The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.
The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security.
The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.
“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership.","The Ontario government is investing $30 million to launch a new round of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, supporting projects aimed at unlocking hydrogen’s potential to drive economic growth, create good-paying jobs and strengthen the province’s position as a world leader in the clean energy economy.

This investment doubles the funding from the previous round and expands eligibility criteria under Energy for Generations, Ontario’s long-term energy roadmap designed to build a resilient, secure and self-reliant energy sector capable of powering the most competitive economy in the G7.

“By expanding the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, our government is making a strategic investment as part of our plan to protect Ontario’s economy and energy independence,” said Sam Oosterhoff, Associate Minister of Energy-Intensive Industries. “Hydrogen technologies are already unlocking new opportunities for private sector investment and creating good-paying jobs, all while enhancing our competitive edge and making Ontario a world leader in the hydrogen sector as we build a more competitive, resilient economy.”

The expanded fund includes two streams: one for projects integrating low-carbon hydrogen into Ontario’s electricity grid, and another supporting broader sector applications of hydrogen across transportation, manufacturing and heavy industry. The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.

The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security. The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.

“Hydrogen has potential as both a clean energy resource and a major economic play that can create tens of thousands of jobs,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Our government’s focus is on delivering affordable energy to families, along with creating good-paying jobs as we build-up Ontario’s low-carbon future.”

Hydrogen technologies are seen as uniquely suited to fill gaps in the energy system that are difficult or costly to address through electrification alone. The province said hydrogen can help manage peak electricity demand, provide long-duration energy storage and reduce emissions in sectors such as steel, cement and refining.

“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership. “The development of the at-scale low-carbon hydrogen economy starts with leveraging innovation to connect hydrogen producers and users, setting the stage for long-term economic growth, job creation, clean energy integration, and low-carbon diversification.”

According to a 2023 study commissioned by Natural Resources Canada, a robust hydrogen economy could create up to 70,000 jobs across Canada by 2050, including in Ontario, in areas such as production, infrastructure, storage and clean technology development, while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Supporting hydrogen innovation helps deliver on the goals of Energy for Generations, Ontario’s first integrated energy plan, which identifies hydrogen as a strategic resource that complements other fuels and technologies to meet growing demand and support industry, heavy transportation and reliable energy generation.",https://sydenhamcurrent.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/cropped-SYDENHAM-CURRENT-LOGO-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-02 06:17:51.824208

Overcoming challenges with renewable energy

Wadi Zar, with a population of 7,000, is a small village accessible by sandy roads and dirt tracks that can pose challenges for vehicular travel. Here, homes made of straw and mud reflect a lifestyle grounded in simplicity, but also in struggle. For years, women like Azara relied on oil-powered lanterns that emitted harmful smoke, endangering the health of users.

""Previously, we used to use battery-powered lamps, which we only used when necessary because we couldn't afford the cost of batteries,"" shares Azara.

The project distributed solar lanterns, which have positively impacted Azara and her family.

""This solar lantern helps us provide light when cooking, helps the children study and play in the evening, and keeps us safe from snakes and scorpions. My husband and I are also able to walk safely, as we are physically disabled.""

Participants are not only learning technical skills but also provided with the knowledge to start their own businesses.

Madleen shares, ""In the production phase, we organized work teams with a unified goal: to create finished products through a complete production line. Every team member had a distinct role, contributing to the final outcome. This product not only helps ease the challenges faced by families but also provides us with the opportunity to learn a valuable new skill.""

A strategic partnership for resilience and sustainability

This project is the result of a strategic partnership between KSRelief and UNDP Yemen, a collaboration formed to address profound humanitarian and developmental challenges facing Yemen. By combining resources, expertise, and a commitment to local capacity building, KSRelief and UNDP are not only meeting critical needs but also driving sustainable change. A cornerstone of this collaboration is the recognition of women’s potential as solar entrepreneurs—empowering them to lead their families and communities toward resilience and self-reliance.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has approved final authorization for the Venture Global CP2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, allowing exports of up to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day to countries without free trade agreements. The decision follows earlier approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and supports a broader federal effort to increase domestic energy production and export capacity.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Assistant Secretary Kyle Haustveit of the Office of Fossil Energy stated the project would provide reliable energy to global partners while supporting job creation and infrastructure development in the U.S.

“In less than ten months, President Trump’s administration is redefining what it means to unleash American energy by approving record new LNG exports,” said Assistant Secretary Haustveit. “Finalizing the non-FTA authorization for CP2 LNG will enable secure and reliable American energy access for our allies and trading partners, while also providing well-paid jobs and economic opportunities at home.”

The authorization is a step in expanding LNG exports since the federal government resumed processing applications for non-free-trade-agreement (FTA) countries. Current U.S. LNG exports average about 15 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting continued growth in the sector.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.","In other words, if the wind is blowing strongly across all turbines, Scotland could generate enough electricity to supply over 70% of Britain’s total onshore wind power needs.

There are now calls to ban further onshore wind farms fearing it is being used to power the UK's green revolution while seeing little reward.

Some critics warn that Scotland’s rapid expansion of wind power for export could be a repeat of the oil experience, when billions of pounds of North Sea oil wealth largely flowed south instead of benefiting local communities.

Government data suggests that the nation produced about a third of the UK's onshore wind power needs last year.

To manage that power surge, Scotland's energy storage capacity is to be ramped up and would become the highest of any of the ten regions of the UK - with 7.5GW out of 27GW across Britain by 2030. According to Renewable UK, the UK has more than 6.8GW of storage with 16% (1.09GW) in Scotland.

The huge batteries are needed because wind power is not constant and they store excess energy when the wind blows, and release it back into the grid when it does not.

But NESO has also indicated more action was needed to expand green power.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Scotland produced a huge share of Britain’s oil, yet much of the economic gain went to companies and the UK Treasury rather than staying in the country.

The loss of control over this “black gold” sparked widespread frustration and became a rallying point for Scottish nationalism. Alba leader and fair energy prices campaigner Kenny MacAskill has accused the UK Government of exploiting Scotland’s natural resources and called for a ban on further onshore wind farms.

""This confirms why Scotland is so vital to the UK economy. It is Scottish renewable energy which is to fuel power and heat it,"" he said.

""It is clear that Scotland is just a resource to be exploited. Our energy taken, no revenues given and few jobs and businesses provided, all whilst our environment is trashed.

""Basically we're supplying the south. The time has come for a moratorium on further onshore wind, other than small scale community owned ones. Enough is enough.""

It comes as a frightening energy debt mountain is gripping the nation, with total unpaid bills set to hit £4.43 billion by the end of June — nearly triple the 2019 figure of £1.55 billion.

The most vulnerable Scots alone are estimated to owe over £400 million, which has prompted calls for government action.

Analysis from regulator Ofgem shows debt has surged by almost £1 billion in the past year alone, leaving households reeling amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.

Under the energy bills price cap set by regulator Ofgem, which limits how much suppliers can charge households per unit of gas and electricity, the average annual bill is £1,755. Despite the cap, this is still over 50% higher than four years ago.

Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland said: ""Energy is an essential requirement and consumers are most concerned about affordability and security of supply to their homes and business.

""It isn’t working in the favour of consumers, mounting debt, more time off supply for those on prepayment meters and 1 in 3 in fuel poverty. It is time to think differently, to at least have an honest debate about the future and how we can reconcile targets for fuel poverty and net zero.""

Meanwhile, the Herald revealed that households have been landed with a £6.6 billion bill to pay energy firms — mostly Scottish wind farms — for switching off because the grid cannot handle all the green power being generated.

The amount of so-called constraint payments reached £1.7 billion in 2024/25, more than four times higher than five years ago, with £1.2 billion (70%) going to Scottish turbines.

NESO has set out the road map for wind power in Scotland in an analysis of the UK Government’s Clean Power 2030 plan which sets targets for how much clean energy should be built across Britain by 2030. And the grid operator has broken down what Scotland, needs to deliver to hit these national goals.

In Scotland, this means a big increase in renewable energy projects, especially battery storage and land-based turbine sites, along with some new solar developments. But they say hitting those goals will require careful planning, stronger electricity networks, investment in local supply chains, and support from communities that will host the projects.

The analysis sees Scotland as a ""significant resource for renewables, but its large pipeline of energy projects are limited in part due to the unique geography and rural grid"". It stated: ""Scotland needs greater investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure to support the development of renewables which can facilitate decarbonisation and new industrial activity. ""It also requires strategic planning of generation, storage and demand...""

It added: ""We are committed to engaging closely and collaboratively with customers and stakeholders across Scotland to understand its unique and varied context.""

It states that their regional energy planning team in Scotland was working with the Scottish Government , local authorities and industry to help ensure Scotland ""responds to local and national ambitions"".

The perception that Scotland was being exploited for its resources helped fuel the rise of the Scottish National Party, which campaigned for greater autonomy and eventually independence.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.

They argue that the country could again become a supplier of energy wealth with limited local benefit, while households and industries south of the border reap the rewards of Scotland’s turbines.

Mr MacAskill, the former SNP justice secretary added: ""We're to be England's giant onshore wind farm but getting nothing in return. The pylons running from the north down the east coast and through the central borders are simply to power England.

""This all confirms that Scotland has received a second great energy bounty. First it was oil and gas and now its renewables. The wealth of Norway has passed us by but the benefit of North Sea oil must still be pursued and used for Scotland's benefit.

""But equally the old adage of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me applies. We must ensure that the wind resource isn't taken from us for a song with our land and people losing out. Lessons must be learned. It cannot be allowed that Scotland is energy rich, yet Scots are fuel poor.

""It's why there should be no more onshore [wind farms] at the moment. Its simply a bonanza for developers with the price paid by consumers and the Scottish environment.""

It comes just three months after a “once in a generation” movement of 53 community councils called for a summit with UK and Scottish energy ministers to pause new energy projects in Scotland’s most scenic areas.

They say they are being overwhelmed by a “barrage” of over 700 renewable energy applications in the Highlands alone, including wind, hydro, storage, and transmission projects, many backed by well-funded overseas developers.

The councils want an inquiry into the cumulative impact on communities and landscapes, warning that unchecked development could override local democracy and accelerate depopulation.

Highland Conservative councillor Helen Crawford, who was a key convention organiser, is now planning to stand in the 2026 Scottish Parliamentary Elections in the deputy first minister Kate Forbes; seat of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch because she felt ""so strongly about the pylon disaster"" and it might provided a ""decent shot at getting the pause"".

The UK Government said that energy firms were pouring billions into Scotland’s green infrastructure, with SSEN Transmission planning up to £31.7bn in upgrades by 2031 and Scottish Power investing £12bn in new transmission networks, supporting thousands of jobs.

Major offshore projects like Cerulean Winds’ £10.9bn Aspen scheme, Berwick Bank, and Green Volt were set to create thousands more roles while the Acorn project in Aberdeen was expected to generate around 15,000 jobs.

A UK Department of for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said: 'Our mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower will unlock economic opportunity for Scotland.

“Our landmark Clean Energy Jobs Plan will deliver up to 40,000 new jobs in Scotland by 2030, creating the next generation of skilled roles.

""Clean energy will bring growth and investment.

But both paths are proving difficult. Without representation, they remain outside key policy discussions, financing frameworks, and subsidy programs that could shape their future.

Startups like Montra Electric, AutoNxt, and ShreeMarut have been developing electric tractors aimed at reducing emissions and fuel costs in agriculture. Yet, as they look to expand production, the absence of a collective industry voice has become a serious handicap.

The lack of association backing also makes financing difficult. Without an institutional framework or recognized body to interface with lenders, startups say banks are hesitant to finance electric tractor purchases.

""Not a single bank has said they will finance an e-tractor,"" said one founder on a condition of anonymity. ""They finance every other electric vehicle, but not tractors yet.""

Experts say that from the perspective of lenders and policymakers, the segment remains too small and untested. ""Financing institutions rely on data and scale,"" said an industry expert. ""A formal association could help generate that data and bridge trust between startups and regulators.""

""Joining the Tractor Manufacturers’ Association (TMA) is essential,"" said one founder. ""Without it, startups have no access to policy discussions or financing networks. But the entry conditions make it nearly impossible.""

The TMA, which represents India’s major tractor manufacturers such as Escorts Kubota, Sonalika, and John Deere, requires companies to have at least ten years of operational history, a source revealed. Most electric tractor firms are only a few years old.

""A startup will die for sure, if not today, then tomorrow,"" said an industry source. ""The TMA’s rule is that a company must be ten years old. The government’s rule is that there should be at least seven companies to form an association.""

TMA did not respond to Autocar Professional’s queries at the time of publishing.

The government allows new industry associations to be formed if at least seven registered members apply together — a requirement that, in a young sector with only a handful of active players, is proving hard to meet.

""Are startups capable of organizing that many events and initiatives? Forming and promoting an association needs money too,"" said another founder.

Industry insiders say the lack of formal representation is one reason electric tractors remain outside subsidy programs. The PM-eDrive scheme, a revised version of FAME, currently supports electric two-wheelers, buses, and ambulances, but not tractors.

""Policy inclusion usually follows when there’s an organized body pushing for it,"" said a source familiar with the matter. ""Right now, e-tractor startups don’t have that collective lobbying power.""

For now, the electric tractor industry remains fragmented with a few innovators trying to establish themselves while struggling for a collective identity.

""The technology is ready, but the ecosystem isn’t,"" said a founder.

A two-headed wind turbine that is nothing like the wind turbines we have seen traditionally. It is a striking sight, but more impressive than that is the 10 megawatts of power it can generate. The two turbines catch the wind above the waves, which has made this turbine yield a high efficiency.

How a floating wind turbine could change the clean energy game

The Dounreay Tri Floating Wind Demonstration is a step in the right direction. Scotland is investing a lot in offshore wind energy projects. This wind turbine is not anchored to the bottom, as is the case with most wind turbines in water. This one floats. Two turbines share a floating platform, which makes the whole setup look kind of like the famed cryptid beast, the Loch Ness Monster, as it floats on the waters, charged with the task of servicing power requirements with clean energy.

Dounreay Tri Ltd is responsible for its construction, and they have been supported in this endeavor in part by the Scottish government, with the added aid of private investors. This idea of a floating wind turbine has always been relished as these are less disruptive to marine life, but the journey in realizing this has been fraught with trial and error. This design is sure to shake things up.

What makes this floating wind turbine particularly special

The aerodynamics involved are where the true genius lies when it comes to this wind turbine. Wake loss is reduced, the effect when one turbine impedes the efficiency of another. These combine well together and create a vortex above the water with very little interference between the two turbines. The two turbines actually help each other out. Together, they create an effect where each one helps the other to spin at an effective rate.

This is a significant time for wind power, and this turbine could help usher in a new era for this kind of clean energy. Scotland is on the front lines of this with their two-headed “Loch Ness monster.”

Wind power in Scotland will never be the same again

Scotland would like to be able to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Perhaps this wind turbine could help. Scotland is windy, and the waters of its seas and lakes are known to be deep. Traditional wind turbines over water just won’t cut it in an environment like that. This two-headed turbine does make the grade. Each turbine is a 10 megawatt Vestas model floating on a platform. The turbine is kept secure by chains and cables.

Experts say this wind turbine could provide clean power for thousands of homes. The project has also helped from an economic standpoint as a lot of jobs have been made available because of it, with Orkney and Caithness being the major beneficiaries at the moment.

When this turbine goes live, real-world data will help shape the way forward

Once this project enters the next phase beyond testing, and real-world data is able to be examined, the design team will be able to further make adjustments and improve on what is already a brilliant idea. The world is watching as well, with companies from Norway, Japan, and America showing interest in the two-headed design. The costs it will save are a major drawcard, all while rendering 15% more power than the single-turret wind turbine.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DounreayTri_Hexicon_large-2017031712272828-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 05:18:53.516078

What's happening?

According to The Guardian, Miliband is considering a proposal that would allow companies to extract more oil and gas from existing sites using a new ""bespoke permitting"" system. The plan would incentivize companies to revisit and drill in older, previously abandoned fields.

Proponents claim this approach would ""speed up the process of evaluation and development"" while protecting jobs tied to the industry.

The oil industry has maintained it could recover more than 7 billion barrels of additional fuel from the North Sea under this system, but climate scientists say that would make it much harder for the U.K. to meet its target to reach net zero by 2050.

Why is continued dirty fuel extraction concerning?

Environmental groups have said this approach could keep the country locked into dirty energy dependency when it should be rapidly scaling up renewables like offshore wind to meet its net-zero target.

""While we remain distracted by ever-diminishing amounts of oil and gas, we are missing the huge opportunities to create good, clean energy jobs in the U.K,"" Tessa Khan, executive director of the climate group Uplift, told The Guardian.

The North Sea has long been a cornerstone of Britain's energy economy, employing about 30,000 people in northeast Scotland.

However, the dirty fuel industry remains the leading driver of global pollution, responsible for the majority of carbon and methane emissions heating our atmosphere. According to the United Nations, it accounts for 68% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions.

From drilling to refining and burning, every stage of oil and gas production contributes to environmental destruction, polluting air and water, harming wildlife, and threatening human health.

Despite this, major oil companies continue to lobby against clean energy policies, delaying the transition to renewables and prolonging dependence on fuels that destabilize our planet.

What's being done about dirty fuel dependency?

The International Energy Agency has stated that no new oil and gas developments can be approved if the world is to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Continuing to extract from aging fields, critics say, would release more carbon and methane into the atmosphere while delaying investments in the renewable energy transition.

The U.K. government insists it can balance both goals, but environmentalists warn that this loophole-permitting strategy could extend dirty fuel dependence for decades when the planet can least afford it.

Having conversations about these issues and voting for pro-climate candidates are critical steps that can help protect people and the environment.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/North-Sea-drillingimage-recRRLFv1Jb00lXO5-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 03:18:39.761091

The Inflation Reduction Act didn’t just expand renewable energy—it created one of the most powerful financial incentives in modern U.S. history for companies producing, processing, or supporting clean energy technologies.

At Icarus Fund, we’ve worked with renewable developers and manufacturers that turned complex tax law into cash flow—literally. One client converted an abandoned coal plant into a battery recycling hub, unlocking over $30 million in 48C credits and attracting new investors overnight. That’s the level of opportunity sitting on the table right now if you know how to qualify.

Let’s break it down: what the 48C Credit is, who qualifies, and how your company can use it to supercharge your next project.

The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit eligibility framework was built to accelerate the United States’ clean energy transition by funding domestic manufacturing, retrofits, and emission-reduction projects.

Originally launched under the 2009 Recovery Act, the 48C Credit was reborn under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—and this time, it’s bigger, bolder, and far more accessible.

Here’s what makes it special:

It’s an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) that can cover up to 30% of eligible project costs.

It applies to both new facilities and retrofitted plants focused on clean energy production or carbon reduction.

The Department of Energy (DOE) and the IRS jointly manage allocations—so compliance matters at every stage.

Put simply, 48C isn’t just a rebate—it’s a capital strategy.

Not all zip codes are created equal.

The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit eligibility rules prioritize projects built in “energy communities”—areas hit hardest by the fossil fuel phaseout.

These locations get an extra 10% bonus, meaning a potential 40% total credit if you meet labor standards.

Here’s the kicker:

Energy communities include former coal towns, refinery hubs, and industrial zones.

Building in these areas also gives you a competitive edge during the DOE review.

One of our clients strategically built a recycling plant in Appalachia—a qualified energy community—and secured an additional $8 million in tax incentives just from location-based bonuses.

The 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit eligibility framework is one of the smartest financial tools available to renewable developers and manufacturers in 2025. But success depends on preparation—knowing the rules, meeting compliance standards, and structuring financing that maximizes every dollar of benefit.

Policymakers and private enterprises around the world are adopting an all-of-the-above approach to energy sourcing – clean energy pledges be damned – in order to shore up energy security in an era of unprecedented flux. Governments around the world are greenlighting new projects to boost energy production as fast as they can in an attempt to stay one step ahead of looming energy shortages, while tech moguls bet big on proven as well as unproven energy technologies. But while the AI boom is boosting investments for energy sources from geothermal to nuclear fusion, the world’s biggest energy source is missing out on the influx of cash that seems to be flowing into every other sector.

Or rather, the amount of AI-inspired dollars flowing into Big Oil’s coffers simply isn’t enough to offset the considerable headwinds faced by the sector today. Despite a rabidly supportive policy environment in the United States and ever-increasing sanctions on Russia, The Economist reports that “times are surprisingly tough for the industry.” Even with ballooning energy demand projections, oil demand has remained soft, and global oil producers are steadily building up a serious oil glut with no signs of relief.

Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency raised its estimate for next year's oil glut, predicting a record oversupply for 2026. According to the agency’s official estimates, global oil supply will exceed demand by nearly 4 million barrels a day, potentially breaking the record for the biggest supply glut in history in annual terms.

Oil companies have been underperforming since before this increased projection hit the markets. “Since the start of last year the S&P 500 index of large American companies has produced a total return, including dividends, of 46%,” reports The Economist. “By contrast, American pedlars [sic] of oil and gas, including giants such as Chevron and Exxon, have returned just 14%.”

Meanwhile, seemingly every other energy sector is going gangbusters. Money is pouring into nuclear energy startups at such a rapid clip that there are rumblings of a bubble. Last year, private equity and venture capital investments in advanced nuclear companies hit an all-time high, “surpass[ing] the total deal value of the past 15 years combined” according to S&P Global.

Even nuclear fusion, which does not yet exist in any commercially viable form, is receiving a windfall of research and development dollars, riding on the back of the AI boom. Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI – the firm behind ChatGPT – and arguably the number one poster child of the AI sector, is also one of the world’s biggest proponents of and investors in nuclear fusion technology. He has personally poured hundreds of millions of dollars into nuclear fusion startups and headed one of the world’s buzziest potential fusion unicorns, Oklo. in part thanks to his high-profile confidence in the technology’s singular ability to meet AI’s future energy needs, a report by E.U. firm Fusion for Energy finds that the sector’s total funding has skyrocketed from US $1.7 billion in 2020 to US $15 billion as of September 2025.

At the same time, the geothermal energy market is emerging from niche status into mainstream energy investment portfolios. In 2023, the global market for geothermal energy was valued at USD 7.4 billion. It’s projected to reach a whopping USD 12.51 billion by 2032. The investment dollars are piling up as Big Tech gets bullish on the baseload clean energy. Meta and Alphabet (the companies behind Facebook and Google) are listed among the growing number of Silicon Valley firms partnering with geothermal startups. Earlier this year, Cindy Taff, chief executive of geothermal company Sage Geosystems, told The Hill that “It’s going to be the decade of geothermal.”

But while even the most fringe and emergent forms of energy are soaring to new heights from the AI boom, Big Oil is struggling to benefit from the windfall. Even as Wood Mackenzie pushes back peak oil projections to 2032, supermajors are resorting to layoffs and handing out dividends instead of reinvesting in expansion in what The Economist calls “a sure sign that Western oilmen are feeling downcast about their industry’s growth prospects.”

Critical minerals strategy represents far more than simple resource procurement in today's interconnected world. These comprehensive governmental frameworks address fundamental vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional economic considerations into realms of national security and technological sovereignty. Understanding the critical minerals energy transition becomes essential as nations grapple with supply chain dependencies.

Modern critical minerals strategy encompasses several interconnected components working in unison. Supply chain mapping reveals dependency patterns that can expose national vulnerabilities during geopolitical tensions. Domestic production capacity development creates buffer zones against foreign manipulation, while international partnership frameworks diversify risk across allied nations. Strategic reserve management provides emergency stockpiles during supply disruptions, and technology innovation support drives long-term solutions to current dependencies.

The urgency driving these strategies becomes clear when examining current realities. Analysis shows that even with optimal investment scenarios totaling $50-75 billion and flawless execution across allied nations, Western countries may only achieve 50% rare earth independence by 2035-2040. This projection illustrates the magnitude of current vulnerabilities and the extended timelines required for meaningful supply chain restructuring.

Environmental and social governance standards increasingly shape critical minerals strategy implementation. Modern approaches must balance security imperatives with sustainability requirements, creating frameworks that ensure responsible extraction and processing while maintaining strategic objectives.

What Makes Minerals ""Critical"" to National Security?

Critical mineral designation stems from a precise intersection of economic importance and supply vulnerability. These materials achieve critical status through their essential roles in defense applications, clean energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing processes, combined with concentrated geographic production that creates strategic dependencies.

The classification process considers multiple risk factors simultaneously. Essential defense applications include weapons guidance systems, advanced armor materials, and sophisticated communications equipment. Clean energy infrastructure dependencies encompass battery storage systems, wind turbine components, and solar panel manufacturing. Limited geographic concentration creates chokepoints where single nations control large portions of global supply chains.

Current data reveals the extent of these vulnerabilities. China maintains control over 85-90% of refined rare earth oxides and magnet production globally, creating a strategic dependency that extends far beyond simple commodity trading into the realm of economic statecraft.

Critical Mineral Categories by Strategic Application:

Technology Sector Key Minerals Strategic Importance Defense Systems Rare Earth Elements, Titanium Weapons guidance, advanced armor Clean Energy Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel Battery storage, wind turbines Electronics Germanium, Indium, Gallium Semiconductors, display technology Infrastructure Copper, Aluminum, Steel Alloys Power transmission, construction

Substitution difficulty represents another crucial factor in critical mineral designation. Materials earning critical status typically lack readily available alternatives, meaning supply disruptions cannot be easily resolved through material substitution. This characteristic amplifies the strategic importance of maintaining reliable supply chains.

Economic impact assessment examines potential GDP-level consequences of supply disruptions across various sectors. Critical minerals often serve as inputs for multiple downstream industries, creating cascading effects when supply chains face disruption.

How Do Geopolitical Tensions Shape Critical Minerals Strategy?

Geopolitical competition fundamentally alters how nations approach critical minerals, transforming traditional commodity relationships into strategic considerations. Current global dynamics reveal sharp contrasts in national approaches, with significant implications for long-term supply security.

China's approach demonstrates vertically integrated, systematically subsidised operations that function as instruments of statecraft rather than purely commercial endeavours. This model enables rapid policy implementation across entire supply chains, creating competitive advantages that extend beyond simple cost considerations. A single policy decree from Beijing can significantly impact global supply chains or influence market pricing through strategic interventions.

Western approaches face structural challenges in responding to this coordinated strategy. Fragmented decision-making processes, regulatory complexities, and market-driven priorities often conflict with long-term strategic planning requirements. Environmental permitting challenges and community engagement requirements, while important for sustainable development, extend project timelines significantly compared to competitor nations.

Long development timelines for mining projects in Western nations create additional vulnerabilities. New mining operations typically require 10-15 years from initial exploration through production, creating extended windows where supply chain dependencies persist. This timeline disparity becomes particularly problematic when competitor nations can rapidly adjust production capacity through centralised planning mechanisms.

Supply chain vulnerability analysis reveals concerning concentration patterns. Limited refining and processing capacity outside Asia creates bottlenecks even when raw materials are available from diverse sources. Western nations may control mining operations while remaining dependent on Asian processing facilities for finished materials.

""Strategic Reality Check: Even with massive investment and perfect execution, Western nations face 10-15 years to achieve partial supply chain independence, highlighting the structural nature of current dependencies.""

Regional permitting and regulatory frameworks create additional competitive disadvantages. Where some nations measure project approval timelines in months, Western regulatory processes often extend across multiple years, creating predictable delays that competitors can exploit through strategic market timing.

Building Domestic Critical Minerals Capabilities

Successful domestic capability development requires coordinated investment across multiple interconnected stages of the supply chain. Each component must scale appropriately to avoid creating new bottlenecks that simply shift vulnerabilities rather than eliminating them. Furthermore, implementing AI in mining operations can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Mining and Extraction Infrastructure

Modern mining capability development extends far beyond traditional extraction operations. Geological survey expansion provides detailed resource mapping that guides long-term investment decisions. Comprehensive permitting process reforms can significantly reduce project timelines while maintaining environmental standards. Environmental impact mitigation technologies enable responsible extraction that meets both production and sustainability objectives.

Community engagement protocols ensure local stakeholder support throughout project lifecycles. Successful mining operations increasingly depend on collaborative relationships with local communities, creating shared value that extends beyond immediate economic benefits.

However, some operations face significant challenges, particularly regarding deep-sea mining concerns which highlight the complex environmental considerations in modern extraction strategies.

Processing and Refining Capacity

Midstream processing represents the most critical bottleneck in many supply chains. Refining facilities require substantial capital investment and specialised technical expertise that takes years to develop. The warning against overbuilding extraction capacity while underbuilding processing capabilities highlights a fundamental strategic principle: supply chain strength depends on the weakest link, not the strongest.

Technology transfer initiatives can accelerate capability development by leveraging existing expertise from allied nations. However, such transfers require careful management to ensure genuine capability building rather than continued dependency relationships. For instance, establishing an European CRM facility demonstrates regional approaches to processing independence.

Skilled workforce training programmes must anticipate long-term industry needs while providing immediate employment opportunities. Vocational certainty across the value chain creates stable career pathways that attract talent to critical sectors.

Manufacturing Integration

End-product manufacturing capabilities complete the domestic supply chain by eliminating dependencies on foreign final assembly. This integration prevents situations where domestic raw material production simply feeds foreign manufacturing capacity.

Quality control systems ensure domestic production meets international standards while maintaining cost competitiveness. Supply chain integration connects domestic extraction, processing, and manufacturing into coherent systems that maximise value retention within national borders.

Investment Requirements for Domestic Capability Building:

Capability Area Investment Range Timeline Key Challenges Mining Infrastructure $20-50 billion globally 5-10 years Permitting, environmental compliance Processing Facilities $30-75 billion globally 3-7 years Technology transfer, skilled workforce R&D Programmes $5-15 billion globally 3-5 years Technical breakthroughs, scaling Workforce Development $2-5 billion globally 2-4 years Training programmes, talent retention

International Cooperation in Critical Minerals Strategy

No single nation possesses sufficient critical mineral resources to achieve complete independence, making international cooperation essential for supply security. Strategic partnerships enable resource sharing while distributing development costs and risks across multiple participants.

Effective partnership models balance resource access with technology sharing. Resource-rich nations provide raw materials while technology-advanced nations contribute processing expertise and manufacturing capabilities. These arrangements create mutual dependencies that strengthen rather than weaken participant nations.

Synchronised Global Alliance structures represent the most comprehensive approach to international cooperation. Such alliances coordinate production capacity, share strategic reserves, and standardise quality specifications across member nations. The emphasis on tight orchestration and synchronisation reflects lessons learned from fragmented approaches that create gaps competitors can exploit.

Bilateral mining agreements provide focused relationships between specific nations with complementary capabilities. These agreements often include long-term supply commitments, technology sharing provisions, and joint investment structures that spread financial risks. Australia's approach follows the Critical Minerals Strategy 2023-2030, which outlines comprehensive frameworks for international partnerships.

Multilateral supply chain initiatives create broader frameworks for cooperation among groups of allied nations. These initiatives can establish common standards, coordinate research programmes, and provide collective responses to supply disruptions.

Joint strategic reserve systems enable participating nations to share stockpile costs while maintaining access during emergencies. Such systems require careful governance structures to ensure equitable access while preventing free-rider problems.

What Role Do Strategic Reserves Play in Supply Security?

Strategic reserves function as insurance policies against supply disruptions while providing market stabilisation mechanisms during volatile periods. Modern reserve strategies extend beyond simple stockpiling to include dynamic management approaches that respond to changing market conditions.

Reserve composition must balance immediate availability with long-term storage considerations. Physical stockpiles of refined materials provide rapid response capability during supply crises, while long-term supply contracts offer price stability and guaranteed access over extended periods.

Price floor mechanisms, such as those implemented by defence agencies for specific materials, create market stability that encourages private investment in domestic production capacity. These interventions signal government commitment to maintaining viable domestic industries even during periods of foreign price manipulation.

Emergency production capacity represents another component of strategic reserves. Maintaining ability to rapidly increase production during crises requires keeping facilities operational even when not economically optimal under normal market conditions.

Strategic Reserve Approaches by Region:

Region Reserve Focus Key Features Management Approach United States National Defense Stockpile Military-focused materials Government-managed Japan Comprehensive stockpiling Private-public partnerships Industry collaboration South Korea Technology metals Advanced materials focus Strategic coordination European Union Critical Raw Materials Circular economy integration Distributed management

Recycling and recovery systems increasingly integrate with strategic reserves to create circular material flows. Advanced recycling technologies can potentially supply 20-30% of critical mineral demand by 2030, significantly reducing primary extraction requirements and strategic stockpile pressures.

Technology Innovation in Critical Minerals Strategy

Technology innovation drives both increasing demand for critical minerals and potential solutions to supply challenges. Innovation strategies must simultaneously address efficiency improvements, alternative material development, and new extraction methodologies. Consequently, exploring asteroid mining advances presents long-term opportunities for supply diversification.

Extraction efficiency improvements can significantly increase recoverable resources from existing deposits. Advanced processing techniques often enable economic extraction of previously sub-economic ore bodies, effectively expanding available supply without discovering new deposits.

Alternative material development represents the most transformative potential solution to critical mineral dependencies. Successful substitutes can eliminate strategic vulnerabilities entirely, though development timelines often extend 10-15 years from laboratory breakthrough to commercial viability.

Processing automation reduces both operational costs and skilled labour requirements, addressing two significant barriers to domestic production development. Automated facilities can maintain consistent quality while reducing exposure to supply chain disruptions in specialised technical expertise.

Supply chain digitisation enables real-time monitoring and optimisation of material flows from extraction through final manufacturing. Digital systems can identify bottlenecks, predict maintenance requirements, and optimise inventory management across complex supply networks.

""Innovation Opportunity: Advanced recycling technologies represent immediate potential for supply chain independence, with implementations possible within 3-5 years compared to 10-15 years for new mining operations.""

Research and development investment requirements typically range from 2-5% of sector revenue to drive meaningful innovation. Government support often proves essential for basic research that private companies cannot justify economically despite strategic importance.

Economic Implications of Critical Minerals Strategy

Critical minerals strategy implementation creates substantial economic opportunities alongside security benefits. Nations investing comprehensively in domestic capabilities position themselves advantageously in emerging technology markets while reducing strategic vulnerabilities.

Job creation spans entire value chains, from geological exploration through final product manufacturing. These positions often provide above-average wages while creating economic opportunities in regions that can benefit from industrial development.

Export revenue generation becomes possible as domestic capacity exceeds national requirements. Nations successfully developing critical minerals capabilities can transition from import dependency to export capability, fundamentally altering trade relationships.

Technology sector competitiveness depends increasingly on reliable access to critical materials. Domestic supply chains provide cost predictability and delivery reliability that enhance broader industrial competitiveness. The International Energy Agency's analysis confirms these economic benefits across developed nations.

Industrial base strengthening occurs as critical minerals capabilities support broader manufacturing ecosystems. Processing facilities often enable related industries to develop, creating industrial clusters that generate additional economic benefits.

Economic Impact Assessment:

Economic Factor Immediate Benefits Long-term Benefits Risk Considerations Employment Construction jobs Permanent operations Skill requirements Trade Balance Import reduction Export potential Market volatility Regional Development Infrastructure investment Industrial clustering Environmental impact Innovation R&D investment Technology leadership Competition risks

Investment requirements, while substantial, generate returns through multiple channels. Direct economic benefits include employment, tax revenue, and export income. Indirect benefits encompass supply chain security, industrial competitiveness, and strategic autonomy.

Measuring Success in Critical Minerals Strategy Implementation

Effective strategy implementation requires comprehensive measurement systems that track progress across multiple dimensions simultaneously. Success indicators must balance quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments of strategic objective achievement.

Supply chain diversification ratios measure progress in reducing dependency on single-source suppliers. Target ranges typically aim for less than 70% import dependency for critical materials, though optimal ratios vary based on specific mineral characteristics and strategic importance.

Domestic production capacity growth tracks development of extraction, processing, and manufacturing capabilities within national borders. Meaningful capacity development often requires 5-10 years, making intermediate milestone tracking essential for strategy management.

Strategic reserve adequacy levels assess whether stockpiles can support national requirements during various disruption scenarios. Reserve calculations must consider consumption rates, critical application priorities, and expected disruption durations.

Critical Minerals Strategy Success Metrics:

Metric Category Key Indicators Target Ranges Measurement Frequency Supply Security Import dependency ratio <70% for critical materials Annual assessment Economic Impact Value-added processing >40% domestic processing Quarterly tracking Innovation R&D investment ratio 2-5% of sector revenue Annual evaluation Sustainability Environmental compliance 100% regulatory adherence Continuous monitoring

Technology innovation metrics evaluate research and development effectiveness, patent development, and successful technology transfer rates. Innovation success often requires 3-5 year measurement cycles to capture development timelines accurately.

International partnership effectiveness measures collaborative success through shared capacity development, reserve coordination, and crisis response capability. Partnership metrics require careful design to capture mutual benefit achievement rather than simple transaction volumes.

Future Challenges and Opportunities in Critical Minerals Strategy

The critical minerals landscape continues evolving rapidly, driven by accelerating technological change, ambitious climate policies, and shifting geopolitical relationships. Future strategies must anticipate emerging challenges while positioning to capitalise on new opportunities.

Increasing demand from clean energy transition creates both challenges and opportunities for critical minerals strategy. Battery storage requirements alone could increase lithium demand 10-20 times current levels by 2040, while wind turbine expansion drives rare earth element consumption growth.

Resource quality degradation represents a long-term challenge as highest-grade deposits face depletion. Future extraction operations may require processing lower-grade ores, increasing costs and environmental impacts while reducing economic viability of marginal operations.

Climate change impacts on mining operations create additional complexity for long-term planning. Water availability changes, extreme weather events, and temperature increases affect both extraction operations and processing facility performance.

Emerging Strategic Opportunities:

Deep-sea mining potential: Ocean floor deposits could provide access to critical minerals without traditional land-based environmental constraints

Space resource utilisation: Asteroid mining represents long-term potential for abundant critical mineral supplies, though technological and economic barriers remain substantial

Biotechnology applications: Biological extraction and processing methods could reduce environmental impacts while improving efficiency

Artificial intelligence optimisation: Machine learning systems can optimise extraction, processing, and supply chain management across complex operations

Evolving geopolitical relationships require flexible strategy frameworks that can adapt to changing alliance structures and competitive dynamics. Fixed strategies risk becoming obsolete as international relationships shift over 10-20 year implementation timelines.

Implementing Effective Critical Minerals Strategy

Successful implementation requires coordinated action across government agencies, private industry, and academic institutions. Clear governance structures, adequate funding mechanisms, and sustained stakeholder alignment prove essential for achieving long-term strategic objectives.

Leadership structure establishment represents the foundation for effective implementation. A dedicated critical minerals authority with cross-agency coordination power and substantial budget allocation provides the institutional capability necessary for comprehensive strategy execution. Historical precedents from major national initiatives demonstrate the importance of centralised coordination with clear accountability structures.

Funding mechanisms must balance public investment with private sector participation. Public-private partnerships can leverage government strategic priorities with private sector efficiency and innovation capability. Strategic investment often requires patient capital that accepts longer return timelines in exchange for strategic benefits.

Regulatory reform enables rapid capability development while maintaining necessary environmental and safety standards. Industrial corridors with streamlined permitting processes can reduce project timelines from decades to months, creating competitive advantages for domestic operations.

Implementation Framework Components:

Centralised Authority: Critical minerals czar with cross-agency coordination power

Financial Structure: Public-private partnerships with patient capital availability

Regulatory Environment: Streamlined permitting for strategic projects

Stakeholder Coordination: Industry-government collaboration mechanisms

Performance Management: Regular strategy assessment and adaptive adjustment

Stakeholder engagement ensures alignment between government objectives, industry capabilities, and community interests. Successful implementation requires ongoing dialogue and coordination among all participants throughout extended development timelines.

Performance monitoring enables adaptive strategy management as conditions change over 10-20 year implementation periods. Regular assessment and strategy adjustment capabilities ensure continued relevance as technological, economic, and geopolitical factors evolve.

""Implementation Success Factor: Countries achieving the greatest progress in critical minerals strategy typically establish dedicated coordination authorities with substantial budgets and clear accountability for measurable outcomes across multi-year timelines.""

The magnitude of current supply chain dependencies and the extended timelines required for meaningful independence highlight the urgency of comprehensive critical minerals strategy implementation. Nations that successfully balance security imperatives with economic opportunities while maintaining environmental and social responsibility will position themselves advantageously for the technological and geopolitical challenges of the coming decades.

The deals, announced this week, bring Meta’s total solar power purchases in 2025 to more than 3 gigawatts — a significant milestone that underscores how tech giants are increasingly turning to renewables to power their expanding fleets of data centers.

Solar energy has become a favorite among major technology firms for its relatively low cost, scalability, and rapid construction timelines. Meta’s latest investments are spread across Louisiana and Texas, with completion expected over the next two years.

The company unveiled two agreements in Louisiana on Thursday that involve purchasing the environmental attributes of 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are slated to be operational by 2027. Earlier in the week, Meta announced an even larger deal — a 600-megawatt purchase from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas, also set to begin commercial operations in 2027.

While the Texas solar project won’t directly power Meta’s data centers, it will feed electricity into the regional grid to offset the company’s overall consumption. The Louisiana projects, however, center around environmental attribute certificates (EACs), which allow Meta to balance out emissions from carbon-intensive sources.

EACs, also known as renewable energy certificates, have faced scrutiny from environmental analysts who argue that they can mask the true carbon footprint of companies whose actual operations continue to rely heavily on traditional power sources.

Still, Meta’s latest renewable investments highlight the growing urgency within the tech sector to secure clean energy as AI-driven data processing dramatically increases electricity demand. With competitors such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google also expanding their renewable portfolios, the race to power AI sustainably has become one of the defining challenges of the industry’s next phase.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/468396449.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 03:18:46.136561

It turns out that this is indeed the case: after two years of use, EVs start reducing their total carbon footprint compared to gas cars.

That's from scientists at Duke University, who carried out research supported by the Albemarle Corporation – a North Carolina-based chemical manufacturing firm involved in the battery value chain for automakers. The peer-reviewed study has been published this week in the journal PLOS Climate.

Okay, so now we know where the findings are coming from. Let's look at what else the researchers observed. Their study confirms that building an EV starts off with about 30% higher CO2 emissions than a regular internal combustion engine (ICE) car. That can be attributed to largely to mining the lithium for the EV's battery, and manufacturing said battery.

But once you get this EV on the road, it begins to make up for its emissions pretty quickly, and wipes the slate clean after two years when compared to a gas car covering the same distance.

To arrive at this, the researchers used the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) – which helps examine how the world's energy, economy, and climate systems interact over long time periods – to evaluate air pollutant emissions across four scenarios of increasing EV adoption in the US through the year 2050. They looked at emissions from fuel production, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly, and operation for both electric and gas-powered cars.

Besides the reduction in CO2 emissions after the initial two years, as battery output increases over time, each additional kWh of an electric car's lithium-ion battery output is projected to lead to a reduction of about 485 lb (220 kg) of CO2 in 2030, and 280 lb (127 kg) of CO2 by the time 2050 rolls around.

The reseacrhers also looked at the overall effects of both air pollution and climate change for both types of cars. They found the economic value of the damages attributable to gas-powered cars over their estimated lifetime of 18 years, amounted to 2 to 3.5 times that of EVs. That includes things like the social cost of healthcare for humans who suffer from conditions brought on by polluted air.

It's worth noting that these findings are derived from computer modeling and scenario simulation. The study also didn't account for a number of categories of emissions, including those associated with disposing or recycling components from both types of vehicles, and those that would be generated in the processing of setting up charging infrastructure for EVs.

Still, this does help inform the discourse around just how green EVs can be, and how we think about the benefits of moving away from gas-powered vehicles as technologies, infrastructure, and public policies in countries around the world continue to evolve.",https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/104388c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2F06%2F64a819f54dbeb63ec3bbc6ebee64%2Fafter-just-two-years-on-the-road-evs-actually-start-reducing-their-total-carbon-footprint-compared-to-gas-cars.jpg&na.image_optimisation=0,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:10.906187

The state purchased the building and its associated property for nearly $2 million last year, following a recommendation from the State Office Task Force, Rep. Lloyd Larsen, R-Lander, explained at the beginning of Tuesday’s meeting.

At the time, he noted, the state was already leasing space in the building for the Department of Health, the Department of Family Services, the driver’s license division of the Wyoming Department of Transportation, and the Department of Agriculture.

“The task force … recommended that the building be refurbished to accommodate additional agencies and to contract with the design firm to do a Level II and Level III study to determine what level of renovation would be required and how best to add the Department of Workforce Services, the Veterans Affairs and the Department of Revenue into the building,” Larsen said.

Level II

The Level II design, created in coordination with the state agencies that will occupy the building, aims to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, Prospect Studio Principal Danny Wicke said – though “some pieces and parts” will have to be demolished.

For example, he said, the lower-level locker rooms, fitness facility, and sauna “really aren’t applicable to the new use of the building” and will be removed – as will the existing staircase leading to the first-floor entryway, which doesn’t meet current code requirements.

“It’s an open stair,” Wicke explained. “It’s not enclosed. And the current stair configuration does not meet the requirements of life safety.”

In order to make space for the updated staircase, Wicke said the design team proposed adding a “front porch” style element to the front of the building, which will provide a more “gracious entry” and also allow room for the current elevator shaft to be expanded and repositioned to accommodate a “new, modern elevator.”

Wicke said the layout for the first floor was also revised to meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, accommodate other life safety elements, and meet the needs of the state agencies that will reside there: the Department of Workforce Services, the WYDOT, and the Department of Revenue.

Larsen pointed out that the Department of Workforce Services currently occupies two offices locally, creating a “bifurcation of the agency.”

“This (new plan) brings the whole agency into this level of the building,” he said.

He also noted that the local Department of Revenue office is currently in an “isolated” location that is “a little concerning.”

“We’re glad that we’re able to bring them into this consolidation,” he said.

Second floor

Similar revisions will be needed on the upper floor of the building, which was originally designed to meet the needs of U.S. Energy’s “C-suite executives,” Wicke said.

“Most of the offices were pushed around the perimeter of the building, and then there’s quite a lot of open space in the middle,” he said.

“The offices were for more executive-level people, and they’re quite large,” Wicke said. “So one of the purposes of revisiting this upper floor was to try to also economize this (space).”

One of the proposed strategies for making the upper level more “efficient” is to install a dropped ceiling, which will leave space below the original vaulted ceiling for mechanical equipment and accommodate the removal of the skylights that are currently in place on the roof, Wicke said.

“Those skylights are (a) leaking point and don’t really make a lot of sense if we’re going to have a ceiling in,” he explained. “So, we propose removing those and … getting this to a roof that’s pretty simple.”

The second floor’s vaulted ceilings will remain in place over the lobby area, he noted.

“From an architectural standpoint, that is one expression we’re trying to maintain in the building, because it’s there, (and) it’s beautiful,” he said.

The upper floor will house the Department of Family Services, the Department of Health, the Wyoming Military Department, and the Department of Agriculture, Wicke said, and the basement floor includes storage space for the agencies that need it.

The basement will also house the boiler, which needs to be upgraded along with the building’s electrical and mechanical systems, Wicke said.

Parking

Wicke shared several proposed changes for the areas surrounding the U.S. Energy building this week, too.

For example, he said the current parking area could be shifted east and expanded to provide more than 100 parking spaces that members of the public can access from West Sunset Drive.

The move would allow the “circuitous and tight ramp” that currently leads from the parking lot to the entryway to be redesigned to “reduce the amount of elevation” people experience as they approach the building, Wicke said.

Meanwhile, he said state employees could use a smaller, secure parking lot located on the southwest side of the property, accessible from North Eighth Street West.

“(That’s) also the access route to get down to the garage,” Wicke said. “So you would go through a state-controlled parking area in order to access the lower garage. We think that provides more security.”

Following completion of the Level II designs, state officials said they will proceed to Level III of the U.S. Energy project, focusing on additional agency coordination and development of construction documents.

“(We) look forward to seeing what will take place,” Larsen said.

The task force concluded this week’s meeting by approving a bill draft that would dissolve their committee next spring – two years earlier than originally planned.

“We’ve done all that we needed to do,” Larsen said. “Our assigned tasks have been completed. The remaining work falls under the jurisdiction of the State Construction Department and the Department of (Administration and Information).”","https://cdn.county10.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/usenergyaerial.jpg",N,,2025-11-02 00:17:50.669363

The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.","A closely-watched and long-debated piece of energy legislation is set to become law after passing through both legislative chambers with the governor’s endorsement.

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, a Rockford Democrat, said Thursday. “If we do nothing … the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

Senate Bill 25 — which supporters call the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — is the largest change to Illinois’ energy policy in at least four years. Among its core policies:

Battery storage. The core of the bill is a new incentive structure for energy storage projects. The incentives are broadly similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power. They will result in new charges to ratepayers, although proponents say that savings from more storage on the grid will offset costs.

Energy efficiency. The bill adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at natural gas and electric utilities. These are aimed at reducing energy demand and proponents of the measure say they will lower prices for consumers.

Nuclear power. The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.

New authority for regulators. The Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, would gain new authority for “integrated resource planning,” a way of setting long-term plans to control both supply-side issues, like plans for electric generation, as well as managing demand.

Labor protections. New requirements for community solar projects would close a loophole that some developers were using to avoid hiring union labor. This was a major priority for organized labor groups during negotiations.

Data centers air regulations. The bill places new requirements on the backup generators used by data centers, which require always-on power to operate.

Virtual power plants and time-of-use. The bill requires large utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs and time-of-use rate plans. This allows utilities to use small-scale residential solar and battery projects to deliver energy throughout the day.

Geothermal energy. The bill outlines a program to fund geothermal heating, a technology which uses naturally occurring heat from underground to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel-based heating.

Thermal energy networks. A new state-backed loan program would fund thermal energy network projects. These use water-filled pipes to transfer heat between energy-intensive buildings, wastewater systems and bodies of water. They can also use geothermal energy to manage heat.

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shock waves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, a Chicago Democrat, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Democratic Senators Michael Hastings, of Frankfort, and Patrick Joyce, of Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, a Morris Republican, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy-making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a longtime advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=5d8603b0-56dd-5ac7-9338-de2aea9ec21a&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:20.699041

The massive 1,500-page package was introduced to parliament on Thursday, after months of meetings between Environment Minister Murray Watt and stakeholders to rewrite reforms that failed to win support last term.

From the beginning, Senator Watt has said that nobody would get everything they wanted — including himself, suggesting that the federal government would be open to amendments in order to see the laws passed.

Speaking on ABC Insiders, Senator Watt said he was ""very confident"" the bill could be passed with the support of either the Coalition or Greens.

""What we're seeking to do here … is achieve a balanced package of reforms,"" he said.

Senator Watt said while the government was not prepared to fully dump the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the government had not made a ""final decision"" on its shape, including whether its CEO could be sacked by a minister — one of the Coalition's asks.

The minister said there was also ""room to move"" to end native forestry's exclusion from the Act, a key demand of the Greens.

This morning, Shadow Environment Minister Angie Bell told Sky News if the legislation remained as it was ""we can't agree to it"".

""We have some grave concerns about the EPBC reforms the government is putting forward,"" Ms Bell said.

""No stakeholders are happy, we're worried about jobs, we're worried about investment and we're certainly worried about productivity.""

Alongside the EPA's leadership, Ms Bell has expressed concerns about definitions requiring a ""net gain"" when remediating environmental damage from a project, changes to an ""unacceptable impact"" clause that could be used to block projects and the removal of emissions reporting requirements.

Ms Bell did not rule out the possibility of a deal being struck this year.

But with an inquiry on the proposed laws set to run until early next year, Ms Bell suggested she would not hurry negotiations.

""He's ramming it through the parliament, at the beginning of the term he was saying he was going to take 12 to 18 months … now suddenly there is a dash to the finish line,"" Ms Bell said.

""Why is he running it through? Because it's got so many holes in it.""

Ministerial power could be used to fast-track critical minerals projects

The environment minister also indicated that intervention powers in the bill could be used to force approvals of critical mineral mining projects.

The government struck an agreement with United States President Donald Trump last month to step up investment in critical minerals, as western nations seek to break dependency on China for those commodities.

That agreement included a stipulation that both nations would take measures ""to accelerate, streamline, or deregulate permitting timelines and processes, including for permits for critical minerals and rare earths mining, separation, and processing"".

The proposed power would allow a minister to override environmental decisions if there was a ""defence or national security"" need, though the bill does not explicitly limit the power's use outside of that.

Senator Watt said critical mineral projects could theoretically be approved under that intervention power.

""That will be obviously up to the minister of the day, and it will require a full environmental assessment for that particular project,"" he said.

""But, yes, under the legislation, if the minister of the day decided that particular project was in the national interest, and a full environmental assessment had occurred to minimise those environmental impacts, if it was still in the national interest to proceed, then the minister would have the ability to approve that.""

The minister also would not rule out that the power could be used to approve a gas project, walking back language on how the power could be used.

Senator Watt told the ABC last week he ""cannot see that happening"" based on how the bill was drafted.

This morning, he said a similar power already existing had been used 27 times in two decades, 17 of which had been in response to natural disasters and recovering near-extinct species.

""So they're the kind of things it's typically used for and I think there are pretty good guide,"" he said.

Senator Watt said he was open to hearing what could be ""tweaked"" in order to see the laws passed.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/11896cd3a4c454ddad2afbdfbbc49f82?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1458&cropW=2592&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:18.539528

Norwegian company Vianode, a global leader in sustainable battery materials, has announced plans to build its first North American facility at Yarmouth Yards in St. Thomas — a multi-billion-dollar investment that marks a major step forward for Canada’s clean energy and critical minerals strategy.

The facility will produce low-emission synthetic graphite, a key component in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, grid storage, and defence applications. Vianode’s products will also support nearby manufacturers, including the Volkswagen-backed PowerCo SE battery cell gigafactory, currently under construction.

myFM spoke with Sean Dyke, CEO of the St. Thomas Economic Development Corp., immediately following the announcement, and he advised that the federal government, earlier Friday, had indicated St. Thomas is to be the location of the Vianode operation.

The firm’s head office is located in Oslo, Norway.

In January of this year, Vianode was selected as a strategic supplier of high-performance anode graphite solutions to General Motors. The multi-billion-dollar deal covers development of large-scale manufacturing capacity and supply of synthetic anode graphite.

Dyke indicated representatives from the city, including Mayor Joe Preston, visited with company officials earlier this year in Norway.

“St. Thomas has long been a leader in the automotive industry, and now we are leading the charge in the North American EV supply chain,” stressed Preston. “Vianode’s decision to invest here is a testament to our city’s talent, innovation, and commitment to a sustainable future.”

Vianode CEO Burkhard Straube said the company chose St. Thomas for its “skilled workforce, world-class infrastructure, and low-carbon electricity grid,” adding that Ontario’s clean energy and manufacturing ecosystem make it an ideal location for the facility.

The company’s process is designed to have a 90% lower carbon footprint than conventional graphite production, helping Canada advance its clean energy transition while building resilient, domestic supply chains.

The project was also featured as part of Canada’s leadership in the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance, which aims to strengthen international partnerships and ensure secure access to materials essential to electric vehicle and battery production.

Vianode’s new plant—dubbed Via TWO—follows the company’s successful operations in Norway, where it runs the world’s most sustainable anode graphite facility, Via ONE. The St. Thomas site will ultimately supply advanced battery materials for up to three million electric vehicles annually by 2030.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2111/files/2025/10/vianode-as-graphite-hero-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 22:17:59.651736

Amid all of Donald Trump’s haphazard policymaking and chaos-mongering, one part of his agenda has remained remarkably consistent throughout both terms: the quest for something he calls “energy dominance.” While Trump probably thinks he coined the concept, only the name is new; it’s really merely a macho rebranding of what was traditionally known as “energy independence,” the desire to produce the nation’s energy domestically rather than import it from potential adversaries. The yearning for energy independence became a focus back during the Nixon era, when geopolitical tensions sparked overlapping energy crises. Ever since, it’s been pursued by every administration, both Democratic and Republican.

So, yes, even cardigan-wearing, thermostat-adjusting Jimmy Carter was an energy dominance guy, maybe even the most successful one. Same goes for Presidents Obama and Biden. What distinguishes Trump — despite all of his regulatory rollbacks, his “Drill, Baby, Drill” and “Mine, Baby, Mine” and “Beautiful Clean Coal” rhetoric and various “emergency” orders — is that his push for dominance has not only been ineffective, it has actually served to weaken the domestic energy industry and has even diminished its ability to produce the power needed to keep modern society running.

If Trump really cared about energy dominance, independence or abundance, he would use all of the tools at his disposal to “win” this war. Even an energy warrior who didn’t give a hoot about pollution or the climate would insist on keeping the fastest-growing energy sources — wind and solar with battery backup — in the nation’s arsenal, along with nuclear, geothermal, hydropower and natural gas, simply for practical reasons, relying on what previous administrations have called an “all-of-the-above” approach.

Instead, Trump has essentially discarded the most promising and effective energy technologies by eliminating federal tax credits for wind power and both rooftop and utility-scale solar, shuttering new wind projects on federal land and in federal waters, subjecting proposed utility-scale solar on federal land to additional scrutiny and red tape, and canceling the Solar for All program that aimed to bring clean energy and energy self-reliance to lower-income families. More recently, the administration clawed back over $7 billion in Biden-era funding for clean energy and grid-reliability projects, many of which were in Western states and all of which came from states that favored Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 election.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is trying to prop up the decrepit and rusty weapons of old, i.e. fossil fuels, and putting them on the front lines in the apparent hope that they don’t crumble away before his term ends.

The administration plans to fork out about $625 million in subsidies in hopes of revitalizing the flagging coal industry and has rolled back myriad regulations (also a form of subsidy) on coal-fired power plants. It has also opened 13 million acres of public land across the West to new coal leasing and overturned Biden-era bans on new leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. At the same time, it has inexplicably canceled funding for carbon capture projects aimed at prolonging nearby coal plants’ lives.

Trump is clearly not looking to achieve energy dominance, but rather to exercise his countless grievances and realize some historical fantasy — while, of course, helping fossil fuel executives rake in a few more bucks while they still can. It’s a sort of qualified bid for coal and oil dominance, so long as it benefits red-leaning states.

But so far, even that’s not going too well.

Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management held its first coal lease sale in over a decade on public land in the Powder River Basin. There was only one would-be buyer, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which bid just $186,000 for a tract containing about 167 million tons of coal — meaning about one-tenth of one cent per ton. That’s in contrast to sales in 2012 that brought in over $1 per ton. The feds rejected the bid on the grounds that it didn’t comply with the Mineral Leasing Act since it didn’t fetch fair market value. The Interior Department promptly canceled another sale in the Powder River Basin for 441 million tons of coal just days before it was scheduled to take place. And a third sale, this one on public lands in southwestern Utah, attracted only one low bid as well; and it, too, was rejected.

And just days after the administration announced its plans to pour taxpayers’ cash into the coal industry, PacifiCorp, the largest grid operator in the Western U.S., doubled down on its plans to convert its Naughton coal plant in Wyoming to run on natural gas. Idaho Power actually proposed a rate decrease for its customers after it cut costs by shutting down a unit at a Nevada coal plant. Meanwhile, no utility anywhere has seriously proposed building any new coal plants, mainly because it is simply an obsolete, expensive and dirty technology.

The president’s continual desire to “Drill, Baby, Drill” is experiencing a failure to launch, as well. The BLM has handed out drilling permits like Shriners throwing candy to the crowd at a parade, continuing to do so at an alarming rate despite the government shutdown. During the first six months of Trump’s term, the administration issued 2,660 permits to drill on public lands — about 524 per month. That eclipses Biden’s biggest year of 2023, when he issued 317 per month and garnered the disdain of climate activists.

And yet, drill rig counts, the most accurate indicator of the industry’s enthusiasm and a good barometer of future crude oil and natural gas production levels, have remained stagnant during Trump’s term. In fact, they’re significantly lower than they were a year ago, shortly before Trump was elected. That’s due in part to low oil prices, which is something Trump has pushed for (and maybe prodded Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to encourage by increasing their own oilfield pumping), but also because Trump’s disorderly trade wars are sowing confusion, while his tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising costs for drillers.

The most recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of oil and gas executives revealed how poorly Trump’s policies are playing out in the oilfields. Most of the executives surveyed said that Trump’s regulatory rollbacks and federal royalty reductions would bring down their “break-even” costs only slightly, and that they would not appreciably increase production.

Generally speaking, optimism is in short supply in the oilpatch these days.

“It’s going to be a bleak three-plus years for the oilpatch,” one executive said, in a survey that was designed to be anonymous to encourage a candid response. Another noted: “After Liberation Day, we cut our drilling budget in half from 10 wells to five wells.”

And yet another declared, “We have begun the twilight of shale. Several multibillion-dollar firms that have previously been U.S.-onshore-only are making investments in foreign countries and riskier (waterborne) geologies.” They went on to question what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of abandoned and orphaned wells when the drilling boom ends, noting, “Society will not treat us kindly unless we do our part to clean up after we are gone.”",https://coyotegulch.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landline-screeshot.png,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:04.683244

President Lai meets European delegates to 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference

On the afternoon of October 28, President Lai Ching-te met with European delegates to the 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference and Taiwan-Europe Undersea Cables Security and Cooperation Forum. In remarks, President Lai expressed his appreciation to the guests for promoting pro-Taiwan resolutions in the European Parliament and their respective national parliaments, and for supporting Taiwan’s international participation. The president indicated that this marks the first time the annual conference has been held in Taiwan, and stated that Taiwan is fully committed to collaborating with European and other democratic partners to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables and other critical infrastructure. He also stated that Taiwan is ready to work with Europe to strengthen the alignment between technology and our values of freedom and democracy through public-private cooperation, so as to jointly establish a new paradigm for democratic partnerships. The president expressed hope to continue working hand in hand to promote global peace, prosperity, and development. A translation of President Lai’s remarks follows: Let me start by warmly welcoming you all to Taiwan. I would also like to thank you for sharing valuable insights and engaging in in-depth exchanges at the conference and forum. The Formosa Club was jointly established in 2019 by the European Parliament-Taiwan Friendship Group and Taiwan friendship groups of the national parliaments of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Its goal is to rally support among like-minded countries for Taiwan’s international participation. This year is especially significant because it marks the first time the Formosa Club Annual Conference has been held in Taiwan. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for your longstanding efforts in promoting pro-Taiwan resolutions in the European Parliament and your respective national parliaments. In particular, the European Parliament has adopted numerous resolutions and statements in its current term that categorically oppose China’s malicious distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and reject any attempts by China to unilaterally change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait by force or coercion. Taiwan has never backed down in the face of expanding authoritarianism. We have always steadfastly upheld the values of democracy and freedom. Your support for Taiwan shows the international community that even under the pressure of authoritarian coercion, we still have like-minded friends who are willing to speak up in the name of friendship and stand for freedom and democracy. This shows the Taiwanese people that democratic partners around the world are working hand in hand with Taiwan to tackle challenges. In recent years, both Taiwan and Europe have faced challenges arising from undersea cable damage or interference. These incidents have reminded us that subsea infrastructure is a lifeline of the global digital economy and a foundation of cybersecurity and economic resilience for democratic nations. At the Taiwan-Europe Undersea Cables Security and Cooperation Forum earlier, Minister of Foreign Affairs Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) introduced Taiwan’s RISK Management Initiative on International Undersea Cables. I want to stress that Taiwan is fully committed to collaborating with European and other democratic partners to enhance the security and resilience of undersea cables and other critical infrastructure. We are also ready to work with Europe to strengthen the alignment between technology and our values of freedom and democracy through public-private cooperation, so as to jointly establish a new paradigm for democratic partnerships. In closing, I once again welcome all our guests who have traveled so far to be here. Thank you for showing support for Taiwan through your actions. Let us continue to work hand in hand to promote global peace, prosperity, and development. Rihards Kols, chair of the 2025 Formosa Club Annual Conference and member of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs, then delivered remarks, first thanking President Lai for the warm reception. He noted that hospitality is something that defines Taiwan and its people, and that he believes everyone in attendance has experienced this hospitality. He went on to say that as chair of this year’s annual conference, he sends best regards from Chair Michael Gahler of the Formosa Club in the European Parliament, adding that Chair Gahler reaffirms the work they have concluded in the past two days on both the joint statement and the discussions related to undersea cables, the challenges that face democracies, and how the European Union, Europe, and Taiwan must collaborate in order to tackle these issues. Chair Kols then acknowledged and extended appreciation to Taiwan for its support for Ukraine, as well as for imposing sanctions where necessary to avoid circumvention. The chair then presented the joint statement from the conference, stating that it not only reflects the efforts of the Formosa Club on ongoing issues, but also focuses on enhancing the partnership with Taiwan, be it representation in international arenas or the meaningful representation of Taiwan, adding that this is something they will work on hands-on. He also noted that people-to-people relations is something they keep dear to their hearts and will promote whenever possible. Els Van Hoof, head of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives delegation, then delivered remarks, stating that Taiwan, Belgium, and the members of the Formosa Club share the values of democracy, human rights, and rule of law, making us natural allies in the shared threat of China and Russia. She indicated that the Belgian Parliament has already adopted a resolution against the distortion of UN Resolution 2758, and now will discuss risk management for undersea cables, adding that there has to be cooperation. She expressed hope to continue working together and deepen cooperation on risk management, creating a global shield of democratic resilience. Erin McGreehan, member of the Chamber of Representatives of Ireland and head of the Irish cross-party parliamentary delegation, then delivered remarks. Ireland and Taiwan, she said, are two very proud island nations who believe in self-determination, democracy, human rights, and freedom. She expressed her belief that we must work together in this troubled time of global unrest and conflict to secure all our futures, stating that we will do that only through dialogue, cooperation, acceptance of difference, and ability to embrace new opportunities. She mentioned that for Ireland and Europe, she sees Taiwan as their opportunity, not only to support a democratic country in Asia, but to enhance economic, educational, and cultural ties. She then said that they have much to do and much to look forward to. Thorsten Benner, co-chair of the delegation of European opinion leaders and co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, then delivered remarks. He said that it is a pleasure for him to be in Taiwan for the first time, noting that their group is eager to learn about Taiwan and how they can deal with shared challenges. He then mentioned examples of such challenges, including our aging societies and the younger generations’ feeling of uncertainty about their future prospects. Justyna Szczudlik, co-chair of the delegation of European opinion leaders and deputy head of research at the Polish Institute of International Affairs, then delivered remarks. She said that their delegation is here because they would like to experience democracy in Asia and in Taiwan, where they have felt its vibrancy. Noting that we are living in turbulent times because of many things ongoing in different parts of the world, she said that there is a consensus in Europe – and not only in Europe – that the security of Europe, of Asia, and of the Taiwan Strait are interconnected. She pointed out that it is in our common interest to work together and to focus on security, the most important topic for Europe, Asia, and Taiwan. In closing, she expressed thanks for President Lai’s meeting with them and for the enormous hospitality they have received, adding that they hope to be back next year.

President Lai attends AIPAC dinner event

On the evening of October 27, President Lai Ching-te attended an American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) dinner event. In remarks, President Lai thanked AIPAC for long highlighting the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait to regional and global peace and prosperity. He also stated that Taiwan, the United States, and Israel may be geographically distant, but are all firmly committed to freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, standing on the frontline against authoritarianism and defending our way of life and fundamental values. The president said that Taiwan will continue to increase military investment and bolster its self-defense capabilities. He expressed hope that Taiwan will make the most of its advantages as a semiconductor industry hub by integrating US and Israeli resources in research and development, and deepen economic and trade collaboration to help achieve regional peace, stability, and prosperity. A transcript of President Lai’s remarks follows: I extend a warm welcome to the first ever delegation to Taiwan from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC is a prominent nonprofit, dedicated to advancing US-Israel relations. It is a highly prestigious and influential organization in the United States. I am so pleased to see that AIPAC’s first delegation to Taiwan comprises over 200 people. I would like to thank President [Bernard] Kaminetsky and the delegation for their high regard and support of Taiwan. Let me also recognize Mr. Jeffrey Schwartz, founder of the Jeffrey D. Schwartz Jewish Community Center, for his long-term promotion of exchanges between Taiwan, Israel, and the US Jewish community, and in particular his efforts in facilitating this visit. The delegation includes leaders from politics, business, and other sectors of the United States. Many of you are visiting Taiwan for the first time. Over the past few days, I am sure you have experienced Taiwan’s freedom, diversity, and vibrancy. Taiwan and the United States are steadfast partners that share the values of freedom and democracy. We are delighted that with cross-party support, Taiwan-US-Israel ties continue to deepen. At this important event, I want to take the opportunity to express my relief that the Israeli hostages have been released. Following the Hamas violent attack on October 7, 2023, Taiwan immediately condemned the attack and then provided assistance to the Israeli people through humanitarian aid and medical supplies. The latest ceasefire and release of hostages have been the most significant developments in the past two years. The breakthrough was a major diplomatic achievement for US President Donald Trump and an important step toward peace in the Middle East. I would like to recognize the tireless contributions of AIPAC members to regional peace during this period. Jewish culture has one of the longest histories in the world. In recent centuries, Jewish people have suffered constant persecution. Yet, with persistence and determination, the more than 15 million Jews around the world have become pillars of their respective communities. The Taiwanese people often look to the example of the Jewish people when facing challenges to our international standing and threats to our sovereignty from China. The people of Taiwan have never become discouraged. By working hard, they have made Taiwan an indispensable partner in the global high-tech industry and the development of artificial intelligence. Taiwan is one of the very few countries that holds International Holocaust Remembrance Day events each year with the Israeli and German missions. In recent years, commemorations have been attended by the president. In addition to reminding us of the grave historical significance behind the phrase “never again,” the events also pay tribute to all acts of courage against totalitarianism. Today’s global landscape is in a state of constant flux. Taiwan, the United States, and Israel may be geographically distant, but we are all firmly committed to freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. We stand on the frontline against authoritarianism, defending our way of life and our fundamental values. My friends, appeasement has never been the way to stop authoritarian regimes. Only the concept of peace through strength can overcome all changes and challenges. This is a maxim that the societies of Taiwan, the United States, and Israel have stood by for years. Israel’s determination and capacity to defend its territory provides a valuable model for Taiwan. I have always believed that Taiwan needs to channel the spirit of David against Goliath in standing up to authoritarian coercion. Over the past few years, Taiwan has further bolstered its self-defense capabilities. Next year’s defense budget, as defined by NATO, will exceed 3.32 percent of GDP. We aim to reach 5 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome and the US Golden Dome, Taiwan will build its own T-Dome multilayered air defense system. Looking ahead, Taiwan will continue to increase military investment. This includes building capacity in the indigenous defense industry and procuring necessary weapons and technology from other countries to bolster overall combat capacities. We hope that AIPAC will lend Taiwan even greater support and assistance in this matter. The United States has consistently demonstrated strong bipartisan support for Taiwan. Recently, Taiwan has also increased engagement with the Israeli administration and Knesset (parliament). Last month, I met with a delegation led by Mr. Boaz Toporovsky, chair of the Israel-Taiwan parliamentary friendship group. I was honored to receive a joint statement backing Taiwan’s international participation signed by 72 Knesset members from various political parties. We are very grateful for the demonstration of support from the Knesset, as well as its stance of firm opposition to Beijing’s “one China” framework and distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. In addition to cooperation on defense, security, and foreign affairs, at this critical juncture in the restructuring of global supply chains, Taiwan, the United States, and Israel should strengthen collaboration in the key areas of trade and investment. Taiwan is well-versed in advanced chip manufacturing and is very willing to enhance cooperation with Israel under President Trump’s AI Action Plan. When I served as mayor of Tainan, I was invited to Israel for the International Mayors Conference. I was deeply impressed by the diversity and resilience of Israel – the innovation nation. I look forward to Taiwan making the most of its advantages as a semiconductor industry hub by integrating US and Israeli resources and experience in research and development. Together, we can deepen collaboration in such fields as semiconductors, ICT, and cybersecurity to jointly expand our global market share and bolster supply chain resilience. In closing, I once again extend a warm welcome to all of you for visiting Taiwan. I hope that the United States, Israel, and other partner countries will continue to highlight the importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait to regional and global peace and prosperity. When you return home, please share your experiences in Taiwan with your friends in all sectors of US society, so that more people can get to know Taiwan and understand what it has to offer. I believe that trilateral Taiwan-US-Israel cooperation can help achieve regional peace, stability, and prosperity.

President Lai delivers 2025 National Day Address

President Lai Ching-te on the morning of October 10 attended the ROC’s 114th Double Tenth National Day Celebration in the plaza fronting the Presidential Office Building, and delivered an address titled “A New Taiwan Rises in a Time of Change.” A translation of the president’s address follows: National Day Celebration Chairperson Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜), Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao, Premier Cho Jung-tai (卓榮泰), Her Excellency the Governor-General of Belize Froyla Tzalam and Mr. Daniel Mendez, His Excellency the Governor-General of St. Lucia Errol Charles and First Lady Anysia Charles, President of the Chamber of Deputies of the Republic of Paraguay Raúl Latorre, Japan-ROC Diet Members’ Consultative Council Chairman Furuya Keiji, heads of delegations from diplomatic allies and friendly nations, members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Taiwan, distinguished guests from home and abroad, and my fellow citizens here in person and watching on TV or online: Good morning. Today is the National Day of the Republic of China, and while we gather every year to celebrate the nation’s birthday, this year is an especially significant one. It is a historic year for Taiwan’s democratization. One month ago, September 10, was the historic date when the number of days Taiwan had spent free from martial law officially surpassed the number of days endured under its stifling rule. This signifies that we have parted entirely from an authoritarian regime and its shadow, and have ushered in a democratic future full of hope. We will not forget the blood and tears of those who united to defend against aggression, nor will we forget the selfless sacrifices of past generations in pursuit of democracy and freedom, granting sovereignty to the people. Those stories, which have become woven into the fabric of our land, are our collective memory. Democratic Taiwan, forged through untold hardships, is what most clearly positions the 23 million people of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu in this world. Taiwan is a beacon of democracy in Asia. For every person still living in darkness under authoritarian rule, we forever shine the light of hope. This year also saw Taiwan’s rise. Nations around the world are suffering drastic changes and challenges, and Taiwan is no exception. In addition to the Russia-Ukraine war, turmoil in the Middle East, and China’s continued military expansion, the United States’ tariff policy has delivered a blow to economies and industries alike. But the people of Taiwan are still on their feet. And not only that – this year’s economic performance greatly impressed the global community. According to the Asian Development Bank’s latest report, Taiwan’s economic growth rate this year leapt from 3.3 to 5.1 percent, leading the Four Asian Tigers and surpassing China. Taiwanese exports have continued to reach record highs, and employment is at its best in 25 years. Our stock market has also risen for six consecutive months, hitting an all-time high of 27,301 points. Taiwan’s market capitalization has topped US$3 trillion, making our stock market the world’s eighth largest, and foreign exchange reserves surpassed US$600 billion for the first time, setting a new record. In the midst of adversity, we remain undaunted. In the midst of challenges, we grow ever stronger. These are achievements that the people of Taiwan made together. Let us all celebrate them! These impressive economic accomplishments also reflect the stellar record of Taiwan’s semiconductor, ICT, electronic component, and other leading industries. Their advantageous position in the global supply chain is the result of long-term key policies for the development of technological and manufacturing capabilities, unique business models, and government-led science parks. This is a monumental industrial achievement forged by decades of combined efforts, and it belongs to all the people of Taiwan. As president, it is my mission to protect these valuable assets and use them to boost Taiwan’s and even worldwide industrial and economic growth, helping to create even better lives for people in Taiwan and around the world. This is also the direction Taiwan is taking. Of course, we will certainly not ignore the formidable challenges in this time of global change, and the risks they pose to different industries, different fields, and groups of different backgrounds. Many of the champions, traditional industries, and micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) leading Taiwan’s economic growth from behind the scenes are facing the pressure of the digital and net-zero transition. Many workers feel concerned and uneasy about job opportunities, salaries, commodity prices, and cost of living in the face of the AI wave. Farmers are also being impacted by an aging rural population and market liberalization. The government will not take these challenges lightly, and will not ignore the impact they have on each and every citizen. It is our responsibility to put our full effort into assisting traditional industries, MSMEs, working families, and those in the agricultural and fishing industries. Therefore, in addition to having proposed a 93-billion-NT-dollar tariff impact support plan to help enterprises, workers, and those in the agricultural and fishing industries weather this difficult time, the government will also be investing tens of billions of dollars each year to help MSMEs introduce AI into their work so they can move toward digital and net-zero upgrading and transformation and address challenges. For traditional machine tools, screws and nuts, and other industries that are facing difficulties, we will also be proposing separate countermeasures to actively help boost competitiveness and expand the market. My fellow citizens, times of change are also times of opportunity. Taiwan’s economic performance is clear for all to see, and our key position in the global supply chain can neither be challenged nor replaced. In the face of change, we must not doubt ourselves or waver, but seize opportunities with confidence and bravely follow through. We must not be complacent or turn back, but even more proactively forge ahead in the world. A Taiwan that is certain will serve as an important, reliable, and steady force for an uncertain world. Moving ahead, we will adopt three major strategies in order to ensure the Republic of China Taiwan’s competitive advantage: First, we will expand investment in Taiwan. Our Three Major Programs for Investing in Taiwan have yielded substantial results. Investment has surpassed NT$2.5 trillion, creating over 160,000 job opportunities. In July, the Executive Yuan extended the programs to 2027 while also expanding applicable industries and eligibility to include overseas Taiwanese businesses worldwide and foreign investing enterprises. The government is continuing to optimize the investment environment, adding NT$720 billion in new loans to attract investment in Taiwan and bring in an estimated NT$1.2 trillion in capital and 80,000 more job opportunities. Besides having good work, we should also have good lives. With this in mind, the government launched the Trillion NT Dollar Investment National Development Plan to encourage copious investment of private capital in public infrastructure through innovative public-private partnerships. It expands funding for construction while at the same time promoting critical infrastructure projects across counties and cities nationwide, in areas such as water, electricity, housing, education, healthcare, culture, tourism, and transportation. This will help meet local residents’ needs so they can live happy lives, and enable industries and spheres of living to develop in a complementary way so that we can achieve our goal of a balanced Taiwan. Second, we will deepen international economic and trade cooperation, and expand our global presence. This year, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, under the framework of our Enhanced Trade Partnership arrangement, additionally signed three pillar arrangements in investment, digital trade, and energy and net-zero. This marks a new milestone for Taiwan-UK economic and trade relations, showing our mutual commitment to high international trade standards and laying the foundation for cooperation in technology, advanced manufacturing, and other strategic industries. Moving ahead, Taiwan will sign bilateral economic and trade cooperation agreements with even more friends and allies while upholding the principle of mutual benefits. We will also actively engage in reciprocal tariff negotiations with the US to secure a reasonable rate, resolve the trade deficit between Taiwan and the US, and deepen industrial cooperation. This will enable Taiwan’s economic development to become more globally connected and thereby make great strides. Third, we are building a chain of “guardian mountains” to shore up Taiwan’s industrial capabilities. In this digital age, we will implement 10 new AI infrastructure initiatives. In addition to helping make Taiwan one of the world’s top five computing centers, we will also invest more vigorously in R&D in three key technological fields: quantum technology, silicon photonics, and robotics. This will facilitate the introduction of AI tools in different sectors and professions, and promote the application of AI in various fields, helping Taiwan move toward an era of comprehensive smart technology and continue to maintain its leading position in global tech development. We are also building Taiwan into a hub in Asia for asset management. This will not only help retain trillions in Taiwanese capital, but attract investment in Taiwan with international capital, promoting growth in the financial industry, creating quality job opportunities, and strengthening Taiwan. The biopharmaceutical industry is a key national industry and has thus been included in our National Project of Hope. We are also developing toward greater use of precision health in health maintenance, preventive medicine, diagnosis, treatment, and care, giving our nation durable competitiveness and advancing the well-being of our people. Next year, our National Infectious Diseases Bank will be completed, and Taiwan will continue stepping up its cooperation with other countries in the field of biotechnology. Through our program for investment in smart healthcare innovation and entrepreneurship, with its budget of NT$10 billion, we will encourage more firms to invest in innovative R&D, expand investment, and move the biomedical industry toward becoming a trillion-NT-dollar industry, which will be one more guardian mountain for our nation. My fellow citizens, Taiwan is for all the people of Taiwan. We are well aware that no matter how impressive our economic performance may be, we must not overlook anyone on this land. The fruits of our economic growth should be enjoyed by all our people. Good numbers should translate into good lives, with no one left behind. Helping our citizens stay healthy, nurturing young talent, creating an even better environment for the younger generation, and providing greater support for young families is the government’s absolute responsibility. The Healthy Taiwan Cultivation Plan, launched this year, is improving the medical environment and system overall and will ensure higher quality healthcare services for all citizens. Also this year, we officially established the Ministry of Sports, ushering in a new era of sports for all, competitive sports, and professional sports. With this new ministry, we aim to ensure that all athletes receive full national support so that they can pursue their dreams on the global stage, winning national glory. In addition, to support our young people, we are providing free tuition for high schools and vocational schools, and an NT$35,000 annual tuition subsidy for students of private junior colleges, colleges, and universities. Our Taiwan Global Pathfinders Initiative, which supports young people aged 15 to 30 in pursuing their dreams abroad, is officially underway. Moreover, for renters, the government provides NT$30 billion in annual rent subsidies. Unmarried renters with an annual income below NT$626,000, families of four with a combined annual income below NT$1.641 million, and households with three generations living together with a combined annual income below NT$2.1245 million will be exempt from individual income tax. We will also provide even greater support to the young parents in our society. In addition to promoting version 2.0 of our national childcare policy for ages 0–6, with increased childcare allowances and expanded childcare subsidies, starting next year, the government will provide an increased birth subsidy of NT$100,000 per child. Nor do our senior citizens need to worry. Next year, with the launch of Long-Term Care 3.0, the government will work hard to ensure that all seniors receive more convenient, more comprehensive care. Our goal is to ensure that all to whom the nation belongs – our children, young people, parents, and grandparents – receive better care so that they can face the future with greater confidence. This year also marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The lessons of World War II are still fresh in our memory. The ambitions of the aggressors in that conflict caused widespread devastation and loss of life. In today’s world, authoritarianism continues to expand and the international order faces severe challenges. Regional order in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, and South China Sea, and even the security of the entire first island chain, are under serious threat. Democratic Taiwan is a crucial link for the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific and a responsible member of the international community. As such, Taiwan will work to uphold the status quo, ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and promote the prosperous development of the region. We look forward to the day when China can take responsibility as a major power and cease its distortion of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 and historical World War II documents. We also hope it will renounce the use of force or coercion to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait so that we can jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific. Looking back at World War II, we see that so many experienced the suffering of war and the pain of invasion. We should learn from these lessons and ensure that the tragedies of history are never repeated. The outcomes of that conflict tell us that aggression fails, unity prevails, and that peace is won through strength. I want to declare to our citizens and the international community: At the end of this year, we will be proposing a special budget for national defense. Defense spending, as it is defined by NATO, will exceed 3 percent of GDP next year, and will reach 5 percent of GDP by 2030, showing our determination to safeguard the nation. The increase in defense spending has a purpose; it is a clear necessity to counter enemy threats and a driving force for developing our defense industries. Through our new defense budget, we aim to achieve three major goals: First, we will accelerate our building of the T-Dome, establish a rigorous air defense system in Taiwan with multi-layered defense, high-level detection, and effective interception, and weave a safety net for Taiwan to protect the lives and property of citizens. Second, we will advance the integration of high-tech and AI technologies to build a smart defense combat system, maximizing effective deterrence for our asymmetric strategy. Third, we will continue to invest in innovative defense technologies and collaborate with the military industries of advanced nations to bolster our defense industry capabilities. We will strengthen our domestic supply chains through local R&D, design, and manufacturing. This will enable Taiwan to accelerate industry upgrades, enhance the resilience of our military equipment, and boost the capacity of our defense industry. In that way, Taiwan, becoming a trusted security partner for our friends and allies, can jointly avoid the red supply chain and foster trust in defense among free and democratic countries, while building a robust line of defense to safeguard the values of freedom and democracy. We are determined to maintain peace through strength. We firmly believe that strength is not obtained through military strength alone, but must also rely on resilience throughout society. Over the past year, through the efforts of the Office of the President Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, we have built up greater strength between the government and private sector, and between the central and local governments. We have integrated disaster prevention and defense to strengthen military-civilian cooperation. We have also continued to strengthen resilience in civilian training, energy, healthcare, information and communications networks, and finance, comprehensively enhancing our ability to respond to various crises. I want to emphasize that building societal defense and resilience requires every ounce of effort. Last month, we released our updated national public safety guide, which includes strategies for responding to various natural disasters and even extreme scenarios such as a military invasion. We plan to gradually ensure that each and every household has access to this safety guide, because only when all of society participates and learns to help themselves and one another can Taiwan develop greater resilience to face all kinds of challenges. My fellow citizens, over the past year, we have faced numerous challenges together, but the people of Taiwan never give up hope. Whenever a crisis arises, we always see numerous Taiwanese standing on the frontline, selflessly dedicating themselves to the nation they love. Just last month we saw two very moving scenes. The first was at the UN General Assembly held in New York, where many members of the overseas Taiwanese community raised money and launched a fundraising campaign to light up Times Square with advertisements to “Chip in with Taiwan,” promoting Taiwan’s participation, and advocating that we are “Better Together.” It touched the hearts of people around the world. The second was the tens of thousands of volunteers who, after the Fata’an Creek barrier lake disaster, slipped on their rain boots, shouldered their shovels, and traveled great distances to provide relief to help the affected residents of Hualien return to normal life as soon as possible. These “superheroes with shovels” did more than dig out heavy mud and sludge to help disaster victims return home; these heroes also uncovered a light – a light of hope that warmed every heart it touched. More than that, they proved the remarkable resilience of the Taiwanese people and their resolve to protect our homeland in the face of crisis. Now, let us all thank these superheroes of disaster relief, who come from all walks of life and from all over the country, as well as friends from abroad and the military, police, firefighters, and central and local government personnel who devoted themselves to the relief effort. This spontaneous nationwide movement is absolutely unique in the world, and for that the world will remember: Taiwan, that small mountainous country, is truly compassionate, and truly great! Moving forward, I will continue to lead the country, hearts united, without fear of hardship or challenge, bravely, toward an even better tomorrow. Let’s keep going, Taiwan! Let’s keep going, Republic of China! Let’s keep going, Republic of China Taiwan! Thank you.",https://english.president.gov.tw/template/assets/img/fbshare.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:33.152144

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Investment Narrative Recap

To own Mitsubishi Heavy Industries stock, you need confidence in its ability to capture long-term demand for energy transition, advanced manufacturing, and cross-border infrastructure projects. The recent US-Japan cooperation around potential US-based investment projects could strengthen order backlog prospects, but the biggest immediate risk, persistent foreign exchange volatility affecting reported earnings, remains largely unchanged by the announcement, as actual project launches and funding are still uncertain. Among recent announcements, MHI's Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings report saw both revenue and net income rise, supported by continuing strong order intake in energy systems. This growth in core markets may be relevant if US project initiatives advance, as stronger earnings and order momentum could help offset near-term risks from margin pressures or currency swings. But investors should also keep in mind that, despite this promising news, heightened sensitivity to currency movements can unexpectedly...

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is projected to reach ¥6,460.1 billion in revenue and ¥438.4 billion in earnings by 2028. This outlook is based on an annual revenue growth rate of 8.1% and an earnings increase of ¥187.0 billion from the current earnings of ¥251.4 billion.

Reliable, affordable electricity is important to existing customers, but it is crucial in recruiting new business and industry to Warren County.","Replacing retired power plants is part of bold plan

Vicksburg will once again be home to an Entergy Mississippi power generation source with construction of the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station, the company’s latest investment to replace retired, fifty-year-old natural gas generation facilities with newer, highly efficient resources. The 754-megawatt combined-cycle combustion turbine facility will be located on the grounds of the former Baxter Wilson Steam Electric Station and, along with already-announced plants in Greenville and Ridgeland, will help ensure Entergy Mississippi’s 459,000 customers continue to have efficient, reliable and affordable energy.

Replacing legacy power plants with new, highly efficient power generation sources provides long-term savings to customers. Modern natural gas plants are forty percent more fuel efficient than older facilities, saving customers more money on future bills for decades to come.

In the short term, the construction of this and other new generation units at the time of new large industrial technology customers’ investments in the grid—like Amazon—will reduce forecasted bill increases by sixteen percent over the next five years.

Savings include an estimated $1.3 billion in the materials and equipment costs to build new power plants today, compared to the cost to build those facilities on their original schedules. Given the inflationary trends in materials and construction costs, building facilities now will save customers money.

Entergy’s diverse generation portfolio offers flexibility to lessen the impact on customers’ bills should one fuel source spike in price. Additionally, Entergy expects to pass on to customers an estimated savings of $700 million in fuel costs over the life of the new units.

“Today, we are in a global race to secure leadership in the emerging industries of the future—and one of the most critical ingredients in this race is energy,” said Governor Tate Reeves, who attended the ground breaking. “A top priority of mine will be continuing to bring more available, affordable and reliable energy to our state. Entergy’s massive $1.2 billion investment will help us further solidify Mississippi as a leader in American energy production. This is another historic day for energy and economic development in Mississippi.”

These measures are part of Superpower Mississippi, the largest grid upgrade in the company’s history, which makes distribution improvements, adds new generation and prioritizes keeping customers’ rates affordable while building an all-of-the-above generation mix that makes the electric grid more reliable and efficient.

While electricity costs are rising nationally, growth in our service area—including new large industrial customers like Amazon—means some of the increased costs for equipment and fuel that otherwise would be incorporated into future bills won’t be passed on to our other existing customers. Customers will also share a smaller portion of the costs than they would have to build the same plants on their original schedules.

“Vicksburg is one of the four original cities we began serving in 1923, and we’re proud to continue our legacy here with the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station. We’re building new natural gas plants in our service area for the first time in more than 50 years. Replacing older plants has been in our long-term resource plan for several years, but we’re taking advantage of the economic growth happening in our region to bring modern generation technology online sooner, while minimizing the rate impact to customers’ bills,” said Haley Fisackerly, President and CEO, Entergy Mississippi.

“These upgrades are not only important to keeping bills affordable for customers, but also to making sure we have the capacity to promote economic development, recruit new and higher paying jobs, and power residential, commercial, industrial and technology growth for Mississippi’s future.

“Our reliability effort announced last month combined with this additional commitment to develop new power generation sources means our Superpower Mississippi plan is bringing more power and better power to customers, all at a lower cost to them,” continued Fisackerly. “Our state leaders have been instrumental in recruiting large industrial customers, like Amazon, that afford us the ability to provide these significant benefits to customers. And, thanks to support for that growth from Governor Reeves, the Mississippi State Legislature and the Mississippi Public Service Commission, all customers will benefit from lower bills than they otherwise would have seen in the future. We’re also grateful to local leaders, like those in Warren County, who welcome these investments that not only help their communities prosper but also serve Mississippi families and businesses throughout the western half of the state.”

“I’m encouraged to see Entergy Mississippi moving into the next phase of its Superpower Mississippi plan, with a clear focus on generating power that’s both efficient and affordable,” said De’Keither Stamps, Mississippi Public Service Commissioner, Central District. “As utility costs continue to rise nationwide, it’s important that Mississippians see real savings and reliable service here at home. By working with large industrial customers to share costs and drive new economic growth, Entergy is helping ensure lower rates and stronger reliability for all customers. I look forward to seeing continued progress that keeps Mississippi competitive and our communities well-powered for the future.”

“Entergy’s investment in this new power plant sets a record for capital investment in the City of Vicksburg,” said Willis Thompson, Vicksburg Mayor. “We are excited about our long-term partnership with Entergy and what this project means for the future of our community. The economic impact will be tremendous, and the additional power capacity will further strengthen our ability to attract new jobs and investment to the region.”

A $1.2 billion investment, the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station represents a significant economic impact for the area, including more than 560 construction jobs over the next several years and additional tax revenue for Warren County. Entergy will employ about twenty-one personnel to operate the plant once completed.

This advanced facility will be equipped with combined-cycle combustion turbine technology that primarily uses natural gas and is also designed to support blended hydrogen in the future, mirroring the other power plants Entergy Mississippi is building: Delta Blues Advanced Power Station in Greenville and Traceview Advanced Power Station in Ridgeland. Much like the legacy units that have been cornerstones of our local communities for half a century, these new plants will power life for the next generation of Mississippians and beyond.

“The contribution of Entergy’s newest power plant goes far beyond generating electricity,” said Kelle Barfield, Warren County Board of Supervisors President. “The contribution of Entergy’s newest power plant goes far beyond generating electricity. Reliable, affordable electricity is important to existing customers, but it is crucial in recruiting new business and industry to Warren County. The plant will also return vital revenues to the tax base for the county, which helps support county services for all residents.”",https://msbusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-fav-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 21:02:53.935474

Get ready for a new line item on electricity bills across Illinois totaling at least $7 billion as the absurdity of Illinois green energy policy continues.

The new charge will be for large batteries that store electricity from wind and solar sources. It’s another cost of green energy nobody told you about. Because wind and solar are not reliable, you will now have to pay to cover up the consequences.

It’s The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA, Senate Bill 25), passed Friday by the General Assembly. Gov. JB Pritzker says he will sign it.

Among many other controversial provisions, here’s one you should know about:

Part of your electricity bill is something called a “capacity charge” assessed by electricity grid operators, two of which cover Illinois. The capacity charge is an assurance that the grid operator will provide enough electricity to its territory even in periods of peak demand. If the grid operator has less access to reliable sources its capacity charges are higher. Capacity charges have soared recently, which is part of why your electricity bills have risen.

The problem with wind and solar is they don’t produce anything when it’s dark and windless. Grid operators therefore cannot give as much credit to wind and solar when they set capacity prices as they can to more reliable sources like natural gas, coal and nuclear. Wind and solar now provide around 20% of Illinois electricity and rising, though estimates vary somewhat. Up went your electricity bill as that portion has risen, thanks to green mandates in Illinois law.

What to do about those higher electricity costs from unreliable sources?

Just add batteries, says our political establishment, and voila, problem solved. Big batteries connected to the grid can store electricity from wind and solar, they say. Their claim is that when the new line item for batteries starts appearing on your bill in 2030 it will be offset by a reduction at least as big in the capacity charge reflected in the rest of your bill.

Think about that. They are making you pay to solve the very problem their green energy mandates caused, which is higher prices. Had we stuck with reliable traditional sources we wouldn’t be trying to deal with the upward pressure on capacity charges caused by renewables.

And who has any confidence that $7 billion of batteries will be the end of it?

Not the authors of the new law, apparently. The battery assessment charge amounts on your bill will be left entirely to the Illinois Commerce Commission – unelected officials. And the law contains no caps. The original law mandating Illinois’ conversion to renewable energy contained caps on rate increases – weak caps, but at least they were something. The new law has nothing. Other estimates already put the charge for the new law at $8 billion, not $7 billion over 20 years.

Perhaps most astonishingly, the bill is being spun by its supporters as a measure to reduce electricity bills. They’ve in fact just swapped one charge in your bill for another.

*******************

This initial article just begins to touch on the madness of the new CRGA law. It’s a monstrosity, and we will try to address the rest of it in later columns. Among its other provisions:

It provides for another $1,687,403 annually for the Clean Jobs Workforce Network program; another $1,687,403 million annually for the Clean Energy Contractor Incubator program; and an additional $1,143,079 million annually for the Barrier Reduction Program beginning June 2026.

It requires the Illinois Department of Commerce to transfer up to $84,800,000 annually from the Energy Transition Assistance Fund to the Electric Vehicle and Charging Fund – more subsidies for charging stations.

And, of course, there’s more bureaucracy:

Thermal Energy Network Pilot Program to run $20 million for thermal network projects.

Geothermal Homes and Businesses Program that allocates $10 million per year in credits for installation of new geothermal heating and cooling systems.

“Powering Up Illinois” program that mandates faster utility connections for EV infrastructure and establishes performance standards.

The first site in Manchester, Kentucky, will be equipped with two 400-kW power electronics cabinets, each with two satellite dispensers for a total of four stalls. The maximum power output is 400 kW (it decreases accordingly to the power demand at other bays).

The satellite dispensers are equipped with two connectors — one CCS1 and one NACS (SAE J3400) — for maximum compatibility, eliminating the need for adapters.

Depending on the demand, the site has space for additional stalls and additional power.

Regarding payments, a credit card reader will be available. An alternative option is to pay through an app.

The Senate Finance Committee recommended passage Tuesday of Senate File 506, the annual Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCCMR) appropriation from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, voting 10–2 to send the bill to the floor.

The bill would authorize $103,326,000 for 124 environmental and natural-resources projects across Minnesota, the package the LCCMR developed through a multistage review process. A technical A1 amendment to change a grant recipient from Bay West LLC to Freshwater Society was approved in committee. A separate A2 amendment offered by Senator Nick Jasinski to reallocate $335,000 and extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects failed 6–6 on a roll call.

Why it matters: the ENRTF is a constitutionally created, voter-approved permanent fund that supplies a large share of state-dedicated funding for conservation, restoration, research, education, land acquisition and related work. LCCMR’s recommendations are the principal vehicle that channels annual ENRTF appropriations to projects the commission selects after competitive review and peer evaluation.

Becca Nash, director of the Legislative Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources, told the committee the package reflects the commission’s process and priorities. ""The bill includes over 103 millions in funding for 124 environmental and natural resources projects across our state,"" she said, and walked members through the bill’s subdivisions that group appropriations by priority area.

The bill allocates funding across multiple subdivisions: $22,084,000 for foundational data and information (36 appropriations); $11,812,000 for water resources (23 appropriations); $11,965,000 for environmental education (19 appropriations); $6,713,000 for invasive species (2 appropriations); $11,744,000 for air quality, climate, and renewable energy (7 appropriations); $12,188,000 for methods to protect or restore land and habitat (19 appropriations); $19,553,000 for land acquisition, habitat, and recreation (14 appropriations); and $7,267,000 for administration, emerging issues and contract reimbursement (4 appropriations). Nash said the commission received 214 proposals requesting roughly $183 million and approved 124 projects following presentations, scoring and external peer review.

Committee members pressed staff on two recurring themes: (1) carryforwards and deadline extensions for previously approved projects and (2) the share of funding that goes to universities and state agencies. Fiscal staff and Nash said many carryforwards stem from COVID-related delays, supply-chain and hiring challenges, or weather impacts; most extensions are for one year, a few for two. Senator Brett (transcript) observed the committee was identifying roughly $9.1 million of extensions across about 13 projects and urged stronger grantee accountability.

A technical A1 amendment, moved by Senator Eichorn and described by staff as a project partner request, replaced the designated lead grantee from Bay West LLC with the Freshwater Society; the committee approved the amendment by voice vote. LCCMR staff explained Freshwater Society is a nonprofit that has previously received ENRTF funding and that the change reflected partner arrangements where a nonprofit serves as the lead and a for‑profit contractor remains as a consultant.

Senator Nick Jasinski offered Amendment A2 to reduce by $335,000 a northern toxic-bloom project and instead extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects (Fergus Falls/Lake Alice, Rice County/French Lake and a new Blue Earth County/North Eagle Lake project) for two years. Jasinski described the work as an in‑water, equipment‑based pilot: ""This is an actual project. It's not a study. This is actual equipment in the water that's working right now."" Dan Mueller, fiscal analyst, told the committee two of the three projects previously received 2023 general fund appropriations and that the amendment would effectively double the funding on those items.

Committee debate on A2 reflected differences about process and regional priorities. Supporters argued the pilot is showing measurable benefits and merited additional, short-term funding. Opponents, including several members who said they serve on or rely on the LCCMR process, urged deferring changes to the commission or the environment committee so the vetted package would remain intact. On a roll-call vote the amendment was tied 6–6 and did not prevail.

After discussion the committee approved the bill as presented. Senator Pappas moved that Senate File 506 be recommended to pass; the roll-call vote was 10 ayes, 2 noes. The committee record shows the LCCMR package includes carryforwards and technical changes in sections that do not add new money but adjust timing or recipients for prior appropriations.

What the committee did not decide: the bill before Finance excludes the new community grants program funded by an increase in the constitutionally allowed ENRTF drawdown from 5.5% to 7% (a constitutional change voters approved in November 2024); Nash told members that community grants funds are separate and are administered by the Department of Natural Resources. Several senators asked for follow-up briefings or meetings with grantees—particularly University of Minnesota researchers—about specific projects and their outputs.

Votes at a glance:

- A1 (technical): change lead grantee from Bay West LLC to Freshwater Society; mover: Senator Eichorn; outcome: approved by voice vote; note: described as a project-partner request.

- A2 (Jasinski): reallocate $335,000 to extend three Southern Minnesota water-quality projects; mover: Senator Jasinski; outcome: failed on roll call, 6 yes (Friends, Pratt, Dames, Draheim, Eichhorn, Jasinski) — 6 no (Marty, Champion, Mohammed, Murphy, Pappas, Wicklund).

- Final motion: recommend Senate File 506 to pass; mover: Senator Pappas; outcome: approved on roll call, 10 ayes (Marty, Friends, Pratt, Champion, Dames, Jasinski, Mohammed, Murphy, Pappas, Wicklund) — 2 no (Draheim, Eichhorn).

The committee's recommendation now moves Senate File 506 to the next legislative stage where funding totals, specific project language, and any additional amendments may be debated further.

Global solar efforts are on the rise … up 64% since last year

Even as the United States shifts away from renewable energy, solar installations are up 64% globally. China has spearheaded this effort, alongside India and much of Africa, as solar has become a more appealing option amidst a “volatile fossil fuel market.”

Urine might save the world

Urine is now being examined as a potential eco-friendly alternative to hydrogen production, which is typically achieved through gas reforming, which releases large amounts of carbon. Alternatively, urine is readily available, and research shows that bacteria can be used to convert compounds in urine into hydrogen without emitting any pollutants. This process has the potential to generate energy that can be used to power cars and homes, while also providing a solution to waste disposal.

In May, Andrew Hozier-Byrne, who performs as Hozier released a 10th anniversary version of his “Like Real People Do,” with a few changes. It features nature sounds, including birds, water, insects and thunder. He celebrates music with nature and for nature, as he pledged 50% of all the royalties to be donated to global conservation efforts.

Investors may want to apply that perspective to American Airlines, but with the caveat that airline investing isn't always a smooth flight.","In Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street, Gordon Gekko attempted to extract profit from the fictitious Bluestar Airlines by committing what amounted to insider trading, implying that it's difficult to make money with airline stocks the ""right way.""

Hollywood hits aside, if Warren Buffett has difficulty making money in airline stocks -- he's taken losses in the industry on two separate occasions -- best believe that this segment isn't giving away ""easy money."" Of course, it pays to remember that Gekko is a fictional character and even the greatest investors, including Buffett, don't bat a thousand.

Add it all up and it might sound as though the best course of action is to avoid stocks like American Airlines (AAL +2.74%), but this Texas-based carrier has recently been gaining altitude and its ascent may be far from over.

American has flown through the darkest clouds

As of Monday, Oct. 27, shares of American are off 23.08% year to date, as of this writing. That's not a data point that screams ""please invest here,"" but understanding the 2025 disappointments delivered by legacy carriers is easy. A lot of the gloominess boils down to trade tariffs.

Those levies hammered airline stocks, including American, on multiple fronts. With some of the targets of President Donald Trump's tariff gambit, such as Canada and Mexico, being important sources of arrivals to the U.S., international business and leisure travel to this country has faltered. Not surprisingly, domestic trade policy has drawn rebuke from the airline industry.

The tariffs also raised costs for American and its airline peers. Some countries at which the U.S. has aimed tariffs have retaliated or simply boosted prices of certain goods purchased by domestic companies. That's relevant in discussing American Airlines because two of its aircraft suppliers, Airbus and Embraer, are foreign companies, and even though Boeing jets are assembled in the States, up to half of the components in some of those aircraft are sourced overseas.

Fortunately, we're more than six months removed from ""Liberation Day"" and American is on the path to redemption. The stock is higher by 18.57% over the past month amid what many investors may perceive as another set of trying circumstances.

What government shutdown?

The current government shutdown could become the longest in U.S. history shjould it continue much longer and it'd be reasonable to think it's a major headwind to airlines. After all, carriers are dependent on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for details such as landings and takeoffs.

Obviously, American's recent stock performance paints a different picture and history confirms a nonworking government isn't always a drag on airline stocks.

American is alluring as a long-haul investment

In the airline biz, a lengthy flight is called a ""long haul."" Investors may want to apply that perspective to American Airlines, but with the caveat that airline investing isn't always a smooth flight. Still, it shouldn't be ignored that management is bullish. CEO Robert Isom believes his company offers more upside than at least two of American's biggest competitors.

The wider industry outlook could also prove supportive of American shares. By some estimates, the total global airline fleet will double in size by 2044 driven by growing middle classes in international markets. That could stoke demand for more international/long-haul travel, the more profitable routes for carriers like American.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839972/aal.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 21:03:09.948094

As long as Democrats dominate, it’s hard to see New York having reliable electric power much longer, and just forget about it being affordable.","Some Democrats in the Albany may be starting to see the insanity of New York’s “climate action” laws — but will enough agree to even delay the suicide pact?

Gov. Kathy Hochul says she wants to “review all our options,” including making changes to the state’s disastrous 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act — which set budget-busting, pie-in-the-sky mandates to slash greenhouse-gas emissions.

Plus, some Assembly Democrats who once denied Hochul was banning gas stoves now admit that’s just what she’s doing — and demand she delay the ban.

Yet it’ll be tough to convince the progressives who dominate the Legislature to roll back the law, since global-warming hysteria remains the rule on the left, especially among the donor class and other college-educated whites.

Watch New Jersey, where voter fury over soaring electric costs may send Jack Ciattarelli to the governor’s mansion; even a close race there will open eyes in Albany.

Rising utility bills and the threat of blackouts are already becoming major issues in New York, and Hochul plans to make “affordability” the centerpiece of her 2026 reelection campaign.

“My job is to ensure we have enough power to keep the lights on, keep rates affordable and attract major economic development projects,” the gov griped after a judge last month ordered her Department of Environmental Conservation to issue rules to ensure the state meets the 2019 law’s emissions goals.

Meaning: She wants to override (or ignore: see below) the clear letter of the law, even if she doesn’t dare go so far as to call out these statutes’ stupidity.

“We plan to review all our options, including working with the Legislature to modify the CLCPA,” in order “to protect New Yorkers from higher costs.”

Under the law, New York must cut CO2 output by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050.

On the other hand, the law ordered that rules to achieve those goals be enacted by Jan. 1, 2024 — yet here we are nearly two years later, and they have yet to materialize.

(Yep: Hochul’s ignoring the law!)

Meanwhile, Assemblyman William Conrad (D-W.NY) reports the state’s no-gas mandate, which kicks in at the end of this year, has already hiked construction costs, threatening affordable-housing projects and raising the specter of winter blackouts.

Worse, the state Climate Action Plan mandates closing natural-gas power plants and replacing them with pricier, less reliable solar and offshore-wind installations (which are often failing to get off the ground).

Indeed: The New York Independent System Operator (which runs the electric grid) and even the New York Affordable Clean Power Alliance, a solar-industry group, warn that shifting to solar and wind poses dire threats to reliable power, particularly in the Hudson Valley, Long Island and the Big Apple.

How will Hochul prevent blackouts and keep costs down for New Yorkers when the power supply runs short? Especially, as the NYSIO points out, with growing electric demands from cryptocurrency, data mining and all the “green” mandates to shift to electric heat, cooking and cars?

The idea that New York can even build enough solar- and wind-power generation in time to meet those mandates was always fantasy, a charade to please climate activists — yet it’s what the law says the state must do.

As the legal deadlines get closer (or pass without the state doing what the law says it should), the truth grows ever more obvious: It’s not just unrealistic to make “net-zero carbon emissions” a top priority, it’s also expensive, risky and wrongheaded.

How many court orders can the governor defy?

Can she get the Legislature to change the laws and get the courts off her back?

Alas, pols like Hochul may only care about timing: The 2026 gas mandates kick in just as their reelection campaigns begin.

“Don’t bring things to a grinding halt,” suggests Assemblyman John McDonald (D-Rensselaer), just “slow down a little bit and put a temporary pause in there.”

Translation: Wait until after we’re safely reelected before socking New Yorkers with higher bills and blackouts.

Don’t forget how Hochul delayed congestion pricing until after the 2024 elections.

Yet reality won’t change after the election.

Albany should ditch the mandates completely and focus on economic growth.

Yet Hochul will only seek delays, and the progs may well not go along even that far; forget about doing what New York really needs, like opening the state to fracking.

Hope for Ohio’s Future While state and federal politics can be divisive, PCFO shows that clean energy can unite communities.","Across Ohio, cities and towns are taking the lead in shaping a cleaner, stronger future. Mayors and other local leaders from rural, suburban, and urban communities are proving that investing in clean energy isn’t just good for the environment—it’s smart economics.

That’s the driving idea behind Power A Clean Future Ohio (PCFO), a group helping communities work together to reduce pollution, grow local jobs, and build resilience for the long term.

“Power A Clean Future Ohio represents 50 communities all across our state, from small villages up to our largest cities and counties, and everywhere in between. It represents rural and conservative suburban communities, communities led by Republicans and Democrats alike,” said executive director Joe Flarida. “They have seen the opportunity that the clean energy economy presents for their residents and for their workers, and they know it’s smart to invest.”

A Local Response to a Statewide Challenge

PCFO was born out of frustration—and hope. In 2019, Ohio saw one of the biggest corruption scandals in its history when $60 million in bribes helped pass House Bill 6, a bill that bailed out coal and nuclear plants while rolling back renewable energy and efficiency programs.

Instead of giving up, local advocates and mayors across Ohio came together and said: We can do better. That same year, they launched Power A Clean Future Ohio with a simple mission—empower local governments to take control of their energy future.

Five years later, that mission has grown into a statewide movement. PCFO now represents over 50 communities, from rural towns and counties to large urban centers like Columbus, Dayton, and Toledo.

Local Leaders, Real Results

Ohio’s mayors are showing that clean energy works for everyone.

Mayor Aftab Pureval of Cincinnati puts it simply: “When you’re a local leader, you can’t spin, you can’t obfuscate. You have to lead… That’s why cities are really the perfect venue for climate action. Because we are big enough to have a really big impact on the issue, but we’re small enough in order to be nimble and flexible and address the ever-changing landscape.”

In Toledo, Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz says embracing clean technology is part of the city’s industrial DNA. “We’re still going to create jobs, we’re still going to win those awards for economic development,” he says, “but we’re going to be doing it with an eye toward sustainability.”

For Dayton Mayor Jeffrey J. Mims, Jr., collaboration is key, rather than going it alone: “It makes a whole lot more sense to collaborate with other cities,” he points out, “to move us more quickly to trying to be more of a sustainable city, more of a sustainable state.”

And in Lebanon, Mayor Mark Messer points out a direct benefit to residents: “One of the main benefits with solar is that we’re able to take all of our rate savings and pass them directly on to our rate payers.”

The Power of Pragmatism

PCFO’s success lies in its practical, community-first approach. Every city’s needs are different, so the organization helps local governments create plans that are achievable, measurable, and affordable. They connect cities with technical assistance, funding opportunities, and peer networks—so that progress isn’t limited to political party or geography.

“These efforts unite people because they deliver tangible benefits: lower energy costs, healthier neighborhoods, and new opportunities for small businesses,” said Michael Roberts, senior program officer for McKnight’s Midwest Climate & Energy program. “Power a Clean Future Ohio shows what’s possible when communities come together around shared values of economic vitality and local resilience so their residents have a direct stake in building a more prosperous future. When we invest in clean energy locally, we invest in the economic and civic strength of Ohio.”

According to PCFO’s Executive Director, Joe Flarida, even when there are barriers at the state or federal level, local leaders are proving that Ohio can keep moving forward. “This work continues because it matters to Ohioans—they want clean air, good jobs, and a healthy future.”

Clean Energy Means Good Jobs and Healthy Communities

Clean energy isn’t just about cutting pollution—it’s a growing economic powerhouse. In 2024, clean energy and clean vehicle jobs in Ohio reached more than 121,000, growing much faster than the state’s overall economy.

Those jobs are in everything from installing solar panels, wind turbines, and heat pumps to manufacturing electric vehicles and efficient appliances. They’re helping to keep young workers in the state and making communities more competitive for new business investment.

On top of economic benefits, local clean energy projects are making Ohio healthier. Cities, towns and counties are working on community-driven projects that reduce pollution while improving quality of life—especially for those most affected by unhealthy air and rising energy costs. From electric vehicle programs to energy waste reduction and from renewable electricity to sustainable land use, PCFO supports projects that create cleaner air, lower bills, and create safer neighborhoods for all Ohioans.

Hope for Ohio’s Future

While state and federal politics can be divisive, PCFO shows that clean energy can unite communities. Local leaders of all political stripes agree that investing in clean power makes sense for jobs, for public health, and for the next generation.

As Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther puts it, “We know that Ohio’s economy runs through Ohio cities, so the impact that mayors and local leaders can have in fighting climate change and building more resilient communities—the power’s in our hands, we just have to take it.”

PCFO’s growing network of communities is living proof that real progress doesn’t always start at the top—it starts at home, with leaders willing to act. “We are inspired by the ever-growing momentum of local leaders in Ohio choosing to take action to advance affordable, clean energy and resilience,” said John Mitterholzer, program director for Climate and Environmental Justice at the George Gund Foundation. “The work PCFO does is critical and indispensable. It’s a national model for how cities can collaborate and have an enormous impact with the right kind of support.”

Nearly half of all Ohioans now live in a PCFO member community, a fact that has Flarida feeling optimistic about the state’s progress. “The clean energy economy is here to stay,” says Flarida. “Ohioans understand what’s at stake. Together, we’re building a brighter, cleaner future for everyone.”",https://www.mcknight.org/wp-content/uploads/pcfo-toledo-solar-tour.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:13.960438

Resources have been developed for caucus members to raise awareness of the Albanese government's proposal to overhaul the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in hopes of either spurring ""good faith"" negotiations, or casting their political opponents as a ""blockers"" of sound reforms.

Following a similar blueprint to last term where the Greens were painted as ""wreckers"" for refusing to back an earlier iteration of a proposal to establish a national Environment Protection Agency (EPA), and delaying the Housing Australia Future Fund, Labor insiders believe their tactics will pay electoral dividends in 2028.

But the Greens remain unfazed, casting Labor's move as a desperate play to disguise that its laws ""weaken"" environmental protections.

As part of the campaign, Labor has launched an ""EPA now"" website where Australians can fill out a quick form to send their local senator an email urging them to back the environment reforms, with more than 5,000 people doing so already.

The party also held one of its biggest ever online branch meetings, which was attended by more than 800 members online.

While more than 20 backbench MPs from around the country are participating in a campaign to get the government's message out to voters in must-hold electorates in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth.

In the Brisbane seat of Griffith, Labor MP Renee Coffey has been doorknocking and holding mobile offices.

""We need modern environment laws — with an independent EPA — to hold corporations to account, stop further habitat destruction, and make it is easier to sustainably build new homes and generate cheaper electricity,"" she said.

""All of that is at risk if the Greens don't negotiate in good faith with the government, support this reform and work with us to create environmental laws fit for our time.""

Ms Coffey's high-profile defeat of Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather at the 2025 election has been attributed in part to community unhappiness with the minor party blocking or delaying Labor's reforms last term.

Reid MP Sally Sitou has been taking meetings with her Sydney community and hosted a Webinar attended by Environment Minister Murray Watt.

""There is an overwhelming recognition that the current laws aren't working,"" she said.

""The community wants us to be ambitious and wants us to get these reforms through.""

In the neighbouring seat of Bennelong, Labor's Jerome Laxale said the feedback in his community was the need to change environment laws.

""At street stalls and community events that I've held, even the most environmentally conscious community members are not taking the Greens' position that the status quo is better than the new laws,"" he said.

""People want the reforms to be as strong as possible, but at the end of the day they want us to pass them.

""That's a message the Greens could listen to.""

Assistant Climate Change and Energy Minister Josh Wilson said there was strong interest in his community in the changes, rejecting the idea Western Australians were disinterested in protecting the environment.

Mr Wilson said the current proposal delivered ""big positive changes,"" like increasing penalties, compliance and improving national standards to benefit the environment.

""That doesn't mean we can't have a conversation about where it can be improved further. Let's have that conversation, but let's have it in good faith,"" he said.

""If the starting point isn't that what's been put forward isn't already a momentous improvement to existing laws, that's a position I struggle to understand.""

But Greens' environment spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young has argued Labor's laws were an attempt to win over the Coalition, rather than the environmental party.

""If this was a package that was designed with us as the preferred partner, they'd be closing the loopholes and protecting the environment,"" she said earlier this week.

A Greens insider said Labor ""can't act surprised"" the party and environment groups did not want to ""weaken"" protections for nature.

""Labor thought they could sneak past new laws that fast track coal and gas mines, and they're on the defensive now. Watt's been caught out,"" they said.

They pointed to the criticism of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has been vocal on social media with posts insisting the proposed reforms ""can't be the ones that become law"".

Other groups like the Lock the Gate Alliance have also launched campaigns online critical of Labor's proposal.

Mr Watt said, once established, Australia's first national EPA would be a ""landmark moment"" for the country and something the community had been calling for over the past decade.

""It's time to get this done,"" he said.

""When I've been out talking to people about these reforms, what I've heard more than anything else is that Australians want the environment protected for future generations to enjoy.""

Mr Watt said it was up to the Greens and Coalition to decide if they wanted to support the important work, or ""block it from happening as they have before"".",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/db542573af6ff0b3dd26026d6abbc0e3?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=4860&cropW=8641&xPos=0&yPos=451&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-01 19:59:10.027506

While the two natural gas units are being built, the Cayuga coal plants, which are nearly 60 years old, could be operational.
Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke Energy Indiana, said the financing will ultimately save customers more than $812 million over the new plant’s lifetime.
Protegere said a condition of the settlement is that it will not affect the operation of the natural gas units, the cost or the schedule.
“There’s an enormous amount of emissions related to the extraction, the transportation, the storage, the combustion of natural gas,” Olson said, “so let’s not kid ourselves.","Duke Energy ratepayers will see an increase in their monthly bill starting next year after the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Wednesday approved a $3.3 billion plan by Duke Energy Indiana to replace its two coal-powered units at the Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas units, an effort the utility company maintains is necessary to meet growing energy demands.

The ruling was the result of a months-long battle at IURC public hearings between Duke and opponents who expressed concern about the environmental and financial effects of Duke’s proposal, which will commission a feasibility study examining whether the coal plants should be sold to a third party and kept running.

Under the IURC’s ruling — and Indiana state statute — Duke will receive clean energy incentives as the company builds the new natural gas units.

A 2023 law allows utility companies to use what is known as “Construction Work in Progress” to charge customers for natural gas projects gradually while the project is still being built. The measure is meant to avoid sudden rate increases upon the project’s completion, but also reduces financing costs for utility companies. While the two natural gas units are being built, the Cayuga coal plants, which are nearly 60 years old, could be operational.

Angeline Protogere, a spokesperson for Duke Energy Indiana, said the financing will ultimately save customers more than $812 million over the new plant’s lifetime. But consumer advocacy groups predict customers could see increases of at least $20 per month by 2031, when the two gas units are complete.

Combined with orders from national and state leadership prioritizing coal for energy production, the approval means the public ultimately loses, said Kerwin Olson, executive director Citizens Action Coalition, which intervened in the case. “We are extremely disappointed in this order,” Olson said. “This order from the commission only stands to exacerbate the affordability crisis that faces your consumers today. Duke pretty much got everything they asked for.”

MEETING THE ENERGY DEMAND

The Cayuga Station, located in Vermillion County, first went into service in 1970 and is the oldest coal-fired plant in Duke’s Indiana network.

With a current capacity of around 1,000 megawatts, Protogere said the two natural gas units will add 470 megawatts more for a total capacity of 1,470, a necessary expansion given the units’ age and limits as they approach retirement in 2029 and 2030. Since the last major power plant was added to the Hoosier system in 2013, Protogere said, Duke has acquired about 126,000 new customers.

“That includes everything from homes to small businesses to manufacturers and industries,” Protogere said. “So we will now be able to increase the amount of power generation there on site at Cayuga to meet the rising demand.”

On top of adding new customers, utility companies around the nation are grappling with how to meet energy demands as artificial intelligence data centers continue to boom, making it difficult to predict how much power they will need to ensure reliability in their service areas.

The Cayuga plan is just one way Duke is responding to the demand for more energy. According to a September filing with the IURC, Duke purchased 470 megawatts of additional capacity to serve customers ahead of summer 2025, and the company is projected to come close to falling below requirements in 2030.

“We are seeing growth in our system since 2013,” Protogere said, “and we have an obligation to meet that increased demand for power.”

President Donald Trump in April also issued an executive order to support and increase coal production across the nation, a sentiment that Indiana Gov. Mike Braun shared in an executive order of his own directing Indiana to consider extending the life of every coal plant in the state.

The regulatory approval includes a settlement with Reliable Energy, Inc., an Indiana-based trade association representing the state’s major coal producers, for the study that could transfer operation of the Cayuga units to an outside party. When Duke initially filed its proposal in June, REI opposed, but later agreed to support Duke’s request to build the power plants in exchange for the study, which must be completed within eight months.

“Duke Energy’s exploration of selling its coal units to an independent third party represents a significant step toward Gov. Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply,” REI President Savannah Kerstiens wrote in a statement.

“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online.”

The filing details required elements of the study, a request for proposals and bidding and a negotiations and due diligence period. Protegere said a condition of the settlement is that it will not affect the operation of the natural gas units, the cost or the schedule. Duke will wait to proceed on demolition of the coal plants during the request for proposals process, and will not close them before 2029.

DECISION UNFAIR TO RATEPAYERS, GROUPS SAY

Several environmental and customer advocacy groups have strongly opposed Duke’s proposal since June. Two public field hearings were held in April in Bloomington and Terre Haute, where advocates like Olson of the Citizen’s Action Committee and nonprofit Vote Solar expressed frustration and filed testimony, leaving the IURC with final say.

The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents the interests of utility customers, recommended against the plan in May, citing affordability concerns, ever-changing environmental regulations and technological advancements, according to testimony documents. The OUCC suggested alternatives, like continuing to operate the Cayuga coal units or refueling them with natural gas.

“After the IURC issues an order, the OUCC begins extensive legal and technical review,” OUCC Director of External Affairs Olivia Rivera told the News and Tribune in an email. “The order is 80 pages, and our staff has begun the review process, which will take time. I can not offer additional information or comment at this time as I must allow staff to continue their review.”

Protogere of Duke said the rate increase will hit consumers in six-month increments over the construction of the natural gas units, helping smooth out the rate impact so the plant is paid for over many years.

“Rather acquiring the required [power] then, than investing and incurring interest charges that are then compounding,” she said. “By paying as you go, you reduce those financing charges.”

Olson said customers have already seen significant increases in monthly electric bills year over year, citing the $395 million increase requested by Duke and approved by the IURC in January. With people already struggling to get by on a daily basis in today’s economy, Olson said, Wednesday’s decision will shift the risks of the facility’s construction onto people who cannot afford it.

“What ratepayers will see are periodic filings from Duke Energy where they will be seeking cost recovery for expenses recurred to date,” Olson said. “Initially, customers will see a small bill impact – 50 cents, a dollar.”

But those costs will grow over time as construction continues, he said, and ratepayers could see bills go up $20 or more. Protegere said she could not give a specific estimate as to what the first six-month increase might be, but said Duke predicts a 5.4% overall increase during construction years.

What’s more, Olson said, is that natural gas is not as environmentally-friendly as utility companies tout. While natural gas does emit a lower level of carbon dioxide, it still, like coal plants, creates pollution that contributes to global warming. Olson said he thinks oil, gas and utility industries are “very good at PR” advertising natural gas as clean when it isn’t.

“There’s an enormous amount of emissions related to the extraction, the transportation, the storage, the combustion of natural gas,” Olson said, “so let’s not kid ourselves. While it may have fewer emissions than coal, it has emissions that are harmful to public health and our environment and have a negative impact on the climate crisis.”

He said cleaner and cheaper alternatives exist in the way of wind and solar energy, and the CAC filed testimony with a “no-regrets” strategy emphasizing the value of clean energy options that would lead to better outcomes for customers and society.

“What we see is an emphasis on wealth creation for the few at the expense of the many,” he said. “We can have our disagreements over what resources we should be using to power the grid, but there should be no disagreement about who can afford to pay for this stuff and finance this stuff, and it is certainly not your everyday, average Hoosier.”

That being said, the IURC’s ruling was given on the basis Duke’s proposal satisfied Indiana’s required five pillars of energy policy — reliability, resilience, stability, affordability and environmental sustainability.

Olson said he does not see how a plan that will raise costs falls into those pillars.

“It should not be ratepayers funding this thing,” he said. “Part of our issue with this ruling is how the state of Indiana is allowing this thing to be financed, and they’re allowing this thing to be financed on the backs of ratepayers.”

Protegere reiterated the Cayuga project was determined to be the right solution for meeting the needs of demand across the state, balancing the need for consistent service with cost and environmental regulations.

“This is a way to do it efficiently with natural gas units, but also gradually spread out the rate impacts over a number of years.”

Nextracker holds a strong market position in the solar industry

Nextracker provides integrated solar tracking systems and related solutions for solar projects across the world. Its primary product is a pivoting base that enables solar panels to follow the sun's movement across the sky, optimizing performance and getting the most energy out of daylight. Panels mounted on its single-axis solar trackers can generate up to 25% more energy than non-tracking solar panels.

Nextracker is the top tracker provider in the world, with leading positions in North America and Latin America, and a 26% global market share.

From this position of competitive strength, Nextracker is evolving from a single product supplier into a diversified solar power platform company. It's doing so by acquiring and developing adjacent technologies, which will allow it to lower costs for customers and accelerate construction timelines. Management believes its non-tracker products and services sales could grow to provide more than one-third of the company's total revenue in the next five years.

Investors got more regulatory clarity

When the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" was first introduced in Congress, solar investors were nervous about the mixed signals it sent on energy policy. On the one hand, it offered major infrastructure and industrial incentives, but on the other, it seemed fossil fuels might benefit more from tax breaks and regulatory relief.

When the final details came out, the bill turned out to be ""better than feared"" for the solar industry, according to JPMorgan analyst Mark Strouse. Some key aspects of previously established law that supported solar energy were left intact, including some investment tax credits. That said, Congress and the president did sharply curtail the duration and accessibility of some of those clean energy tax credits and incentives, and added new compliance hurdles for companies that want to make use of them.

Growing demand for energy could be a tailwind for Nextracker

Nextracker's opportunity will come from the growing demand for clean energy to power tomorrow's technologies. While many hyperscalers and investors have focused on nuclear power, which is coming back into favor, Nextracker's solar power solutions could benefit as companies seek a variety of carbon-neutral solutions to meet their growing energy needs.

According to the International Energy Agency(IEA), solar power is on track to become the largest source of renewable electricity worldwide in just a few years. Not only does it provide clean energy at competitive prices, but solar arrays can be deployed quickly compared to other energy sources, meeting demand in the near term -- not five years from now.

Improvements in energy storage systems and their widening use could be a massive tailwind for Nextracker as well. Management describes solar and storage as an ""unbeatable"" combination. That optimistic view is well founded. In the company's fiscal second quarter (which ended Sept. 26), its backlog -- signed customer orders for its solar tracking systems and related technologies awaiting fulfillment -- reached a record $5 billion.

That deep backlog and the company's large project portfolio provide it with revenue visibility and reduce the uncertainty it faces due to the current U.S. policy backdrop. Management noted that a high percentage of projects in its U.S. backlog have safe harbor status that locks in their eligibility for key tax credits and incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Is Nextracker a buy?

Energy demand is on the rise, and Nextracker is a stock that may be overlooked in this sector. With a forward-price-to-earnings ratio of 21, the stock appears reasonably priced, particularly when compared to some other alternative energy providers that are trading at sky-high valuations.

Nextracker remains vulnerable in the current political landscape, especially given that some tax credits and incentives intended to support clean energy have been curtailed. That said, Nextracker continues to provide solutions that help address America's growing energy demands, and its fair valuation provides investors with some cushion, which is why I think it could be a good stock buy today.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840036/engineers-walk-beside-rows-of-solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 19:59:22.917228

Virginians need to raise their voices and make clear they don’t want to pay higher prices for dirtier energy.","President Donald Trump stormed back into the White House on a campaign focused on costs. Part of his argument was a pledge to “cut your energy prices in half within 12 months.” As we close in on that mark, energy prices are rising at more than twice the overall rate of inflation. Average electricity rates in Virginia were up 11.3% year over year as of July.

Since taking office, Trump has used every lever of power available to disadvantage cleaner, cheaper energy and prop up and promote the accelerated burning of fossil fuels.

The first eight months of this administration have seen an all-out assault on clean energy. Legislatively, it includes the repeal of tax credits that both spurred clean energy development and deployment and provided relief to consumers and businesses. On the regulatory front, it has involved extraordinary actions by the departments of the Interior, Energy, Treasury and Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency to hinder clean energy and promote fossil fuel use.

Iowans draw more than 60% of their power from wind energy and have among the lowest utility bills in the country. Yet on a visit to a national lab there, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright tried to argue that wind energy is unreliable and expensive. The assembled dignitaries and elected officials, all Republicans, weren’t having it, and the secretary begrudgingly acknowledged that Iowa has benefitted from its long-term investment in wind energy. Still, federal actions continue to impede the offshore wind industry in Virginia.

In parallel, the Trump administration is actively looking to extend the life of dirty, uncompetitive coal power plants, recently announcing $625 million in subsidies for these plants. This handout is a triple whammy: Taxpayers will pay for the subsidy itself, ratepayers will see higher electric bills — Energy Innovation notes that 99% of the U.S. coal fleet is more expensive to keep running than new cheaper, cleaner renewables — and we will all bear the pollution and climate impacts.

Blocking clean energy takes affordable options off the table at a time when Virginians are facing substantial electric bills. Clean energy offers some of the most affordable — and fastest ways — to provide new electric power. Last year, 93% of newly generated energy capacity that came online last year came from wind, solar and storage. According to a new analysis by Politico of U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the majority of states leaning heavily into wind and solar have lower electricity prices, and roughly half of these states are showing power bill increases below the national average.

But the Trump administration and its allies in state governments are actively restricting the supply of affordable, clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes. They’re freezing the permitting for wind projects, cutting clean energy tax credits, slowing down wind and solar on federal lands, and more — all while propping up dirty, outdated, costly fossil fuel plants.

The Center for American Progress’ analysis found that in 41 states and the District of Columbia, utilities had requested rate increases, which, if approved, will drive utility bills higher still. Utilities in Virginia have already requested rate increases five times for the 2025-2026 period.

In a recent survey for the Searchlight Institute, voters were asked to name the three monthly expenses that put the most strain on their household budget. Some 63% of respondents named utility bills — higher than any other category including groceries, housing and health care.

Are the fish safe to eat? Are the animals who live in the water getting sick? What are the new innovations for keeping the Bay and its tributaries healthy? How can art help environmentalists think more creatively? These are some of the questions addressed at the State of the San Francisco Estuary Conference, which was held this week at Oakland’s Scottish Rite Center.

The event was organized by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership, a regional collaborative of government agencies, nonprofits and community groups that work to protect and restore the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. It is one of 28 estuary partnerships across the country established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and funded by Congress.

According to SFEP Director Caitlin Sweeney, the partnership program has been funded through the year and has broad bipartisan support.

Each year’s conference opens with a progress report. Sweeney delivered a summary in front of a projected color-coded scorecard.

The report evaluates the health of the estuary in 24 indicators grouped into five categories — clean water, quality of habitat, resiliency of ecological processes, flourishing wildlife and public health.

“Here’s the 2025 scorecard,” Sweeney said. “As you can see, red and yellow predominate, meaning that most of these indicators are in fair or poor condition.”

Jay Davis, program director with the San Francisco Estuary Institute, a data-collecting scientific organization that monitors the Bay, began with a reminder of progress.

“Prior to the Clean Water Act of 1972 and other environmental regulations of the 1970s, the Bay and its shoreline were a dumping ground for minimally treated sewage, industrial wastewater, polluted runoff and solid waste,” said Davis. “With the passage of environmental laws, water quality showed a stunning improvement within 15 years, but the rate of overall progress has slowed in the past 30 years.”

“Is the Bay safe for swimming? The condition is good and holding steady,” he said, meaning that the water is clean enough for recreational use.

“Are fish safe to eat? The overall assessment is fair, but things have been steady and not changing,” Davis said, blaming the historic presence of mercury and industrial toxins as the main reasons that estuary fish are not entirely safe for human consumption.

Striped bass are popular for consumption and the main indicator species for mercury, he said, adding their health rating has hovered between fair and poor for the last 50 years.

Is the estuary safe for aquatic life, like birds and salmon?

“Water quality is fair and shows no change,” he said.

Concentrations of nutrients like fertilizer are higher in the Delta regions and put other parts of the estuaries at risk for harmful algal blooms, he said. But a proactive, massive initiative is underway to spend billions of dollars to upgrade our regional wastewater treatment plants to reduce nutrient inputs.

Not all algal blooms are toxic, but bad outbreaks of blue-green algae in warm waters can generate cyanotoxins, which can make people and animals ill when inhaled or touched.

Changes in the amount of cool fresh water that flows into the Bay from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are one of the strongest indicators of overall health.

“Based on the amount of fresh water that actually flows into the bay each year, the estuary has been for decades experiencing chronic man-made drought conditions,” said independent consultant Christina Swanson.

“The [water quality] index declined from generally good conditions to fair conditions during the 1940s and early 1950s, reflecting the construction and operations of dams and ramped up water diversions from the Bay’s rivers and the Delta,” she said.

Swanson said 2006 was the last year with good conditions, and since then conditions have been poor in more than three quarters of all years.

The political perspective was delivered by David Lewis, executive director of Save The Bay, the area’s largest regional estuary advocacy organization. Lewis was presented with the SFEP Jean Auer Award for his significant contribution to the cause.

“We all know the challenges today are daunting,” Lewis said in his acceptance speech. “Ocean warming and acidification threatens the whole marine food web. With sea level rise, our wetlands will flood our communities within decades. And our 50-year-old environmental laws, like the California Environmental Quality Act, Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, are insufficient for what is facing us. They don’t help us speed up protection of environment and public safety from climate threats, floods and extreme storms, fires and droughts and rightly should be modernized.”

After the ceremony, Lewis said in an interview that the Trump administration has acted vindictively by targeting San Francisco Bay and California for cuts.

“The good news is that Californians passed a $10 billion climate bond last year in November, and one billion of that is for coastal resilience,” he said. “We were wise to pass measure AA in 2016 which has provided steady funding from people who live here.”

Measure AA generates about $25 million a year specifically for tidal marsh restoration, he said. A tidal marsh is an area that floods and drains with the daily tides and is crucial for protecting shorelines, cleaning water and providing essential habitats for dabbling ducks and baby salmon.

Creative thinking

At the 2024 conference last year, it seemed to be raining money. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure bill had allotted $132 million for expanding and accelerating comprehensive plans created through the National Estuary Program, with underserved communities being the first to benefit. Any local community wanting to clean up their neighborhood creeks or restore native habitats could apply for a variety of state and county grants.

This year, the focus was on creative thinking.

Performance artist Diandra Marizet Esparza, delivered a keynote by reading interpretive prose from her journal and meditating on storytelling as a form of healing.

“When our sense of belonging is ruptured by politics, by migration, by storms and destruction, our stories can guide us back to a sense of hope,” she said.

An art exhibition in the main hall featured the Bay Clay Oyster Reef project by Daniel McCormick and Mary O’Brian. Their rock-like sculptures are made from heavy Bay silt. They are placed along the shoreline to promote the colonization of oyster beds that were wiped out by layers of silt released by mining practices in the Gold Rush era.

One of the most popular panels was all about Bokashi balls, a do-it-yourself organic chemical solution for improving water quality. Bokashi are golf ball-sized nuggets shaped by hand from a mixture of clay, wheat bran, wood ash and molasses. The final ingredient is beneficial microbials, pro-biotic bacteria commonly found in everyday items like yogurt that have digestive health benefits.

When the balls are dropped into dark waters, beneficial bacteria grow and out-competes the harmful bacteria found in pollutants and algae.

Cuauhtemoc Villa, who runs a youth engagement program in Portland, Oregon, said the use of effective microorganisms in organic farming was tested by chemical engineers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“They are microbes like you’ll find in lactic acid bacteria, that we know from pickling,” he said. “If you think of pickles, it keeps things from going pathogenic. It’s a clean freak.”

The panel was organized by Charlie Toledo, executive director of the Suscol Intertribal Council, who attributes the Bokashi balls with cleaning the Napa River. Toledo reminded the audience that modern restoration practices can be done at the community level, just like pre-European forms of land management.

“[California] was not a wilderness,” said Toledo. “It was a managed agricultural preserve. One of our elders had said a long time ago, every square inch of California was touched by human hands.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BCN-20251028-STATEOFESTUARY-05-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-01 18:58:21.082723

More than 1 billion pounds of pumpkins rot in U.S. landfills each year after Halloween, according to the Department of Energy.

Yours doesn’t have to go to waste. Experts told us your pumpkins can be eaten, composted or even fed to animals. Here’s how.

Cooking With Pumpkin Waste

If you’re carving a jack-o’-lantern, don’t throw away the skin or innards — every part is edible.

After carving, you can cube the excess flesh — the thick part between the outer skin and the inner pulp that holds the seeds — for soups and stews, said Carleigh Bodrug, a chef known for cooking with common food scraps.

You can also puree it and add a tablespoon to your dog’s dinner for extra nutrients. And pumpkin chunks can be frozen for future use.

“The seeds are a nutritional gold mine,” Bodrug said.

They’re packed with protein, magnesium, zinc and healthy fats, according to a 2022 study in the journal Plants.

One of Bodrug’s recipes involves removing the seeds, rinsing and roasting them with cinnamon for a crunchy snack or salad topper. Then you can use the stringy guts to make a pumpkin puree for muffins.

This version differs from canned purees in grocery stores — which typically use a different type of pumpkin or squash — because carving pumpkins have stringier innards and a milder flavor.

A carving pumpkin’s guts can still be used for baking — you’ll just have to amp up the seasoning to boost the flavor.

If you don’t want to eat your pumpkins, you can donate them to a local farm, which might use them to feed pigs, chickens and other animals.

Edible parts should be collected while you’re carving and before it’s painted, decorated or left on your porch for weeks. Paint and wax aren’t food-safe, and bacteria and mold can grow on the skin in outdoor climates.

Once you’ve cooked what you can and donated what’s safe to feed, composting the rest is the easiest way to keep it out of the landfill.

“That way, even though they’re not safe to eat, they can still give back to the earth,” Bodrug said.

Composting At Home Or Donating To A Farm

Composting pumpkins keeps them out of methane-emitting landfills and turns them into nutrient-rich soil instead. You can do this at home or drop them off at a local farm, compost collection bin or drop-off site.

“A large percentage of what ends up going to the landfill is stuff that could have been composted,” said Dante Sclafani, compost coordinator at Queens County Farm in New York. “So, even just cutting down something like pumpkins could really help curb how many garbage bags you’re putting out every week.”

Before composting, remove any candles, plastic, glitter, or other decorations — they can contaminate the compost.

A little glitter or paint won’t ruin the pile, but it’s best to get it as clean as possible before tossing it in. Then, chop up the pumpkin in 1-inch pieces so it can break down easier.

“Pumpkins are full of water, so it’s important to maintain a good balance of dried leaves, wood chips, sawdust, shredded newspaper, cardboard, straw — anything that’s a dry organic material— in your compost bin,” Sclafani said.

If you don’t maintain this balance, your compost might start to stink.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, a healthy compost pile should include a mix of “greens” — like pumpkin scraps and food waste — and “browns” like dry leaves, straw or cardboard, in roughly a three-to-one ratio. That balance helps the pile break down faster and prevents odors.

And if your pumpkin’s been sitting on the porch all month? That’s actually ideal.

“It’s never too far gone for compost,” Sclafani said. “Even if it’s mushy or moldy, that actually helps, because the fungus speeds up decomposition.”

“Composting anything organic is better than throwing it out because you’re not creating more refuse in landfills, you’re not creating methane gas,” said Laura Graney, the farm’s education director.

Graney said autumn on the farm is the perfect opportunity to teach kids about composting since it gives them a sense of power in the face of big environmental challenges.

“Even though they’re little, composting helps them feel like they can make a difference,” Graney said. “They take that message home to their families, and that’s how we spread the word.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/6HiQFo3_FCiWCAQ6ehbit6T_1Yk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/7TACW4XB4ZGXJH6IW3FOZSQBUU.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 23:03:23.995932

Joseph “Joey” Wender, SHLB’s executive director, said the coalition had begun drafting a new three-to-five-year strategic plan focused on expanding its impact. “Momentum was on our side,” he said, citing the Supreme Court in Federal Communications Commission v. Consumers’ Research, in which SHLB participates, and new partnerships.

Cindy Aden, program chair at the University of Washington Information School, led the planning workshop and urged attendees to identify new audiences and measurable outcomes to guide SHLB’s next phase of advocacy.

SHLB is uniquely positioned to connect broadband policy to real-world access gaps, she said. “How could we talk about AI in education if students still didn’t have the connectivity they need to learn?”

Panelists said SHLB’s next chapter should emphasize outreach to smaller, rural, and under-resourced institutions.

One participant from West Texas described towns of just 700 to 11,000 residents where limited broadband access left students unfamiliar with modern workplace technology and disconnected from industry standards. Aden and others said those realities, where geography dictated opportunity, had to be reflected in federal and state broadband policy, not treated as anecdotal gaps.

From expansion to preservation

Kristen Corra, policy counsel at SHLB, said the coalition’s policy environment had shifted since the Biden administration, moving from expansion to preservation. “A few years ago, we were modernizing: adding hotspots, Wi-Fi on buses, and pushing future-focused rules,” she said. “Now we’re fighting to sustain what was built.”

Still, she said SHLB’s advocacy remained strong, pointing to durable partnerships with state broadband offices, anchor institutions, and education groups that “keep the mission alive, even as the funding climate changes.”

Philip Neufeld, executive officer for strategic research at the Fresno Unified School District, said practical resources, such as shared templates, case studies, and baseline connectivity standards would help small districts advocate more effectively at local school boards.

The West Texas participant added that “when you have clear benchmarks, you gain confidence in front of the school board, and confidence drives investment.”

Wender closed the session by urging members to continue sharing data and stories that link connectivity and measurable outcomes.

While some networks carry heavy environmental and social costs, Algorand was designed from the ground up to be energy‑efficient, resilient and ready for real‑world scale.

Its single‑layer, quantum‑secure architecture delivers instant finality, consistently high throughput and low fees, capabilities that make verifiable traceability, carbon accounting and renewable‑energy tokenisation practical for modern supply chains.

Sustainability in this context means combining strong security and scale with the smallest possible environmental footprint.

Algorand minimises energy use while enabling builders to meet robust standards for transparency and user rights, key requirements for audit‑ready provenance and chain‑of‑custody solutions.

The Algorand Foundation steers ecosystem growth, maintaining core infrastructure and technical standards, supporting entrepreneurs, enabling decentralised governance and offering a best‑in‑class developer environment where teams can build in familiar languages such as Python.

Founded in 2019 by Turing Award‑winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, Algorand now supports a vibrant community of developers, enterprises and millions of retail users drawn to low fees and instant settlement.

Marc Vanlerberghe, Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer, who helped launch Android at Google, drives institutional adoption of a sustainable, future‑ready blockchain. Matt Keller, Head of Impact and Inclusion and former leader at the UN World Food Programme, One Laptop per Child and the Global Learning XPRIZE, forges partnerships that expand financial access, advance environmental sustainability and build community resilience.

Here, Marc and Matt share how Algorand is scaling sustainable blockchain to support transparent, high‑integrity supply chains and next‑generation carbon and renewable markets.

How is Algorand helping companies prove their sustainability?

Marc: Having verifiable, trusted sustainability programmes is key - and not just because many companies are under pressure from regulators and consumers to prove their sustainability claims.

Algorand helps by giving them a way to record data about their sustainability (from product origins to the supply chain’s footprint) on the blockchain, so their efforts are immutable, transparent and verifiable.

Supply chains can be fragmented and prone to fraud, making it hard to verify sustainability claims without a trusted digital infrastructure.

Algorand addresses that gap, ensuring data integrity (tamper-proof, time-stamped records) and giving consumers and regulators confidence that claims are accurate.

Algorand’s high throughput and reliability allow it to handle complex, high-volume supply chains on a global scale.

Because Algorand itself is carbon neutral, businesses can rely on a platform that aligns with their sustainability commitments and ESG goals.

Matt: Some of the companies building on Algorand include Wholechain, which uses Algorand to provide end-to-end traceability for supply chains in industries like seafood and personal care.

Every step of a product’s journey is immutably recorded, helping prove ethical sourcing, authenticity and sustainability.

Another one is Finboot, which works with major enterprises, including those in the oil and gas industry, to integrate blockchain into their supply chain management.

This helps track raw materials and processes, providing a verifiable record of sustainability practices across industrial sectors.

Can Algorand help with carbon reduction projects?

Marc: Transparent carbon monitoring (and transparent carbon markets) are one piece of the puzzle to reducing carbon emissions, but many existing systems are siloed.

Algorand helps companies record verified emissions data in real time on the blockchain.

And by combining blockchain with Internet of Things (IoT) devices and AI, projects can automate monitoring, reduce costs and make verification more reliable.

This creates opportunities for both enterprises and households (usually excluded from these markets) to participate in carbon markets, turning emission reductions into credits that can be applied toward income or energy payments.

Algorand's speed, low fees and efficiency make it possible to scale these kinds of carbon markets.

The Algorand Foundation also shows this in practice by offsetting its own footprint every year through ClimateTrade, a marketplace built on Algorand.

An impressive example of this is Ureca, which uses Algorand with IoT and machine learning to verify carbon reduction projects.

Emissions data is collected and logged on Algorand in real time, creating trusted records for investors, regulators and communities.

The platform enables households and enterprises to measure emissions, generate credits and apply them to bills or income.

Can Algorand help people access renewable energy?

Marc: Absolutely.

The tokenisation of renewables is what makes them more accessible to everyone, no matter where they live.

Many people cannot, for example, install rooftop solar because they live in apartments or in restricted buildings.

Tokenisation on Algorand makes renewable energy accessible to them - meaning they can benefit from renewable energy projects - without having the direct infrastructure.

Tokenisation allows you to create a fungible or non-fungible token version of an asset. These tokens then represent fractional ownership of an asset like solar or wind farms.

This model creates inclusion in the green transition and makes clean energy more widely available.

Enel, one of the largest energy utilities in the world, partnered with Conio to launch the EBITTS project on the Algorand blockchain.

The project tokenises Enel’s renewable assets, allowing consumers to purchase “Energy Utility Tokens” representing fractional ownership in solar and wind plants.

Marc: Other chains are also progressing on this front, but one obstacle remains: how well these other blockchains can scale.

As they get more traffic and add more computers to their network, that means more compute power (and electricity) is required.

One way blockchain can continue to be more conscious is to make its hardware requirements lighter (like that of Algorand) and to take actions like purchasing offsets, so any existing carbon footprint is managed.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5105962ba4d0d85d59287ab4a8cb94b2:98f49f5d0bac1cfcf9afd85d87f254d5/algorand-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 01:18:12.480844

ExxonMobil Chemical Limited has been fined £176,000 after pleading guilty to breaching its environmental permit during a six-day flaring event at its Cowdenbeath site in April 2019. The flaring caused significant disruption to the local community with residents describing the noise as “like a jet engine”. It led to over 900 complaints, the highest ever recorded for a single environmental event in Scotland.

The conviction follows an extensive regulatory investigation involving our specialist regulatory, technical, scientific and enforcement staff, which resulted in referral to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) in July 2020.

Our investigation found that:

Smoke emissions exceeded legal limits for 110 minutes, more than seven times the permitted 15-minute duration.

Noise pollution was significant, confirmed by monitoring in the community and resident statements.

Existing contingency plans weren’t followed to a high enough standard.

Poor maintenance, a lack of understanding of the site’s steam balance, and outdated risk analyses contributed to the incident.

Through our regulatory requirements, the company has since made major investments to reduce future flaring, including installing low-noise flare tips and upgrading steam systems. We’ll keep monitoring compliance to ensure lasting improvements and real benefits for the community.

Scottish household stats: small gains, big opportunities in recycling

Scotland’s household waste statistics, published this week, show a slight increase in recycling rates. In total, 44.3% of household waste was recycled in 2024. However, over half of what goes in general bins could still be recycled, including food waste, paper, cardboard and plastics.

Each person generated 0.42 tonnes of waste last year, with 0.19 tonnes recycled, 0.05 tonnes landfilled, and the rest diverted, mostly through incineration. While landfill use continues to decline (down 82.5% since 2011), incineration rose by 37.6% from 2023.

The carbon impact of household waste was 5.31 million tonnes CO₂e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent), a 21.5% reduction since 2011, demonstrating the environmental benefits of recycling and waste reduction.

Small changes at home can make a big difference. By recycling more and wasting less, households can play a part in reducing emissions and supporting Scotland’s transition to a circular economy.

CEO focus: shaping the future of our environment

Nicole Paterson, our Chief Executive, has set out an ambitious, customer-focused programme of transformation that will enhance how we protect and improve the environment for the communities of Scotland.

Scotland’s environment doesn’t exist in isolation to global changes, technological advances and societal interests. To be dynamic and future focused it's important that we stay ahead of developments, collaborate, listen and influence.

This month, Nicole shares some personal highlights from October, offering a glimpse into how she’s championing this transformation and shaping our journey forward.

I started this month at the Scottish Parliament, sharing how SEPA are delivering for Scotland. The informal drop-in session gave MSPs, researchers and parliamentary staff the opportunity to learn more about how we not only protect and improve the environment but are also supporting communities and business.

We covered everything from how we manage water scarcity to digital innovation in regulation and advanced technologies like AI and eDNA. Giving elected members and their teams more information on our work means they can better signpost to our services and use the outcomes in their own work to support people in Scotland.

As we saw through our VIBES Awards, Scotland’s businesses are really taking on the climate challenge and helping us move towards Net Zero. This year I’ve been a judge on the Institute of Directors (IoD) Scotland Director of the Year Award 2025 and had the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates and winners. At the award ceremony earlier this month, we celebrated the incredible leadership and innovation across Scotland’s business community.

As I mentioned previously, Scotland’s environment doesn’t exist in isolation and so engaging across national boundaries is really important to help us plan for the future, share best practice and tackle some of the biggest challenges of our time. This month I joined environment leaders from across Europe at the 44th EPA Network Plenary, hosted by our counterparts Natural Resources Wales.

Despite the sobering insights from the European Environment Agency’s 2025 State of the Environment Report, the energy and innovation in the room were palpable. I was honoured to take part in a panel led by the European Commission on Simplification, sharing SEPA’s progress on implementing the Integrated Authorisation Framework through the Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018, which will see businesses benefit from streamlined, easier to understand regulations and our work focus on activities that can cause the most risk to our environment.

On Wednesday I was back in the Scottish Parliament, this time in a more formal setting at the Public Audit Committee contributing to the discussion on flood resilience in Scotland, which we play a vital role in helping the nation to prepare for, respond to and recover from flooding.

Building a future where Scotland’s environment and communities can thrive.

We have a leading role to play in making sure we are not only responding to today’s environmental challenges but actively shaping tomorrow’s solutions. How we deliver this and shape our plans involves all of us - our partners, our stakeholders and communities across Scotland. Through leadership, innovation and collaboration, we’re building a future where Scotland’s environment and communities can thrive.

Leading the way for Boards across Scotland

Lisa Tennant, as Chair of the Agency Board, is a leader not only for our organisation but also for fellow Chairs and Board members across Scotland. This month Lisa led the inaugural Chair Circle, a new initiative designed to support and strengthen the leadership of Boards across the public, private, and third sectors. The network enables Chairs to be dynamic leaders in a fast-changing world by sharing insights and discussing the opportunity of transformation from tools like AI and digital innovation.

Scotland slowly recovering from water scarcity

As we move into more unsettled and typically autumnal weather, our latest water scarcity report shows conditions are gradually improving but parts of the north and east have not yet recovered.

The length of time that rivers have been at low flows shows the accumulated impact of dry conditions over recent months. We’re continuing to monitor the situation closely and encourage water users to follow guidance based on local scarcity levels. Weekly reports and the Drought Risk Assessment Tool (DRAT) are still available to help communities and businesses stay informed and manage resources responsibly.

Making use of scrap and end-of-life vehicles

Scrap and end-of-life vehicles are typically taken to dismantlers, scrap, salvage or breakers yards – more formally known as authorised treatment facilities (ATFs). The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) is offering a chance for these vehicles to be used one last time before they’re dismantled and recycled.

They need vehicles of various shapes and sizes to support training, demonstrations, and other operational needs throughout the country and are looking for suppliers.

Supported by the Suppliers Development Programme, a free webinar will talk interested suppliers through the process. Find out more information and register for a free account to join the webinar on the Suppliers Development Programme website.

The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.","BISMARCK, N.D. — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,"" said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. ""And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,"" he said, ""and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.""

Don’t be fooled into complacency, embrace the knowledge and foresight of your great Republican predecessors.","Dear Editor:

THE WIZARD OF OZ stood looking at today’s Republicans, as they made their pleas:

The Republican Lion said, “We have no more Courage. Please, can you help us?”

“It’s not that you have no courage, you’re just under a spell. You simply need to remember, you’re capable of greatness. One of the greatest acts of courage was made by your fellow Republican, Abraham Lincoln. Against bitter opposition, he did the right thing for the nation, honoring our founders’ declaration that ‘all men are created equal,’ and he freed the slaves with his brilliant Emancipation Proclamation. I’m awarding you with this Top Hat, Lincoln’s trademark object, to help you discover the courage within you.”

The Lion’s eyes opened wide, he put on the hat, and he said, “Yes, black lives REALLY DO matter!” The Wizard smiled, and said, “See? You’re on your way!”

The Tin Republican said, “What about ME? I have no HEART!”

The Wizard said, “It’s not that you have no heart, it’s that you’ve been mesmerized by greed and fear. You’ve forgotten your proud roots. Think back to 1986, when one of your great Republicans, Ronald Reagan, recognized our obligation to our fellow citizens, and he signed into law EMTALA, the law that instructs hospitals that they MUST treat all patients who come to them with serious problems, regardless of their ability to pay. Not only did Reagan see health care as a right due all citizens, but he also said, “I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.” So, Reagan granted immunity … AMNESTY … to MILLIONS of immigrants within our borders, knowing they were productive members of our society. Tin Republican, I’m awarding you this Reagan Cowboy Hat, so you might remember the HEART that once defined Republicans!”

The Tin Republican put on the hat, and said, “They are NOT eating our dogs! They are NOT eating our cats! They are our neighbors and friends!” The Wizard said, “There. Don’t you feel better?”

Then the Republican Scarecrow spoke up. “But I have no BRAIN! What can be done?”

The Wizard said, “It’s not that you have no brain. It’s that you’ve been led to believe in things that are not in your best interest by people who profit from your blind support. Think back to 1970, when one of your great Republicans CREATED the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Republicans back then recognized that human activity can create disastrous environmental problems, and that government has the obligation to protect our citizens. The EPA employed lots of great brains to address the many problems of environmental decline, and our air and water almost immediately became cleaner! Richard Nixon was that great Republican who applied his brain to address this serious national problem, and all citizens benefitted tremendously. I’m awarding you this PEN that Nixon used to sign the EPA into law.”

The Republican Scarecrow grasped the PEN, and said, “Global Climate Change is REAL! We NEED the EPA, and should absolutely NOT defund it!” The Wizard said, “That’s right. Don’t be fooled into complacency, embrace the knowledge and foresight of your great Republican predecessors. Reject those who would tell your brains and knowledge are BAD.”

Republican Dorothy said, “This new place we find ourselves is not good. We really should go HOME. There’s no place like it!”

The Wizard said, “AMEN!”

The grant, which was part of the 2021 Infrastructure Bill, accounted for 20% of the funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association's projects.

PAST COVERAGE: The list of clean energy grants, including in Oregon, Washington canceled by Trump admin.

Chris Green, president of the association, highlighted the impact, stating, ""We had a project that's going to use green hydrogen to make fertilizer. So you're displacing some of the natural gas and fossil-based products that go into fertilizer and creating a green product that has huge demand in Oregon and Washington and the Northwest, where we import all of our fertilizer currently from sometimes pretty far away places.""

The projects, spread across the Pacific Northwest, focus on producing, storing, transporting, and utilizing hydrogen in industries such as agriculture, transportation, and infrastructure.

While some projects may continue, others face setbacks. Green emphasized the importance of hydrogen in transitioning to clean energy and decarbonization, noting its role alongside solar, wind, batteries, and biofuels.

The cancellation has drawn criticism from U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, who described the decision as ""unprecedented and corrupt.""

She vowed to fight for the restoration of funds, emphasizing the potential loss of over 10,000 jobs across the region.

In late October, dozens of hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles were delivered from TAM Europe to Seoul, South Korea, and Vienna, Austria, the first batch of hydrogen-powered buses produced by the Slovenian manufacturer.

The company currently has an annual production capacity of 500 electric commercial vehicles. During the Paris Olympic Games, TAM Europe supplied 24 electric buses to Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport. Over the next three years, it plans to produce around 100 hydrogen-powered vehicles annually.

Founded in 1947, the Maribor Automobile Factory (TAM) was once renowned for producing trucks, trailers, and military vehicles. However, severe challenges amid market changes and economic restructuring eventually forced the company into bankruptcy in 2011.

After the infusion of Chinese investment and technology, production resumed in 2013, and the company retained its original brand. Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage. It has become a driving force in advancing green and sustainable urban transport through its hydrogen and electric buses.

The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM's new energy production line. The model integrates Hyundai's hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system. Emitting only water vapor during operation, it marked a major step forward in the decarbonization of urban mobility.

""Our breakthroughs in environmental protection and technology upgrading have been key to our entry into the high-end European market,"" said TAM Europe CEO Ma Fuxiong, adding that the rollout demonstrates the factory's sophisticated craftsmanship and lean management in complex new energy assembly.

""It fully embodies the forward-looking layout and strong cross-border collaboration driven by Chinese capital in global green technology and high-end manufacturing - a vivid example of how 'Chinese wisdom' connects with global resources,"" Ma added.

Li Minghai, vice president for technology and manufacturing at TAM, highlighted the transformation brought by Chinese investment. He said that through strategic investment and resource integration, this green manufacturing project has gained strong momentum in the heart of Europe.

""It ensures efficiency at every stage - from technology alignment and supply chain management to production implementation,"" Li said.

FuelCellsWorks, a professional platform for the hydrogen and fuel cell sector, analyzed in an article that the successful rollout carries dual significance: it consolidates TAM's position as a European hub for specialty vehicles and new energy manufacturing, while also exemplifying the deep integration and synergy between Chinese capital and European industrial capabilities in green technology.

Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna. Li said, ""Our brand recognition is growing steadily, with customers now across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.""

At present, the company employs nearly 200 local workers. It regularly sends local employees to its plant in China to learn new technologies, while Chinese technicians also visit the Slovenian plant to provide on-site guidance.

""This is not only the success of a company but also a testament to win-win cooperation in green development,"" Li added. ■",,N,,2025-11-01 16:18:59.152735

Arizona agencies estimate $44 million in savings by transitioning to electric vehicles

State and local agencies and governments are pushing forward with plans to convert fleet vehicles to electric and install public charging stations despite the federal government’s efforts to curtail electric vehicle mandates and expansion.

The Arizona Department of Transportation, along with cities and counties across the state, has either installed or plans to install charging stations on government-owned property and on highways to increase accessibility for electric vehicle owners.

Some cities and counties have also replaced aging government fleet vehicles with electric and hybrid vehicles, with plans to acquire more electric vehicles.

The agencies and municipalities have developed electric vehicle and infrastructure plans for public electric chargers even as President Donald Trump’s administration ended a tax credit program for new and used electric vehicles.

The Trump administration also temporarily paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program this summer, which provides money to states to install electric vehicle chargers, before resuming it.

The Arizona Department of Transportation is receiving $76.5 million from the program to eventually build up to 74 rapid-charging stations along the state’s highways.

ADOT recently announced it is seeking bids from private companies to build and operate 34 electric charging stations along Interstates 10 and 40, U.S. Routes 60, 89, 93 and 160, and state routes 64, 68, 80, 87, 90, 95, 260 and 347.

The department approved an initial round of charger locations in August 2024, totaling 18 stations along Interstates 8, 10, 17, 19 and 40.

All of the stations will be privately owned and operated, with the federal money covering up to 80% of the cost and the private developer paying for at least 20% of the eligible project costs, according to ADOT.

Although the state is primed to grow the number of charging stations, the number of drivers who purchased electric vehicles decreased in October after the expiration of the tax credits.

According to J.D. Power, electric vehicles accounted for 5.2% of vehicle sales down from almost 13% in September.

Despite the drop, there is still an incentive for consumers and governments to purchase electric vehicles due to an overall cost savings, said Diane Brown, executive director of Arizona Public Interest Research Group (Arizona PIRG), which has advocated for local governments to integrate electric vehicles into fleets.

“Momentum is on the side of transportation electrification. Arizona has seen businesses start up and employ individuals leading to good jobs, and drivers of EVs have noted financial savings, as well as benefits to air quality and public health,” Brown said.

The Arizona PIRG Education Fund, the Nature Conservancy in Arizona and Frontier Group estimate that state agencies can save about $44 million over the next decade by transitioning to electric vehicles.

Brown said electric vehicle registrations in the state have increased over the years and several of the state’s largest municipalities have doubled or tripled the total number of electric vehicles in their fleets.

The city of Phoenix’s fleet includes 100 electric vehicles across multiple departments and more than 400 charging ports that are open to city employees, fleet vehicles and the public, according to city officials.

“While recent federal and state policy changes have created uncertainty for local governments, Phoenix continues to move forward with its clean fleet and infrastructure goals as outlined in the Transportation Electrification Action Plan (TEAP) and Climate Action Plan (CAP),” according to a statement from the city.

The city plans to expand to 500 city-owned chargers and 200 electric vehicles in its fleet by 2030, according to the statement.

The city was also awarded $15 million through the federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support new charging sites, especially in underserved neighborhoods, but those funds remain on hold pending a federal review, according to the city.

“Our commitment to sustainability remains strong regardless of changes at the federal level. Investing in EV infrastructure not only helps improve air quality and public health but also supports long-term economic growth and resilience for Phoenix residents,” said Karen Apple, the electric vehicle program manager for the city of Phoenix.

The city of Tucson has 85 electric vehicles with plans to add six more, while Sun Tran, the city’s transit service, has 10 electric buses in service with 10 more planned, according to city officials.

Sun Tran also received support from Tucson Electric Power to install 10 electric bus chargers, according to TEP spokesman Joseph Barrios.

TEP has also supported the city of Tucson and Pima County through its electrification program, which advises and supports governments and agencies that are looking to transition their fleets to electric vehicles and install charging infrastructure, Barrios said.

Pima County currently operates 137 electric vehicles and plans to acquire 65 electric or hybrid vehicles over the next several years, said Pima County Services Director Leonard Boswell in a statement.

“For the current fiscal year, the focus will be on procuring hybrid vehicles, which aligns with our long-term strategy and does not alter our existing acquisition plan,” Boswell said.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2025/10/Electric-vehicles.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 15:58:56.045512

Back in the summer, the administration pulled $4 billion from the California high speed rail project. It followed up a month later by withdrawing another $175 million from the project. While these cuts alone won’t kill off the project, for which California voters have already approved tens of billions of funding through raising bond revenue, they do make it harder for the state to complete vital parts of the rail system. The federal dollars were being used for everything from building stations to constructing viaducts and railway bridges.

In 2019, when Donald Trump 1.0 attempted a similarly destructive maneuver against the high-speed rail system, California sued. Two years later, with Joe Biden as president, the funds were fully restored. This time around, California has sued again, arguing that the deprivation of funds, despite the project having fulfilled all the legally required reviews, is an act of political retribution — and one that puts more than 15,000 jobs on the line. In the meantime, the rail project continues, but with a giant hole in its budget thanks to the Trump administration’s efforts at punishing California for opposing the MAGA and Project 2025 agendas.

During the shutdown, Trump has been expanding the punitive model nationally, losing no opportunities to go after big-ticket items in blue parts of the country, and to roll back huge public sector investments contained in Biden’s three signature legislative achievements, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act. Between them, according to research by Robert Pollin, an economist at the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, these acts created 2.9 million jobs, 70 percent of which were aimed at people without college degrees. The jobs paid about $3 per hour more than equivalent private sector jobs and generated secondary spending in the regions of the country that attracted the most investments. Now, many of these signature public sector investments are on the chopping block, as are many other investments deemed by Trump to be “Democrat priorities.”

In early October, the Army Corps of Engineers put on hold $11 billion worth of water-related projects in a dozen blue states. Subsequently, the corps, falling back on new “Department of War” media guidelines about not releasing non-essential information during a government shutdown, refused to publicly provide details as to which projects had had the pause button pressed on them.

Later in the month, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget put the screws on Illinois by withholding more than $2 billion that had been earmarked for expanding the city’s elevated rail system — a massive project aimed at expanding the system into the impoverished far South Side of Chicago, that ground has already been broken on — and by nixing more than half a billion dollars in grants for energy-related projects around the state.

That same week, Trump announced on social media that he was “terminating” the Hudson Tunnel Project — a long-planned project that had garnered a $16 billion commitment from the federal government, to create a second railway tunnel, under the Hudson River, linking New York and New Jersey. That project, too, billed as the nation’s largest ongoing infrastructure project, is already underway, and its completion has now been put into doubt by Trump’s erratic politics-by-social-media-post behavior.

Compounding the damage to blue states, the administration also yanked billions of dollars in funding for clean energy projects around the country. All but one of the states that lost this money were blue states; the one outlier was New Hampshire, whose Republican governor was on Trump’s shit list because she had stood up to him when he ordered red states to implement mid-decade redistricting to try to predetermine the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections.

This game of raw power politics comes with a high cost. Yanking dollars from projects that are already underway means putting large numbers of jobs at risk — both the jobs of those working directly on the impacted projects and the secondary ones that are generated when those federal dollars circulate through local economies.

Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that at least 11,000 people are currently working on the New York–New Jersey tunnel project. Beyond those numbers, however, he believes that at least another 11,000 are in jobs (in the restaurant industry and other service sectors) that would likely evaporate if all of those construction workers no longer had employment and thus income to spend locally. While the disappearance of 22,000 jobs in a metropolitan region with 6 million workers wouldn’t in itself trigger a local recession, for the impacted workers those lost jobs could mean dreams shattered and the triggering of financial chaos. “The construction jobs will be very hard to replace,” Baker told Truthout. In a period when the residential and commercial construction industries are already in the doldrums, “They’re not going to have an easy time finding other jobs.”

Baker calculates that the cumulative damage done by the cessation of the flow of federal dollars into all of these projects around the country will hit many tens of thousands of workers. Regarding the clean energy projects alone, he believes that somewhere in the region of 50,000 jobs are at risk.

“Every million dollars you pull out, you’re going to lose about ten of these jobs,” Robert Pollin told Truthout. “The jobs that replace them won’t be the same quality of jobs, because these are good working-class jobs.”

“It’s clearly just punitive,” Baker says. While the states have already begun suing to protect their federal dollars, the economist anticipates that there will be different outcomes in different state lawsuits and that eventually it will fall to the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump’s financial actions against cities and states that oppose his agenda are constitutional. In normal times, he says, it would be a slam dunk that the Supreme Court would nix this behavior; but, given the hyper-conservative nature of the current Supreme Court majority, three of whom are Trump appointees, he has “no idea how the court will rule,” he says.

It is entirely possible that over the coming year the nation’s highest court will greenlight federal actions designed to deliberately economically harm denizens of blue regions of the country. If they do, it’s a fair bet that Trump and OMB chief Russell Vought will accelerate their assaults on the economic health, and the income streams, of blue-leaning parts of the country, dismantling still more of the investments generated by Biden-era legislation.

“These are large amounts of money for local economies,” Thomas Palley, a D.C.-based economist who publishes the Economics for Democratic and Open Societies newsletter, told Truthout. “It’s a big deal for local economies. This is really unprecedented. People on those projects will be laid off. There are material consequences to people who have businesses reliant on government contracting. And there’s an uncertainty impact. People will put plans for business expansion on hold. People will be taking precautionary steps.”

At some point, Palley says, if the squeeze on blue states gets too extreme, those states might end up trying to respond by finding ways to interrupt the transfer of payments from state taxpayers to the federal government. But, until then, he says, everyone’s at the mercy of “the clown with the razor blade; he’s willing to run around and slash people.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2198598158.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 16:19:03.387625

CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand rests heavily on these efficiency arguments.
Rare earth market dynamics involve significant uncertainty and speculation about future regulatory changes should be balanced against established market fundamentals.","Understanding the Foundation of CEI's Market-Based Critique

The Competitive Enterprise Institute has positioned itself at the center of a heated debate over federal energy policy, challenging the conventional wisdom that government subsidies for green technologies serve America's strategic interests. Their argument centers on what they term CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand – a phenomenon they claim undermines market efficiency and paradoxically strengthens the very dependencies these policies aim to reduce.

Defining Government-Induced Demand Distortions

Government subsidies fundamentally alter natural market dynamics by incentivising consumption patterns that would not exist under purely economic conditions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, federal tax credits for electric vehicles reached $7.5 billion in 2023, directly influencing consumer purchasing decisions beyond what underlying technology merits would support (U.S. Energy Information Administration, ""Federal Financial Interventions and Subsidies in Energy Markets,"" 2024).

This intervention creates what economists classify as deadweight loss, where resources flow toward politically favoured technologies rather than economically optimal solutions. The distinction between organic market adoption and policy-accelerated deployment becomes particularly relevant when examining rare earth-intensive technologies that require substantial mineral inputs per unit of energy produced.

The Role of Federal Energy Policies in Market Manipulation

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated approximately $369 billion toward clean energy incentives, with substantial portions directed toward technologies requiring significant rare earth elements. Wind turbines typically require 200-600 kilograms of rare earth materials per megawatt of capacity, while electric vehicle motors contain 1-2 kilograms of neodymium and smaller quantities of dysprosium and terbium (U.S. Geological Survey, ""Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024"").

These subsidy mechanisms create artificial demand spikes that exceed what market forces alone would generate. Industry data suggests that without federal incentives, electric vehicle adoption rates would likely remain 40-50% below current levels, directly translating to reduced pressure on rare earth supply chains (Congressional Budget Office, ""Federal Subsidies for Electric Vehicles,"" 2023).

Furthermore, understanding mining permitting guidelines becomes crucial when examining how regulatory barriers interact with these demand-side policies to create additional market distortions.

The Unintended Geopolitical Consequences of Green Energy Incentives

The strategic implications of increased rare earth consumption extend far beyond domestic energy policy considerations. China currently controls approximately 85% of global rare earth processing capacity, creating a bottleneck that federal subsidies inadvertently strengthen through increased demand pressure.

Supply Chain Vulnerability Through Increased Consumption

China's dominance across the rare earth value chain represents one of the most concentrated resource dependencies in the global economy. The country processes over 90% of heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium and terbium, which are essential for high-performance permanent magnets used in wind turbines and electric vehicle motors (Institute for Defence Analyses, ""Rare Earth Elements in National Defence,"" 2023).

Each subsidised wind farm installation requires substantial quantities of these materials:

Neodymium: 150-200 kg per MW of wind capacity

Dysprosium: 20-30 kg per MW for high-efficiency turbines

Terbium: 5-10 kg per MW for advanced generator designs

Praseodymium: 50-75 kg per MW as neodymium substitute

This consumption pattern means that accelerated renewable deployment through subsidies directly increases dependence on Chinese processing capabilities, potentially creating greater strategic vulnerability rather than reducing it.

The Dependency Paradox in U.S. Energy Policy

The contradiction between energy independence goals and rare earth dependency creates what analysts term the ""green minerals paradox."" Policies designed to reduce fossil fuel imports simultaneously increase reliance on Chinese-controlled mineral processing, potentially trading one form of energy dependence for another.

Historical precedent suggests that supply disruptions in critical mineral markets can have severe economic consequences. The 2010 rare earth export restrictions imposed by China following a diplomatic dispute with Japan led to price increases of 300-2000% across various rare earth oxides, demonstrating the leverage that concentrated supply chains provide (U.S. Government Accountability Office, ""Rare Earth Materials: Developing a Comprehensive Approach Could Help DOD Better Manage National Security Risks,"" 2023).

However, critical minerals energy security considerations extend beyond just rare earths, encompassing a broader range of materials essential for national defence and economic stability.

Market Inefficiencies and Resource Misallocation Patterns

Economic theory suggests that subsidies create distortions by separating consumption decisions from true production costs, leading to suboptimal resource allocation across the broader economy. CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand rests heavily on these efficiency arguments.

Price Signal Disruption in Critical Mineral Markets

Federal subsidies effectively mask the true cost of rare earth-intensive technologies by socialising mineral input costs through taxpayer support. This disruption prevents accurate price discovery, which typically guides investment decisions in mining and processing infrastructure.

Without clear market signals, private investors struggle to assess the economic viability of domestic rare earth projects. The Mountain Pass mine in California, for example, has faced periodic operational challenges partly due to uncertain long-term demand patterns influenced by policy rather than fundamental economics (Reuters, ""MP Materials restarts rare earths production,"" 2024).

Capital Allocation Consequences Across Industries

Subsidy-driven demand creates ripple effects throughout the investment landscape, potentially diverting capital from more economically viable alternatives. Research by the American Enterprise Institute suggests that every dollar of clean energy subsidies may displace 60-80 cents of private investment in competing technologies (American Enterprise Institute, ""The Hidden Costs of Green Industrial Policy,"" 2024).

This crowding-out effect extends to rare earth supply chain development, where uncertain policy trajectories make long-term infrastructure investments riskier. Processing facilities require 5-7 years to develop and billions in capital investment, timelines that extend beyond typical political cycles and subsidy programme durations.

The Free-Market Alternative to Industrial Policy Approaches

CEI advocates for regulatory reform rather than subsidy expansion as the primary mechanism for addressing rare earth supply chain vulnerabilities. Their approach emphasises removing barriers to domestic production while allowing market forces to determine optimal technology adoption rates.

Regulatory Barriers as the Primary Supply Constraint

Federal permitting processes for mining projects average 7-10 years in the United States, compared to 2-3 years in Australia and Canada (Fraser Institute, ""Annual Survey of Mining Companies 2023""). These lengthy timelines create uncertainty that discourages investment regardless of underlying demand conditions.

Environmental review requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act often add 2-4 years to project development timelines, even for facilities processing already-mined materials. The proposed Texas processing facility for rare earth separation faced a 3-year environmental review process despite utilising existing industrial infrastructure (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, permit records 2023).

Key regulatory bottlenecks include:

Mining permits: Average 8.5 years for new operations

Processing facility approvals: 4-6 years for separation plants

Transportation infrastructure: 3-5 years for specialised logistics

Waste management permits: 2-4 years for tailings facilities

Market-Driven Solutions for Supply Chain Security

Free market mechanisms could theoretically address supply chain vulnerabilities through price signals that encourage diversification and substitution. Higher rare earth prices resulting from supply constraints would naturally incentivise domestic production and alternative technology development.

Private sector recycling initiatives have already begun responding to supply pressures. Urban Mining Company reports recovering 95% of rare earth content from end-of-life permanent magnets, with processing costs 30-40% below primary mining when operating at scale (Urban Mining Company, ""Rare Earth Recycling Economics,"" 2024).

In addition, recent developments such as the executive order on critical minerals demonstrate how policy changes can influence market dynamics and investment decisions in the sector.

International Market Forces Beyond U.S. Policy Control

The global context challenges CEI's focus on U.S. subsidy elimination as a solution to rare earth market distortions. International demand drivers operate independently of American policy decisions and continue expanding regardless of domestic subsidy policies.

European and Asian Consumption Driving Worldwide Growth

The European Union's Green Deal allocated €1 trillion toward carbon neutrality by 2050, with substantial portions directed toward technologies requiring rare earth elements. Germany alone plans to install 115 GW of wind capacity by 2030, requiring approximately 23,000-69,000 tonnes of rare earth materials (European Commission, ""REPowerEU Plan,"" 2024).

China's domestic consumption has become the largest single driver of global rare earth demand, accounting for over 60% of worldwide usage. The country's internal green energy transition, including plans for 1,200 GW of renewable capacity by 2030, creates demand pressures that dwarf American consumption patterns (China National Energy Administration, ""14th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy,"" 2024).

Region Annual REE Consumption (tonnes) Primary Applications China 135,000-150,000 Domestic manufacturing, green energy Europe 25,000-30,000 Wind energy, automotive Japan/Korea 20,000-25,000 Electronics, automotive United States 15,000-20,000 Defence, energy, electronics

Consequently, initiatives like the European CRM facility highlight how other regions are developing their own strategic responses to rare earth supply challenges.

Defence and Technology Sectors as Non-Subsidised Drivers

Military applications represent a significant source of rare earth demand that operates independently of clean energy subsidies. Each F-35 fighter aircraft contains approximately 417 kilograms of rare earth materials, while advanced radar systems require substantial quantities of yttrium and terbium (U.S. Department of Defence, ""Industrial Capabilities Report,"" 2023).

The artificial intelligence boom has created new demand sources through data centre expansion and specialised computing hardware. High-performance permanent magnet motors used in server cooling systems and quantum computing applications require ultra-pure rare earth materials, adding pressure to supply chains regardless of renewable energy policies.

Furthermore, China's new rare earth and magnet restrictions threaten US defence supply chains, highlighting how geopolitical tensions exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities regardless of domestic demand policies.

Balancing Extraction Impacts with Technology Deployment

Environmental considerations add another layer of complexity to CEI's market-based arguments. Different technology pathways create varying demands on rare earth resources, with implications for mining intensity and ecological impact.

Mining Intensity Variations Across Energy Technologies

Comparative analysis reveals significant differences in rare earth requirements across energy systems. Offshore wind turbines require 2-3 times more rare earth materials per megawatt than onshore installations due to the need for direct-drive generators that operate in harsh marine environments (International Energy Agency, ""The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions,"" 2023).

Electric vehicle technologies show similar variation:

Battery Electric Vehicles: 1-2 kg rare earths per vehicle

Hybrid Electric Vehicles: 3-5 kg due to dual powertrains

Fuel Cell Vehicles: 0.5-1 kg primarily in electric motors

Conventional Vehicles: 0.1-0.3 kg in catalytic converters

Recycling and Circular Economy Considerations

Market-driven recycling could reduce primary mining pressure if price signals accurately reflect scarcity values. Current recycling rates for rare earths remain below 5% globally, primarily due to the dispersed nature of applications and collection challenges (United Nations Environment Programme, ""Global Material Flows and Resource Productivity,"" 2024).

Technology advances in magnetic separation and hydrometallurgical processing have improved recovery rates from electronic waste streams. However, economic viability depends on achieving sufficient scale and consistent feedstock supplies, factors that government policy could influence through waste management regulations rather than demand subsidies.

Strategic Reserves vs. Market Deregulation Strategies

Alternative policy approaches to rare earth security offer different trade-offs between market efficiency and strategic autonomy. Each mechanism creates distinct incentive structures and carries unique implementation challenges.

Policy Approach Implementation Cost Security Timeline Market Distortion Strategic Stockpiling $2-5 billion initial 2-3 years Low-moderate Domestic Mining Incentives $10-15 billion 8-12 years Moderate-high Processing Infrastructure $5-8 billion 5-7 years Moderate Regulatory Streamlining Administrative costs 3-5 years Minimal International Partnerships Negotiation costs 2-4 years Low

Strategic reserve systems could provide short-term supply security without creating ongoing demand distortions. The Defence Logistics Agency currently maintains reserves of specific rare earth materials, but quantities cover only 3-6 months of defence sector consumption (Defence Logistics Agency, ""Strategic Materials Status Report,"" 2023).

Projected Market Outcomes from Subsidy Elimination

Implementing CEI's recommendations would create significant adjustments across multiple sectors, with both intended and unintended consequences for rare earth supply chains and technology deployment.

Short-Term Adjustment Periods and Industry Responses

Elimination of federal subsidies would likely reduce renewable energy deployment rates by 30-50% in the near term, based on historical patterns when similar programmes expired. The wind industry experienced a 76% decline in new installations during 2013 when the Production Tax Credit briefly lapsed (American Wind Energy Association, ""Wind Industry Market Report,"" 2023).

Electric vehicle adoption could decline more dramatically, as purchase incentives directly influence consumer behaviour. Industry modelling suggests that removing the $7,500 federal tax credit could reduce EV sales by 40-60%, particularly affecting lower-income buyers for whom the incentive represents a larger percentage of vehicle cost (Congressional Budget Office, ""Federal Subsidies for Electric Vehicles Analysis,"" 2023).

Long-Term Supply Chain Evolution Scenarios

Reduced demand growth could paradoxically delay domestic rare earth processing development by decreasing investment returns for long-term infrastructure projects. Processing facilities require consistent demand over 15-20 year periods to justify capital investments, and policy uncertainty could extend development timelines.

However, slower demand growth might also reduce price volatility and supply pressures, creating more stable conditions for strategic planning. Companies could invest in supply chain diversification based on fundamental economics rather than policy-driven demand spikes.

Additionally, mining industry innovation continues to develop new approaches that could reduce costs and environmental impacts, potentially changing the economics of domestic production regardless of subsidy policies.

Counterarguments to the Pure Market Approach

Critics of CEI's position argue that market failures in critical mineral supply chains justify government intervention, particularly when national security considerations extend beyond pure economic efficiency.

National Security Considerations in Critical Mineral Policy

Defence applications for rare earth materials create strategic imperatives that may override economic efficiency arguments. Military systems often require specific performance characteristics that depend on particular rare earth elements, creating inelastic demand that persists regardless of price signals.

Competition with state-directed economies adds another dimension to the strategic calculus. China's government-subsidised approach to rare earth development created current market dominance through policies that disregarded short-term profitability in favour of long-term control. Purely market-based responses may prove insufficient to compete with state-sponsored industrial policy.

Market Failure Arguments in Critical Infrastructure Development

Large-scale infrastructure transitions exhibit characteristics of public goods that create coordination problems for private actors. Individual companies may underinvest in supply chain development if they cannot capture the full benefits of reduced strategic vulnerability.

First-mover disadvantages in emerging technology markets can also justify temporary intervention. Companies investing in domestic processing facilities face higher costs than established Chinese operations, requiring either premium pricing or policy support to achieve commercial viability.

Moreover, research indicates that rare earth elements are not as scarce as commonly believed, suggesting that supply constraints may be more about processing capacity and geopolitical control than geological scarcity.

Synthesis Approaches Combining Market Mechanisms with Targeted Intervention

Practical policy solutions may require hybrid approaches that address CEI's efficiency concerns whilst maintaining strategic flexibility for critical mineral security.

Hybrid Policy Frameworks for Critical Mineral Security

Regulatory streamlining combined with limited strategic incentives could address supply constraints without creating broad demand distortions. Accelerated permitting for domestic rare earth projects, coupled with strategic stockpiling, might achieve security objectives with minimal market interference.

Public-private partnerships for supply chain development offer another compromise approach. Government coordination and risk-sharing could support infrastructure development whilst maintaining private sector efficiency incentives and market discipline.

Measurement and Evaluation Criteria for Policy Effectiveness

Effective policy frameworks require clear metrics for distinguishing legitimate strategic needs from artificial demand creation. Key indicators might include:

Supply chain concentration ratios across critical materials

Import dependency percentages for defence and infrastructure applications

Price volatility measures in rare earth markets

Investment levels in domestic processing capacity

Technology substitution rates reducing critical mineral intensity

The Path Forward in Critical Mineral Policy Development

The debate over artificial rare earth demand reflects broader tensions between market efficiency and strategic autonomy in an increasingly complex global economy. CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand provides valuable insights into subsidy-induced distortions whilst highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to critical mineral security.

Key Takeaways from the Artificial Demand Debate

Market distortions from federal subsidies create legitimate concerns about resource allocation efficiency and unintended strategic consequences. However, global demand realities extend far beyond U.S. policy influence, limiting the effectiveness of purely domestic solutions to supply chain vulnerabilities.

The integration of security considerations with economic efficiency goals requires policy frameworks that can adapt to changing market conditions whilst maintaining strategic flexibility. Neither pure market approaches nor comprehensive industrial policy appears sufficient to address the full range of challenges in critical mineral supply chains.

Implementation Considerations for Market-Based Reforms

Transition strategies for reducing subsidy dependence should account for existing investment commitments and international competitive dynamics. Regulatory reform priorities offer the most promising avenue for improving domestic supply capabilities without creating ongoing market distortions.

International coordination opportunities through trade agreements and strategic partnerships could address supply chain vulnerabilities through diversification rather than subsidisation, aligning with market-based principles whilst achieving security objectives.

The path forward requires balancing CEI's valid concerns about artificial demand with the reality of global market forces and strategic necessities that extend beyond pure economic considerations. Ultimately, CEI's case against artificial rare earth demand highlights the complexity of balancing market efficiency with strategic security in an interconnected global economy.

Several Central European nations have seen astonishing increases in solar and battery storage projects, which will enable the energy sector to lean on the untapped potential that the renewable energy sector has stored away. Central Europe has relied on the gas and oil production coming from Russia and has plans to phase out energy from Moscow.

Renewable energy projects are key to the global energy transition

For far too long, the impact of the fossil fuel sector’s dominance on the global energy market has been ignored. Following the litany of climate disasters that have ravaged parts of the world, the political and social leaders worldwide have called for the renewable energy sector to receive significant investments to fast-track the transition of the energy market.

Reports have now emerged that state the key role that Central Europe will play in the global transition away from fossil fuels towards the renewable energy sector. Several nations in the region have developed and commissioned innovative projects that accelerate the transition and strengthen the standing of solar and battery storage systems that are locally produced.

Over the past three years, several Central European nations, including Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Poland, have sharply increased solar power capacity to boost local energy production. This rise has driven fossil-fuel generation to record lows in 2025.

The growth of solar power has been matched by the battery storage systems in Central Europe

The inevitable death of the conventional energy generation methods that the world has relied on for generations has been accelerated by the increase in solar capacity and improved domestically produced battery storage systems in Central Europe.

Notably, two nations are leading the charge to integrate the renewable energy sector in Central Europe, namely Austria and Hungary. Both nations have up until recently, relied on imports of energy from Russia, although a phase out of Russian gas and coal has forced them to sharply decrease that reliance. Austria now imports most of its gas from Slovakia, while Hungary still imports Russian-made gas and coal, although that number has declined too.

This year alone, Austria has generated about 17 % of its electricity from solar-powered projects, exemplifying the transitional nature of the Central European energy market. Hungary, on the other hand, has seen its solar share increasing to approximately 33%.

Battery storage systems have also seen tremendous growth over the past few years in Central Europe. Between 2022 and 2025, Austria, Hungary, and Romania boosted BESS capacity by roughly 472 %.

Industry experts and insiders have pointed out that regional capacity could grow more than tenfold by the end of the decade. Slovakia, which has been supplying energy to Austria, recently evaluated US technology for a planned 1.2 GW nuclear project, which could fast-track the energy transition in the region even further.

In an era of intensifying global supply challenges, the Trump and Australia critical minerals deal signals a bold shift towards reducing dependence on China. This transformation aligns with critical minerals demand, as industry leaders underscore vulnerabilities in existing frameworks.

Understanding Critical Minerals and Their Strategic Importance

The Foundation of Modern Technology

Critical minerals such as rare earth elements, lithium, cobalt, and gallium are the backbone of advanced manufacturing, defence systems, and clean energy technologies. Furthermore, these elements support semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries, and renewable energy projects. Their role in empowering modern society is undeniable.

Current Global Market Dynamics

Global rare earth reserves are highly concentrated, with China commanding a significant share. This disparity has led to pressing alternatives, as seen with the growing mining industry evolution. Moreover, shifting global conditions coupled with the US–China trade impact amplify these vulnerabilities.

China's Comprehensive Market Dominance Strategy

Mining and Processing Control

China’s dominance is rooted in decades of strategic investment. The nation controls approximately 69% of global rare earth mining capacity and 90% of refining operations. As a result, Western nations face significant challenges when attempting to develop their own processing facilities.

Manufacturing Integration Advantages

Beyond raw material extraction, China leads in the production of critical components. For instance, it produces 98% of global permanent magnets. This downstream integration bolsters China’s competitive cost advantages and underlines the sophisticated synergy between mining and manufacturing.

Comprehensive Partnership Framework Details

Financial Commitments and Investment Structure

The deal outlines an investment framework of $8.5 billion. It includes immediate U.S. project funding of $3 billion and the prospect of unlocking deposits valued at $53 billion in Australian territories. Furthermore, detailed projections create investor confidence in emerging alternatives.

Flagship Infrastructure Development Projects

Key projects include the Alcoa-Sojitz Gallium Recovery Project, which targets 10% of global gallium supply in Western Australia. Another is the Arafura Nolans Rare Earths Project in Australia’s Northern Territory, with $100 million in government backing. These initiatives aim to address supply vulnerabilities in defence and semiconductor applications.

Presidential Commitments and Timeline Projections

Analysts note that Trump’s critical minerals order foreshadows regulatory approvals rather than immediate production boosts. Experts expect that the initial phase could take up to one year before operational clarifications emerge. Additionally, a recent article on economic implications highlights the broader fiscal stakes of these projects.

Priority Mineral Targeting Strategy

Vulnerability Assessment and Strategic Focus

Analysts identify samarium, graphite, lutetium, and terbium as minerals most at risk from export limitations. This priority targeting is vital for reducing dependency on China.

Key vulnerable sectors include:

• Defence system components

• Thermal management in electronics

• Medical imaging tools

• Advanced lighting and green energy applications

Gallium Processing Breakthrough

The proposed Western Australia gallium refinery is designed to process 100 metric tonnes per year. It aims to break China’s hold on integrated gallium processing, a critical bottleneck in semiconductor and defence applications. This approach could significantly alter current supply chain dynamics.

Development Timeline and Realistic Expectations

Extended Development Requirements

Experts estimate 5–7 years for initial operations and 8–10 years for full-scale production. These projections account for the complex technical and regulatory challenges inherent in rare earth processing. Each phase will require meticulous planning and sustained capital investment.

Infrastructure and Expertise Development Challenges

Key challenges include:

• Securing environmental permits

• Developing a specialised workforce

• Constructing modern refining facilities

• Facilitating effective technology transfer

• Establishing robust market relationships

• Ensuring regulatory compliance

These factors underscore the long-term nature of the investment.

Economic Vulnerability Analysis

Supply Disruption Impact Assessment

Research from leading financial institutions shows that even a 10% disruption in rare earth supplies could incur losses of $150 billion in affected industries. This statistic reinforces the urgency of building resilient supply chains. Transitioning away from concentrated sources is critical for sustained economic stability.

Market Concentration Risks

The heavy concentration of mining capabilities in one region poses systemic risks. Consequential price volatility and supply delays affect sectors as diverse as semiconductors and renewable energy. Mitigating these risks will require strategic diversification and enhanced supply chain management.

Chinese Strategic Response and Countermeasures

Export Control Implementation

China has extended export controls by adding dozens of refining technologies to its controlled lists. Consequently, foreign producers who rely on Chinese materials must comply with stringent regulations. This approach effectively extends China’s influence over global supply chains.

Regulatory Extension Strategy

These new controls exemplify China’s efforts to maintain its competitive edge. By influencing regulatory standards overseas, China shapes market conditions to its advantage. This extraterritorial reach deepens the challenges for nations seeking to establish independent processing facilities.

Broader Alliance Building and International Cooperation

Multi-Nation Diversification Approach

The U.S. has expanded critical minerals cooperation beyond Australia by engaging with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. This multi-nation approach aims to achieve:

• Geographic diversification

• Multiple processing hubs

• Cross-border technology sharing

• Reduced geopolitical vulnerabilities

Domestic Production Enhancement

Simultaneously, the United States is exploring domestic rare earth production enhancements. Measures include establishing strategic reserves and supporting mining companies with tariff protections. This dual approach integrates international partnerships with homegrown capability development.

Success Probability and Competitive Challenges

Realistic Impact Assessment

The Trump and Australia critical minerals deal is a crucial step towards diversifying global supply chains. However, sustained success depends on long-term funding, innovative technology transfer, and steadfast commitment. These factors must overcome entrenched competitive advantages in established markets.

Competitive Disadvantages and Barriers

Western projects face challenges such as:

• Higher operational labour costs

• Strict environmental regulations

• Limited specialised technical expertise

• Pre-established supplier networks with China

Overcoming these obstacles requires persistent investment and ingenuity.

Market Price Implications and Investment Opportunities

Price Dynamics and Market Evolution

Increased competition in rare earth supply chains may eventually moderate prices. Initially, infrastructure investments are expected to drive up costs. Investors and industry stakeholders must remain patient as alternative supplies gradually bolster market stability and reduce long-term pricing pressures.

Investment Risk Considerations

Potential investors should assess:

• Extended development timelines

• Capital-intensive processing facilities

• Uncertain demand patterns

• Competitive responses from established players

This measured approach is crucial for navigating the inherent risks of the sector.

Geopolitical Strategy and Defence Implications

National Security Considerations

Critical minerals are indispensable for modern military systems. They are used in missile guidance, radar systems, and advanced communications. Securing independent supply chains is thus a strategic imperative for national defence. Enhanced security protocols further underscore the urgency of this transformation.

Alliance Strengthening Through Resource Security

The U.S.-Australia partnership, bolstered by initiatives like the AUKUS trilateral agreement with the United Kingdom, reinforces resource-based alliances. Such frameworks promote mutual security and economic collaboration. They also provide a robust strategic framework for multilateral cooperation.

Environmental Sustainability and Innovation Opportunities

Sustainable Mining Practice Standards

Australian mining is known for stringent environmental compliance. These high standards set benchmarks for global responsible mining practices. Incorporating sustainable methods ensures minimal ecological disruption while securing critical resources. The emphasis on responsible extraction plays a pivotal role in long-term industry stability.

Processing Technology Innovation

Investments in new refining technologies are driving innovations in efficiency and environmental performance. Research focuses on:

• Cleaner chemical processing

• Waste reduction strategies

• Energy-efficient operations

• Automated quality control

In addition, modern waste management solutions are integral to minimising environmental footprints.

Long-Term Strategic Implications and Market Transformation

The Trump and Australia critical minerals deal marks a transformative phase in global resource management. It is now clear that long-term success depends on technological breakthroughs, environmental stewardship, and cohesive international policies. This partnership—echoing robust political will and economic resolve—challenges existing norms and paves the way for industry renewal.

Furthermore, the agreement encourages innovation across supply chain management, pricing mechanisms, and strategic alliances. As geopolitical landscapes evolve, the sustained impact of the Trump and Australia critical minerals deal will be pivotal in redefining resource independence.

The zone, located strategically near the Port of Alat south of Baku, is not only a logistics and manufacturing hub but increasingly a focal point for green investment and renewable energy innovation.

According to Valeh Alasgarov, Chairman of the Board of the AFEZ Authority, about 200 hectares of land have already been allocated for development, with 138 hectares presented to investors. Among them, 23 hectares are reserved specifically for solar panel production facilities, marking one of Azerbaijan’s most tangible steps toward building a domestic green energy supply chain.

“Three factories are planned - one focused exclusively on solar panel assembly, and two others producing silicon crystals and related materials,” Alasgarov noted, emphasizing the integrated nature of this industrial ecosystem.

Already, companies from China, India, Russia, Israel, and Türkiye have registered in the zone, with four actively constructing facilities and two expected to start production by the end of this year.

The AFEZ offers investors one of the most favorable regulatory and fiscal frameworks in the region. The zone operates under an independent legal regime, ensuring that state institutions cannot interfere in its internal activities. Investors enjoy tax and customs exemptions, along with ready-to-use industrial plots equipped with complete infrastructure and communication systems.

This model is designed to attract export-oriented and high-value-added industries - at least 75% of goods produced in the zone must be exported - ensuring integration with global markets while protecting the domestic economy from potential imbalances.

Such an approach clearly illustrates Azerbaijan’s strategic vision to position Alat as a key gateway between Europe and Asia, serving not only as a hub for logistics and trade but also as a center for clean and sustainable industrial development. The design of the Free Economic Zone reflects the country’s broader economic agenda, where diversification and green transition intersect - aligning industrial policy with global sustainability goals.

Azerbaijan’s broader commitment to green energy provides the policy backbone for initiatives like AFEZ. Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov recently underlined the scale of progress in the country’s energy sector, noting in Azerbaijan newspaper that:

“With the commissioning of new power plants, the total electricity generation capacity of our country has now reached 9,732.5 MW - an increase of 1,317 MW, or 15.6 percent, compared to the same period last year.”

He also highlighted the launch of the 1,880 MW “8 Noyabr” Power Plant, calling it “a shining example of international partnership in the field of electricity,” developed with Chinese and Italian companies.

This expanding energy mix includes renewable components, with 9 solar plants (278.2 MW) and 5 wind farms (63.5 MW) already in operation, alongside ongoing hybrid and waste-to-energy projects. The government’s declared goal of transforming Garabagh and Eastern Zangazur into “green energy zones” demonstrates that renewable development is no longer peripheral - it is now a pillar of national economic policy.

The convergence of energy transition policies and investment liberalization makes the Alat Free Economic Zone a strategic experiment in sustainable industrial policy. By offering a business-friendly environment tied to renewable production, Azerbaijan is signaling to global investors that it aims to be a regional leader in green industry.

Experts argue that AFEZ could soon play a critical role in attracting technology transfers, green finance, and climate-friendly manufacturing - from solar panels and batteries to smart infrastructure components. The participation of international firms underscores growing confidence in Azerbaijan’s regulatory stability and long-term economic vision.

This arrangement is expected to generate over $7 million for community projects across 31 counties in four states by 2035.","A multi-state carbon capture pipeline known as the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline has officially commenced operations, marking a significant milestone in reducing emissions from ethanol plants across the Midwest. This initiative represents a breakthrough in a sector that has faced considerable hurdles, including years of legal challenges and community opposition. Unlike other costly projects that have struggled without guarantees of success, the Tallgrass project has garnered praise due to its proactive community engagement and financial backing.

The pipeline facilitates the transportation of carbon dioxide emissions from eleven ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a designated site in southeastern Wyoming, where the gas will be injected and stored 9,000 feet underground. The fermentation process that turns corn into ethanol generates significant carbon emissions. By capturing these emissions, the plants can lower their carbon intensity scores, making their products more appealing for conversion into sustainable aviation fuel. This sector is anticipated to expand rapidly, with projections estimating an annual market of up to 50 billion gallons, particularly important as the demand for traditional motor fuels declines due to the increasing prevalence of electric vehicles.

Federal incentives, including lucrative tax credits, have played a crucial role in encouraging carbon capture practices. Both the Biden and Trump administrations supported the continuation of these credits, further incentivizing the industry.

In contrast to Tallgrass’ progress, at least three other companies have attempted to establish carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest. The Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions continues to pursue its ambitious multibillion-dollar project, which involves a network of pipelines across five states. Despite its backing from agricultural groups and the ethanol sector, Summit has faced fierce opposition from landowners resistant to the pipeline’s impact on their properties. Legal challenges and legislative actions have further complicated its efforts.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has stringent regulations governing the underground injection of carbon dioxide, ensuring that such activities protect drinking water sources. This rigorous permitting process is designed to safeguard environmental quality while enabling carbon storage in geological formations deep underground.

Tallgrass has attributed much of its success to the strategic retrofitting of an existing natural gas pipeline, minimizing the need for new construction. This approach has been complemented by extensive community outreach. The company collaborated with Bold Nebraska to establish a community investment fund designed to contribute to local initiatives, including early childhood development and senior care. The initial contribution of $500,000 will be followed by ongoing payments based on the carbon emissions captured. This arrangement is expected to generate over $7 million for community projects across 31 counties in four states by 2035.

Commentators have noted that the cooperative nature of Tallgrass’ approach has set a precedent that could serve as a model for future energy projects. Local leaders have expressed appreciation for the company’s willingness to engage openly with the community and address concerns. Experts emphasize the importance of listening and negotiating with stakeholders, suggesting that such practices could help alleviate fears associated with infrastructure projects.

While Tallgrass has set a high standard for community relations in pipeline development, some experts caution that replicating this success may be challenging due to the decreasing availability of natural gas pipelines suitable for retrofitting. Nonetheless, the company’s approach illustrates the potential for effective collaboration between energy infrastructure projects and local communities, underscoring the role of transparency and mutual benefit in navigating complex energy transitions.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Tallgrass-Pipeline-Begins-Carbon-Capture-Operations-Amid-Community-Support.com2Ffe2Fbd2Fb6be0d909f80e3482b05e6f0605e2F17cfb49ea00f43c39cd8.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 16:18:22.002911

Throw rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.","As tech companies tout their plans for massive new data centers, consumers are increasingly worried the AI-driven gold rush will ultimately drive up the price they pay for electricity, according to a new survey.

The report, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that 80% of consumers are worried about the impact of data centers on their utility bills.

Consumers’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

Electricity demand in the United States held steady for over a decade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Over the last five years, commercial users including data centers and industrial users began drinking more deeply from the grid, with annual growth rising 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, residential use only grew by 0.7% annually.

Data centers today consume about 4% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than double their share in 2018. By 2028, consumption is forecasted to rise to 6.7% to 12%, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Generation has managed to meet demand thanks to a surge in new capacity from solar, wind, and grid-scale battery storage. Big tech companies have been inking large deals for new utility-scale solar, in particular, attracted by the energy source’s low cost, modularity, and speed to power. Solar farms can start delivering power to data centers before they’re completed, and a new project typically takes around 18 months to complete.

The EIA expects renewables to dominate new generating capacity through at least the next year. The trend likely would have extended beyond 2026, but experts predict a Republican repeal of key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act will hamper the renewables’ growth.

Meanwhile, natural gas, another source of energy favored by data center operators, hasn’t met the moment. Production has been rising, but most of the new supplies have gone toward feeding exports rather than the domestic market. Consumption by electricity generators rose by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while exporters consumed 140% more.

New natural gas power plants won’t be ready in time, either, since they take around four years to complete, according to the International Energy Agency. A backlog of turbines used by gas-fired power plants has only compounded the problem. Manufacturers are quoting delivery dates up to seven years out, and newly announced production capacity is unlikely to change things.

Slow natural gas buildouts coupled with kneecapped renewables have put data center developers in a bind.

While AI and data centers aren’t entirely responsible for increasing electricity demand — industrial users have been nearly as thirsty — they’ve been leading the headlines.

AI is likely to be the focus of consumers’ ire: More people are concerned about the technology than excited about it, according to a Pew survey. No surprise given that many employers have been wielding the tool as a way to cut headcount rather than improve augment employee productivity.

Throw rising energy prices into the mix, and you can begin to see how a backlash might be brewing.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2197370288.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2025-11-01 13:59:09.278437

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/preview-26.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 14:59:06.389085

To date, climate adaptation has focused on the environmental impacts of climate change: strengthening seawalls against sea level rise, improving flood control systems, and retrofitting buildings for extreme weather events.
But this infrastructure-centric framing sidesteps questions about the institutions that will condition how people experience the political impacts of climate change.
Nearly 30 years ago, the Kyoto protocol represented the prevailing wisdom that market mechanisms would solve climate change.
But the exclusive focus on preventing climate catastrophe obscures a more immediate reality: climate change is already reshaping our world.","For decades, “stopping climate change” has been the singular goal of climate politics. Across the political spectrum, from grassroots climate campaigners to elite UN negotiators, reducing carbon emissions to avoid future catastrophe has been the organizing logic of climate policies.

Yet climate change has arrived and its material impacts are already being felt. This means that climate politics can no longer focus only on preventing future catastrophes. It must now also encompass struggles over how society manages climate impacts already reshaping economic and social life. Insurance markets, housing, water and land use policies, national labor markets, and local economies – all will need to be radically remade as we adapt to a changed and increasingly volatile climate.

To date, climate adaptation has focused on the environmental impacts of climate change: strengthening seawalls against sea level rise, improving flood control systems, and retrofitting buildings for extreme weather events. But this infrastructure-centric framing sidesteps questions about the institutions that will condition how people experience the political impacts of climate change. Should we allow property insurance markets to operate freely, or should the federal government backstop high-risk regions? Do we maintain disaster aid systems that only protect property owners, or do we guarantee equitable recovery support? Do we leave workers laboring in extreme heat to their employers’ whims, or do we enact federal protections?

These questions are not hypothetical. In the United States alone, a spike in non-renewal rates across the homeowners’ insurance industry – even beyond high-risk markets in Florida and California – indicates that climate threatens to trigger a national insurance crisis. In 2023, UPS workers threatened a nationwide strike over on-the-job heat exposure, ultimately winning an agreement to install air conditioning in delivery trucks. That same year, after decades of drought left the Colorado River’s reservoirs at historic lows – threatening water supplies for 40 million people – the Biden administration paid Arizona, Nevada and California $1.2bn to reduce their water usage. How we respond to these political crises – and those to come – will encode fundamentally different visions of society. Yet these struggles remain largely outside the frame of climate politics, which continues to treat adaptation as a technical matter for experts and engineers rather than genuine political contestation.

Climate politics has already moved beyond technocratic frameworks when it comes to mitigation. Nearly 30 years ago, the Kyoto protocol represented the prevailing wisdom that market mechanisms would solve climate change. But as emissions kept rising and those markets proved ineffectual, the focus shifted to national-level industrial policy debates – and with it, climate became genuinely political. Recent years have seen any number of political battles, spanning the green capitalism of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act versus the democratic socialism of the Green New Deal to debates over lithium nationalization in Bolivia and coal phase-out compensation in Germany. These are fights about values and mediating between competing interests, not merely carbon accounting.

Yet even as climate migrated from the preserve of technocratic elites to more familiar domains of political struggle, it remained restricted to the realm of decarbonization. Even the politically progressive agenda of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral campaign – which links climate to the cost-of-living crisis, arguing that rent freezes, universal childcare and free public transit will prevent New Yorkers from fleeing for more affordable, but energy-intensive, life in the suburbs – makes its case through an emissions reductions framework. A truly comprehensive climate politics would apply this same political imagination to adaptation – transforming social institutions not only to prevent future warming, but also to manage the climate impacts already transforming everyday life.

The need for this shift becomes clearer once we abandon the apocalyptic framing that has long dominated climate discourse. In insisting that climate change constitutes an all-powerful force that will entirely overwhelm human civilization, climate politics has become blind to the reality that, for most people, climate change will materialize not as something utterly new, but as familiar problems made worse: more people priced out of housing markets after disasters, more workers forced to work during heatwaves, more local industries decimated after extreme weather events. Climate adaptation is not a distinct technical challenge, then, but rather continuous with ongoing political struggles.

The terrain of this struggle is beginning to take shape. The Council on Foreign Relations, for example, recently proposed reforms to the property insurance market to expose homeowners to the “full actuarial cost” of living in high-risk areas like California. By contrast, the progressive Climate and Community Institute has proposed a system of Housing Resilience Agencies that would provide comprehensive public disaster insurance. The contrast is stark: one approach uses price signaling to prod people out of vulnerable areas – effectively a form of managed retreat through market pressure – while the other commits public resources that enable them to stay in place safely. But these kinds of policy debates remain few and far between in climate discourse.

This is not to suggest that mitigation should be abandoned. But the exclusive focus on preventing climate catastrophe obscures a more immediate reality: climate change is already reshaping our world. The question is not whether we will reshape our institutions to manage climate impacts, but how – and whose vision will prevail.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e346b5a70ea30ece8b3d0e4b2f32d0fb3a0bdd22/317_0_3163_2531/master/3163.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1238adda546fc7fd55347aa70aa24775",N,,2025-11-01 13:05:57.468001

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it's released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,"" said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. ""And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn't easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn't been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don't want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota's legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,"" he said, ""and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.""

At the same time, newly forged trade agreements and planned industry investment suggest that some of the current downsizing may be reversed as markets adjust and manufacturers launch new models.

Electric vehicle sales surged in the United States during the third quarter, but with the expiration of federal incentives, automakers have abruptly adjusted their operations in response to changing policy and market conditions. However, industry analysts note that the mounting cutbacks in the sector may prove temporary as new models and consumer incentives change in the coming year.

General Motors, the country's second-largest seller of battery-powered vehicles behind Tesla, began paring back output at its Detroit Factory Zero plant, which produces flagship EV models such as the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Cadillac Escalade IQ.

The assembly line, previously running around the clock on three shifts, was idled for a month and is expected to restart operations next year with only one shift – a move that will leave 1,200 assembly workers without jobs indefinitely. Additional temporary layoffs will affect a further 1,670 workers at GM's battery and components plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, with the automaker citing evolving market conditions and regulatory shifts for the changes.

GM's joint venture with LG Energy Solution, Ultium Cells, will also pause production at its battery factories in Warren, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, resulting in 550 indefinite layoffs and 1,550 temporary layoffs. Earlier this month, GM reported a $1.6 billion charge to reflect the declining value of its EV plants and to cover the costs of layoffs and canceled supplier contracts.

Rivian, the electric truck and SUV manufacturer, has undergone a series of workforce reductions in response to an anticipated sales slowdown. The company recently announced layoffs affecting approximately 600 employees, or around 4.5% of its total workforce.

This follows a smaller round of job cuts one month prior as the company prepares to introduce a new midsize SUV, the R2, expected to start at around $45,000. Rivian reported vehicle sales of 13,201 units in the third quarter, marking a 32% increase year-over-year, but narrowed its delivery guidance for the year from a previous forecast of 46,000 vehicles to a revised range of 41,500 to 43,500 units.

The company lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter but maintains that it has sufficient capital to launch the R2 SUV, anticipating stronger demand for the new vehicle than its current models – the R1T pickup and R1S SUV – which start at $70,990 and $76,900, respectively.

One factor that could help make these cutbacks temporary is the recent trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, which introduces new opportunities and more favorable conditions for EV automakers and suppliers across the global supply chain.

Under the new arrangement, tariffs on Korean autos and auto parts will be reduced from 25% to 15% in exchange for a $350 billion investment commitment from South Korea, structured to avoid destabilizing its currency by capping annual injections at $20 billion over two decades. Of the total, $150 billion will be directed toward American shipbuilding. This deal levels the playing field for South Korean automakers and suppliers, such as Hyundai, LG Energy Solution, and SK, whose business interests in North America depend on fair market access.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/11/2025-11-01-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 16:19:09.933461

When operational, the project will provide 82,000 people with clean, reliable electricity and eliminate 58,740 tons of CO2 emissions per annum.

The approval, comprising $7.27 million from the African Development Bank's own resources, and matching concessional financing from a Development Finance Institution, demonstrates a bold commitment to closing Zambia’s energy gap while advancing the Mission 300 goal of providing 300 million Africans with electricity access by 2030. Zambia is among the first cohort of countries that launched national energy compacts under Mission 300, in January 2025.

The $24.5 million project will design, construct, operate, and maintain the 20 megawatt solar plant, to be connected to the national grid via a 10 km, 33 kV power line. Under a 25-year take-or-pay Power Purchase Agreement, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited will offtake all electricity generated from the plant.

“The project marks a key milestone in Zambia’s efforts to restore confidence in its power sector, attract private sector investment, and drive progress toward closing the energy gap and achieving Mission 300 goals,” said Wale Shonibare, Director of Energy Financial Solutions, Policy, and Regulation at the African Development Bank.

The Garneton North 20MW Solar Project is one of six projects selected by the Zambia government under the country’s Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariffs (GETFiT) programme, designed to unlock private-sector investment in small- and medium-scale renewable energy independent power projects in the country.

It will hire 90 people during construction compromising 5 women and 50 youth, and will hire 10 people during operations, comprising 2 females and 6 youth. The project will add critical capacity to Zambia’s strained power grid, reducing blackouts and improving energy security.

The GETFiT programme approach will facilitate the timely procurement of a total 120 MW of renewable energy capacity; diversify Zambia’s power mix, and demonstrate that Zambia’s power sector is once again bankable for private investment.

“Through the successful implementation of this project and the broader programme, Zambia will demonstrate its strong commitment to diversifying its energy mix away from hydropower and enhancing energy security,” said Jing Li, Division Manager, Energy Financial Solutions at the African Development Bank. “By expanding renewable generation capacity, the project will help reduce the frequency and severity of power outages, ensure a more reliable electricity supply, and contribute to maintaining cost-reflective tariffs for consumers.”

The Garneton North 20MW Solar Project aligns with the African Development Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2024–2033), and the New Deal on Energy for Africa, advancing a low-carbon development path and facilitating universal electricity access through clean energy.

It further supports the Bank’s climate change, gender, youth employment, and resilience strategies, as well as private-sector-led renewable energy development under Mission 300.",https://www.afdb.org/sites/default/files/1500-man-solar-panel.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:20:48.600370

Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.

Proposition 50 would redraw California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats.

If voters approve it, the number of Republicans representing California in Congress could be cut roughly in half, potentially altering the national balance of power.

Polls show about six in 10 likely voters support the proposition, though support breaks sharply along party lines and varies by region.

Still haven’t decided how you are voting on Prop. 50? Let us help.

The basics

Proposition 50 would change how California determines the boundaries of congressional districts. The measure asks voters to approve new congressional district lines designed to favor Democrats for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, overriding the map drawn by the state’s nonpartisan, independent redistricting commission.

Impact

If voters approve Proposition 50, Golden State Democrats would see the odds tilted further in their favor, while the number of Republicans representing California in Washington, D.C., could be reduced by half.

Background

With a push from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrats in the state Legislature put Proposition 50 on California’s Nov. 4 ballot after the Texas GOP began discussing a new map that would help elect five more Republicans to Congress. The Republican Party holds the House by such a slim margin that any changes to state maps could have an effect on the balance of power in Washington.

How to vote in California’s Nov. 4 special election

Here are some things to know about how to vote in California’s special election on Nov. 4, and where to access more information about the election.

Will your congressional district shift left or right in Newsom’s proposed map?

We calculated the margin of victory between Democrats and Republicans in Newsom’s redistricting effort. Here are the results.

Taking sides

Generally speaking, Proposition 50 is marked by a partisan divide.

Some supporters say they will vote for redistricting even though they don’t like it. Instead, they blame Republicans in Texas and elsewhere for gerrymandering to help the GOP. If California didn’t respond, Republicans would get away with stacking the congressional electoral map in their favor. Prop. 50 is backed by topDemocrats nationwide, led by Newsom.

Supporters:

President Barack Obama

Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years,. With Prop. 50, you can stop Republicans in their tracks. Prop. 50 puts our elections back on a level playing field, preserves independent redistricting over the long term, and lets the people decide. Return your ballot today.”

-Barack Obama

Opponents

President Donald Trump

Vice President J.D. Vance

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger

Rep. Doug LaMalfa

“They are trying to fight for democracy by getting rid of the democratic principles of California. It is insane to let that happen... They want to dismantle this independent commission. They want to get rid of it under the auspices of we have to fight Trump. It doesn’t make any sense to me because we have to fight Trump, [yet] we become Trump.”

—Arnold Schwarzenegger

Orange County Register: “Prop. 50 tosses aside the congressional maps drawn by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in favor of maps drawn by and for the benefit of politicians. In a healthy democracy, you want voters to be the ones choosing their politicians. With Prop. 50, you have politicians choosing their voters.”

California Republicans energized by their opposition to Newsom’s redistricting special election

Next year’s governor race took a backseat to GOP opposition to Prop. 50, the ballot measure voters will decide in a November special election that would redraw California’s congressional districts, potentially netting Democrats five additional seats and determining control of Congress.

‘It’s all at stake’: As Prop. 50 fight intensifies, Newsom, partisan influencers rally their bases

The multimillion-dollar jousting over a redistricting push in California to counter President Trump was on full display recently, as both sides courted voters.

State of the race

Polls

Polls have shown Prop. 50 comfortable leading.

Six in 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times. About 38% of likely voters oppose the ballot measure.

According to the survey, the breakdown among voters was highly partisan, with more than 9 out of 10 Democrats supporting Proposition 50 and a similar proportion of Republicans opposing it. Among voters who belong to other parties, or identify as “no party preference,” 57% favored the ballot measure, while 39% opposed it.

In the voter-rich urban areas of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay area, Proposition 50 led by wide margins, the poll found. Voters in Orange County, the Inland Empire and the Central Valley were pretty evenly divided.

Fundraising

Records show pro-Prop. 50 forces have raised much more money than critics.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s committee supporting the redistricting measure raised $36.8 million between Sept. 21 and Oct. 18, bringing its total to $114.3 million, as of last Thursday.

The two main opposition groups raised a total of $8.4 million during the 28 days covered by the fundraising period, bringing their total haul to $43.7 million.

These compact, three-wheeled vehicles will deliver Coca-Cola products in major cities, including Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, and Bhopal.
For India, where millions rely on small electric vehicles for daily transport and deliveries, the rollout signals a meaningful shift toward accessible, locally appropriate clean energy solutions.
Environmental experts say scaling up smaller electric vehicles could have an outsized impact in congested urban centers.
Cleaner delivery vehicles mean safer air, quieter neighborhoods, and reduced reliance on dirty fuels.","Coca-Cola's bottling partners in India are taking a cleaner route to customers, one electric rickshaw at a time. According to Electrek, the Coca-Cola company recently announced the addition of more than 5,000 e-rickshaws to its local delivery fleet as part of a wider push to cut pollution and support small-scale entrepreneurs under a program called Vividhta ka Uphaar, which translates to ""a gift of diversity.""

These compact, three-wheeled vehicles will deliver Coca-Cola products in major cities, including Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, and Bhopal. Powered by small electric drivetrains, the e-rickshaws release zero tailpipe pollution and operate quietly through dense city streets, helping reduce both air and noise pollution for residents. Lower fuel and maintenance costs also make the switch a financial win for local drivers who lease or own their vehicles.

The move puts Coca-Cola among a growing list of global corporations like IKEA, Amazon, and Flipkart, which all use electric tuk-tuks to decarbonize last-mile delivery in Asia. For India, where millions rely on small electric vehicles for daily transport and deliveries, the rollout signals a meaningful shift toward accessible, locally appropriate clean energy solutions.

Environmental experts say scaling up smaller electric vehicles could have an outsized impact in congested urban centers.

As one commenter noted on Electrek's coverage, ""We need millions.""

Another added, ""Throw some solar PV panels on the roof of the warehouse and all of those eTukTuks are powered for the next 30 years!""

While Coca-Cola's investment in electric mobility marks a positive step, the company's environmental record remains far from spotless. It continues to top global rankings as the world's largest producer of branded plastic waste, responsible for billions of bottles each year.

Still, changes like this matter. Cleaner delivery vehicles mean safer air, quieter neighborhoods, and reduced reliance on dirty fuels. It's one way mainstream brands can start supporting sustainable systems from within. This is a move consumers can amplify by supporting eco-friendly initiatives by mainstream brands.

If Coca-Cola's latest rollout proves successful, those thousands of e-rickshaws could become the start of something much larger. In the future, it may not be a fleet measured in thousands, but in millions.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by four to 546 in the week to October 31, the lowest since September.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

It said oil rigs fell by six to 414 this week, their lowest level since September, while gas rigs rose by four to 125, their highest since August 2023.

FIRMS SHIFT FOCUS AMID LOWER ENERGY PRICES

In Texas, the biggest oil and gas producing state, the rig count fell by one to 235, the lowest since September 2021. In Louisiana, meanwhile, the rig count rose by one to 41, the highest since September 2024.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production (E&P) companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 3% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

US EIA PROJECTED HIGHER OUTPUT

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

We saw that DAC involves the pulling in of large amounts of air using giant fans or pumps, which is then passed through chemicals. The chemicals react with air in such a manner that carbon dioxide is trapped, and the other air is released. This pure stream of carbon dioxide is then carried to underground reservoirs for storage. We also saw that DAC is a highly capital-intensive process and requires a steady supply of green energy for it to be meaningful. There are very few such operational projects at the moment, with many being planned. The main operational DAC project in the world is the Climeworks project in Iceland: the Orca plant and the Mammoth project. The Heirloom Plant in California is also operational, but is much smaller than the Climeworks plants. The South Texas Hub and the Project Cypress Hub in Louisiana are being planned in the USA on a much larger scale, but the progress on these is uncertain after the election of President Trump as the President of the USA. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that there are 27 DAC projects in the world, and another 130 projects are in various stages of planning. Most of the DAC plants under operation are small operations. Let us discuss the operational DAC projects.

Climeworks’ Iceland DAC Plants

There are two DAC plants located near the Hellisheidi geothermal plant: the smaller Orca plant, which can remove 4,000 tonnes of CO2 per year and the Mammoth plant, which can remove 36,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The Mammoth plant was commissioned in May 2024. The location of Iceland is not coincidental: it has been carefully chosen because of a steady supply of green geothermal energy. Further, the Mammoth plant is situated near a dormant volcano, which provides large storage space for the CO2 captured. The storage partner of Climeworks is a company called Carbfix, which injects the carbon dioxide into deep basalt rocks, where it gets converted into carbonate minerals and stored for over 10,000 years. In the words of the co-founder of Climeworks, Christophe Gribald, they intend to capture one Megaton of CO2 per year by 2030 and one Gigaton by 2050.

The smaller Orca plant was commissioned in September 2021 and can remove 4,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.

The DAC plants of Climeworks have been successful in both raising funds for their operations and finding customers for the green carbon credits they have created. Their funding came from a variety of sources, ranging from GIC of Singapore to private equity firms such as Partners Group and BigPoint Holdings. Their earliest customers were two European Airlines: Swiss Air and Lufthansa, and they quickly expanded to include Microsoft, BCG, JP Morgan, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines.

DAC Plants under Development

Most of the large plants under development are in the USA and have been planned in pursuance of a USD 3.5 billion grant to develop DAC hubs under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Stratos DAC Plant, Texas: Developed by 1Point Five (USA) and Carbon Engineering (Canada), this facility will remove 5,00,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually, becoming the world’s largest DAC plant, once operational.

South Texas DAC Hub: Also by 1Point Five, this Kleberg County project mirrors Stratos’ design, targeting 5,00,000 tonnes yearly with plans for 3 billion tonnes of long-term storage.

Norway DAC Projects: Norway, with its large supply of renewable energy, is developing into a large DAC hub in the world. Three large projects being planned are: the Carbon Engineering and Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV) project in the Koollsnes area, with a capacity to remove 5,00,000 to one million tonnes of CO2 per year, the Climeworks project with Northern Lights infrastructure and the Removr plant with a capacity to remove one million tonnes of CO2 per year.

Project Cypress Hub, Louisiana: This hub is being developed by the US Department of Energy at two locations in Louisiana: Calcasieu Parish near Vinton (will use Climeworks’ technology) and Caddo Parish at the Port of Caddo-Bossier (will use Heirloom’s technology), to remove one million tonnes of CO2 per year when operational.

Conclusion

Direct Air Capture is an important technological intervention and should be a part of the strategy across the world to achieve net-zero emissions. While it is highly capital-intensive and costly at the moment, costs are likely to fall as more and more plants become operational.",https://www.millenniumpost.in/h-upload/2025/11/01/997924-carban.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 15:59:53.860936

It’s investing that money at Sanford’s Helix Innovation Park at the Brickyard. The company expects to create 102 jobs at the Lee County site. Add N.C. Department of Commerce incentives worth $2 million over 12 years and local incentives approved by Sanford City Council and Lee County Board of Commissioners, and the project is expected to grow the state’s economy by more than $1 billion, according to a news release.

The Kyowa Kirin project represents more than a single economic development win. “It will be a showcase for industry, not just from Lee but from Chatham and Harnett counties as well,” says Sanford Area Growth Alliance CEO Jimmy Randolph. “You’ll be able to see the manufacturing that’s happening here. It’s going to be a cornerstone of our workforce in North Carolina.”

Nestled together in North Carolina’s center, Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties have more than boundaries in common. Residents cross those lines regularly for work and play. They share utilities, including electricity and water. And their future, economic and otherwise, will be determined by their efforts, whether they’re done individually or collectively.

BUILDING A WORKFORCE

Central Carolina Community College has three campuses. Their reach is extended with instructional locations — seven in Lee, four in Chatham and nine in Harnett. “[It’s] more than an educational institution,” says Margaret Roberton, CCCC vice president of workforce development and chief of staff. “It is a vital component of economic development in the region and a trusted partner for businesses across Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties. CCCC’s deep connections to local industry make it a critical force in building a skilled workforce, supporting business retention and driving regional prosperity. The college’s impact extends beyond the classroom. CCCC collaborates closely with regional and local economic development organizations — Carolina Core, RTRP, SAGA, Chatham EDC and Harnett EDC — chambers of commerce, workforce boards and local governments to attract new industry and strengthen existing businesses.”

Harnett County Economic Development Director Stephen Barrington says CCCC may be the three-county region’s greatest asset. The best one specifically for industry may be the college’s 22-acre E. Eugene Moore Manufacturing and Biotech Solutions Center in Sanford.

Renovations to Moore Center’s 10,000-square-foot biotechnology building will make room for program expansions intended to support the region’s blossoming biotechnology industry. A “wall breaking” ceremony kicked off the work in September. “The building will contain clean room experiences, fill-finish labs, BioWork classrooms and a high flexible lab designed to shift with industry needs, among other learning spaces,” Roberton says. “This building will support individuals entering into the industry in areas of process technician and quality as well as upskilling the existing workforce as they progress through their careers.”

Kyowa Kirin joins manufacturers Pfizer and Astellas in providing input for renovations and designing future training efforts at the Moore Center. “The college through a mix of county, state and private funds has committed $32.1 million toward current renovation efforts, which include the biotechnology building and Phase 1 of the manufacturing building,” Roberton says. “We are working on a capital campaign leveraging both public and private funds for the $72 million needed to complete the full renovation of the center. We are inviting a number of area manufacturers for input on Phase 1 of the larger building as well as early design efforts for Phase 2.”

Phase 2 addresses the balance of approximately 175,000 square feet of the main building. “[It’s] focused on ensuring that relevant advanced manufacturing training is offered as well as holding space for partnerships and unique solution opportunities responding to manufacturing needs,” according to CCCC. “Training areas will include welding, industrial systems, automation, engineering technologies, computer-integrated machining, advanced materials/energy and the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies.”

The Moore Center is home to several programs. Robertson says the commercial drivers’ license division, is parked there, offering hands-on instruction for people pursuing this high-demand field. Other workforce development initiatives are underway elsewhere. Barrington says Harnett County has invested in CCCC’s Liftoff Lab program, funding multiple scholarships per year. The program is led by the college’s Small Business Center, which in partnership with the Sanford Area Growth Alliance and Downtown Sanford created Real Investment in Sanford Entrepreneurs in 2021.

CCCC has several new programs. FirstHealth FirstFutures is a healthcare workforce partnership with FirstHealth of the Carolinas and other community colleges. AdvanceNC is a collaboration of 12 community colleges, seven workforce development boards, three universities and two nonprofit partners that intends to create a more aligned and responsive workforce ecosystem for the advanced manufacturing sector. And Commercial Leap Ahead for Wide bandgap Semiconductors — CLAWS — works with NC State and N.C. A&T to respond to the national need for a skilled workforce in microelectronics and semiconductors.

CCCC is prepared for a variety of assignments. “From advanced manufacturing and life sciences to clean energy and healthcare, CCCC is at the table for industry recruitment and expansion conversations, ensuring companies know they will have access to the talent they need to grow and thrive,” Roberton says. “These efforts include innovative efforts to include employers in meaningful conversations about workforce needs from inviting employers to help design training environments to establishing Business & Industry Leadership Teams to provide industry direct connections into helping the college align our educational delivery to their current and future workforce needs.”

SHARED SERVICES

Chatham, Harnett and Lee counties share a workforce, trading commuters every morning and evening. “Our three counties are uniquely part of two distinct economic development regions in the state — Research Triangle and the Carolina Core,” Barrington says. “Areas in which each of our counties will actively work to uncover solutions include affordable housing, which differentiates from low-income housing; power, including use of alternative sources; and childcare, its scarcity and affordability.”

Barrington says more than half of Harnett residents leave the county for work. The county launched its Harnett County Jobs Campaign in January, hoping to spur 1,000 new jobs at or above 125% of the county average annual wage, which state data shows is $46,969, by the end of 2030. “We know this will not make a real dent in the 39,000, or net loss of 20,000, that leave the county every day to go to work,” he says. “But it is a focused start.”

Randolph says other parameters direct job creation in the counties. “We have to also consider our partnership with [Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina] and their interest in larger projects like in life sciences, energy related and, as the uncertainty around tariffs continues, we see projects that may be interested in onshoring manufacturing. The challenge is power and access to adequate power infrastructure.”

Central Electric Membership Corp. serves Chatham, Harnett, Lee, Moore and Randolph counties. “We need 20 to 50 megawatts for advanced manufacturing that may be heavily automated, and it’s putting some significant challenges to our partners on the utilities side to meet those needs,” Randolph says. “That’s going to be part of the story of economic development in the future. Some data center projects think central North Carolina would be a great place, but we don’t have the electrical capacity to support that. Some centers need potentially hundreds of megawatts, and that’s unprecedented in our area for a single

end user.”

The availability of other utilities can be hurdles, too. TriRiver Water serves Chatham, Lee and parts of Orange counties. It formed in July 2024, when Sanford and the town of Pittsboro in Chatham County merged their water services. Siler City in Chatham County joined a year later. “If you’re thinking about regionality in economic development, you’re now seeing how small systems are not adequate,” Randolph says. “And I think Sanford is going to be a model for the state, where we look at a more regional approach. TriRiver Water is making significant investments to connect all those cities and will move to a 30-million-gallon-per-day capacity. That’s critical for our larger businesses.”

Chatham County Economic Development President Michael Smith underscored the importance of adequate water supply to projects. “TriRiver Water is a key player in supporting our community across the county, from the Triangle Innovation Point megasite in Moncure to the Chatham Advanced Manufacturing site in Siler City,” he says. “From regional water infrastructure to industrial site development, our partnerships are fueling opportunity and shaping the future of Chatham County.”

MIXING WORK AND PLAY

Chatham County has water views. “Jordan Lake is the most visited state park in North Carolina,” Smith says. “And that’s exciting, because it’s right here in our county. It’s a beautiful body of water with zero development along its shores.” Chatham also has upscale housing developments, including one owned by Disney, and tourist attractions such as Carolina Tiger Rescue, a nonprofit wildlife sanctuary near Pittsboro.

Smith says Chatham has strong relationships with its neighboring counties. “And we’re fortunate to be part of both the RTP Regional Partnership and the Carolina Core,” he says. “These connections give us the advantage of collaboration and the support of regional marketing groups that help us share our story.” It has a whole chapter dedicated to business parks, including Triangle Innovation Point and Chatham-Siler City Advance Manufacturing, which has 1,300 acres available.

Apex Gateway has six completed buildings, which total more than 1 million square feet, and additional space is under construction. Tenants include Durham Coca-Cola Bottling, US Autoforce, Emcor and Life Sciences Logistics. “Through our partnership with Apex Economic Development, we are marketing the Apex Gateway site, which will offer over 1 million square feet of industrial space at the U.S. 64/N.C. 751 intersection,” Smith says.

Chatham County EDC opened a satellite office at 79°West Innovation Hub, a 22,000-square-foot workspace and 8,500-square-foot warehouse in MOSAIC, a 44-acre mixed-use community in the live-work-play-learn community of Chatham Park, just north of downtown Pittsboro. “MOSAIC’s 79°West Innovation Hub keeps creating community with innovative programming and by becoming home to small businesses, including the Chatham EDC and the Chatham Chamber,” says Kirk Bradley, the developer of MOSAIC at Chatham Park. “More guests than ever are attending MOSAIC events, including concerts, markets, wellness Wednesdays and more. And Hampton Inn & Suites is bustling with both business and wedding party traffic.”

MOSAIC includes businesses, restaurants, apartments, an outdoor concert venue and a hotel. “[It’s] alive with activity, whether that’s community events on the Philip H. Kohl MOSAIC Family Commons or a tenant’s grand opening,” Bradley says. “We’ve added multiple new services, like Foundations Family Therapy and barre3 Chatham Park, and look forward to welcoming a new restaurant, a Tavolo Italian Eatery from local restauranteur Greg Lewis.”

Vanessa Jenkins is executive vice president of Cary-based Preston Development, which created the district. “Chatham Park is a unique community where residents can put down roots and work in a variety of locations,” she says. “We are convenient to megasites, the city of Sanford as well as Hartnett County. There are also many employment opportunities within Chatham Park as well. Various development projects are underway within Chatham Park, several of which will provide services and residential offerings for years to come. Grading of the UNC Health Campus, phase one of Asteria, StoryLiving by Disney, the extension of Chatham Parkway to connect Highway 64 and 15/501 have all broken ground this year.”

MOSAIC has plenty to offer. “[It’s] an attractive spot for businesses to locate, because it’s a mixed-use development, where community members can live, work, learn, play and dine all in one place in the growing community of Pittsboro,” Bradley says. “In short, the momentum at MOSAIC continues to add to Chatham County’s growing energy.”

MAKING ROOM FOR BUSINESS

Harnett’s population is about 146,000, 25% more than in 2010. That increase has been noticed.“Private developers are now circling the county and plan to bring to the market new shopping centers with top tier grocery store anchors,” Barrington says. “Harnett County has also invested in a relationship with Retail Strategies out of Birmingham, Alabama, to help attract national brands within the retail, restaurant and hospitality space.”

Truck equipment manufacturer Godwin Manufacturing, a $30 million Rooms to Go expansion, doors and turnstiles manufacturer Boon Edam, grocery chain Carlie C’s IGA and Warren Oil Co., are big blocks in Harnett’s economic foundation. The search for room to add more is underway. Product development — buildings and land — is Harnett County Economic Development’s focus. “Product development is all about ‘setting the table’ for new and expanding companies,” Barrington says. The county is working to identify buildings and land suitable for manufacturing and professional/business services and transitioning available land to market-ready sites. He says Harnett’s first Class A industrial park, Harnett 95 Industrial Center, will have approximately 800,000 square feet of industrial building space.

Harnett wants a high-level presence in manufacturing, retail, professional and business services and health care. “Cape Fear Valley Health continues to grow in Harnett County,” Barrington says. “Over the last year, they added a 60,000-square-foot facility at their Lillington campus that included a cancer treatment center. They are currently constructing an Adolescent Behavioral Health Center on the same campus.”

EXPANDING DEVELOPMENT

Kyowa Kirin’s impact goes beyond its factory and CCCC. Randolph says Sanford Area Growth Alliance worked with local developer James Goodnight Jr. to create office space inside the former Capital Bank Building, one of eight properties he owns in downtown Sanford. “And they’ve moved 55 of their employees there,” Randolph says. “So, we will have that live-work-play atmosphere going on downtown.”

Goodnight’s other downtown buildings are undergoing repairs and renovations. Downtown Sanford Inc. Executive Director Kelli Laudate says the Kimbrell’s Furniture Store is being repurposed into 10 market-rate apartments with three to four ground-floor spaces for retail. “Nearby, another building on South Steele Street is under renovation and will soon provide two additional opportunities for retail or restaurant tenants,” she says. “Both projects are expected to be completed by spring 2026. Sanford is fortunate to benefit from Mr. Goodnight’s investment and leadership as he brings not only a strong vision for downtown development but also a deep appreciation for historic preservation.”

The downtown Pilgrim’s Sanford Agricultural Marketplace is expected to open in the spring. It will be a regional hub for farmers and artisans and partner with N.C. Cooperative Extension for workshops, cooking classes and demonstrations on food preservation. A commercial kitchen will support local food-based businesses.

Travel 2 miles from downtown Sanford, and you’ll find Riverbirch Shopping Center in an underserved corner of the city. In late September, Sanford City Council approved $4.4 million in incentives for Ohio-based Casto to redevelop the center, which is expected to include a Target and regional grocery store by 2030. The $64 million project aims to revive the former retail hub and marks Target’s first Lee County location.

Laudate says work on Kyowa Kirin’s office space was completed earlier this year. It signified something bigger than a place to put desks, chairs and workers. “What’s most important is the broader impact,” she says. “Bringing Kyowa Kirin downtown not only anchors a global company in Sanford but also strengthens the city’s ability to attract future industries to establish offices in the heart of downtown.” ■

WILD MEETINGS

Carolina Tiger Rescue gives large and wild cats a better life. It helps local companies and student groups build unity and give back.

East of Pittsboro off U.S. 64 is Carolina Tiger Rescue, a 67-acre sanctuary that’s gaining favor with local businesses, which bring their staff for outdoor getaways. Cisco employees, for example, had visited 14 times this year as of late September. Employees from Deutsche Bank, Epic Games, Google, Lenovo, MetLife, SAS and Whole Foods have visited, along with sororities and fraternities from Duke University, NC State and UNC Chapel Hill. “It’s like a team building exercise for them,” says Kris Marino, Carolina Tiger Rescue executive director. “I worked for big nonprofits for a long time, and team building is a big thing. They’re getting a day out, and they have a way to give back.”

Marino says the sanctuary welcomed more than 1,000 workgroup volunteers last year. They represented almost 100 companies and universities and contributed nearly 4,500 hours to sanctuary care and maintenance. “We are on track to reach similar numbers in 2025,” she says.

Volunteers help construct enclosures, work on roads, mow grass or do any other outdoor task that needs to be completed. Some bring donations or wish-list items such as paper towels. “We just appreciate them coming and helping out with projects,” Marino says.

Carolina Tiger Rescue is home to 55 animals — tigers, lions, servals, cougars, caracals, kinkajous, bobcats, coatimundis, raccoons and porcupines. They live in spacious enclosures that replicate their natural habitat. Most come from traveling circuses, mom-and-pop zoos or private owners. “Some of our residents have been confiscated by authorities,” Marino says. “You cannot [privately] own a large cat anymore. It’s illegal. But you can own a wild cat like a bobcat [in four states, including North Carolina]. We actually have a bobcat that was owned by someone, and when she reached the age and size where she was no longer a kitten … well, she lives here now. We have a lot of caracals that people thought were cute, but at the end of the day, they’re wild animals.”

Everyone who enters Carolina Tiger Rescue requires a staff escort. The sanctuary offers public and private tours, school field trips, a middle school homeschool program and internships. Tours provide an opportunity to educate people about the animals and their rescue stories.

“From an economic perspective, those who travel here, they buy gas, they buy meals and they spend money in Chatham County,” Marino says.

“We hope to have more tours and educate more people. For everyone who works here, it’s a labor of love. It’s a great job. We have about 22,000 visitors a year. Our goal here is to educate.”

Marino moved to Chatham County in December 2020, and she toured Carolina Tiger Rescue the next month. “My favorite animal was the massive tiger who greeted you when you went on tour,” she says. “I walked in and saw him, and I immediately knew I needed to work with Carolina Tiger Rescue somehow. The tiger’s name was Caprichio, and he was a big boy. He weighed 489 pounds. I started working as a volunteer. He’s what made me want to stay.”

Caprichio was born in 2010 and rescued in 2016 from a roadside zoo in Colorado. His hind legs were injured, and his back was bowed from metabolic bone disease. Carolina Tiger Rescue provided medical care and a home. A staff favorite, he learned to appreciate human help and spent hot summer days splashing in his pool. He died in October 2023.

Marino heads a 22-person staff. She says their affection for the animals is continual. “We have a memorial garden, and we have a ceremony,” she says, alluding to Caprichio’s service. “It’s very emotional. Everyone who works here loves animals.”

Carolina Tiger Rescue has 12 acres where it will build a visitor’s center and educational building. D&G Community Development, a national organization that works with nonprofits, is organizing a capital campaign, and Carolina Tiger Rescue has fundraising links on its Facebook page and website. An architect and engineering firm are onboard, and Marino is working with local officials. “We probably are going to have our groundbreaking on the new 16,000-sqare-foot building in 2026,” she says. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NovCC_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:20:53.232040

Together, with North Valley Thrive and Opportunity Stanislaus, the San Joaquin Partnership welcomed leaders from across California to experience, first-hand, the innovation, collaboration, and economic potential that define our region.

The summit opened with three regional tours designed to showcase local strengths and innovations in clean energy, local restoration efforts, the bioeconomy, and advanced manufacturing — including an Aviation C Innovation Tour that highlighted the exciting industries shaping the Valley’s economic future. These experiences set the tone for a conference that celebrated progress rooted in partnership and regional leadership.

Among the highlights of the week were remarks from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who underscored California’s commitment to regional economic collaboration and inclusive growth, and a governor’s candidate forum featuring four candidates discussing their visions for the state’s future. These sessions reinforced the importance of sustained investment and engagement in California’s diverse regions.

I want to extend my sincere gratitude to Mayor Christina Fugazi for her leadership and hospitality throughout the summit. Her presence and engagement underscored Stockton’s commitment to collaboration and growth. Appreciation is also due to Vice Mayor Jason Lee, the Stockton City Council, and Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom for their continued partnership and advocacy on behalf of our region.

A special thank-you to Chief Stanley McFadden and Officer Richard Buckley of the Stockton Police Department Air Unit for the national anthem helicopter flyover at the regional reception — a moment that captured our community’s pride and professionalism. Appreciation also goes to Chief Bryan Carr and the Stockton Fire Department for their support in helping us close the event with a spectacular fireworks display at Banner Island Ballpark.

The summit was far more than a three-day conference. It was an opportunity to highlight the North San Joaquin Valley’s growing role in shaping California’s economic future. Thanks to the hard work of the San Joaquin Partnership team, iHub San Joaquin, and the San Joaquin Community Foundation, along with our sponsors — Valley Strong Credit Union, A.G. Spanos Companies, American Medical Response (AMR), California Strawberry Commission, Collins Electric, CSU Stanislaus, the Reinvent Stockton Foundation, and California Water Service — we delivered a powerful message: Our region is open for business, full of talent, and ready to lead.

Not often do we have the chance to tell our story on such a large stage. This milestone event marked a proud moment, not just for Stockton, but for the entire North San Joaquin Valley. It showcased our capacity to lead, to partner, and reminded everyone that our region is resilient and full of promise.

As we look ahead, the San Joaquin Partnership remains focused on building on this momentum and attracting investment, fostering innovation, and creating pathways for shared prosperity.

To all who contributed to this success, thank you for representing our community with pride. Together, we showed that when Stockton shows up, we shine.

The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.

Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.

“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”

He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”

Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.

But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.

And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.

“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.

Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”

Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.

Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-1024x6001762002510.jpg?h=e8f379d2&itok=D-NxR1-J,N,,2025-11-01 12:07:19.588763

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me. As I say in the Sunday videos over on Take Two, I hope you’re well, safe, and with someone you care about who also cares for you.

We start today’s show in Tokyo, where the Japan Mobility Show took place this week.

The event featured a range of new vehicles and concept teases — including BYD’s first Kei car for Japan, the all-electric BYD Racco, powered by a 20-kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack. Japanese brands also leaned into EVs, with Toyota previewing the next-generation Corolla as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full EV. It also unveiled the IMV Origin EV, a modular skateboard platform, and several HiAce EV concepts. Nissan debuted its solar roof for the Sakura EV, promising up to thirty miles of range per day from solar alone. And Honda introduced two standouts: the Honda 0 Alpha crossover and the Super-One Prototype — a sportier N-One with a body kit, simulated engine noise, and gear shifts — headed for production in Japan, the UK, and select markets next year.

The U.S. administration’s shifting stance on green energy and transportation continues to send shockwaves worldwide.

This week, Manager Magazin in Germany reported that the Volkswagen Group plans up to twelve billion euros in cost cuts next year, largely due to changing U.S. demand and weak EV sales in other markets. U.S. production of the ID.4 is expected to remain paused for a significant period, while future imports to the U.S. remain uncertain. Meanwhile, GM extended layoffs, cutting three thousand three hundred staff across Factory Zero in Detroit, its Ohio Ultium facility, and its Ultium plant in Tennessee. While these layoffs are temporary until early next year, GM blames the “evolving regulatory environment.” In other words, President Trump—a man so anti-EV he thinks magnets stop working when wet and wants aircraft carriers to return to “steam-powered” lifts—continues to shape U.S. policy.

And if that story wasn’t enough bad news, Ford added to it this week by officially confirming its F150 Lightning production facility is shuttered until further notice.

You might assume this is simply a sales-driven reduction, but the real reason is different: Ford’s key aluminum supplier, Novelis, suffered a massive factory fire a few weeks ago, creating a shortage of the metal used in all F150s. For now, Ford says it is prioritizing its available aluminum for internal combustion and hybrid F150s. Financially, it makes sense—the internal combustion F150 is Ford’s largest seller—but the company also claims that model uses less aluminum per truck than the Lightning. Still, it’s disappointing given that the F150 Lightning was the U.S.’s best-selling electric pickup last quarter. Ford can do better.

No matter how many times you try to bust EV myths, someone, somewhere is always ready to jump into a comment section or Reddit thread to tell you just how wrong you are.

One of the most persistent myths is that EV battery packs will require replacement after a few years, posing a threat to anyone buying a used EV. For those who enjoy a little FUD-busting, new data from Swedish used-car marketplace Kvdbil examined the health of battery packs in over one thousand three hundred used plug-in vehicles—more than half battery electric—and found that eighty percent retained more than ninety percent of their original capacity, though odometer readings weren’t reported. The EVs showing the least degradation were the Kia EV6, Kia e-Niro, Tesla Model Y, and Opel Mokka-e. The Mazda MX-30 also ranked well, likely because its low volume and short range mean high-mileage examples are extremely rare, making degradation unlikely.

Despite automakers’ efforts to the contrary, Europe is on track to ban the sale of new internal‑combustion‑engine vehicles from twenty thirty-five onwards.

As part of that shift, plug‑in hybrids—which still carry combustion engines—are also slated for phase-out. While they can drive in EV mode, studies show that in everyday use they often become heavy polluters once the battery’s range is exhausted, since their engines rarely warm up properly. Now Germany’s VDA (the German Association of the Automotive Industry) is proposing a built-in charging obligation for plug‑in hybrids, requiring regular charging in exchange for EU approval to sell them beyond twenty thirty-five. The measure is pitched as giving long-distance drivers flexibility while ensuring EV-mode use most of the time—but the words “relic” and “bygone age” come to mind.

As a triple citizen of the UK, the U.S., and Canada, I’ve watched as two of those countries have made my life harder—while the other has tried to make smarter choices about our future.

If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you’ve probably seen the kerfuffle this week after Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, green‑lit an ad on U.S. TV during the World Series, critical of U.S. tariffs on Canada and using excerpts from a Ronald Reagan speech. In retaliation, Donald Trump cut off trade negotiations and ramped up tariffs on all Canadian products. But Canada might have the last laugh: Prime Minister Mark Carney is reportedly considering removing all import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, potentially paving the way for automakers like BYD to sell there. While safety standards and regulations remain hurdles, continued U.S. antagonism could push Canada to adopt European—or its own—standards, shaking up the North American EV market. Good job, Canada—this could be game-changing!

Sticking with Canada, Nissan Canada has announced a partnership with Quebec-based Lithion Technologies to establish end-of-life EV battery recycling in the country.

Through the partnership, Nissan will use Lithion’s hydrometallurgical techniques to recover up to ninety-five percent of critical battery materials and ninety-eight percent of key minerals from used Nissan EV packs. Meanwhile, Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported this week that Nissan is preparing for scale production of commercial solid-state battery packs in its 2028 financial year, which runs from April to March. Details are sparse, but the paper claims Nissan is targeting double the volumetric energy density of its current lithium-ion technology—meaning that, if successful, Nissan could regain its long-lost position as one of the world’s leading EV manufacturers.

With automakers around the world seemingly less enthusiastic about Evs than they once were – and many news outlets doing the rest of the work to claim nobody wants EVs – good, solid sales data is always welcome to bust that bubble.

This week, the European automaker association ACEA released data from its members showing one hundred sixty-seven thousand five hundred eighty-six electric cars sold in September across the EU—twenty percent higher than the same month last year.

So far in 2025, just over one point three million EVs have been registered on European roads, representing a sixteen point one percent market share. Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands led the charge, while France saw another slight year-over-year drop, continuing a trend from the previous quarter. Although the ACEA—which has historically pushed back against ICE bans—notes that these figures fall short of what’s needed to fully transition the fleet to electric, it’s encouraging to see steady growth.

While our earlier story on battery degradation should give used EV owners more confidence, LG Energy Solution in South Korea has just launched a new service to ease fears even further.

Enter the B.Once service: it promises customers a quick five-minute state-of-health readout for a potential new-to-them EV, with a longer one-hour test providing more granular insights into the battery pack’s condition. The service is currently limited to South Korean cars with LG Energy Solution battery packs, and Revolt—a platform for used EVs—has already signed on. Meanwhile, in Europe, digital used EV marketplace Aampere secured one point six million euros this week to help expand its platform. It uses AI algorithms to evaluate vehicles being sold privately or professionally on the used market.

The current… Dear Leader of the U.S. hates wind turbines with a passion—especially offshore ones. While his Department of Energy and allies on Capitol Hill slow U.S. wind farm development, the rest of the world is charging ahead.

New data from think tank Ember, working with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, shows that outside the U.S., offshore wind has never been stronger. Dozens of countries, subnational governments, and regions now have twenty-thirty offshore wind targets that together point to roughly two hundred and sixty gigawatts of capacity by the end of the decade. Yet the report cautions that many jurisdictions could miss their targets unless permitting and supply-chain hurdles are addressed. Many European countries are already on track, while the U.S. is lagging. Don’t count the U.S. out, though: some states have set their own targets and are actively working to pick up the slack left by the previous administration’s abandoned plans. I bet the White House did Nat-zee that coming—probably too busy targeting people in inflatable frog costumes.

We’re now officially done with our Autumnal Patreon drive—but I want to thank everyone who signed up during September and October, and remind those who haven’t yet that there’s still plenty of reasons to support this channel at Patreon.com/TransportEvolved!

We’ve been making EV content for fifteen years, ten of those in the U.S., always aiming to be independent and impartial. We’re not backed by corporations or big production budgets. Our tiny team—three full-time and one part-time member—works hard every week to bring you well-researched, honest content.

In a landscape where YouTube is overtly silencing diverse, independent voices and avoiding many minority groups entirely—while highlighting clickbait and AI fluff above real content—ad revenue is falling even when view counts aren’t. Your support helps pay bills, health insurance, retirement, and keeps the content coming.

Next month, our annual broadcast insurance bill is due—something only people who operate as journalists need. It protects us if we ever report on a company or automaker who takes issue with our coverage—a situation I personally experienced once while still at another firm. The cost is five thousand dollars. Last week, we had to replace our wireless microphone packs and mics after five years of hard service. The new gear is AMAZING—thank you—but it set us back two thousand five hundred dollars.

Even though the Autumn drive is over, consider joining the several thousand folx already supporting us. You help me avoid sleepless nights and allow us to expand onto other platforms like PeerTube without relying solely on YouTube. And if you already do—thank you.

And now… it’s time for those last two stories.

Electric bicycles have gone from curiosity to mainstream in record time—and what counts as an eBike can vary wildly depending on where you live.

That’s causing headaches for lawmakers, especially in the U.S., where patchwork local rules and lax federal guidance mean some eBikes can outperform mopeds. The result: more collisions, pedestrian incidents, and reckless riding. In Florida, a Republican lawmaker has proposed a draft bill to curb e-bike recklessness. It would ban anyone under sixteen from riding electric motorcycles or scooters over seven hundred and fifty watts, require e-bikes and e-scooters to yield to pedestrians and use audible signals when passing, mandate crash reporting, and require a driver’s license or permit for Class 3 e-bikes with assisted speeds up to twenty-eight miles per hour. The highest-specced bikes—think Sur Ron—would be classified as electric motorcycles. Hopefully, the rules curb danger without penalizing lower-power eBikes, as responsibly ridden low-power e-bikes can dramatically improve health outcomes while lowering congestion and pollution.

Most hardened EV fans know the EV1—General Motors’ first production EV, a sleek two-seater leased to select U.S. customers at the turn of the century.

Nearly all EV1s, along with contemporaries like the RAV4 EV, Ford Ranger EV, and Honda EV Plus, were crushed, as documented in Who Killed the Electric Car? The few survivors were crippled and sent to museums, except one fully functioning EV1 at the Smithsonian. There are some rumors of others, but unconfirmed. Many RAV4 EVs, Ford Ranger EVs, and Chevy S10 EVs survived, thanks to leasing differences—and in the case of the RAV4 EV, brief sales, which is how both Kate Walton-Elliott and I drove RAV4 EVs for a while. This week, an EV enthusiast named Billy purchased an EV1 at auction for one hundred and eighteen thousand dollars, becoming the first person to legally own one. Originally leased in Colorado via Arizona, it was decommissioned, donated to a Georgia university, then abandoned in a towing lot. Billy plans to restore VIN 212 in time for the EV1’s thirtieth birthday—and perhaps give its former owner a drive.

And on that exciting note – we are done with today’s show.

But first, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all.

And in closing, some important words:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong. You have a purpose.

While politicians around the world continue to slide toward authoritarianism, remember: the way we stop it is through intentional action. Engage in Tactical Frivolity. Don’t surrender to fear, hate, or misinformation. That’s as true in Portland, Oregon, as it is anywhere power and greed seek to crush the will of ordinary people.

Don’t buy into division and cruelty. Empathy is a skill we must practice daily to preserve our shared humanity. Just like humor, it’s an act of radical resistance.

But everyone needs time out. Unplug, get outside, dive into a good book — I shared my current favorite on today’s show — and recharge. Care for yourself and your loved ones now, so you can return ready to fight for decency, community, justice, and a better world. Let your light shine — in or outside an inflatable frog costume.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. Don’t let hate or ignorance win. As always, keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ten_556_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:20:29.326860

From 2019 to 2025, at least 25 bills were introduced to advance energy affordability, transparency, and access to clean energy in Kentucky.
Sierra Club Kentucky’s report urges lawmakers to reverse course by reinstating fair net metering, requiring utilities to disclose disconnection data, and holding energy-intensive industries accountable for their impact on rates and reliability.
“This is about more than politics,” said Sarah Reeves, Grassroots Coordinator of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter.
“Kentucky’s energy future should serve the people who keep the lights on—not the corporations profiting from outdated policies.” The full report, Profits Over People: How Kentucky’s Legislature Has Undermined Energy Affordability, is available at http://sierraclub.org/kentucky/profits-over-people-report.","FRANKFORT, KY — A new report released today by the Sierra Club, titled Profits Over People: How Kentucky’s Legislature Has Undermined Energy Affordability, reveals how Kentucky lawmakers have systematically advanced the interests of utilities, fossil fuel companies, and cryptocurrency miners—while blocking efforts to make energy more affordable for Kentucky families.

The report examines nearly a decade of legislative activity and finds a consistent pattern: legislation that benefits industry moves quickly through the General Assembly, while those that would lower costs for households or expand access to clean energy rarely receive a hearing.

“For too long, Kentucky’s energy policy has been written by and for the utilities,” said Julia Finch, Director of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter. “Lawmakers talk about affordability, but the record shows they’ve repeatedly sided with corporate profits over the needs of working families.”

Among the report’s findings:

Coal and fossil fuel mandates such as 2023’s SB 4 and 2024’s SB 349 have imposed stricter regulatory requirements that make it harder to retire uneconomic coal plants. These bills prioritize preserving coal infrastructure over more cost-effective energy alternatives, increasing costs that ultimately fall on consumers.

Crypto and data center incentives, including 2021’s HB 230 and HB 775, have created tax exemptions and regulatory protections that encourage energy-intensive industries. These operations strain the grid, drive up electricity costs, and shift financial and environmental burdens onto residents and communities.

From 2019 to 2025, at least 25 bills were introduced to advance energy affordability, transparency, and access to clean energy in Kentucky. Most were never heard in committee, and not a single one passed.

The report also identifies a core group of legislators who have repeatedly sponsored or championed bills that raise costs for Kentuckians while protecting utility interests.

Sierra Club Kentucky’s report urges lawmakers to reverse course by reinstating fair net metering, requiring utilities to disclose disconnection data, and holding energy-intensive industries accountable for their impact on rates and reliability.

“This is about more than politics,” said Sarah Reeves, Grassroots Coordinator of the Sierra Club Kentucky Chapter. “Kentucky’s energy future should serve the people who keep the lights on—not the corporations profiting from outdated policies.”

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.
Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.
In 2024, the state’s 10 operating biodiesel plants produced about 350 million gallons, making Iowa the leading biodiesel-producing state in the country.
The IBB’s comments were submitted under EPA Docket ID No: EPA-HQ-OAR-2024-0505, pertaining to the Renewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2026 and 2027.","Ankeny, Iowa: The Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB) has called on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to move swiftly in finalizing the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) rule for 2026 and 2027 and to fully reallocate nearly 200 small refinery exemptions. In its formal comments submitted to the EPA, the organization warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing estimates from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services (WAEES) model, reports Iowabiodiesel.org.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said that biomass-based diesel contributes about 10 percent of the value of each bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S., adding that this support is critical as farmers face record yields amid uncertain global markets.

The IBB’s comments also highlighted the vulnerability of Iowa’s independent biodiesel producers, who lack the financial strength of larger companies to cope with extended periods of policy uncertainty. Kimberley warned that losing these producers would be a major setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating years of investment and removing key local markets for Iowa’s farmers at a time when they can least afford it.

The organization urged the EPA to reallocate all small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027, finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) before the next compliance year begins, and maintain strong volume targets to ensure stability for farmers and producers.

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. However, the group stressed that delays in finalizing the rule leave the biomass-based diesel sector uncertain and unable to plan future investments. Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.

According to a national study commissioned by Clean Fuels Alliance America, Iowa’s biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity each year. In 2024, the state’s 10 operating biodiesel plants produced about 350 million gallons, making Iowa the leading biodiesel-producing state in the country.

Xcel Energy has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.
The advisory group Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, formed in cooperation with Xcel, recommended that the coal plant be replaced by natural gas or small, modular nuclear reactors.
Trump has championed coal and nuclear power as energy sources while attacking renewable energy.
Hurd said in his letter to Wright, a fellow Coloradan, that the Comanche power plant is “a cornerstone of electric reliability in the region” and a lifeline for Pueblo County.","Colorado Congressman Jeff Hurd has asked Energy Secretary Chris Wright to issue an emergency order that the two units at the Comanche power plant keep operating because there’s a risk of an energy shortfall if the coal facility in Pueblo County is shut down when planned.

The Republican who represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Pueblo County, said in a letter Thursday to Wright that “the state’s politically driven rush to decommission otherwise safe, reliable, and efficient generation” could leave Colorado short of reliable sources of electricity.

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest electric utility, closed a unit of the coal facility in 2022 and plans to close another by the end of this year. The third and last unit at the site is scheduled to shut down by the end of 2030.

Comanche 3 is Xcel’s largest generating unit in Colorado, but one plagued by chronic malfunctions and breakdowns. And it’s one that hasn’t run since mid-August and might not be operational again until next summer.

Comanche will be Xcel’s last coal plant in Colorado when it closes. The company decided to shut the plant earlier than planned as questions about its reliability grew and moves to cut the state’s greenhouse gas emissions intensified.

Xcel Energy has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

But some Pueblo County business and political leaders say Xcel’s plan, which was endorsed by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, won’t replace the jobs and tax revenue the Comanche plant has provided to the community for years. The advisory group Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, formed in cooperation with Xcel, recommended that the coal plant be replaced by natural gas or small, modular nuclear reactors.

In September, the Pueblo County commissioners filed a document with regulators saying they would ask President Donald Trump and Wright to order that the coal plants in the county keep running until a new energy facility is built that can provide the kind of jobs and revenue that Xcel’s coal facilities have.

The plant generates approximately $200 million per year in economic activity and $31 million annually in property tax revenue, according to a report by the Pueblo advisory committee.

Trump has championed coal and nuclear power as energy sources while attacking renewable energy. The administration issued emergency directives to keep coal plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania operating despite plans to retire them.

Hurd said in his letter to Wright, a fellow Coloradan, that the Comanche power plant is “a cornerstone of electric reliability in the region” and a lifeline for Pueblo County. A message was left with Hurd asking if he has concerns about Comanche 3’s operational troubles.

A message was also left with the Department of Energy asking whether Wright is considering issuing an order to keep the coal plant running until a new source of power generation begins operating.

“We are in regular conversations about Colorado’s energy future with various stakeholders, including federal, state and local elected officials. We are aware that there are members of the community that would like to see the plant’s life extended,” Xcel Energy spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said in an email Friday.

Aguayo added that Colorado regulations call for the closing of Comanche 2 at the end of 2025. She said the unit has been a reliable part of Xcel’s generation fleet since1975.

“We are also aware that federal actions can extend plants of this nature,” Aguayo said. “We will comply with any orders issued by the Department of Energy to extend our coal plants if ordered to do so.”

Emma Pinter, chair of the Adams County commissioners, called Hurd’s letter to Wright “beyond disappointing.”

“Keeping this unreliable and polluting coal plant open is going to cost Coloradans tens – maybe hundreds – of millions of dollars, and it’s not even necessary. There’s no energy emergency in Colorado,” Pinter said in an email.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/TDP-L-Comanche-coal-RJS-10418.jpg?w=1024&h=768,N,,2025-11-01 13:05:33.617191

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/10/69053e247802e3.76442270.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 14:19:16.700453

“Primarily used in the food and medical industries, its accessibility, non-toxicity, and biodegradability make [soy protein] a promising material for potential applications in other fields,” says Shen.
The soy protein electrolyte also showed a significantly lower release of toxic or flammable volatile compounds compared to other materials.","Researchers at Tsinghua University, Beijing, have developed a renewable material made from soy protein that could power the next generation of solid-state batteries with high efficiency and long lifespans.

Solid-state batteries have been hailed as the successor to lithium-ion battery technologies used everywhere today from smartphones to electric vehicles. The core innovation in solid-state batteries lies in the electrolyte, an essential component of any battery that acts as a bridge between the electrodes, allowing metal ions to travel through it to generate electricity. As their name implies, solid-state batteries replace conventional liquid electrolytes with solid materials, enabling faster charging and potentially doubling energy storage capacity.

Development is still underway to make solid-state batteries competitive with other batteries in both performance and cost. A solution that is increasingly gaining attention consists of using renewable materials to make solid electrolytes, offering a way to reduce the environmental impact of battery manufacturing while improving battery performance and safety.

“Our research advances the use of green and sustainable biomass materials in the field of battery science and technology, contributing to creating a cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable future,” says Yang Shen, a professor at Tsinghua University and an author of the study. “Compared to traditional solid electrolytes, the high-performance solid electrolytes developed using renewable [soy protein] help reduce waste generation and minimize environmental impact.”

From soybeans to high-end batteries

Soy protein is a renewable, low-cost material that can be grown in abundance, making it an ideal candidate to make affordable, environmentally friendly batteries. The natural structure of the soy proteins allows ions to travel through them, while simultaneously enabling scientists to easily modify the material and tailor its properties to suit a wide range of applications.

“Primarily used in the food and medical industries, its accessibility, non-toxicity, and biodegradability make [soy protein] a promising material for potential applications in other fields,” says Shen.

To make a material suitable for batteries, his research team chemically modified soy proteins to increase their natural conductivity, helping lithium ions travel through more easily. The resulting material consists of a three-dimensional network of hard and soft layers that make the electrolyte tough and flexible at the same time.

A solid-state lithium battery built using this soy-based electrolyte was able to stably charge and discharge for 2,000 hours at 60°C. When the temperature was raised to 120°C, the battery retained nearly 75% of its capacity for over 800 charging cycles, showing potential for applications that require reliable performance at high temperatures. In contrast, conventional lithium-ion batteries are typically unstable at temperatures over 60°C, which severely impacts their performance and can pose safety risks such as the leakage of toxic and highly flammable compounds.

Additionally, the soy-based material could address a major challenge for many electrolytes currently in development: As a battery charges and discharges, a chemical reaction can occur between the electrolyte and the electrodes that deposits chemicals to create an interface layer. If this layer is not stabilized, it will keep growing with every charging cycle, slowly reducing the battery’s performance over time.

Batteries built with the soy-based material created a thin and uniform interface between the electrolyte and electrodes that remained stable over time. Moreover, the interface layer was flexible, allowing it to expand and contract with the battery as it cycles, preventing cracks.

A lifecycle assessment showed that the manufacturing of the soy-based material would have a lower environmental impact with regard to acidification, release of carcinogens, and fossil fuel use compared to other organic electrolyte materials that have shown promise in solid-state battery applications. The soy protein electrolyte also showed a significantly lower release of toxic or flammable volatile compounds compared to other materials.

“These results demonstrated that [soy-based] materials hold great potential in the field of energy storage and provide a promising route toward biomass-based solid electrolytes,” says Shen.

While more work will be needed to refine this material and make it suitable for large-scale production of next-generation batteries, soy protein could one day become the foundation for eco-friendly batteries with long lifespans. In particular, Shen and colleagues see promise for applications in electric vehicles and electronic devices, especially for any use cases where batteries may need to reliably work under extreme temperatures.

Energy storage company Torus Inc. raised $200 million in new funding to build a battery manufacturing facility and deploy backup power for utilities and data centers.

The investment from Magnetar Financial LLC into the Utah-based company is the latest round of funding for the renewable energy firm. Torus is preparing to open GigaOne, a 540,000-square-foot campus in South Salt Lake, where production capacity is expected to scale to more than one gigawatt within three years, according to a statement Tuesday. The company already has a plant in the state that can produce about 400 megawatts annually.

Utilities are increasingly adopting battery storage to support a boom in power demand driven by electrification in manufacturing and data center expansion. Backup power also helps bridge fluctuations on the grid to avoid disruptions. Torus uses a technology that combines flywheels — a fast-spinning wheel that creates bursts of energy — and batteries to keep the power flowing for longer. The combination helps the systems respond quickly to intermittent issues on the power grid, Chief Executive Officer Nate Walkingshaw said in an interview.

Torus expects its partnership with Magnetar to help bring in additional orders from data centers, Walkingshaw added. So far, the company has raised $300 million and is expanding an existing partnership with major grid operator PacifiCorp to build up to 500 megawatts of its modular power plants to cover seven states, including Utah and Washington. Torus has also signed a letter of intent to supply power to Portland General Electric.

The agreements, detailed in a recent report by TechCrunch, involve partnerships with renewable energy providers in the U.S., highlighting Meta’s strategy to offset its carbon footprint while supporting ambitious artificial intelligence initiatives.

These deals bring Meta’s 2025 solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts, according to industry analyses, positioning the company as a heavyweight in corporate renewable procurement. As data centers proliferate to handle AI workloads, energy demands have skyrocketed, prompting tech giants like Meta to lock in clean power sources to mitigate regulatory pressures and operational costs.

Powering the AI Boom

One key agreement expands Meta’s collaboration with Engie North America, incorporating a massive 600-megawatt solar project in Texas valued at around $900 million, as reported by Electrek. This project alone will supply 100% of its output to Meta’s U.S. data centers, reflecting a broader trend where tech firms are directly funding renewable infrastructure to ensure reliable, green energy.

Additional pacts include deals with other providers for solar capacity in various states, collectively pushing the total to nearly 1 gigawatt this week. Such procurements not only address immediate power needs but also signal long-term commitments to net-zero goals, with Meta aiming to power all operations with renewables by 2030.

Strategic Implications for Tech and Energy Sectors

Industry insiders note that Meta’s aggressive buying spree—following earlier purchases exceeding 1 gigawatt in June, per another TechCrunch piece—stems from CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision for AI dominance. The company’s data center investments are projected to require immense electricity, rivaling that of small nations, making solar a cost-effective hedge against volatile fossil fuel prices.

Moreover, these moves are reshaping the energy market. By inking power purchase agreements (PPAs), Meta is catalyzing solar farm development, particularly in sun-rich regions like Texas, where Engie’s project will create jobs and boost local economies. Reuters highlighted in a recent article how such expansions with Engie elevate their joint capacity to over 1.3 gigawatts, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between Big Tech and utilities.

Challenges and Broader Context

Yet, challenges loom. Solar intermittency requires backup solutions, and grid integration remains a hurdle in some areas. Critics argue that while these deals offset emissions, they don’t fully address the environmental toll of data center construction, including water usage and land impacts.

Comparatively, peers like Google and Amazon have pursued similar strategies, but Meta’s pace this year stands out, with total renewables now surpassing 10 gigawatts globally. As Yahoo Finance observed, these investments are as much about public image as practicality, helping Meta navigate scrutiny over its energy-intensive metaverse and AI pursuits.

Future Outlook and Industry Ripple Effects

Looking ahead, experts predict more such mega-deals as AI adoption accelerates. Meta’s actions could pressure competitors to follow suit, potentially accelerating the U.S. transition to renewables. With solar costs plummeting, these procurements might yield financial returns through tax credits and stable pricing.

Ultimately, Meta’s 1-gigawatt solar haul this week exemplifies how tech innovation is intertwined with energy sustainability, setting a precedent for corporate responsibility in an era of exponential digital growth. As the sector evolves, such initiatives will likely define the balance between technological advancement and environmental stewardship.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-b225740a-d370-4211-a908-87e914cdd5c6.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 13:59:31.551522

United States Senator Mike Lee of Utah introduced legislation titled:

The Fair Air Enforcement Act.

Senator Lee describes the legislation as stopping:

…weaponization of the judicial system by outlawing citizen suits under the Clean Air Act, which has been used by political groups to hurt Americans and their businesses.

Almost every federal environmental statute includes a “citizen suit” provision which allows a citizen to enforce environmental laws directly by bringing federal judicial actions against facilities that are allegedly violating the federal environmental statutes or regulations. The various citizen suit provisions in the federal environmental statutes generally allow individuals or groups to file an action in federal court against any person or any governmental instrumentality or agency currently violating a federal environmental statute’s requirements.

The argument in favor of federal environmental citizen suits is that enforcement agencies lack the resources to address all facilities violating federal environmental laws or regulations. Such provisions allow plaintiffs to ask a federal court to impose civil penalties for a source’s violations. Further, they can request injunctive relief (i.e., request an order from the court requiring a facility to take specific actions to correct compliance problems and avoid future violations).

Note that a citizen or non-profit organization seeking to file such federal action must first serve the alleged violator, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and any relevant state agency with certain notices that identify the alleges violations. This provides a grace period in which the alleged violator can come into compliance, or the EPA or state agency can file its own action which may then preclude citizen enforcement.

The Fair Enforcement Act would:

Amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit lawsuits by private citizens alleging violations of its provisions.

Require such enforcement lawsuits to be brought by state governments and relevant agencies.

Make conforming changes to other sections of U.S. code referencing the amended provision.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 12:06:53.613680

IN THE SPOTLIGHT: After four years operating largely behind the scenes as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s top climate adviser, Lauren Sanchez is now out front in the state’s fight to defend its ambitious goals from an unrelenting Trump administration.

Sanchez was sworn in earlier this month as chair of the California Air Resources Board. She steps into the role at a crucial moment for the agency, as it tries to preserve its authority to regulate vehicle emissions standards and works to keep its climate ambitions intact as the federal government retreats from international goals — all while developing regulations for critical programs like cap-and-trade.

Sanchez, who was a key negotiator for Newsom as the governor and state lawmakers hammered out a last-minute energy and gasoline affordability package at the end of the legislative session earlier this year, must now try to strike a delicate balance between efforts to reduce emissions without pushing California’s already high cost-of-living higher.

Sanchez spoke to POLITICO about her time advising Newsom on climate policy, the state’s role in countering the Trump administration and her top policy targets as CARB chair.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Do you talk with the governor about the politics of climate as an issue? And how do you calibrate how far to go and where not to go?

His north star on this issue continues to be our international leadership. He is in the business of ensuring that California is relevant in the future economy. If you look into the future 5-10 years, we’re going to have a number of electro states, not petro states. It’s said that China is already the first electro state. I think that the governor has seen things we have been able to do here in California, crises we have been able to respond to.

I’ll give you two examples. Coming into office with the Paradise fire and then doubling down on investments, on forest management, fire protection, and using AI for early fire protection. And then I turned to battery deployment. He came into office [with the state] at 770 megawatts [of battery storage]. The CARB scoping plan from 2017 did not envision a role for battery storage. We had the rolling blackouts of 2020, and the state’s response to that is an enormous deployment of batteries, such that now we haven’t even had a flex alert in the last three years. We’re almost at, we’re at 16 gigawatts of battery storage. And I’ll tell you, when we travel the world, one of the questions the governor gets from developed economies that are hitting higher levels of renewable penetration is, “How do you deal with intermittency?” And we’re able to point to the track record on battery storage.

As you reflect on this new role, how does it differ from working as an adviser to Newsom? Do you have a different constituency or different goals?

I am held accountable by my appointing authority, the governor, and still remain close to him. I’m familiar with his priorities and what he’s working on, but I’m one of 16 members on the California Air Resources Board. In my first few weeks here as chair, I have spent time getting to know each of them. A number of them are Governor appointees. Some are appointed by the legislature, and a big part of this job now is making sure that the board continues to guide this agency and staff in the direction of laying the track record for climate action and economic growth going hand in hand.

I’ll also say, distinctly different from my climate advisory role, is all of the work the board is doing on clean air and air quality. One of my first constituency meetings was visiting the San Joaquin Valley Air District, and their board and stakeholders are really focused on cleaning the air in the valley. I think a number of stakeholder relationships that I bring from my former job will continue to be really relevant to CARB’s work, and continuing to work with the governor, the Legislature, who have given us a handful of legislative mandates that now we are again rolling up our sleeves to make sure we implement.

Aside from cap-and-trade, are there any other big-ticket items that you’re anticipating bringing to the board next year?

We have two additional important pieces of legislation to bring to the board next year. SB 905, regarding carbon removal and our regulatory framework for that, which is a big part of how we’re going to reach carbon neutrality. Sen. [Anna] Caballero’s bill from our first climate package. And SB 253 and 261, around corporate disclosure. A lot of stakeholder interest in both of those. Those will be big items to bring to the board. Just next month, we are bringing the landfill methane regulation to the board. Methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide; our best chance at staving off near-term warming is addressing methane.

You’ve previously said you were surprised by the effectiveness of the Trump administration at hampering California’s policy goals. Why did that come as a surprise to you and California leaders when a lot of it was laid out in Project 2025?

We are familiar with the playbook they used in Trump 1.0. The state had over 100 lawsuits against the first Trump administration, over 70 related to climate and the environment. We were largely successful.

We saw, out of the gate, the federal administration deploy a variety of new tactics. You’ve seen the governor comment on the role of Congress and how that is significantly different in this administration. You’ve heard the governor comment on the role of corporations, law firms, universities. The environment is very different. So, I don’t know that I credit the Trump administration for more sophistication so much as it’s just a very different chessboard.

The governor has specifically called out General Motors CEO Mary Barra for her role in rolling back California’s electric vehicle sales rules. What happened to anger him so much, and how close were you to landing deals with other companies?

General Motors, full stop, negotiated in bad faith and played both sides and continued to work with Congress. And I think ’s important about where we are now, and me coming into this role as chair, is that we’re moving forward. You saw the workshop that we hosted last week about what does the next era of regulations on clean cars look like in California. It is very much our intention to continue moving the next wave of regulations forward. We have gotten over 100 waivers from EPA, Democratic administrations, Republican administrations, and we plan to continue our long track record of technologically feasible, cost-effective standards that have borne the catalytic converter and the electric vehicle revolution you see transforming the world today.

Four truck makers signed an agreement with the Trump administration saying they’ll never work with California on another voluntary agreement. EPA is pushing back on CARB’s attempt to bring back its 2012 light-duty vehicle emissions rules. Are all bets off at this point?

The federal government and U.S. EPA have abdicated their duty to protect Americans, in particular Californians. Millions of Californians suffer from breathing dirty air. More than 10 million Californians breathe unhealthy air, according to the U.S. EPA, 1,500 Californians die prematurely from air pollution every year in Southern California alone. We have a federal administration that is denying climate science, that is letting polluters off the hook with an email exemption that is undermining their own ability to take on these regulations, and they will stop at nothing in attacking Californians. My response to them, and you’ve heard this from the Governor, is California will not back down. You saw the lawsuit on Monday. We look forward to defending that lawsuit, and frankly, every other lawsuit that has been filed against us or we have filed in court. We are confident we will prevail because of the underlying authority granted to California, full stop.

FORESTRY FRACAS: A fast-moving federal bill to improve forest management and reduce wildfire risks in national forests has split not only environmentalists, but California’s two senators as well.

The “Fix Our Forests Act,” S. 1462, would give the U.S. Agriculture secretary wide latitude to declare “emergency” situations on millions of acres of federal land, providing a work-around on environmental safeguards, reports Marc Heller for POLITICO’s E&E news.

The legislation spells out a couple of scenarios for fast-tracked thinning of forests and logging, which the bill’s boosters say will help prevent the worst wildfires by depriving them of potential fuel. But Ellen Stuart-Haëntjens, executive director of the Virginia Wilderness Committee, said that the “emergency” designation is so broad that it could encompass projects that have more to do with harvesting timber than preventing wildfires.

“This administration is redefining what we call an emergency,” Haentjens said.

California Sen. Alex Padilla is one of the bill’s main Democratic sponsors in the Senate. He believes that the legislation would protect some of the National Environmental Policy Act regulations that the Trump administration is looking to change, aides to the senator said. That includes ensuring public involvement as projects are proposed, they said.

Sen. Adam Schiff, meanwhile, has opposed the measure.

Their division mirrors one among environmental advocates: the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Wildlife Federation are in favor, while the Center for Biological Diversity and Earthjustice are firmly opposed.

The bill advanced out of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee with bipartisan support earlier this month. The House passed a similar bill earlier this year. — MH, NB

CEQA DEFENSE: After a legislative session in which lawmakers chipped away at environmental rules for construction projects, the Assembly’s Natural Resources chair wants lawmakers to strike a better balance.

Asked about the biggest hurdles lawmakers face going into next year, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan told attendees to a webinar Thursday that the California Environmental Quality Act — the law often blamed for slowing down housing and energy projects — is “still under attack.”

“CEQA, at times, has been abused and misused,” Bryan said. “But that doesn’t mean the idea of looking through a healthy and thoughtful, long-term criteria for what this kind of building would do to our environment isn’t important.”

Bryan’s appearance on the webinar hosted by the Climate Center came a little over a week after the California Chamber of Commerce filed a ballot initiative to further streamline CEQA and limit lawsuits against affordable housing, clean energy and other projects deemed “essential.” — AN

NOT YOU, CALIFORNIA: Widespread opposition to new offshore drilling has pressured the Trump administration to back off plans to open the waters off the coasts of many states. California isn’t one of them.

The Interior Department has removed the federal waters off the Atlantic coast from its offshore drilling plan in the face of Republican pressure, but still plans to propose allowing new oil and gas leases off the California coast, reports POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre. The plan’s latest iteration will also include a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but provide a buffer around Florida, a Republican stronghold long opposed to drilling, three people familiar with the latest moves told POLITICO.

The Interior Department is expected to propose the new plan soon, the people said. It could change before its final publication, and will go through a review process before becoming public.

A White House spokesperson declined to discuss ongoing policy deliberations, and an Interior spokesperson did not respond to questions.

California political leaders have come out in sharp opposition to the possibility of new oil and gas leases opening off their shore. — BL, NB

BUILD IT FIRST: Forget concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble: West Coast tech titans are all in on data center growth, and the electricity grid upgrades needed to fuel it, reports Jason Plautz for POLITICO’s E&E News.

If the nation’s internet giants overestimate the coming demand for data centers, Americans could end up footing the outsized electricity bills for new energy infrastructure built to meetr demand that never materialized.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg didn’t appear to be concerned during the company’s Wednesday earnings call. He thinks the right strategy is to “aggressively front-load building capacity” — though he acknowledged that it’s “of course possible to overshoot.”

Worst case, he said, is “we effectively have just prebuilt for a couple of years ... but we’d grow into that and use it over time.”

Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said during her company’s earnings call Wednesday that she has “very high” confidence that all the data centers will be needed. Executives from Amazon and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, expressed similar confidence in moving forward with data center construction.

Those decisions are having ripple effects across the country. American Electric Power— a utility spanning parts of 11 states — increased its five-year capital spending plan by nearly 30 percent in order to meet data center needs. — JP, NB

The kingdom is aware that fossil fuels, the source of its fabulous wealth, are on their way out. Its leaders want to have a modern electro-state in place when the pumps fall idle.

The UNDP officials say that Saudi Arabia has connected over 10 gigawatts of renewable energy to its grid and has another 33 gigawatts in the pipeline. Saudi officials want to install 20 gigawatts of green energy every year, so as to reach their goal of 50% of the grid in only 5 years. They write, “Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history.”

It is an astonishing statistic, though it should be put into context. China is the country that has put in the most solar, and in quantities that dwarf that of the Saudis. It is just that they have been working at it for a while. Saudi Arabia, having spent six years preparing the stage, is now taking off like a rocket.

Saudi Arabia also already has 2 gigawatts of battery storage in place, ensuring that it can store wind and solar energy for when the wind dies down or for night time use. It has another 5.5 gigawatts of battery storage in the pipeline, and wants to double that by 2030.

(Remember, make the checks out to “Juan Cole” or they can’t be cashed)

Although it may seem paradoxical for an oil state like Saudi Arabia to go big into wind and solar, it makes perfect economic sense, as I have argued elsewhere. About 38% of Saudi power plants use petroleum and 62% of electricity generation is done by domestically produced fossil gas. Wind and solar are cheaper ways of making electricity domestically. As long as some countries in the outside world will buy Saudi oil and gas, it makes much more economic sense to export those commodities for a profit than to use them up at home, with a government subsidy. In a recent year, Saudi Arabia lost $11 billion on energy generation, and demand is increasing 10% a year. The kingdom needs renewables for its economic health.

The Saudis are having China’s Goldwind (“the Huawei of green energy”) build for it the largest wind farm in the world near Riyadh, with a nameplate capacity of 3 gigawatts when it is finished early in 2028, only a little over 2 years from now. This project is an example of China’s mature and sophisticated clean energy technology being deployed to help an oil giant move away from fossil fuels.

There was a time when a massive power plant in the global south would have been built by American firms, but the backward Republican Party with its bondage to Big Oil is killing the American green energy industries. So it is Chinese firms that are picking up these contracts. One partner in the consortium along with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) is the Arabian American Oil Company, ARAMCO, which developed Saudi oil in the late forties and fifties. Originally American-dominated, it was nationalized by the Saudis in the 1970s. Despite its name, therefore, it no longer has anything to do with America. ARAMCO is a partner in the Goldwind project! Even it has taken up with China.

Goldwind is designing its wind turbines to function in the extreme heat of Saudi summers, when temperatures can exceed 122º F.

Another big wind farm, with a 1.5 gigawatt capacity, is planned at Dawadmi near Riyadh by a consortium led by South Korea’s KEPCO. It has achieved a new world record for the lowest cost of producing electricity from wind energy.

The 1.4 gigawatt Najran Solar Project is being built in partnership with Masdar, the UAE-based clean energy firm. It can generate electricity for about a U.S. penny a kilowatt hour, the second lowest price for this sort of power in the world. The only plant that is cheaper is also in Saudi Arabia. Najran, in the southwest of the kingdom down near Yemen, gets a lot of sunshine. But a penny a kilowatt hour? Fossil fuels may as well just pack up and go away. At their best, they are six to ten times that.

The kingdom has 7 big renewable energy projects in the pipeline at the moment, at a cost of over $8 billion, with a goal of producing 15 gigawatts of power.

“Solar Kingdom,” Digital, Dall-E / Clip2Comic, 2025

The giant Saudi green energy company, ACWA, announced this month that renewables in the kingdom no longer need government subsidies. The technology, mostly Chinese, has fallen in price so dramatically, and the kingdom is so well endowed with sunshine and steady winds, that sustainable energy is a money-maker in its own right.

ACWA Power’s Mohammed Abu Nyan told Sharq Business reporter Maya Hajij, “if it were not for technology, in which Chinese innovations play a key role, we would not have witnessed what has been achieved so far in the energy transformation side.”

He is convinced that large language models (“artificial intelligence”) will enable a doubling of green energy production. Abu Nyan does not seem to have said how, exactly, in this interview. But perhaps AI can help in solar panel and wind turbine design and placement for maximum efficiency. Data centers are energy hogs, but it would be an interesting development if they really could pay for themselves twice over by redesigning greentech so as to achieve efficiency breakthroughs.",https://media.juancole.com/images/2025/11/IMG_7190b.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 14:58:46.997161

Key topics discussed

Shale Revolution: The U.S. led the shale revolution, but significant shale reserves also exist in Argentina, China, and other countries. Argentina’s Vaca Muerta is seeing major growth, while China faces water constraints.

Break-even Prices: The Permian Basin break-even oil price is closer to $50-60 per barrel. $60 oil is about the minimum needed to incentivize new drilling.

Energy Stocks vs. Oil Prices: Energy stocks (as shown by the XLE energy sector ETF) have outperformed the underlying oil commodity recently, partly because refiners perform well when oil prices are lower.

AI & Electricity Demand: The AI revolution and cloud computing are driving surging electricity demand, benefiting utilities (especially those selling into competitive markets, like NRG Energy).

Small Modular Reactors: Small nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a solution for high power demand, but regulatory hurdles and the risk of safety shortcuts remain concerns.

OPEC & Oil Markets: OPEC is overproducing, keeping oil prices around $60 and trying to squeeze out U.S. shale producers, similar to past strategies.

California’s Energy Policy: California has unique regulations that make gasoline more expensive and is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil as it restricts local production and refineries.

Midstream Investments: Midstream energy companies (pipelines, storage, MLPs) offer stable, high-yield income for investors and are less volatile than upstream/downstream sectors, making them attractive for retirement portfolios.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Well, we've seen the price of oil stabilize. It's in the $60 range. Some think it could go higher. Energy stocks have done better than the commodity. Well, let's find out what's going on in the Energy Patch. Joining me on the program is Robert Rapier. Robert, I want to talk about an article you recently wrote for Forbes. It was called ""America's Newest Export: the Shale Revolution."" In it, you reference that perhaps shale may be plateauing here in the U.S., but there are some big shale plays out there. One is in Argentina you talked about, and another one in China. So let's talk about that.

Robert Rapier:

The shale revolution in the U.S.—I mean, it was born in the U.S.—but all along, you know, the Energy Information Administration was putting out these maps showing there are enormous shale oil and gas reserves in several countries around the world. And sometimes there are constraints. You know, some countries aren't really interested in pursuing that. In some countries, the environmental movement has made it very difficult to do. Some countries lack water. But one where it seemed like it would probably get some traction was Argentina. The Vaca Muerta formation has a lot of technically recoverable resources: 16 billion barrels of oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of gas. Oil majors are investing there, and the area's oil output rose by 27% last year. Gas went up 23%. Chevron, Shell—they're all investing. And Chevron has come out and publicly stated that this is one of the most significant unconventional oil reserves and has said they're going to be up to about 30,000 barrels per day by the end of this year. I expect that area to continue to develop beyond that. China has technically the largest recoverable shale gas reserves, but they're in areas where there's not a lot of water, so that makes it a little more challenging. But, you know, if they can figure that out, there are tremendous implications. If China ever really unleashes the shale gas they have, that could really reshape the whole LNG flows of the entire region and reduce China's coal dependence. And then, Saudi Arabia actually has a lot of shale gas and would like to develop that and save their oil for export. There are a whole lot of other countries with enormous potential. Russia's one, but they've just got so much low-cost conventional reserves, they've had little motivation to invest in their shale technologies. But, you know, there are a lot of other countries. Canada has produced some shale gas and oil. Australia has a lot of promise, but there are a lot of environmental regulatory concerns there. And then, you know, there are a number of other countries that are either looking at it or testing it. But if you look at the maps of the resource, you know, it's pretty scattered around the world. I mean, North and South America, across Africa, a lot in Russia, a lot in China.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing when you look at the price of oil. It hit a bottom in April and it's been hovering back and forth between, you know, mid-60s, lower-60s. And Robert, what's the break-even point in the Permian right now? Is it 60 bucks or is it 50 bucks?

Robert Rapier:

Do you know what it is for brand new? Well, it's probably a little lower than 60. It's probably closer to 50.

Jim Puplava:

Right.

Robert Rapier:

But right now it's not. $60 won't incentivize a lot of drilling. I think that's about the bare minimum for, you know, oil producers. They don't really want to see it lower than that. I think they'd prefer to see it around $70. And I think you'd see drilling activity pick up if there were a sustained period where it's back up in the seventy- to eighty-dollar range. You know, we've seen the rig count falling and the main reason for that is just, you know, the outlook for oil prices. Oil prices have been low, and the outlook is that they will remain, you know, in this range for the foreseeable future.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because I know the President wants to see ""drill, baby, drill,"" but if you're an oil company and the price is at 60, why would you want to overproduce and drive the price even lower?

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, that's the problem. I mean, I think President Trump is trying to make consumers happy with low oil and gas prices. But that doesn't make the oil companies happy and that certainly doesn't make them want to go out and drill. They don't drill because the President says ""drill, baby, drill."" They drill because they look at their economics and they say, okay, we can make money here. We think oil prices are going to be here. But, you know, if oil prices were at $40, President Trump could scream ""drill, baby, drill"" every day, and they're not going to drill. At the end of the day, they're beholden to shareholders, and that's—they've got to make decisions based on, you know, what their economics look like.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing because if you look at the price of oil, it's really gone nowhere. But then if you look at the XLE, since its bottom in April, it's up about 10%. So the stocks are doing better than the commodity.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah. And one reason for that is refiners are doing so, so well. When oil prices are falling, a lot of people don't realize, you know, the oil producers usually aren't doing as well, but the refiners—that's usually when their margins expand, when oil prices are falling. And if you look at who did really, really well in the third quarter, it was the refiners. All the refiners were up, you know, solid double digits. And you're seeing the midstream producers did okay. The tanker operators did extremely well in the third quarter. But, yeah, and also natural gas prices are high. So, you know, oil companies with a lot of gas production or gas companies are doing quite well.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, because, I mean, you look at a company like Valero, which has gone from 100 to almost 170. So not bad for a quarter.

Robert Rapier:

Exactly right.

Jim Puplava:

I want to talk about something else, and that's the AI revolution and cloud, where companies are scrambling to get energy. And we're seeing, Robert, and you follow the utility space, but some of these utilities are beginning to look like growth stocks again. And the latest move is a lot of the big guys, whether it's Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, are talking about creating their own power source, kind of doing what Elon Musk did in Virginia when he—I think he built two nat gas plants. He did that in about three or four months. And he's got his data center powered. Let's talk about that and where that might lead.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, and to illustrate your point, you know, NRG Energy, the Houston-based utility—that is a company that we put in our portfolio on Utility Forecaster a few years ago. And in less than three years it's up about 500%. Now that's a utility, for crying out loud. But the reason it's doing so well is they are not totally regulated. They sell power into the competitive market. And for utilities like that, for utilities that have a competitive power, at least some aspect to them, they are making enormous profits because these AI data centers are going in and consuming a lot of power. You know, I've had a lot of people ask me, why is my electricity bill higher? I said, well, the biggest reason is the AI data centers are soaking up demand that wasn't foreseen a decade ago. I mean, I've said before, in the past 150 years, there have been some really enormous revolutions that have changed our lives a lot. The automobile was one, television was one, the Internet, smartphones. And I've told people AI is going to be like that. They're going to be one of those sorts of developments where you'll look back and you'll say that's when everything changed. And this wasn't really foreseen a decade ago. And so, you know, there's an analogy here. The reason I think power prices are going to be high for a while: in the early part of this century, OPEC was not out developing new fields, and demand from China wasn't foreseen to explode in the early part of this century, but it did. And then OPEC was scrambling to try to get new oil out on the market. And what happened was they were late and we saw oil prices surge up over $100 and persistently stay there until the shale boom really took pressure off of oil prices. And I think we're going to see that here. We're going to see this power demand not be able to be alleviated for a few years. You do have a lot of companies out there—I just wrote an article for Forbes—where a lot of these small modular reactors, a lot of these companies are trying to develop small nuclear. And companies like Amazon are engaging and saying, hey, we'll build some small modular reactors to try to power our data centers. Because there's just not enough out there that can be built quickly enough. And so we're going to continue to see, you know, high prices. But for investors in certain utilities, I mean, you know, a company like NRG, a utility, looks like Nvidia or something. I mean, you look at it and you go, wow, how did this happen? And I can tell you my Utility Forecaster subscribers are really, really happy about NRG. It's been our best-performing stock in the past few years. But there are a few like that—you know, Constellation and Vistra—they were some of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 last year. And it all traces back to the AI boom.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I mean, we have utilities in our portfolio and it's just amazing how well they've done, especially some of the growth utilities that are near these data centers and providing this electricity. And a lot of these utilities, as you mentioned, like NRG, some of the ones we've invested in, are having—you know, they can sell independent power, so they've got a good portion of their business that isn't regulated. So they can make higher profits. Right. I want to talk about something else, and that's small nuclear reactors. I know China is moving ahead with this, and let's talk about the possibilities here in the U.S. and what are the difficulties they're going to have. I'm thinking of the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, which, you know, puts up all this kind of red tape.

Robert Rapier:

You know, if I had to guess, I think the Trump administration will try to clear that out as much as possible and try to, you know, clear the path for these guys. I think they can be at market a lot faster than a large plant. There are a number of players here now that are out and have developed their own technology. You know, there's NuScale, there's Terrestrial Energy. I know some of those guys, and I've known some of those guys for a long time. And so I've kind of followed what they're doing. A lot of companies now—there are risks that come along with that, though, and that is if you have a lot of players out there, there's more of a risk that somebody's going to screw up. And that's really what we have to be careful about, that everybody's doing this the right way. So when we talk about, you know, stripping away the red tape, we've got to make sure that none of these guys are taking shortcuts, because all it's going to take is one accident by somebody being careless or somebody, you know, cutting corners, and it's going to do tremendous damage. And we can go back to history and see that. If you look at the global nuclear power build-out before Chernobyl, you know, it was exponential. Nuclear power was growing by leaps and bounds. And suddenly when Chernobyl happened, there was an inflection point. And then when Fukushima happened, growth stopped. I mean, we saw nuclear power growth stop and, you know, it's just now beginning to recover. So, you know, that's the risk. The reward is with a lot of players out there developing their small modular reactors, we can probably get more to market faster. But we just have to be really careful here because a misstep could set the industry back a long time.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I mean, contrast these small nuclear reactors to, let's say, building a mega nuclear plant that—I think, what was the last one? I think it was about 17 years and $30 billion to build. Where we get these small modular reactors, they're more built like in manufacturing, like a regular plant. So you can scale it.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And my alma mater, Texas A&M, has been doing nuclear—I mean, they've had a nuclear reactor at the university, a small one, and Terrestrial Energy is partnering with them. So, you know, that's a good partnership there. The university has tremendous experience at this and, you know, you believe they can partner together to bring this to market in a safe fashion. I think if there is an accident there, the good thing is, being small, you know, the damage is going to be limited. If there is an accident relative to a Chernobyl, where a meltdown there released tremendous amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere and you have to evacuate for miles and miles around, the smaller modular reactors are going to be safer in that way because you've got a smaller amount of material in an area. But still, I think any accident is going to bring so much scrutiny and it's going to really hurt the industry. So you really want to do this the right way.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we need to do it because if you take a look at our sources of power for utilities, we're closing down our coal-fired plants. Wind and solar don't exactly do it. So, you know, natural gas has stepped in to play, but it seems to me the next big wave has got to be nuclear.

Robert Rapier:

You're absolutely right, it has to be. And I've said this for many years, that, you know, the fastest-growing nuclear power is in China. And if you're concerned about carbon emissions going into the atmosphere, you have to cheer that development. Because if China can build out nuclear and shut down coal or, in addition, use gas-fired power to shut down coal, that is the single lowest hanging fruit as far as getting carbon emissions under control. Because that's where all the growth is coming from in carbon emissions. It's coming from Southeast Asia, it's coming from India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam. Those are the countries driving the growth globally in carbon emissions.

Jim Puplava:

So I want to talk about—go back to energy demand for a moment—because anytime you see the price of oil spike, the IEA comes out and says, you know, demand for oil has peaked. They're projecting we're running 3 million barrels a day more than what we're consuming. My question is, Robert, if that's the case, where is it showing up in inventories?

Robert Rapier:

Well, I think countries like China have built up their petroleum reserve. And I do believe it's correct—I think we're overproducing right now, and that's mainly because OPEC is overproducing right now. And, you know, OPEC tried this a decade ago. They tried to put the shale producers out of business. And I wrote a Forbes article, it went viral, and I was on CNBC over the article. It was called ""OPEC's Trillion Dollar Miscalculation."" And I said, this is going to cost OPEC a trillion dollars. And it did because they crashed the oil market. Oil fell all the way into the 20s back in 2015, 2016, and they did shake out some of the weaker producers. But the shale producers tightened their belts. They came back stronger than ever. And finally OPEC had to wave the white flag. They said, okay, we're not going to do this again. But now they're doing it again. They're out there going, okay, maybe these guys are ripe to squeeze some of them out of the market again. And so OPEC is out overproducing once again. And that's why—that is the biggest reason we have oil sitting around $60 is OPEC has put it there.

Jim Puplava:

So when you take a look at demand, OPEC is saying that it'll go up a little over a million barrels. They're projecting the same for next year. It doesn't look like overall demand is declining, if I read OPEC's numbers right.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah, I don't think it's declining. I think we'll see with the next statistical review. But, you know, we may see it declining in the West or we may see it flattening in the West. Like, take carbon emissions in the United States. Our carbon emissions, you go back 50 years, they're about the same as they were 50 years ago. So our energy consumption per capita, or, you know, it's at least gotten cleaner, so we're not emitting as much. And that's the way it is with oil. Our oil demand has been pretty stable. But developing countries—you know, China, India—oil demand has surged there. And I think that's going to continue to drive it globally. What's going to drive it globally is not countries like the United States consuming more oil. It's billions of people consuming just a little bit more oil. And I think that will drive oil consumption over the next few years, as it has over the past few years.

Jim Puplava:

And let's even talk about transportation. I mean, I think, what is it, electric vehicles here are about 3 or 4% of the auto population? I mean, people are still driving gasoline cars.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And I always use Norway as an example here. Norway had triple-digit growth in electric vehicles for seven years, and they have the highest penetration of electric vehicles on the road—about 30% of the vehicles there are electric. And yet, oil demand over the last 15 years is only down about 10%. So the point I make there is California sometimes says, we don't need oil because we're building out all these electric vehicles. And I say, if you look at Norway, you will see, number one, you're not building out nearly as fast as they are. And yet their oil demand, and it's only been in the past couple of years it's really been affected. So the lesson there is, California, you are still going to need oil for a long time and you're not going to phase it out as fast as you think. One of the issues there, and it shows up on California Energy, the government's own statistics, is as this has happened, as the shale boom happened and left California behind, they have become more dependent on foreign sources of oil, and that has exploded. When you talk about oil as a national security issue for the United States still, it's because of California, because California gets a lot of its oil from the Persian Gulf. And so, if not for that, we really wouldn't be that concerned about what's going on over there. But, you know, if the Strait of Hormuz, for instance, was shut down, it would impact California and have dramatic consequences. And yet California has declared war on the oil industry and is trying to drive the industry out of business.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, and of course, we have the highest gasoline prices in the country. Our prices are almost $2 more a gallon than, let's say, what my son pays in Phoenix.

Robert Rapier:

Yeah. And one of the reasons is you've got very special regulations there. I will tell people, in fairness, California air is a lot cleaner than it was. You know, the LA smog issue from the '70s has largely gone away. But there's a cost to that. And you go, have we gone too far here? Would the air still be clean if the restrictions weren't quite as stringent? Because that keeps California's gasoline specifications so specific that when there's a problem there, gasoline can't flow in from neighboring states because they don't meet the California specifications. And so that's the main reason California is a gasoline island. They can't have gasoline flowing in from these other states if there's an issue. Typically, if you see gasoline prices spike in an area, you'll see jobbers picking up gasoline and moving it into that area to take advantage of those prices. And that ultimately brings the prices back down. That doesn't happen to any significant extent in California.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we got today's headline: ""Exxon takes California to court over compelled climate speech."" And by the end of the year, two more oil companies are shutting down their refineries here. So we're down to about five. And then by the end of the year, Chevron is moving its corporate headquarters after 130 years in California. They're moving to Austin, Texas. So California continues to drive the oil business out of the state.

Robert Rapier:

Right. And from an oil company's perspective, you go, if you don't want me here and you're going to be hostile, yeah, we don't have to be here. You're taxing us more, you're suing us, you're making it difficult for us to do business, you're trying to regulate us out of existence. We'll just pack up and move and you can deal with it. And if you want to—if you think you can run the state on electric, you know, you can run things on electric cars. I mean, you're still going to need all that jet fuel at LAX. You're still going to need diesel for heavy transport. But if you really want to put us out of business, okay, good luck. And that's why California's energy prices are so high.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's even worse than that because I think as of 2030 or 2035, you can't drive a diesel truck in this state. So how in the heck are they going to get merchandise to stores? So listen, Robert, as you look at this right now from the energy perspective, we like energy. I mean, a lot of these big integrated oil companies have refiners, so they're making profits on that side of the business. The dividends have been solid and they've been going up. Anything else that you think looks attractive here from an energy perspective?

Robert Rapier:

Well, I always talk about midstream, and with this AI infrastructure buildout, the data center buildout, I look at who is going to benefit. So we talked about NRG and the utilities, but the energy companies that supply them with natural gas to produce this power—because a lot of that power is coming from natural gas—so natural gas companies. But the midstream companies. I just published an article today for Utility Forecaster where I talked about how to build a portfolio for income in retirement. And I went through the different areas and I said have about 15% in Master Limited Partnerships and pipeline companies because they are paying 8% pretty safely and sustainably. You've got a company like Enterprise Products Partners, which is in my own portfolio, that's paid 8% as far as the eye can see. You look back, this thing is just a money machine and they are a pipeline and storage company and, you know, very safe. And I say for, you know, that should be a cornerstone in retirement of an income portfolio that's, you know, tax-advantaged income. So midstreams—I really encourage people, especially those seeking income, to really look at the midstream sector because that is less volatile than upstream or downstream and pays better income. On the other hand, it doesn't have as much upside when commodity prices are skyrocketing.

Jim Puplava:

But, you know, who wouldn't want 7 or 8% with the Fed lowering interest rates? Well, listen Robert, as we close, how can people find out more about you? You're a prolific writer. You write for Forbes and you've got other publications. Tell them about it.

Robert Rapier:

Right. So you can find me at Forbes. If you Google ""Robert Rapier Forbes,"" you'll find my Forbes articles. I write at least five articles a month for Forbes covering the entire energy sector. I'm the editor in chief at Shale Magazine, which—we cover the whole energy sector there too. But a lot of my articles will appear there, and we've got other writers there writing about issues that are important to the energy sector. I write several subscription columns for Investing Daily, Utility Forecaster being the biggest one. Despite the name, it's about all income-producing sectors. So, you know, we cover utilities but we cover energy. We cover upstream, midstream, we've got consumer staples, but it's basically helping people try to safely generate income. And then I've got a couple of others there. Also, I publish a free column there every Tuesday. It appears on the Investing Daily homepage and it's always—or it's almost always—some personal finance article, like, you know, we're in open enrollment season right now for healthcare. So I explained to people the advantages of a high-deductible healthcare plan, which I've used myself and can save you a lot of money. So I cover a lot. I cover energy, but I also cover finance and personal finance.

Jim Puplava:

All right, well listen Robert, as always, it's a pleasure having you on the program. Have yourself a great rest of the year.

Each vehicle will be equipped with two battery packs, giving the Holon Urban a total battery capacity of 114 kWh.
All that is said is that the battery system has a “robust stainless steel battery case and uses a compact, active liquid cooling system”.
It has not been confirmed whether BorgWarner will also supply the battery packs for the other production sites.","Benteler subsidiary Holon announced just this week that the first US factory for the Holon Urban autonomous e-shuttle will be built in Jacksonville, Florida. Holon has signed a preliminary agreement with project developer InLight Real Estate Partners for a facility covering almost 54,000 square meters. The groundbreaking ceremony is planned for April 2026, with commissioning scheduled for the second half of 2027.

Just a few days later, the supply chain is beginning to take shape: US supplier BorgWarner has announced that it will supply NMC battery packs with cylindrical cells and a capacity of 57 kWh for the Holon Urban. Each vehicle will be equipped with two battery packs, giving the Holon Urban a total battery capacity of 114 kWh.

BorgWarner further states that each of the battery packs will be equipped with an integrated, replaceable contact housing and a multi-pack controller. According to the US supplier, the NMC cells will feature “latest generation cell chemistry and benchmark-setting energy density.” However, no data or further information on this is provided. All that is said is that the battery system has a “robust stainless steel battery case and uses a compact, active liquid cooling system”.

BorgWarner will start production of the battery packs in Seneca, South Carolina, in the second quarter of 2027 and will deliver them from there to Jacksonville. Although the origin of the round cells is not specified, several battery projects have been established in the states of Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The supplier, therefore, states that the battery system complies with Buy America requirements and the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulation.

German supplier Benteler initially developed its autonomous electric shuttle under its own name, but then spun off the project under the name Holon. Holon unveiled its first e-shuttle at CES in Las Vegas in January 2023. Designed by Pininfarina, the electric Holon Mover is designed to carry up to 15 passengers. It operates automatically (Level 4) at a maximum speed of 60 kph and, according to information available at the time, has a range of approximately 290 kilometres. Production is planned at several locations, including Jacksonville, for the US market. It has not been confirmed whether BorgWarner will also supply the battery packs for the other production sites.

“BorgWarner has extensive experience with smart and integrated battery management systems and excels in energy density, scalability and robust safety certifications – all key components to this exciting new application,” says Henk Vanthournout, Vice President of BorgWarner and President and General Manager, Battery and Charging Systems. “Working with an innovator like HOLON is a great fit for our team. They aim to provide safe, sustainable and inclusive transportation solutions, aligning with our overall sustainability strategy and vision to create a clean, energy-efficient world.”

Flavio Friesen, Vice President of Engineering at Holon, adds: “BorgWarner is a strong fit for HOLON: their battery platform combines benchmark energy density with robust safety, cybersecurity, and serviceability. The modular, liquid-cooled two-pack system integrates perfectly with our shuttle’s packaging and uptime requirements, supporting not only our North American rollout, but also the demands in Europe and the Middle East regions.”

The forum was held by the Minnesota Nuclear Energy Alliance, a coalition of over 40 organizations aiming to repeal Minnesota’s 30-year old nuclear moratorium. Held at LiUNA’s facility in Minneapolis, the event featured a diverse panel of experts discussing the topic of nuclear energy. In attendance were legislators, business leaders, energy industry professionals, environmental advocates and other stakeholders.

“We need a firm clean, baseload solution,” Taylor Stevenson, CEO of Envoy Public Labs, said. “The extreme need for energy has brought nuclear to the forefront.” Stevenson said, warning that other states near Minnesota are advancing nuclear energy and may look to sell the power to Minnesota.

“Minnesota is way behind,” he said. “We need to open up the conversation about nuclear energy.” Other speakers agreed with this sentiment.

“To take nuclear off the table is a mistake,” Michael Noble, principal, NobleIdeas, said.

“We are seeing other states open to nuclear; Minnesota is an outlier,” Aaron Rosenthal, North Star Policy Action, said. “There is a real contradiction here. We want to reach the goal but not allow the most practical and affordable way to meet it.”

One key advantage of nuclear that was highlighted is that it can be dependably adjusted to meet demand day and night.

“We are going to need clean, dispatchable resources to replace coal,” said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner, Minnesota Department of Commerce. “You can run dispatchable as long as you need it, until you shut it off,” she said.

The forum also highlighted the economic contributions of nuclear energy, particularly in job creation and community development.

“Nuclear provides more jobs for a longer time,” said Kevin Pranis, Minesota State Building and Construction Trades Council, while comparing nuclear energy to other types of energy resources. Rosenthal also underscored the quality and sustainability of employment opportunities tied to the nuclear industry, noting the jobs pay well and positively impact local economies.

Other panelists included Philip Hult, Generation Atomic; Pam Gorman Prochaska, Xcel Energy; Darrick Moe, Minnesota Rural Electric Association; and Kristy Hartman, with the Nuclear Energy Institute. Blake Johnson, representing the Prairie Island Indian Community, participated and shared the viewpoint and concerns of the tribal community, which sits nearby the existing Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant.

Additionally, North Star Policy Action and Rosenthal presented a newly released report detailing the far-reaching benefits of nuclear energy in Minnesota. The report identified three core advantages: climate benefits, workforce benefits, and state and regional benefits. The findings highlighted nuclear energy’s minor carbon footprint in comparison to all other fuel types, including renewables. Economic gains include significant tax revenue for local communities, increased household incomes due to indirect jobs and stability created by long-term employment opportunities tied to nuclear power generation.

In a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Shortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2198893774-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 06:58:53.557473

The Kent Cos. has acquired 15 Chevron-branded convenience stores from Ponchatoula, Louisiana-based B&B Petroleum. This marks the Midland, Texas-based retailer’s entrance into its ninth state, Louisiana.

The deal, announced on Friday, also includes B&B Petroleum’s Subway and Red Bird Café locations.

The Kent Cos. is No. 61 on CSP’s 2025 Top 202 ranking of U.S. convenience-store chains by store count.

The 15 c-stores will transition to the Kent Kwik brand, The Kent Cos. said.

“We are thrilled to officially enter the Louisiana market and continue growing the Kent Kwik footprint across the Southeast,” said Bill Kent, owner and CEO of The Kent Cos. “B&B Petroleum has built a strong reputation for quality and community, which perfectly aligns with our family values and brand promise of ‘Making Your Life Easy’ for our guests and team members.”

The Kent Cos. now has 130 company-owned c-stores and travel centers across nine states, and it supplies fuels to more than 150 dealer sites across six states. The expansion into Louisiana is a natural progression of its five-year growth strategy, the company said, aimed at extending eastward from its Texas roots.

The Kent Cos. remains a Chevron Texaco brand partner, it said.

The owners of B&B Petroleum LLC, Art Bonneval and Jay Barzenick, said in a joint statement: “It has been an incredible journey building and growing B&B Petroleum over the years. We are proud of what our team has accomplished and the strong relationships we’ve built with our customers and partners. We believe this acquisition with Kent Cos. aligns with our values and marks a meaningful step forward that will allow the business to continue evolving and serving its customers. As we close this chapter, we leave with immense gratitude for everyone who has been part of this journey and pride in all that we’ve achieved together.”

WILDEMAN,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fast-chargers-expanding-quickly-american-131229919.html,"KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward.
This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy.","The Illinois Senate passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, also known as SB25, on Thursday. The bill passed the House on Wednesday, so it's now headed to the governor's desk. It's a move that's getting mixed reactions.

State Senator Jil Tracy (R-Quincy) issued a statement criticizing the passage of the ""so-called 'Energy Omnibus Bill.'""

“Democratic policies have created a mess for Illinois families, and this latest energy bill only digs the hole deeper,"" Senator Tracy said. ""Just when we thought things couldn’t get more chaotic after the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), this proposal removes crucial protections, hands unelected bureaucrats unchecked power to raise utility rates, and risks closing reliable local power plants while subsidizing unreliable energy. The result? Families face skyrocketing bills while billions flow to special interest groups and not to the people who actually pay the bills. Illinoisans deserve affordable, reliable energy, not this mess.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition says the bill protects consumers from energy price spikes and safeguards Illinois’ climate commitments made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward. At a time when utility bills are rising due to unprecedented demand for energy, largely driven by data centers, Illinois is taking decisive action to mitigate rising costs while solidifying our clean energy economy for generations to come,"" the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement Thursday night.

“The CRGA Act makes transformative investments in the most cost-effective, reliable resources needed to meet growing demand: battery storage, energy efficiency, and wind and solar. This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy. It is also how we step away from the status quo of Illinois families paying too much to prop up expensive dirty energy plants that pad the profits of out of state fossil fuel corporations instead of building cost-effective, new clean energy resources that are better for consumers and boost economic development. We applaud the General Assembly for taking action.

“As Illinois steps forward to responsibly tackle our energy and affordability challenges, this victory must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centers, the primary driver of rising utility bills, join the solution instead of continuing to be the problem. Illinois has proven that it can tackle complex energy policy issues while keeping equity, consumers, and worker protections at the forefront, and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition looks forward to working with stakeholders next spring to build on that progress.”

The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association says the sweeping energy proposal doesn't go far enough to address the underlying issues. The association said in a statement Thursday night the bill will result in massive electric rate hikes on businesses and consumers.

“Manufacturers need reliable and affordable energy to produce the goods consumers rely on, including food, pharmaceuticals, machinery and household products. Unfortunately, this proposal repeats mistakes of the past, raising costs on manufacturers and working families without addressing underlying capacity and supply issues that are projected to lead to energy shortfalls,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “While there are some provisions of this legislation we support, including lifting the moratorium on nuclear facilities, more work needs to be done to strengthen our state’s energy marketplace, protect consumers and encourage long-term economic investment. We remain committed to offering workable solutions, including advocating for an all-of-the-above approach that includes renewables, maintains operations at current baseload plants, adds new power generation, and invests in more transmission lines and affordable technologies.”",https://foxillinois.com/resources/media/a01141ed-4601-4554-ad4d-320d65970e2a-IMG_0532.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 11:21:06.745918

The comments urge the agency to fully reallocate the impacts of Small Refinery Exemptions (SRE) and finalize the rule before year’s end.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs — an estimated 2.18 billion gallons — to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly. “It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.",https://cstoredecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ace-logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:05:54.058593

Lower-cost batteries and EVs would seemingly be a byproduct, but Panasonic didn’t give the news agency details on production costs.

That’s when Ford plans to start building a lower-cost, all-electric pickup starting at $30,000. By the end of that year, Panasonic is set to be making a breakthrough battery that can add nearly a hundred miles of range to the popular Tesla Model Y, according to Electrek.

That’s about 450 miles of distance, leaving range anxiety with road dust. Japan-headquartered Panasonic is a key Tesla supplier that has long been making headlines for battery innovations. Next, its experts intend to develop a pack that doesn’t include an anode during production. It’s a move that may leave battery buffs wondering how the concept gets past the basic lithium-ion workflow.

“Interesting idea. I hope it pans out,” an Electrek reader commented on a story about the innovation.

They pull it off with lithium metal inside the pack that forms the crucial anode during the first charge cycle, according to Reuters. This leaves more space for valuable cathode materials. When a battery operates, ions move between the two electrodes through a substance called an electrolyte, according to a U.S. Department of Energy fact sheet.

The manufacturing method will allow Panasonic to increase capacity without changing the volume. Experts also hope to reduce the amount of expensive nickel needed for the cathode, the Reuters story added.

Lower-cost batteries and EVs would seemingly be a byproduct, but Panasonic didn’t give the news agency details on production costs.

Globally, 2025 EV and plug-in hybrid sales are expected to increase 25% year-over-year, to 22 million vehicles, according to BloombergNEF. The Panasonic innovation has the potential to provide another boost to the sector.

“I’m always wary of ‘battery breakthrough’ announcements, as they rarely pan out to anything substantial, but if they can deliver a 25% increase in energy density at a reasonable cost with longevity, it could be a winner,” Electrek’s Fred Lambert wrote. Energy density is the amount of electricity that can be stored per pound.

The company made news last year for innovations that promised a wider range. It has also been pioneering silicon anode technology to diversify component supply chains and improve performance.

Reliable EVs are already on the road, as the median range for model year 2024 is 283 miles. Each one that replaces a gas-guzzler prevents thousands of pounds of air pollution annually, according to the DOE.

What’s more, tailpipe gases are associated with health risks and deaths, according to Harvard researchers. That’s in addition to contributing to our planet’s overheating.

Certain states still offer perks for buying and charging an EV. And owners of the cleaner rides enjoy $1,500 a year in gas and service savings. Adding a rooftop solar array and a battery backup can provide free solar energy for charging. Federal tax breaks for the systems expire on Dec. 31, making fast action important. EnergySage is a trusted resource that can help you compare quotes, lock in all the rebates, and find a timely installer. The advice could save you up to $10,000.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.","FORT COLLINS, Colo (AP) — President Donald Trump's efforts to help the U.S. coal industry at home are being undermined by falling sales abroad amid his trade war with China, new government reports show.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,"" coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to ""keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.

More than 6,680 Mesa County residents obtained health coverage through the marketplace for 2025.
If a tax credit extension is included in the continuing resolution, the spike in individual insurance premiums would see more than an 80% reduction.
“We’re that one-stop shop for health care coverage — especially financially assisted health care coverage, either through Connect for Health or through the state of Colorado,” Cubel said.
“Their condition of reopening the government is that we need to pass the enhanced premium tax credits,” Hurd said.","Coloradans with individual insurance, commonly known as Obamacare or Affordable Care Act insurance, could be paying double their current premiums by the start of next year.

With open enrollment underway as of today, that reality becomes increasingly likely. However, there are still opportunities to reverse the inflation apparent in the new plan prices.

More than 6,680 Mesa County residents obtained health coverage through the marketplace for 2025.

“Right now, I pay about $450 a month for my insurance plan. I recently learned that my premium could double to about $900 a month … that is $6,000 more per year out of my pocket,” Aubrey Hix, an independently contracted business consultant, said in a press briefing.

“I’m an independent voter. This is not about politics for me.”“I don’t care if you have a D or an R next to your name, because I have neither. I care about if you’re voting to reduce my costs or not. I care about if you’re looking out for me.”

ARE THE NEW PRICES PERMANENT?

National Public Radio reported that the current government shutdown stemmed from Senate Democrats’ refusal to approve the continued government funding resolution that passed the House, primarily because it did not extend the credits set to expire by the end of this year.

If a tax credit extension is included in the continuing resolution, the spike in individual insurance premiums would see more than an 80% reduction.

When the shutdown started on Oct. 1, Democratic lawmakers intended to obtain that extension before November, when official prices would become available and enrollees could select their coverage for 2026.

Anna Cubel, who supervises Hilltop’s local enrollment assistance program (Health Access) for Obamacare, Medicaid and the Child Health Plan Plus, said it would have been ideal if the decision were made before open enrollment, but it isn’t a hard cut-off.

“If they (Congress) do decide to extend them in one facet or another, we’ll be able to reach out to our clients and have them come back in,” Cubel said. “It means a little bit more work for us, but that’s OK. This is our time to shine.”

She added that clients wouldn’t have to take action to receive the credits retroactively, but it’s advised that they review their options with the new prices to ensure they receive the highest-quality plan they can afford.

While Hilltop Health Access can provide such updates to clients, they don’t work with enrollees who select plans on their own or with insurance brokers.

Those who are not connected to Health Access should keep their eye on the news and the marketplace website to ensure they are up-to-date. Those interested in connecting with Health Access can receive walk-in assistance at various Mesa County Libraries locations through the first week of November:

Nov. 3 – Clifton Library, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Nov. 4 – Palisade Library, 9 a.m. to noon and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Nov. 5 – Central Library, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Nov. 7 – Fruita Library, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Alternatively, those interested can schedule an appointment by visiting www.htop.org/health-access.

“We’re that one-stop shop for health care coverage — especially financially assisted health care coverage, either through Connect for Health or through the state of Colorado,” Cubel said. “But we’re not employed by either entity, so we’re not biased in any way. We’re just here to help people.”

Colorado also made a one-time extension to its marketplace enrollment period this year, allowing residents to enroll as late as Jan. 15 (with coverage going into effect February). If enrollees select a plan before the usual deadline, Dec. 15, their coverage starts with the new year.

HOW LIKELY IS AN EXTENSION?

As of publication, with the shutdown still underway, there’s no clear indication from Congress on which direction it will take.

But there are two most likely outcomes: Democrats concede to reopening the government without an extension, or Republicans agree to include an extension in the continued funding resolution. Either choice would likely be due to mounting pressure over frozen federal programs and federal employees going unpaid.

House Representative Jeff Hurd, R-D3, said he has heard from many Mesa County residents and constituents across his district about the importance of these tax credits in keeping healthcare affordable.

Although not a permanent solution, Hurd said he is open to extending the credit by at least a year, but not through the continued funding resolution required to reopen the government.

“Their condition of reopening the government is that we need to pass the enhanced premium tax credits,” Hurd said. “We cannot hold the government hostage because of a policy issue. It’s wrong when Republicans did it, and it’s now wrong when Democrats are doing it.”

“…we need to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, temporarily, to help alleviate the immediate issue of skyrocketing health insurance premiums,” he added. “But fundamentally, the enhanced premium tax credits are just addressing the symptom, which is a healthcare system that is extremely expensive.”

He added that he is already on a bill that would extend the credits through the end of the year, but it cannot pass until the government re-opens.

That bill, the Bipartisan Premium Tax Credit Extension Act, was introduced into the House nearly one month before the shutdown began, where it has yet to pass since being referred to a House committee. It currently boasts 28 co-sponsors, 14 Democrats and 14 Republicans.

Many of Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress, however, said that the bill is simply “kicking the can down the road,” and will put the legislature (and enrollees) in the same predicament next year.

House Rep. Jason Crow, CD-6, and Sen. John Hickenlooper both told the Sentinel they believe the best solution is a permanent extension of the credits, adding that Republicans maintain full control of Congress and the White House, yet refuse to discuss any compromise.

“Working families deserve real relief, not a bill that puts a temporary (bandage) on the problem for a year and then causes health care premiums to soar again,” Crow said.

“Republicans must come back from their vacations, do their jobs and work with Democrats to pass a budget that reopens the government and lowers health care costs,” he added.

There is already plenty of existing research that shows that shipwrecks create a new ecosystem.
But whether they pull fish from natural reefs or promote production of new fish (known as the attraction-pollution hypothesis) has historically been hard to say.
Early data, according to Baillie, shows that the wrecks have attracted fish from natural reefs and created a habitat for new ones to reproduce, including those that are endangered.
“It seems to come from an earnest place of ‘we must protect and we must understand.’ That is incredibly refreshing to find.”","Sitting at the bottom of the Gulf of Thailand about 20 metres below the ocean surface is the HTMS Hanhak Sattru. Snappers, yellowtail fusiliers and bannerfish swim through the ship’s corridors,while barnacles, algae and young coral cling to the iron ladders and machine-gun on deck. Nearby is another wreck, the HTMS SuphairinBoth were intentionally submerged by the Royal Thai Navy in 2023 to create artificial reefs and dive sites. Their planned scuttling has enabled marine scientists to produce some of the first research on how much shipwrecks change the marine environment.

There is already plenty of existing research that shows that shipwrecks create a new ecosystem. But whether they pull fish from natural reefs or promote production of new fish (known as the attraction-pollution hypothesis) has historically been hard to say.

“It’s hard to get that information from shipwrecks because the majority of them have gone down by accident,” explained Piers Baillie, the founder and director of the marine research centre Global Reef, located on the holiday island of Koh Tao. In this case, however, working with the navy and department of marine and coastal resources, Global Reef was able to collect data before and after HTMS Hanhak Sattru and HTMS Suphairin were sent to the bottom of the ocean.

Early data, according to Baillie, shows that the wrecks have attracted fish from natural reefs and created a habitat for new ones to reproduce, including those that are endangered. “Like anything in science, there’s a slightly nuanced approach to things where we’ve seen potential evidence to support strongly the attraction side of the hypothesis. However, we’re also seeing that there are these juveniles arriving at the shipwrecks.”

This is important because if fish are reproducing on the wreck that means they can be used as a tool to boost fish stocks in a context where numbers are depleting owing to climate change and overtourism. If the wreck is pulling fish away from a natural reef, that may have consequences for nearby natural reefs’ ecosystems, but it could also offer species a level of protection from fishing. These shipwrecks – along with a handful of others purposely sunk in the country – are popular dive sites and the presence of dive boats acts as a deterrent to fishers, he explained, while commercial vessels are unable to trawl a shipwreck.

Shipwrecks already offer an alternative spot for divers to explore, reducing the pressure on natural reefs, according to Iain Suthers, professor at the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales.

Many reefs are succumbing to warming ocean temperatures, physical damage from boats, and coral diseases. Several species that live in the clear waters of Koh Tao, such as stingrays, groupers and bamboo sharks, are also endangered. But here, in one of the most popular dive sites globally, is some of Thailand’s worst underwater damage. More than 500,000 tourists a year arrive on the country’s wooden dock, many of whom are eager to spend their days in the sea with one of the island’s 80-plus dive schools, spotting whale sharks, turtles and sweet lips. Their presence puts the natural ecosystem in danger.

“We need to have a tourism industry that can see and harvest fish. We need to have these sorts of structures to improve the fishery,” Suthers said. “I think the future is in these areas of the ocean – less than 200 metres deep, such as the Gulf of Thailand – to use [artificial reefs] to facilitate the fish to harvest.”

The country has been installing different types of artificial reefs since the 1970s and has scattered thousands of structures, including other ships, along Thailand’s two main coastlines. “There’s been a lot of proactivity in terms of trying to pursue best practices for coral conservation, whether it’s active restoration [or] habitat creation, more than any other country that I have worked in or seen or even learned about,” said Dr Rahul Mehrotra, research director at Aow Thai Marine Ecology Center. Thailand has committed to the international conservation goal of protecting 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030 while also looking for ways to safeguard its own marine ecosystems, in part because of the tourism revenue they generate.

Shipwrecks, with their nooks, passageways and air of mystery, are a way of potentially protecting them. “Artificial reefs and particularly shipwrecks are providing habitats to these valuable, heavily targeted potentially threatened species,” said Baillie whose team of six scientists and around 16 interns spends its days wetsuit-clad, oxygen tanks in tow and research questions at the ready.

That such research is being supported by the government is significant, said Mehrotra. “It’s refreshing, as a conservationist and now as an ecologist, to see officials behind the nation seeming to take the future needs of the marine ecosystem seriously.” He believes that’s because of the Buddhist country’s spiritual, religious and cultural relationship with wildlife. “Its relationship with the sea and its relationship with wildlife is deeply ingrained in the identity of Thailand,” said Mehrotra. “It seems to come from an earnest place of ‘we must protect and we must understand.’ That is incredibly refreshing to find.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6cb51b9fc0d00f75f5c1fa81c666901c765b072/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56ce045ae69d391a4456e673af50ceb8",N,,2025-11-01 06:58:45.074102

On October 29, senior business leaders, government representatives, and international partners came together in Toronto for the B7 Energy Ministerial Side Event, hosted by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).

As part of Canada’s 2025 G7 Presidency and the Canadian Chamber’s leadership as B7 President, the event built on momentum from the B7 Summit in Ottawa earlier this year — advancing dialogue on one of the world’s most pressing challenges: How to deliver energy security and economic growth while accelerating the global transition toward a net-zero future.

The Canadian Chamber is grateful to have been joined by distinguished speakers and partners who contributed to this important dialogue:

A Defining Moment for Canada’s B7 Presidency

The Business 7 (B7) is the official voice of the global business community within the G7 framework, providing policy recommendations that reflect the priorities of the private sector. Under Canada’s presidency, the B7 is focused on strengthening economic resilience, competitiveness, and energy security while ensuring that sustainability and inclusion remain at the core of the conversation.

This side event marked a key milestone in Canada’s B7 year — translating the priorities outlined in the 2025 B7 Communiqué into practical dialogue and policy collaboration. The insights shared in Toronto will help inform the broader G7 process, including future G7 ministerial meetings.

Energy Security and Economic Stability Go Hand in Hand

In a time of global volatility — from geopolitical instability to shifting trade and energy markets — participants emphasized that energy security is economic security. Canada’s reputation as a stable, responsible and innovative supplier of energy positions it as a cornerstone in building a more reliable global system.

Speakers underscored that the path to a low-carbon future cannot come at the expense of reliability or affordability. The world’s economies will succeed in their energy transitions only if they can deliver on both. This balance — among security, sustainability, and competitiveness — was echoed throughout the day and remains central to the B7’s call for investment in a “secure and clean energy economy.”

Technology as an Enabler — Not a Silver Bullet

Innovation and emerging technologies were identified as critical levers for accelerating progress toward net zero. From artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure to small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced energy systems, technological advancements hold the potential to transform how economies produce and consume energy.

However, participants also noted that technology alone is not enough. Unlocking innovation requires predictable policy environments, agile regulation, and deep collaboration between the public and private sectors. At the same time, digitalization itself carries an energy cost — meaning that as the world becomes more data-driven, managing the energy footprint of innovation will be essential to sustainability goals.

The discussion reflected a shared understanding: Innovation must go hand in hand with good governance and international cooperation to achieve a resilient energy future.

Critical Minerals — Building the Foundations of the Future

Critical minerals — from lithium and nickel to rare earth elements — were highlighted as the backbone of the clean energy and advanced manufacturing economies. Participants recognized that these resources are no longer peripheral to economic strategy; they are central to energy independence, technological innovation, and geopolitical stability.

Speakers called for greater investment certainty, infrastructure development, and responsible mining practices that strengthen both domestic and global supply chains. They emphasized that competitiveness and conscience must coexist — ensuring that the race to meet global demand is paired with environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

Indigenous Partnership and Inclusive Growth

A consistent thread throughout the discussions was the importance of inclusion and trust — particularly in how Canada approaches its resource economy. Indigenous Peoples are not just stakeholders but key partners in shaping Canada’s energy future.

This was powerfully underscored by Crystal Smith, Senior Fellow for Energy and Partnerships at Energy for a Secure Future, and former Chief Councillor of the Haisla Nation, who shared the story of the Cedar LNG Project — a majority Indigenous-owned initiative that embodies partnership, equity, and shared prosperity.

Looking Ahead: From Dialogue to Delivery

As the 2025 B7 Presidency continues, Canada’s role is not only to convene but to catalyze — turning discussion into action and ambition into tangible progress.

The B7 Energy Ministerial underscored that no country, company or community can achieve the energy transition alone. Collaboration across sectors, borders and perspectives will be the key to advancing a future that is secure, inclusive and sustainable.

As B7 President for the next two months, the Canadian Chamber will continue to champion the voice of business on the global stage — ensuring that Canada’s leadership drives meaningful outcomes for businesses, workers and communities worldwide.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/69053e23a2e240.28948460.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 06:02:01.292354

From record-breaking events and major investments to new partnerships and workforce expansions, Arizona’s manufacturing ecosystem was on full display.

By the numbers

Arizona continues to outpace the nation in manufacturing growth:

10% increase in manufacturing employment from 2019 to 2024 — more than 10x the national average.

$39.2 billion in manufacturing GDP in 2024, up from $28.5 billion in 2018 — a 37.7% increase, nearly 5x the U.S. growth rate of 7.7%.

Of the 415 active projects in the Arizona Commerce Authority’s pipeline, nearly 70% are manufacturing-related, representing over 96,000 potential new jobs.

Semiconductors surging

Arizona hosted SEMICON West for the first time, drawing thousands of global tech leaders and setting new attendance records — a 60% increase in registrations and nearly 50% more exhibitors. The event reinforced Arizona’s position as North America’s Semiconductor Headquarters.

Key announcements during the week included:

Amkor’s groundbreaking for its $7 billion advanced packaging and test campus in Peoria.

Busch Vacuum Solutions’ new 60,000-square-foot Arizona Service Center in Tempe.

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

• West Virginia: +27.71%

• Ohio: +30.11%

• Pennsylvania: +30.85%

• Virginia: +19.78%

• Kentucky: +17.66%

• North Carolina: +24.17%

• Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and

solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid – coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

• Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

• Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

• Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

• Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need – or want – to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity – ultimately increasing your power bill.

“This fleet of quieter and cleaner buses is a great step in the right direction and a great investment.”","A new fleet of electric-powered buses will soon transport Burlington County Special Services School students.

The county commissioners joined district officials and a state legislator for a ribbon-cutting on Oct. 29 to celebrate the addition of 10 electric buses and five charging stations at the district’s Westampton campus. The upgrade to cleaner, environmentally friendly vehicles is expected to protect the health of students and staff and create long-term savings and benefits.

“We celebrate more than just an addition to our fleet, we celebrate progress, innovation and a shared commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future for our students and community,” said Special Services/BCIT Superintendent Dr. Ashanti Holley. “This milestone reflects our district’s dedication to both student safety and environmental responsibility.

“These buses represent more than just transportation,” Holley added. “They represent opportunity, clear air for our students, quieter neighborhoods and a forward-thinking approach to how we move our schools and state into the future. Together, we’re going to drive change one mile, one bus and one student at a time.”

The 10 buses are believed to be the largest EV fleet in the county. There are seven, 24-passenger and three 54-passenger vehicles. They will replace about half of the school district’s retiring diesel bus fleet, with the goal of eventually replacing all of them.

The school district purchased the vehicles from Wolfington Body Company using funding secured through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Clean School Bus Rebate Program. Wolfington is based in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, but has an office in Hainesport.

A total of $1.6 million in federal funding was awarded to the school district for the upgrade.

“The switch from diesel to electric-powered buses is an investment in a cleaner environment and also in our students’ health,” noted county Commissioner Deputy Director Allison Eckel.

In addition to the vehicles, the school district acquired equipment for five charging stations to power the buses. They were installed by the county’s Division of Construction Services, which hired skilled union trade workers for the project.

The division also assisted the school district with the installation of its new all-inclusive playground, and more recently renovated space at the Burlington County Institute of Technology’s Medford campus for a new video game design lab.

“The Division of Construction Services has become one of Burlington County’s biggest successes,” said county Commissioner Randy Brolo. “In 2024 alone, (it) completed more than $17.5 million worth of construction jobs, ranging from roof and elevator repairs to building renovations and bridge replacements.

“This skilled labor has saved county taxpayers millions of dollars on construction expenses, so we were excited to partner with the Special Services School District to use their services for such an important project to improve children’s health and promote a cleaner environment.”

Assemblyman Balvir Singh also congratulated the district on its upgrade.

“As a parent and a public-school educator,” he pointed out, “I can tell you from experience the extraordinary number of hours kids spend on buses, going back and forth to school and on athletic trips or other field trips.

“This fleet of quieter and cleaner buses is a great step in the right direction and a great investment.”",https://media-com.website-us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/image002-2025-10-30T160929.685.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 12:06:56.805889

The interview was edited for clarity.

Cecilia Holden has been CEO of myFutureNC since the nonprofit’s creation in 2019. Its goal is to boost the quality of the state’s workforce to help North Carolina thrive in a global economy. She previously had a mix of roles in the private sector and state and local government. She was the legislative and community affairs director for the N.C. State Board of Education from 2017 to 2019 after previously serving as chief of staff for the N.C. Department of Commerce. She has also worked for a private investment firm and IBM. Holden received an undergraduate degree from UNC Chapel Hill and an MBA from Duke University. She grew up in Whiteville in Columbus County, near Wilmington.

What does myFutureNC do?

MyFutureNC is an organization that is laser-focused on North Carolina’s educational attainment goal. Around the 2016-2017 timeframe, UNC System President Margaret Spellings and MC Belk Pilon, who is the leader of the John Belk Endowment, had a vision that we needed to close the attainment and skills gap in North Carolina that our employers have identified.

So they brought together a commission of probably

50 different influential leaders across North Carolina. They did listening tours, looked at data and research, and after two years, in 2019, agreed on a state goal. By the year 2030, it was determined that North Carolina was going to need 2 million people between the ages of 25 to 44 to have either an industry-valued credential or a college degree.

So, the N.C. General Assembly codified that goal into state law. And then later that year, myFutureNC stood up as a nonprofit organization to move that goal into action.

Why was it important to reach for the 2 million North Carolinians between age 25 and 44 to have a post-secondary degree or industry-related credential?

We wanted to build a workforce in North Carolina to meet the demands of corporations and employers moving to the state. And also those that currently exist in the state or expanding in the state.

We started in 2019, and then COVID hit. And if anything that elevated the importance of hitting the goal.

How is the group funded?

We are funded by private philanthropy. We got two government grants in the middle of Covid. One came from Covid relief money. And then we were asked by the General Assembly to conduct a study around the opportunities to have interoperable data systems to benefit our students. And those are the only two investments that government has made in the work.

Otherwise, we’re 100% private philanthropy. We’ve got national funders, state funders, local funders. The John M. Belk Endowment was instrumental in this work being lifted off the ground. The Goodnight Educational Foundation is one of our key partners.

How is myFutureNC doing toward its 2 million goal?

We started out with a gap of 400,000 people who were lacking a degree or credential that we needed to close by the year 2030. The most recent census data from last year projected a shortage of about 55,000, so we’ve gone from a gap of 400,000 to a gap of 55,000. We’re closing the gap, thanks to institutions like yours and all of our many education partners across the state.

We’ve got 36 phenomenal private universities, 16 public universities, 58 community colleges and our workforce development boards.

We’ve got the assets, we’ve got the infrastructure, we’ve got some of the very best in the entire nation.

What are the top three assets in North Carolina besides climate and logistical, you know, access to highways and airports?

North Carolina has it all. We’ve got the natural assets, we’ve got the infrastructure, we’ve got the workforce. And at the same time, we know where we’ve got opportunities for growth. So we’ve got a basic foundation for success.

Additionally, North Carolina has a lot of good policies and a lot of good funding streams. For example, we’ve got an entire rural division in the Department of Commerce that has grants that are available to rural parts of the state. We look at it as we are one state, but we have 100 counties and we want to see all 100 thrive.

Since 2019, we’ve had an increased interest in North Carolina economically. Did the increase in companies moving to the state challenge your goals?

The answer is the 2 million by 2030 goal was a factor in the economic growth. So that’s the good news. The goal was set expecting that North Carolina would continue on the trajectory that it was on.

If anything, we are importing talent, but we are both an importer of talent and we’re a producer of talent. The percentage of population growth for our state has been five percentage points over the last five or six years. We love to see North Carolina grow. And, the people that are moving into our state do tend to be more educated than not. So, it actually helps to close the skills gap. We are also growing our own.

What are the specific steps myFutureNC is taking to move toward its goal?

You don’t know where you are and you don’t know how to improve if you don’t know what the data shows. We break it down county by county. And so every county understands how they are actually tracking toward a recommended local goal. But it’s a lot of different key performance indicators, everything from North Carolina pre-K all the way through to labor market alignment.

I will share that 79 of the 100 counties have increased in attainment. We have 21 counties that have not. That factors in population declining or growth.

Is there a correlation between the data looking better in metro areas than rural counties? If so, why?

All 21 counties that are not increasing are rural. As you know, we’ve got rural communities that are resourced very differently than our metro areas.

There are a lot of different things that factor in. Sometimes it’s a matter of people who just don’t know how to navigate the maze of higher education. They don’t think that it’s affordable. They don’t know how to even go about it.

And yet we have 58 community colleges spread all over the state.

That takes me to the next strand of our work, which is things like FAFSA completions, which leads to federal Pell Grants and state need-based grants. And we partner with the state Education Assistance Authority. Our goal is to push the word that college can be affordable.

Or perhaps, they’re virtual options today or even our private colleges have great scholarships. So there’s opportunity. Sometimes it’s a matter of telling the story.

What are some of the challenges keeping you from accomplishing your goals?

We know that there are limited fund buckets for the work that we do. Not for our purposes, but for our partners’ purposes to be able to get some of the work done, it does require some investments from the government. So I would say purse strings is one sometimes.

Politics get in the way in terms of just being able to have a budget, you know, making sure that the state is moving forward. And the third thing is personalities. In this space, different people have different perspectives on how best to go about the work.

But ultimately, everybody has rallied around the North Star of 2 million by 2030.

So 2030 comes, you’ve achieved your goals. What’s next?

We want to make sure that whatever we do is systemic change so that we leave a legacy so that future generations have higher levels of education as well. And so we will not shut down the shop. There may be a 2040 goal that we continue to rally around. We know that North Carolina is going to continue to need a workforce. It may be that we narrow our focus on a particular strand of the work.

We want to make 2 million by 2029 and then keep rolling.

You were the chief of staff in the Department of Commerce from 2015 to 2017, under Secretary John Skvarla. What was the greatest achievement you saw in Commerce in North Carolina?

We came in during the legislation that created the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, which spun off the economic development arm from Commerce. That was a big success. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/header_power-list-interview_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 08:59:10.089785

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago. A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

* West Virginia: +27.71%

* Ohio: +30.11%

* Pennsylvania: +30.85%

* Virginia: +19.78%

* Kentucky: +17.66%

* North Carolina: +24.17%

* Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid – coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

* Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

* Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

* Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

* Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need – or want – to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity – ultimately increasing your power bill.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.newsandsentinel.com/images/2024/11/20211138/Image-From-a-Certain-Point-of-View-Op-Ed-1100x638.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 03:18:02.573309

Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this year signed a law authorizing a $1 billion private school voucher program, tapping the state comptroller’s office as the entity responsible for its creation.

The law grants Texas’ chief financial officer tremendous authority to build the infrastructure around education savings accounts, a type of voucher program that will allow families to receive taxpayer money to cover their children’s private school or home-schooling costs.

The agency’s responsibilities include choosing the companies that will receive millions of dollars to help administer the program, creating the rules that participating families must follow and producing annual reports on the program’s outcomes.

Former Texas Sen. Kelly Hancock currently serves as acting comptroller and will guide most of the program’s development before it launches next year. The North Richland Hills Republican filled the position after Glenn Hegar stepped down to lead the Texas A&M University System.

The comptroller is an elected position, and voters will decide next year who will occupy the role for the next four-year term. Hancock is running to keep the seat against Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick and former state Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, the other two candidates in the Republican primary who plan to run for comptroller.

State law provides the comptroller with a framework for how to structure the program, but the office will ultimately determine what exactly it will look like ahead of its official launch at the start of the 2026-27 school year.

Here’s what you need to know about the comptroller’s role in shaping the voucher program.

What does the comptroller do?

The comptroller manages the state’s money and collects taxes, estimates revenue and awards state contracts.

Texas operates a $337 billion budget and rakes in more than $250 billion in revenue from a variety of taxes, fees and assessments.

What is the comptroller’s role in shaping the state’s school voucher program?

The comptroller’s office will oversee the $1 billion program’s implementation. It will negotiate contracts with and select the companies responsible for helping manage the day-to-day operations. Those companies will help the state respond to inquiries, process payments and resolve complaints, among other duties.

The agency will also design the program’s rules. It will work with vendors to determine which private schools can receive state money through the program, when families can apply to participate, what documentation Texans have to submit and how participants will access funds to make approved educational purchases.

The comptroller must hire a private company to audit the program at least once a year to ensure participants, schools and vendors are following state requirements. The agency can close the accounts of students who do not remain in good standing. It must also notify the appropriate county or district attorney in the local jurisdiction of any family, school or company that appears to have committed fraud or broken the law.

State law requires the office to collect and publish annual data on the program, such as the number of applications it receives and accepts, participant satisfaction, and how the program affects private school capacity and Texas’ public education system. The comptroller is required to provide state lawmakers with the demographic information of participants, such as age, race and sex. The finance chief can also ask the Legislature to increase the program’s funding.

What has the comptroller done to build the program so far?

The office released the proposed rules for the program earlier this year. It invited Texans to submit comments on the proposal over a 30-day period that concluded in September and conducted a public hearing soon after.

The comptroller also accepted bids from companies interested in helping manage the program — officially called Texas Education Freedom Accounts — later agreeing to a contract with the New York-based finance and technology company Odyssey.

The state could end up paying Odyssey up to $52 million for its services over the next four years — $26 million for the first two and an additional $26 million for another two if the contract gets renewed. The law allows the state to pay the company up to 5% of the program’s $1 billion in funding, or $50 million, each year.

The agency is expected to launch its marketing campaign for the program around the end of October.

What else needs to happen before the program launches?

The comptroller has yet to open registration for Texas private schools looking to participate in the program, as well as the process for families to apply.

Odyssey and the comptroller agreed to a plan that sets a tentative date of Dec. 2 for private schools to register to become one of the options families can select to spend funds awarded by the state.

The agreement also set Feb. 4, 2026, as the date when Texas will begin accepting applications from families seeking state aid to pay for their children’s private school or home-schooling expenses. That window would remain open until mid-March. Odyssey will design those processes and the system parents will use to pay tuition.

Under the current plan, the state is expected to provide a status update for students it approves by May 1, 2026. State law sets May 15, 2026, as the date the comptroller must finalize the program rules.

The tuition platform families will use is expected to launch in early July.

What do we know about the candidates running for the office?

So far, three candidates are expected to run to be the state’s next comptroller.

Abbott appointed Hancock, a former state senator, as interim comptroller in June. Hancock is vying against Craddick, the Texas Railroad Commissioner, and Huffines, the former state senator, in the Republican primary. No Democrat has publicly expressed interest in the office.

None of the candidates could be reached for interviews before publication. Hancock, who is overseeing the creation of the state’s voucher program, has toured campuses across the state to promote it. In a statement, Craddick said that her top priority for the voucher program as comptroller would be to ensure “every dollar is used exactly as intended.” It is not clear if Huffines has any plans for the voucher program, but he supported its creation when he served in the Legislature.

Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report.
The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana.","New research shows a continuous pattern of air pollution violations from liquified natural gas export facilities in Southwest Louisiana.

Three LNG export facilities in Cameron Parish are featured in a report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit research organization.

Sourced from federal and state data, the report documents federal Clean Air Act infractions for each of the past 12 quarters – spanning three years – at Cheniere Energy‘s Sabine Pass LNG terminal and Venture Global‘s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal. The Cameron LNG export terminal in Hackberry has been out of compliance with the Clean Air Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters.

Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.

Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.

“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.

Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said.

“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”

While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include:

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators;

exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and

failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels.

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records.

“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference.

Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report.

The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.

Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids.

Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion.

“President Trump has aggressively promoted the liquefied natural gas industry, including by directing agencies to fast track certain approvals for LNG projects,” he said. “State and federal agencies should be slowing down and more carefully scrutinizing new applications for LNG export projects instead of speeding up permit reviews.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/3.-Depositphotos_LNG.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 08:17:31.198763

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.

Key takeaways

Benefits scale with cleaner electricity grids and smaller, lighter vehicle models.

Electrifying buses, taxis and delivery fleets yields faster air-quality wins than private cars alone.

Battery recycling & renewable charging will define the next wave of carbon savings.

Together, these shifts show the EV transition is already transforming the climate and energy balance of whole economies.

Why some countries are winning the EV race

Scale & cost: High-volume battery and vehicle manufacturing slashes prices.

Incentives & standards: Zero-emission mandates and tax credits nudge buyers and fleets.

Charging build-out: Fast-charging corridors and workplace charging reduce range anxiety.

Model availability: Broader line-ups (SUVs, city cars, vans) unlock mainstream demand.

What most posts miss

Export dynamics: Cross-border EV exports (especially from Asia) reshape global prices.

Grid impact vs smart charging: Managed charging can cut peak load stress drastically.

Oil displacement: EVs are already reducing oil use — watch the feedback loop with fuel prices.

Battery recycling gap: Secondary use & recycling must scale to match sales growth.

Beyond cars: energy, jobs and supply chains

Energy: EV charging adds new electricity demand — smart charging + renewables smooth the curve.

Jobs: Growth in battery cells, power electronics, software and charging operations.

But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.
Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years.
“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.
“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said.","Making electric vehicles and their batteries is a dirty process that uses a lot of energy. But a new study says that EVs quickly make up for that with less overall emissions through two years of use than a gas-powered vehicle.

The study also estimated that gas-powered vehicles cause at least twice as much environmental damage over their lifetimes as EVs, and said the benefits of EVs can be expected to increase in coming decades as clean sources of power, such as solar and wind, are brought onto the grid.

The work by researchers from Northern Arizona University and Duke University, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS Climate, offers insight into a transportation sector that makes up a big part of U.S. emissions. It also comes as some EV skeptics have raised concerns about whether the environmental impact of battery production, including mining, makes it worthwhile to switch to electric.

“While there is a bigger carbon footprint in the very short term because of the manufacturing process in creating the batteries for electric vehicles, very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three and then for all of the rest of the vehicle lifetime, you’re far ahead and so cumulatively much lower carbon footprint,"" said Drew Shindell, an earth science professor at Duke University and study co-author.

The researchers evaluated several harmful air pollutants monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as emissions data, to compare the relative impact over time of EVs and internal combustion engines on air quality and climate change.

Their analysis said that EVs produce 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline vehicles in their first two years. That can be attributed to the energy-intensive production and manufacturing processes involved in mining lithium for EV batteries.

They also sought to account for how the U.S. energy system might develop in coming years, assuming growth in clean energy. And they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption, ranging from the lowest — a 31% share of vehicle sales — to the highest, 75% of sales, by 2050. (EV sales accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2024.)

The researchers said the average of those four models found that for each additional kilowatt hour of lithium-ion battery output, carbon dioxide emissions drop by an average of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) in 2030, and another 127 kilograms (280 pounds) in 2050.

The consistent decrease in CO2 emissions from EVs is “not only driven by the on-road vehicles, but also reduction that has been brought due to electricity production,” said lead author Pankaj Sadavarte, a postdoctoral researcher at Northern Arizona University.

Greg Keoleian, a University of Michigan professor of sustainable systems who wasn’t involved in the research, called it a “valuable study” that echoes other findings and “confirms the environmental and economic benefits” of EVs.

“Accelerating the adoption of battery electric vehicles is a key strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector which will reduce future damages and costs of climate change,” he said.

Shindell, the Duke researcher, said the grid will evolve to have more solar and wind power.

“When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” he said. “So the grid just overall becomes much cleaner in both the terms of carbon emissions for climate change, and for air pollution.""

Outside experts agreed — as long as the policy landscape supports it. That hasn't been the case under President Donald Trump, who has worked to boost fossil fuels and restrain solar and wind power development.

“The great news is the rest of the world isn’t slowing down in terms of its embrace of this technology,"" said Ellen Kennedy, principal for carbon-free transportation at RMI, a clean energy nonprofit. As for the U.S., she said, ""I think it’s important to keep in mind states and local governments, there’s a lot that’s happening on those fronts.”

One thing the study didn't address was recycling or disposal of batteries at the end of their life. Kennedy said battery recycling will improve, helping to address one of the environmental impacts of their production.

The study comes at a notable time given the challenges that EVs face in the U.S.

EVs have seen more interest in recent years as an alternative to gas-powered cars and trucks — particularly as they become more affordable and charging infrastructure becomes more available.

But growth has slowed amid shifting federal policy toward EVs and an industry step back from ambitious EV production promises.

Former President Joe Biden set a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030. But Trump reversed that policy, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for an EV purchase. The administration has also targeted vehicle pollution rules that would encourage greater uptake of EVs in the U.S., and the president has attempted to halt a nationwide EV charging buildout.

“The study is important to show how really misguided the current administration’s policies are,” Shindell said. “If we want to protect us from climate change and from the very clear and local damage from poor air quality, this is a really clear way to do it: Incentivize the switch from internal combustion engines to EVs.”

The German automaker announced Friday it will use the financing to offer hybrid versions of all new vehicles developed and manufactured in the region starting in 2026.

The move marks the latest step in Volkswagen’s retreat from its once-aggressive pure electric vehicle strategy, as the company hedges its electrification bets amid slowing global EV demand and intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers.

Comprehensive Hybrid Rollout Planned for 2026

“We will offer hybrids in every possible category: mild hybrids, hybrids, and plug-in hybrids,” said Ciro Possobom, Volkswagen’s head in Brazil.

The automaker expects to invest 20 billion reais ($3.7 billion) in South America by 2028, building on a previous commitment of €1 billion announced in 2023.

The BNDES financing will support development of flex-fuel hybrid vehicles that can run on either gasoline or ethanol, capitalizing on Brazil’s extensive biofuel infrastructure. Ethanol derived from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to gasoline, making it an attractive bridge technology for markets where pure EV infrastructure remains limited.

According to Argus Media, every vehicle developed and manufactured by Volkswagen in South America will be electrified “at some capacity” as soon as 2026. The funding will also help develop advanced driver-assistance systems and infotainment technologies—features that have become standard in Chinese EVs rapidly gaining popularity in Brazil.

Strategic Pivot Mirrors Global Retreat From Pure EVs

Volkswagen’s Brazil strategy reflects a broader global shift away from the “EV-or-bust” approach championed by former CEO Herbert Diess. Under current CEO Oliver Blume, the automaker has systematically walked back ambitious battery-electric commitments while increasing investment in hybrid technologies.

The company’s ID family of electric vehicles, once positioned as central to VW’s future, has struggled to gain traction against cheaper Chinese competitors and persistent consumer concerns about charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and high purchase prices. In fact, the automaker is selling so many combustion engine vehicles that it’s on track to overshoot European emissions allowances, prompting Blume to ask EU regulators for leniency.

This represents a dramatic reversal from just three years ago, when Volkswagen aggressively lobbied for strict EV mandates in the European Union.

“Electric mobility has won the race,” Diess declared in 2021 when presenting VW’s battery strategy. “Many in the industry questioned our approach. Today, they are following suit, while we are reaping the fruit.”

Those fruits have proven less plentiful than anticipated.

Why Brazil Matters for US EV Enthusiasts

While this announcement focuses on South American markets, the strategic implications extend directly to US consumers and the global automotive industry. Volkswagen’s hybrid pivot in Brazil mirrors identical consumer preference shifts happening in the United States.

Recent data shows American interest in pure electric vehicles declining sharply. An AAA survey found only 16% of Americans would consider an EV as their next vehicle—down from 25% just two years ago in 2023. Meanwhile, 45% say they would consider purchasing a hybrid, according to Pew Research Center.

Battery electric vehicle transaction prices in the US averaged $59,200 in March 2025, compared to $47,500 for all new vehicles—a 25% premium that represents the highest price gap since April 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That price differential, combined with range anxiety and charging infrastructure concerns, has driven consumers toward hybrid alternatives that offer electrification benefits without the infrastructure dependencies.

The September 2025 expiration of federal EV tax credits has further complicated the market dynamics, creating uncertainty that benefits hybrid vehicles as a lower-risk alternative for consumers hesitant about full electrification.

BNDES: Brazil’s Green Financing Powerhouse

The Brazilian National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) ranks as one of the world’s largest development banks, with total assets exceeding $216 billion. Established in 1952, BNDES has played a fundamental role in financing industrial expansion and infrastructure development across Brazil.

The bank operates with an explicit commitment to sustainable development and climate change mitigation, having assisted Brazil in constructing one of the planet’s cleanest energy grids. BNDES prioritizes projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while generating employment and reducing regional inequalities.

For Volkswagen, accessing BNDES financing provides favorable long-term credit terms while aligning the project with Brazil’s national development priorities and Paris Agreement commitments to reduce emissions.

South America: VW’s Strategic Growth Market

Brazil represents Volkswagen’s largest market in South America and has been profitable for the company since 2021 after years of losses. The automaker operates four plants in Brazil—in São Bernardo do Campo, Taubaté, São José dos Pinhais, and an engine plant in São Carlos—plus a parts center and 473 dealerships covering all Brazilian states.

Volkswagen began production in Brazil 70 years ago in São Paulo, making it the company’s first manufacturing location outside Germany. The automaker has produced 25 million vehicles in Brazil over seven decades, with 4 million exported to other markets.

The South American automotive market is expected to grow 11% annually until 2030, making it one of the fastest-growing markets globally. However, pure EV adoption in Brazil is projected to remain modest—around 4% of new vehicle sales by 2033—making hybrid technology a more practical electrification pathway for the region.

EVXL’s Take

Volkswagen’s $426 million BNDES financing for hybrid development isn’t an isolated decision—it’s the culmination of 18 months of strategic retreat from pure electric vehicles that EVXL has documented extensively.

In June 2025, we reported that VW was delaying its all-new Scalable Systems Platform (SSP) and integrating range-extending gas engines, abandoning the clean-sheet EV architecture originally planned. Just weeks earlier in May 2025, shareholders demanded governance reforms, criticizing the company’s board for lacking expertise in electrification and digitalization—expertise desperately needed as VW falls behind competitors like Tesla and BYD.

The pattern continued throughout 2024. In September, we covered how VW was contemplating factory closures in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, squeezed between high European production costs and aggressive Chinese EV manufacturers capturing market share. August brought news that VW’s battery chief was backing away from the target of 200 gigawatt hours of battery capacity by 2030, emphasizing “flexibility” over the company’s previous aggressive stance.

This Brazil announcement crystallizes what we’ve been tracking: Volkswagen is formalizing its hybrid-first strategy globally, not just in developing markets. While Tesla CEO Elon Musk maintains that automakers pursuing plug-in hybrids over pure EVs are making a strategic mistake, legacy manufacturers like VW have calculated differently. They’re watching US consumers demonstrate the same preferences Brazilian buyers show—45% willing to consider hybrids versus just 16% for pure EVs, according to recent surveys.

The timing is particularly telling. With US federal EV tax credits expiring in September 2025, American automakers including GM and Ford are pivoting toward hybrids to meet consumer demand without forcing expensive pure-EV technology into segments where buyers remain hesitant. VW’s Brazil strategy—leveraging existing fuel infrastructure while adding electrification—provides a blueprint for this hedged approach globally.

Brazil’s flex-fuel expertise offers VW something it desperately needs: a way to claim environmental progress (80% emissions reduction with ethanol versus gasoline) without the massive infrastructure investments and consumer education required for pure EV adoption. It’s pragmatic, cost-effective, and perfectly aligned with current market realities.

But here’s what concerns us: this represents the formalization of defeat for the bold electric vision Herbert Diess championed just four years ago. When Diess declared “electric mobility has won the race” in 2021, he envisioned VW as the global EV leader by 2025. Instead, under Oliver Blume’s leadership, VW has become a case study in strategic retreat—asking regulators for emissions leniency, closing historic factories, and now cementing hybrids as the primary electrification path for the world’s fastest-growing automotive markets.

The Chinese automakers VW once dismissed are now forcing everyone else to play catch-up. BYD alone sold 2.5 million hybrids in 2024, leveraging local battery plants that enable 30% cost advantages over European manufacturers. While VW secures loans for hybrid development, Chinese competitors are already exporting both pure EVs and plug-in hybrids at scale, capturing market share across Latin America, Europe, and beyond.

For EV enthusiasts in the US, Volkswagen’s Brazil move signals that the “inevitable” pure-EV future may be further away than optimistic projections suggested. Legacy automakers are choosing the path of least resistance—hybrids that require no new infrastructure, address range anxiety, and meet emissions targets at lower cost than pure battery-electric platforms.

The revolution is still coming. It’s just moving slower than promised, and taking a more circuitous route.

Overview: AFIDA and Its Reach AFIDA was enacted for the collection of information regarding foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land.
Many states also impose reporting and ownership restrictions on foreign-owned agricultural land that can vary widely from those under AFIDA.
Recent penalty assessment data underscores this trend: Many recent enforcement actions have targeted renewable and other energy and infrastructure projects, reflecting both the scale of their landholdings and the increasing presence of foreign capital in energy infrastructure investment.
Conclusion AFIDA enforcement, once largely perfunctory, is becoming a meaningful compliance risk for the energy and infrastructure sectors.","The renewed focus by the Trump Administration and Congress on enforcement of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 (AFIDA) marks a significant shift for foreign-owned developers of energy and infrastructure projects. Since its enactment, few enforcement penalties were imposed under AFIDA. Now, with increasing scrutiny on foreign investment in agricultural land as a national security issue—and amid several recent Congressional proposals to expand oversight and tighten reporting requirements—AFIDA has re-emerged as a compliance risk for energy projects, particularly with increased reliance on foreign capital in the industry.

This renewed enforcement environment raises several legal, transactional, and compliance considerations for project sponsors, investors, and counsel.

Overview: AFIDA and Its Reach

AFIDA was enacted for the collection of information regarding foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land. Under AFIDA and its authorizing regulations, entities with at least 10% direct or indirect foreign ownership must report certain acquisitions, dispositions, and changes in use of U.S. agricultural land to the Farm Service Agency within the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA). “Agricultural land” is defined broadly to include parcels used for farming, ranching, orchard, vineyard or timber production within the previous five years—categories that often capture sites being repurposed for energy and infrastructure development.

While AFIDA does not prohibit foreign ownership, it does impose mandatory reporting obligations and authorizes significant civil penalties for failure to file or for submitting false or incomplete information—potentially up to 25% of the property’s fair market value.

Importantly, AFIDA applies not only to direct fee ownership of land but also to leasehold interests of 10 years or longer. Easement interests and contingent future interests (including options) are expressly excluded.

Energy and infrastructure projects with long-term site rights often fall under the purview of AFIDA, particularly during the construction and operation periods, creating a reporting obligation that is easily overlooked.

Many states also impose reporting and ownership restrictions on foreign-owned agricultural land that can vary widely from those under AFIDA.

AFIDA Enforcement

The USDA is tasked with collecting, tracking and reporting data under AFIDA, as well as assessing civil penalties up to 25% of the fair market value of the property for non-compliance.

While AFIDA has existed for nearly five decades, enforcement activity has historically been limited due largely to funding and staffing constraints at USDA. In recent years, however, foreign ownership of interests in U.S. agricultural land has exploded—with approximately 45 million acres of U.S. agricultural land held by foreign entities as of December 2023—with calls for renewed regulatory scrutiny. Recent penalty assessment data underscores this trend:

Many recent enforcement actions have targeted renewable and other energy and infrastructure projects, reflecting both the scale of their landholdings and the increasing presence of foreign capital in energy infrastructure investment. Further, with the increased awareness of AFIDA, several legislative and regulatory proposals have been advanced in recent years that would affect its scope and operation, including more than three bills introduced in the current Congress largely aimed at increasing reporting requirements and strengthening enforcement.

Accordingly, compliance with AFIDA and other state restrictions should be considered when acquiring, leasing, or developing land with any level of foreign ownership or investment participation. Project participants should anticipate enhanced data collection, more frequent audits, and higher penalty assessments in the years ahead and stay updated on legislative and regulatory developments in this area insofar as any changes are likely to impact compliance requirements.

Conclusion

AFIDA enforcement, once largely perfunctory, is becoming a meaningful compliance risk for the energy and infrastructure sectors. With foreign investment continuing to play a critical role in project development and financing, project participants cannot afford to treat AFIDA as an afterthought.

Instead, investors and developers should identify potential AFIDA triggers early in site acquisition, leasing, and financing stages; incorporate compliance representations and covenants into transaction documents; and prepare for heightened scrutiny from the USDA, Congress, and state regulators—all of whom increasingly view agricultural and rural land use through a national security lens. And with multiple recent Congressional proposals to further expand oversight and tighten reporting requirements, participants must remain vigilant and up to date on legislative developments to ensure continued compliance in a rapidly evolving compliance landscape.","https://images.passle.net/fit-in/400x400/filters:crop(0,46,1998,1125)/Passle/671960b986748a978b266239/SearchServiceImages/2025-10-31-13-51-13-975-6904bed1f20ebfb6312f8ae6.jpg",N,,2025-11-01 07:58:53.459191

“Our message to EPA is simple: finalize the rule now,” said Devin Mogler, President and CEO of NOPA. “Every day of delay adds more uncertainty for farmers and processors – the EPA has already done an excellent job with a proposal that includes BBD volumes reflective of the industry’s capacity and a half-RIN provision that prioritizes domestic feedstocks.”

NOPA’s comments reinforce key priorities for the supplemental and final rule:

· Strong Biomass-Based Diesel (BBD) volumes that reflect actual growth and industry capacity

· 100% reallocation of waived gallons to maintain the integrity of the RFS, and

· Support for the half-RIN mechanism, which prioritizes U.S. feedstocks and safeguards domestic agriculture from unfair foreign competition

It’s maddening, because for a second it’s been about soybeans to distract us from Epstein. All we get are TACO threats.

U.S. imports of edible cooking oil from China are relatively small compared to imports of used cooking oil (UCO), which is actually the byproduct of cooking oil and is used as a raw material for fuels, animal feeds, and chemical products like machine lubricants and certain soaps.

Chinese UCO importssurged in recent years after President Joe Biden’s Administration prioritized a green transition through the landmark Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, That included offering tax credits and other incentives for the use of sustainable aviation fuel by the transportation industry.

The U.S. went from being a net exporter of UCO to becoming a net importer in 2022, and China has accounted for a significant amount of those imports. In 2023, China became the top supplier of UCO to the U.S. That coincided with a drop in demand for Chinese UCO after the European Union probed Chinese imports for artificially low prices. Chinese sales to the U.S. of processed edible oils, including UCO, hit a record 1.27 million tons, worth around $1.2 billion based on recent trade estimates, in 2024. That accounted for around 43% of Chinese UCO exports last year, according to the Department of Agriculture.

China bought 27 million metric tons of soybeans from US farmers in 2024. But somehow this “deal” to buy significantly less is a huge victory.

This above posting is the current state of politics that almost caused a tariff war over cooking oil. The upshot is that Trump thinks tariff wars are like actual wars and that they can be ‘won’. In the latest soybean skirmish Trump gained no advantage, drove up the costs because he screwed up as in his first term and gave his cronies an advantage as he interfered in the market with both Brazil and Argentina, in one case a pro-Bolsonaro tariff and in the other, propping up Milei by bailing out a buddy of Scott Bessent.

Trump didn’t have to threaten a tariff war over cooking oil but he did try. Chinese soybean importers havenot bought any soybeansfrom the latest U.S. harvest in retaliation for earlier U.S. tariffs, costing U.S. farmers (many of whom are Trump supporters) billions of dollars in lost sales.

Trump screwed with his MAGAs for a second time, and still doesn’t know how tariffs work. Now there’s an agreement as of this week, which mollifies US farmers but doesn’t account for the more complex nature of “cooking oil” markets, especially the used cooking oil / UCO market.

India is the world’s biggest importer of cooking oils. Trump is playing the cushion in terms of India’s market but is actually at the mercy of a market for Big Grease (cooking oil) that is not identical to a Used Cooking Oil :

With that cooking oil rant it's quite obvious to any kindergartener he doesn't know how tariffs work and he evidently doesn't know how he put tariffs in place. Used cooking oil is something else, as Trump simply wanted to mess with Biden policies meant to promote biofuels.

Overview of International Trade and Tariffs on Cooking Oil

The topic of international trade often features tariffs as key instruments that governments use to control the flow of imports and exports. A tariff is essentially a tax imposed on imports, making foreign products more expensive compared to local goods. This can lead to trade disputes, commonly referred to as ""tariff wars.""

Current Context of Cooking Oil Tariffs

In recent years, several countries have engaged in tariff disputes concerning cooking oils, particularly palm oil, soybean oil, and canola oil. These disputes typically arise due to various factors:

Market Protection: Countries often impose tariffs to protect their domestic agriculture sectors from foreign competition.

Environmental Concerns: Palm oil production, for example, raises significant environmental issues, prompting some nations to impose tariffs or trade restrictions on suppliers they view as unsustainable.

Political Relations: Tariff wars can also reflect broader geopolitical tensions, where countries use trade policies to exert pressure on each other.

Effects of Tariff Wars

Tariff wars have various consequences that can significantly affect both economies and consumers:

Higher Prices: Consumers typically face higher prices for cooking oils when tariffs are imposed, as import costs increase.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can lead to disruptions in global supply chains, affecting production in related industries.

Retaliatory Measures: Countries often respond to tariffs with their own, leading to an escalation of trade barriers that can harm businesses on both sides.

Recent Examples

For instance, countries in Southeast Asia and Europe have encountered disputes over palm oil, with major producers like Indonesia and Malaysia facing tariffs from the European Union. These tariffs are often justified by the EU's environmental policies, which seek to limit imports that contribute to deforestation.

Other nations might impose tariffs on soybean oil, targeting major producers such as the United States to protect their local market.

As focused as they are on personal profit, one gets the impression that nobody in the Trump administration actually cares about the US economy.

what is to be eaten?

The price of cooking oil was expected to jump up in 2025 thanks to tariffs. Generally, vegetable, canola, soy, coconut, and avocado oils went up. Olive oil has managed to buck this trend for now. While 15% tariffs on goods from the EU will start affecting the product soon, the 2024/2025 bumper olive crop has brought down prices.

Does this mean we’re in the clear? It’s unsure. Tariffs only recently went into effect, and the prices of Kirkland’s olive oils appear to have moved again by September of 2025. The 2-liter Organic Extra Virgin is now up to $20.99, while the 3-liter bottle dropped even more to $22.49 (although we find this Kirkland Signature Olive Oil to be rather bland). Perhaps Costco’s ability to source from different regions has helped them avoid tariffs in the blend.

The initiative focuses on giving high-voltage lithium-ion batteries from BMW and Mini EVs a second life or a responsible end once they can no longer power vehicles.

The partnership builds on EcoBatt’s growing prominence in Australia’s recycling sector, coming just weeks after the company opened the world’s first battery-in-device shredding (BIDS) facility in Campbellfield, Victoria.

How Is BMW Tackling EV Battery Concerns in Australia?

The move addresses one of the key questions facing EV adoption — what happens to batteries when they reach the end of their life or are damaged. BMW’s program ensures these batteries are handled safely and locally, reducing environmental risks and dependence on overseas processing.

Here’s how the recycling loop works:

• Collection: End-of-life or damaged EV batteries are transported from BMW and Mini dealerships to EcoBatt’s Campbellfield plant.

• Safe discharge: Batteries are safely de-energised, and recovered energy is reused to power the facility itself.

• Shredding process: The batteries are mechanically shredded using the BIDS technology.

• Material recovery: The process produces black mass, a mix of valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite.

• Recycling for reuse: This black mass is sent to refiners who extract the minerals for reuse in new battery production.

This full-circle process not only reduces waste but also creates a sustainable materials supply chain for Australia’s growing EV industry.

EcoBatt’s Groundbreaking BIDS Facility

EcoBatt’s Campbellfield facility represents a major leap in local battery recycling. Opened less than two months ago, it’s the first plant in the world capable of safely shredding batteries still embedded in everyday products such as vapes, phones, power tools, and now EV packs.

According to Doug Rowe, CEO of the EcoCycle Group (EcoBatt’s parent company):

“Every home has products with hidden batteries, and until now there hasn’t been a dedicated way to recover them at scale. This plant gives Australians confidence that recycling happens safely, onshore, and responsibly.”

The plant’s capacity highlights its potential impact

• Can process up to 5,000 tonnes of batteries per year

• Recovers over 90 per cent of materials including metals and plastics

• Powers part of its operations with energy recovered from discharged EV batteries

This integration of recycling and self-sustainability reduces emissions and reinforces Australia’s role in the global clean energy supply chain.

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/10/69053e273b2068.23242105.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-01 13:59:37.875973

Meanwhile, WVR said in a news release that the federal loan “supports WVR’s $2.6 billion clean ammonia fertilizer project, which will repurpose an existing clean-coal gasification plant for ammonia production,” Wabash Valley Resources stated in a news release.
Dan Williams, Wabash Valley Resources chief executive officer, stated, “This project is more than an investment; it’s a new chapter for a worldclass facility and the community that built it.
Not everyone’s thrilled Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources has long raised concerns about the company’s plans for carbon sequestration.
“Vermillion and Vigo County communities, both directly targeted by the Wabash Valley Resources Pilot Project, are standing united together against this unwanted, unnecessary project,” the statement said.","Wabash Valley Resources has secured a $1.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to help finance a coal and ammonia fertilizer facility in West Terre Haute, the federal agency announced Thursday.

The DOE Loan Programs Office “closed a loan to support independent, American-made, and coal-powered fertilizer production,” according to a DOEnews release.

Greg Zoeller, WVR vice president for external affairs, stated, “This project fulfills the long-sought goal of having our first fertilizer plant in Indiana for corn farmers while creating jobs and opportunities for the Wabash Valley by reutilizing a former coal power plant.”

The federal loan “triggers the use of all the private equity we already have,” Zoeller said. The project must use all of those private and investor funds before WVR can use any of the federal loan money.

“With this loan, all of our other financing is fully committed,” he said. “It allows us to start to sign contracts to build an ammonia plant, which will take us a couple of years.” Among those disappointed by the news was Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, which has long raised concerns about the project’s carbon sequestration component.

“This is extremely disheartening news. The health and safety of the community is at risk and taxpayer dollars will be squandered on outdated and dirty 20th century technology for what will likely be a massive boondoggle,” Olson said.

Wabash Valley Resources has previously said it plans to pipe and inject 1.67 million tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at the former coal gasification plant. Zoeller said WVR has the authority to construct the CO2 wells, but to inject CO2 it will have to go through another process. Injection would be among the last things to occur in the project. “We have to make ammonia before we inject anything,” Zoeller said. The federal loan would be repaid through the project, with a lot of it coming from carbon capture, Zoeller said.

Meanwhile, WVR said in a news release that the federal loan “supports WVR’s $2.6 billion clean ammonia fertilizer project, which will repurpose an existing clean-coal gasification plant for ammonia production,” Wabash Valley Resources stated in a news release.

According to DOE, the project will restart and repurpose a coal gasification plant idled since 2016 to produce 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia per year by using coal from a nearby southern Indiana mine and petcoke as feedstock.

Dan Williams, Wabash Valley Resources chief executive officer, stated, “This project is more than an investment; it’s a new chapter for a worldclass facility and the community that built it. With the support of the U.S. Department of Energy, our elected leaders, our Korean partners, and America’s skilled workforce, we’re restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.

Williams added, “We’re especially grateful to the men and women of organized labor — particularly the national IBEW and our local building trades unions — whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

The Wabash project will bring the gasification plant back online to produce ammonia fertilizer – a vital resource for farmers across the Corn Belt, which currently relies on imports from Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Russia, the DOE release stated.

This marks the second closed loan under the Energy Dominance Financing Program created by the Working Families Tax Cut, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Not everyone’s thrilled

Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources has long raised concerns about the company’s plans for carbon sequestration.

Opponents say carbon capture is not a proven technology, and risks include potential water and soil contamination; human health and safety risks; seismic activity; and pipeline ruptures.

Other concerns relate to emergency response, safety and evacuation, the group says.

Olson, of Citizens Action Coalition, said “it is extremely telling and disingenuous that the [Department of Energy] press release fails to mention the CCS component of this project. Not surprising however considering this Administration has repealed the endangerment finding and is denying climate change.""

Olson continued, “Therefore, they are hiding the fact that this project is taking advantage of the CCS tax credits included in President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed in part, to address the climate crisis. So, if there’s no climate crisis, why is the Trump Administration supporting this project? Makes no sense.”

In an emailed statement, Whitney Boyce of Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources said, “It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid.

“Vermillion and Vigo County communities, both directly targeted by the Wabash Valley Resources Pilot Project, are standing united together against this unwanted, unnecessary project,” the statement said.

Boyce continued, “Indiana law states WVR must have 60% voluntary pore space before eminent domain can be used to take our property against our will. This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community for their CO2 dumps. We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme. It is our land, not theirs.”",,N,,2025-10-31 20:06:17.872315
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-31 23:40:31+00:00,Business North Carolina,Data centers are boosting economic prospects while raising concern over N.C. energy policies.,"Mike MacMillan, Mike MacMillan https:, businessnc.com",,,,,https://businessnc.com/113645-2/,"Data center investment is having a measurable impact on the country’s overall economic growth.
The state ranks ninth nationally in the number of data centers, with 91.
In 2023, data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity generation, and that may double by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
“Hyperscale data centers actually don’t employ many staff — typically in the 50 to 150 range,” says Synergy Research Group’s Dinsdale.
“There are always going to be examples of data center developers getting it wrong in terms of scale, timing, demand or logistics, but the overriding picture is one of there not being enough data center capacity,” says Dinsdale from Synergy Research.","Amazon, Apple, Google, OpenAI affiliate Stargate. Everybody is building a data center these days. Data center construction represents one of the largest building projects in world history.

It is certainly one of the most expensive. “Total investment in upcoming and under construction data centers has soared to around $750 billion,” estimates Alex Wang, an analyst at Nashville, Tennessee-based investment firm Alliance Bernstein. That seems understated, with Stargate alone committed to spending $500 billion for AI-related data center projects over the next four years.

In North Carolina, Amazon says it will spend $10 billion for data centers in Richmond County as part of a broader $100 billion plan over 15 years. Apple is planning a $175 million investment at its data center in Maiden in Catawba County. Major projects are underway or being considered in several other NC cities.

As a result, Duke Energy projects energy demand in North Carolina will grow eight times faster over the next 15 years than in the previous 15. Artificial intelligence requires computing that demands massive energy inputs.

Data center investment is having a measurable impact on the country’s overall economic growth. Information processing investment contributed more than half of the 1.2% growth in U.S. GDP during the first half of 2025, according to The Wall Street Journal. UBS, an investment bank, forecasts that companies will spend $375 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 and another $500 billion next year.

It’s a big number, and North Carolina is hoping to get its fair share, or maybe a little bit more. The state ranks ninth nationally in the number of data centers, with 91. Virginia leads with more than 600, followed by Texas (379) and California (318).

In terms of megawatts of electricity consumed by data centers, Texas leads the way with about 8,000 MW, followed by Virginia with 7,000, according to CarbonCredits.com, which tracks carbon usage. In North Carolina, the comparable figure is around 770 megawatts, reports the Baxtel research group. In 2023, data centers consumed 4% of U.S. electricity generation, and that may double by 2030, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Data centers are also getting bigger, with many defined as “hyperscale,” a term that IBM characterizes as a physical site large enough for at least 5,000 servers and possibly miles of connection equipment. These centers can “easily encompass millions of square feet of space,” IBM says.

THE NEXT LOUDON COUNTY

In the old days, pioneers followed rivers and streams to open up new territory, and cities were founded along their banks. More recently, railroads and the interstate highway system have helped drive site selection for corporations and distribution centers. Now, for data centers, it’s power availability.

In discussing how to assess a potential data center site, site selection expert Ben Rojahn says he looks for high-voltage transmission lines first, followed by fiber capacity and “some reasonable access to water and sewer.” He’s a vice president for data center solutions with the CBRE real estate firm in Charlotte.

Loudon County, Virginia, which is directly west of Washington, D.C., has perhaps the world’s greatest concentration of data centers. Statewide, they consumed a whopping 23.6% of the Dominion State’s electricity in 2023, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. For North Carolina, the comparable number was 1.9%.

Partly as a result, data center development is on the move. “The whole I-85 corridor is seeing a lot of activity from data center developers and users,” says CBRE’s Rojahn, moving down from Virginia and, to a lesser extent, up from Atlanta.

North Carolina appears well positioned to capture some of that growth. The state is poised to meet demands for larger power loads over the next four or five years, Rojahn says, making it competitive with other states. It has regions served by high-voltage lines built originally for furniture and textile companies and other manufacturers that can be put to work bringing power to data centers. While those lines may serve smaller markets rather than large metros, that is not an issue with some AI and cloud applications where latency — the time it takes data to move from where it’s sourced to the destination – is less of a concern.

With billions of dollars at stake, states are competing aggressively to be the next Loudon County. Incentives often include a combination of sales and use tax exemptions, property tax abatements, investment tax credits, and regulatory relief like relaxed zoning requirements. Favorable power rates are also sometimes involved.

“Our job is to work with local leaders and economic development officials to help power their economy in a manner that matches their local vision for the community,” says Danielle Buckins, Duke Energy’s director of North Carolina development.

The benefits are clear, the costs perhaps less so. Consider the potential impact on Richmond County, where median income was $46,600 in 2023, compared with about $69,000 statewide. The county’s value of assessed property stands at $4.4 billion, which is less than Amazon’s proposed long-term investment. As many as 1,500 construction workers are expected to participate over the next five years.

Amazon has promised to create 500 permanent jobs, but hasn’t estimated the expected average salaries. The county offered a 20-year incentive package of cash grants equal to 50% of the annual property tax and 65% of the annual personal property tax for each of the 20 buildings that are proposed for the project. The package is contingent on $1 billion of investments and 50 jobs by the end of 2030.

“Five hundred jobs is huge for Richmond County,” says Martie Butler, a county economic developer. “A lot of years of planning went into developing our infrastructure (to attract a company like Amazon),” including support for Duke Energy’s generating facility near Hamlet, she says. “It will enhance our tax base significantly, and it won’t be a heavy lift for our community.”

A FOOL’S RACE?

In site selection, “The gating issues are ones that drive material cost impact — the availability of power, the availability of fiber,” says Jim Grice, a partner in Dallas at the Akerman law firm and a specialist in data centers and digital infrastructure. “Beyond that, one of the other big inputs to costs is taxes. The data center asset class operates with a very high percent of assets that are personal property. Servers have a refresh cycle. They last three to five years. As a result, your tax framework will have a big impact on site selection.”

Not everyone thinks these incentives are a good idea. North Carolina’s lack of transparency around data center incentives suggests that the state is “hiding costs and exaggerating benefits,” thereby putting the state’s budget at risk, according to a September op-ed in the News & Observer of Raleigh penned by Goodjobsfirst executive director Greg LeRoy and Brian Balfour of the Locke Foundation. Both nonprofits oppose corporate subsidies.

“It’s a fool’s race to the bottom,” LeRoy says in an interview. “This is not a struggling industry. These are enormously profitable and valuable companies doing something that makes a ton of profit for them.”

The companies would build these data centers with or without tax subsidies and abatements, he says. Citing the loss of tax revenues and the potential strain on local infrastructure like schools and roads, “I think North Carolina would win by losing data centers.”

Some residents of potential sites for data centers share that view. Opposition to projects has blocked projects in various N.C. locations, including some economically struggling ones. In September, Tarboro voted to reject a proposal to build a $6.4 billion data center project in Edgecombe County, citing concerns over its impact on water, sewer, and quality of life issues. The county’s 6.1% unemployment rate in September was the state’s highest.

Akerman’s Grice offers a more positive view of the impact of giant server farms. “You have substantial upgrades (to infrastructure) that wouldn’t be done except for the data center. Typically, [the data centers] pay a higher than regional average salary. The investment is so material they’re not going to walk away overnight. They’ll stimulate the local economy. They don’t have smokestacks. They don’t have as much impact as a new manufacturing facility would. They tend to have a clustering

effect — other companies show up.”

The data center industry contends there is a significant multiplier effect of as much as $7 of economic activity for every dollar invested. Good, bad, or indifferent, the tax incentive ship seems to have sailed among political and economic development leaders. As Rojahn puts it, “Tax incentives are a prerequisite for states to be competitive.”

Critics note other issues, most prominently the lack of significant long-term employment opportunities at data centers once they’re up and running, and the potential impact on ratepayers from all this demand for electricity.

“Hyperscale data centers actually don’t employ many staff — typically in the 50 to 150 range,” says Synergy Research Group’s Dinsdale. “For reasons of efficiency, security and cost, there is a lot of software and automation, rather than staff. The big employee numbers are in the construction phase, when there might easily be a thousand workers or many more.”

As for consumers, they are starting to notice the impact of all this construction on their electric bills. A recent study from Carnegie-Mellon and NC State universities reported that “data center and cryptocurrency mining growth through 2030 could increase average U.S. electricity costs by 8%” though the impact will vary by region and the sources of power generation. A Bloomberg analysis in September found that “electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.”

One thing for sure is it will increase demand. Duke has more than 100 prospective customer projects of all types in the Carolinas with a base demand of 50 megawatts or greater. Historically, Duke says, 10 megawatts was considered a large load.

Dot-com reprise?

In tech land, any trend that persists over a multiyear period is almost inevitably deemed a “bubble.” AI and data centers are now entering that territory, prompting comparisons with the dot-com bubble in 1999-2001 that ended with the NASDAQ index crashing nearly 80% from its peak. Key differences are that the Internet was early in its adoption curve 25 years ago, while today’s AI data centers are being financed by massive companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. There may be an excess of capital going into the sector, but the businesses are real.

Of course, AI could change everything and still leave behind hundreds of billions of dollars in stranded capital, which occurred during the early Internet era. San Jose, California-based Cisco Systems is a leading networking equipment operator, and operates a large site in Durham. It had the stock market’s largest valuation in March 2000, briefly topping $80 per share. It lost more than 80% of its value by late 2002. Twenty-three years later, it has rebounded to the $70 range.

Many following the tech industry remain resolutely bullish. “I don’t sense that we’re going to see a slowdown in the immediate future,” says Akerman’s Grice. “You have cloud [computing] growing at 18% compounded annually, and AI cloud is projected to grow

at 36%.”

The next big step in AI is expected to be “inference,” which refers to how technology is deployed once the robotic models have been completely trained.

“There are always going to be examples of data center developers getting it wrong in terms of scale, timing, demand or logistics, but the overriding picture is one of there not being enough data center capacity,” says Dinsdale from Synergy Research.

In August, Open AI CEO Sam Altman told a group of reporters, “When bubbles happen, s

mart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes.”

Venture capitalists put $192.7 billion into AI startups this year through late September, according to data provider Pitchbook. That was more than half of total VC investment during the period. Meanwhile, research from the real estate firm JLL found that the data center vacancy rate stood at a low 2.3% in North America.

In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Guns, Germs, and Steel author Jared Diamond describes how geography and environment shaped early civilization. If the hype is to be believed, artificial intelligence will soon supplant those forces in defining the future. That intelligence doesn’t exist in the physical world, but rather within a virtual geography of servers and fiber optic cables.

While AI may be agnostic as to location, it is matters very much to states, towns, and counties looking for a lifeline in a post-industrial world. Like Richmond County. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Data-Center_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 00:17:41.345513

He has cited his opposition to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan as a major career achievement.
The commission’s regulatory process is “quasi-judicial,” meaning that it demands evidence-based argumentation from Duke Energy, its critics and other interest groups.","In July, Duke Energy had every reason to expect that the N.C. Utilities Commission would approve its plan to build a 245-megawatt solar project in Richmond County. The facility was in line with its Carolinas Resource Plan, the commission-approved framework for adding more power.

Ultimately, the commission approved the plan, but only after a sharp dissent from its newest member, Donald van der Vaart. The former state environmental-quality secretary downplayed the usefulness of solar power that lacked battery storage, and highlighted how North Carolina’s natural gas supply remains limited.

“These constraints necessitate extending coal-fleet operations to bridge to large-scale nuclear for carbon neutrality by 2050,” he says.

Van der Vaart’s dissent, and his presence on the commission, signals how the regulatory body’s outlook is in flux. It’s partly a function of a restructuring ordered by state Republican leaders, who have gained more sway over North Carolina’s regulatory agencies.

The governor had traditionally appointed all seven members of the Utilities Commission. Now, after a law passed in 2023, the commission is down to five members, with Gov. Josh Stein and legislators each picking two people and the state treasurer selecting the other seat.

The treasurer, Brad Briner, picked van der Vaart. He joined holdovers Karen Kemerait and Floyd McKissick Jr., who were gubernatorial picks, and Bill Brawley and Tommy Tucker, the legislative selections.

McKissick, a Durham Democrat, and Tucker, a Union County Republican, are former state senators. Brawley is a former Mecklenburg County Republican state representative. Kemerait is a Raleigh lawyer whose practice involved energy, water, wastewater and land-use matters. She is a registered Democrat.

Four other members left this year: former chair Charlotte Mitchell, Kimberly Duffley, Jeffrey Hughes and Steve Levitas.

Representatives of N.C. environmental groups have long been critical of van der Vaart, a chemical engineer who worked in Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration. He has cited his opposition to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan as a major career achievement.

The Utilities Commission is ultimately beholden to the law as written by the General Assembly, says former state Rep. John Szoka, a Cumberland County Republican who now heads the Michigan-based Conservative Energy Network. That means balancing a decrease in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions with keeping electricity prices as low as possible.

“All five of them, and I think they’ve shown it so far, are administering the law as regulators are required to by the law, and they’re going to do that to the best of their ability,” Szoka says.

The commission’s regulatory process is “quasi-judicial,” meaning that it demands evidence-based argumentation from Duke Energy, its critics and other interest groups.

It’s “more important than ever that anybody who comes before the board really has their stuff together when they present whatever position they are representing,” he adds. “It’s not feelings; it’s facts, because these cases are decided on facts.”

The commission’s main job in 2026 is reviewing Duke’s revised Carolinas Resource Plan, which envisions pumping the brakes on solar development in favor of using more gas combustion turbines and operating the utility’s coal-fired power plants longer than previous projections.

The revision follows the General Assembly’s passage this year of Senate Bill 266, which retains the ultimate goal of making power production carbon-neutral by 2050. But the state is no longer asking Duke to get 70% of the way there by 2030.

While about half of Duke’s total generation capacity comes from nuclear, the utility is cautious about building new reactors. Its filing says the company will undertake planning work, but is noncommittal about following through. But Duke needs to start placing orders for reactor vessels and other equipment by 2028 to build more of the gigawatt-size facilities it now operates.

The slowdown on solar, meanwhile, partly stems from the Trump administration’s adamant opposition to tax credits and other incentives for renewables. That is forcing adjustments in long-term planning as some existing solar deals may fall though, Duke’s filing noted. ■",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Utilities_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 21:58:21.179351

Here are five elections where rising power bills, offshore wind, data centers, and the future of clean energy are all on the line.

Georgia Public Service Commission

Every state has an obscure regulatory body that oversees for-profit electric utilities, including their requests to raise rates and build new energy projects. In Georgia, it’s called the Public Service Commission, and unlike in most states, voters get to decide who’s on it.

Georgia’s current five utility commissioners — all Republicans — have been in power beyond their elected terms because lawsuits have delayed elections. On Tuesday, two of those commissioners will finally face voters.

In one race, Republican incumbent Tim Echols faces a challenge from Democrat Alicia Johnson. Echols calls for more nuclear power and battery storage and has touted his support for solar. Johnson wants more solar power and battery storage, including rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources, but is less bullish on nuclear.

In the other PSC race, Democrat Peter Hubbard is looking to unseat Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson (no relation to Alicia Johnson). Hubbard, an energy modeler, has a long track record of challenging the PSC, and told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John he’d push for more solar and less gas if elected. Johnson didn’t respond to Canary’s requests for comment, but has called this election a contest of ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates.”

New Jersey governor

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican former state legislator Jack Ciattarelli to lead New Jersey — and energy affordability has become a key issue. The state saw one of the country’s biggest electricity rate increases over the last year, and Sherrill has promised to build more clean energy generation to address the problem.

Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has blamed New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for rising power prices. He’s also not a fan of offshore wind — just take a look at the koozies his campaign store is selling.

Virginia governor

Rising power bills are also a hot topic in Virginia, where Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race.

Virginia is already known as the data-center capital of the world, and continued development could drive up power demand even further. Spanberger has called for exploring energy-efficiency programs and virtual power plants as potential solutions, and supports solar, offshore wind, and nuclear development to meet demand. Earle-Sears is more critical of solar and wind power, but is a strong supporter of small nuclear reactors.

New York City mayor

There’s a three-way race underway to lead New York City, where Democrat Zohran Mamdani is polling ahead of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The future mayor will have a lot of say in implementation of the city’s landmark law requiring cuts in climate emissions from buildings, and Mamdani has promised to strictly enforce the measure. Mamdani has also woven climate action into his plans to make the city more affordable, including by turning dozens of schools into renewables-equipped resilience hubs.

Sliwa, for his part, has campaigned against battery storage development, and he celebrated when a major battery project planned for Staten Island was canceled this month. (More on that news below.)

More big energy stories

A big week for conventional nuclear reactors

Small nuclear reactors may be generating more buzz, but conventional reactors are at the center of three big nuclear deals announced in the U.S. this past week. The first comes from the Trump administration, which announced an $80 million plan to work with nuclear reactor developer Westinghouse, Brookfield Asset Management, and uranium supplier Cameco to build several Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S.

In Iowa, Google announced it’s partnering with utility NextEra Energy to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant. The facility has been shut down for five years, but Google hopes to get it back online by 2029 to help power its growing data-center fleet. And in South Carolina, state-owned utility Santee Cooper is tapping Brookfield Asset Management to finish construction of two AP1000 reactors that the utility abandoned back in 2018.

A win and a loss for battery storage

Large-scale battery development saw both a breakthrough and a setback over this past week. The good news for storage came from Form Energy, which has started installing its 100-hour iron-air batteries at a Great River Energy storage project in Minnesota. The startup is building those first-of-a-kind batteries at its West Virginia factory, where it hopes to speed up production as it works out some early kinks.

But on New York’s Staten Island, Hecate Energy has withdrawn plans to build a 650-megawatt battery storage facility. The company didn’t give a reason for the termination, but it did face opposition from residents and local leaders.

The petition comes after the federal government said Montana can use “narrative” water quality standards, subjective criteria such as odor, color and the presence of undesirable aquatic life, instead of statistical metrics, to establish regulatory limits on nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus.

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper announced Oct. 29 that it is petitioning the state to hold off on wastewater permitting until a “lawful, science-based plan is in place to protect Montana’s waterways from nutrient pollution.”

Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is working alongside eight other environmental nonprofits to circulate the petition as part of an effort to ensure DEQ has a clear plan to mitigate nutrient pollution as it attempts to emerge from an extended period of permitting limbo wrought by a yearslong water quality tug-of-war between the state Legislature, environmentalists, industry groups and federal and state regulators.

Nitrogen and phosphorus can contribute to persistent algal blooms that deprive fish and other aquatic life of the dissolved oxygen they need to thrive. Wastewater from municipal treatment plants, mines and refineries is a common contributor of “point-source” nutrient pollution, but diffuse sources that are harder to regulate, such as poorly maintained septic systems, fertilizer runoff and livestock manure, can also contaminate rivers and lakes.

About one-third of the state’s waterways were considered “impaired” by nutrient pollution in 2020, when the DEQ last took a pulse check on the health of Montana waters.

Earlier this year, while testifying in favor of a bill to transition the state back to narrative water quality standards, DEQ told state lawmakers it had stopped issuing new wastewater discharge permits and allowed some of its permits to be “administratively continued” using whatever standards they had been granted under, even if the permit had expired. The agency described that situation as unsustainable.

In April, the Legislature passed that proposal, House Bill 664, by a healthy margin: 103 of the body’s 150 lawmakers voted to support the measure. Since it intersects with federal regulations, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had to sign off on the revised standards before DEQ, its state counterpart, could implement them.

That happened Oct. 3 when EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western told DEQ that HB 664 could stand, arguing that DEQ’s proposed approach to water quality regulation will “protect designated uses” under the Clean Water Act, the federal law Congress passed in 1972 to clean up contaminated rivers.

Guy Alsentzer, with Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said in an emailed press release that DEQ lacks an implementation plan, and that lack will lead to the degradation of “countless river miles.”

“Right now, DEQ is flying blind without a plan in place to determine — and prevent — harmful levels of nutrient pollution for most Montana waterways. This hands-off approach to regulating point-source pollution is a recipe for disaster,” he said.

In an email to MTFP, DEQ maintained that prior to adopting numeric criteria in 2015, the state used narrative nutrient criteria to protect Montana’s water bodies for decades. The numeric standards never applied to Flathead Lake and “most large rivers,” she added.

Asked if DEQ has emerged from its permitting standstill, agency spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote that the agency has been “focused on developing the methodology for applying the narrative nutrient standard and reviewing administratively continued permits.”

McGeffers noted that the agency has drafted a nutrient-specific modification to the Sibanye-Stillwater platinum and palladium mine permit, which is currently out for public comment. The old plan called for a limit of 15 pounds of nitrogen (a byproduct of the mine’s dynamite usage) entering the East Boulder River per day. The new plan seeks to increase that threshold using an averaged calculation and extend the mine’s timeline for complying with stricter limits in the future. It also includes monitoring and reporting requirements.

Asked about the mine’s permit application in a follow-up interview with MTFP, Alsentzer said the proposal is a departure from science-based regulations that are protective of water quality, and said they represent a new playbook for industry groups.

Alsentzer argued that “there’s no reasonable dispute” that the mine is the largest single source of nutrient pollution on the East Boulder River and that the mine discharges more nutrients than was previously authorized or understood. It appears, he said, that companies like Sibanye-Stillwater were biding their time, waiting for HB 664 to go into effect rather than working toward increasingly protective water quality targets laid out in their permits.

“Nobody wants to play by the old rulebook anymore,” Alsentzer said. “We’re going back to subjective decision-making without clear guidance, and I think it’s ridiculous.”

After the public comment period for the mine’s revised permit closes on Nov. 7, DEQ will make a final determination.

Other groups circulating the petition include Gallatin River Task Force, Bitterroot River Protection Association, Citizens for a Better Flathead, Montana Environmental Information Center, Gallatin Wildlife Association, Clark Fork Coalition, Flathead Lakers, and Alliance for the Wild Rockies. As of Friday afternoon, Oct. 31, the petition had garnered 102 signatures.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boyer_ClarkFork-5116.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 07:59:00.854533

China has stopped importing U.S. coal, accounting for most of a 14% decline in U.S. coal exports so far this year, according to analysts and the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week suggests trade progress. But whether it will include the U.S. coal industry is still uncertain.

“It’s hard to tell whether that’s just going to maintain the status quo or if that’s going to be an increase in exports of coal and soybeans to China,” coal analyst Seth Feaster with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said Friday.

Trump has been easing up on regulations and opening up mining on federal lands. The result has been to “keep our lights on, our economy strong, and America Energy Dominant,” Interior Department spokesperson Charlotte Taylor said in an e-mailed statement Friday.

The administration has also reduced royalty rates for coal extracted from federal lands and in September pledged $625 million to bolster coal power generation, including by recommissioning or modernizing old coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

Recent government coal lease sales in Montana, Wyoming and Utah, however, have failed to draw bids deemed acceptable by the Interior Department.

So far this year, U.S. coal production is up about 6%, due not to Trump policies but higher natural gas prices, Feaster said.

Meanwhile, coal exports fell 14% from January through September compared to the same time last year, according to an EIA report released Oct. 7.

The drop followed an additional Chinese tariff of 15% on U.S. coal in February and a 34% reciprocal Chinese tariff on imports from the U.S. in April, the EIA said in a report issued Friday.

The U.S. exports about one-fifth of the coal it produces. Most goes to India, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.

China is not a top destination, taking in only about one-tenth of U.S. coal exports. But it has had an outsized effect on overall U.S. coal exports by halting all coal from the U.S. since April, said Andy Blumenfeld, a coal analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.

Almost three-quarters of U.S. coal exported to China last year was metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. The rest was thermal coal burned in power plants to produce electricity, according to Blumenfeld.

Nearly all U.S. metallurgical coal is mined in Appalachia, while the bulk of U.S. thermal coal comes from massive, open-pit mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana.

Appalachia would therefore benefit most from a resumption of U.S. coal exports to China, noted Blumenfeld by email.

“There is optimism,” Blumenfeld wrote. “But there is little documentation to back that up right now.”

Most coal headed for China last year went through Baltimore, with lesser amounts via the Norfolk, Virginia, area and Gulf of Mexico, according to Blumenfeld.

Relatively little thermal coal from the Western U.S. is exported due to the cost of hauling it by rail to the West Coast, where there has also been political resistance to building port facilities to export more coal.",https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coal_Exports_07035.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 19:18:47.757956

Construction’s contributions to North Carolina can be counted in many ways. The $1 billion Pearl complex has led to a highly anticipated medical school and a separate magnet attracting leading global surgeons to study in Charlotte. Toyota’s $14 billion battery plant in Randolph County strengthens the Tar Heel state’s participation in creating a clean energy future.

CN Hotels’ development of a dual-branded Hilton hotel gave the state capital the highest rooftbar in the Triangle. Northwood Development has turned Charlotte’s Ballantyne area, long known for its massive office complex, into a popular place to eat, drink and enjoy live entertainment.

Then there’s Champion Credit Union’s decision to move forward with a new corporate headquarters in Haywood County, demonstrating the resiliency of Canton residents affected by Tropical Storm Fred and the closing of a dominant regional employer. In Bessemer City, a long-abandoned Gaston County textile mill now offers 139 affordable housing units.

Making a difference in communities was a common theme as Business North Carolina recognizes the most important new buildings to open in the year ending June 30. This marks the 12th year for the project, which is put together by the BNC editorial team with input from representatives of the state’s construction and architecture industries.

The list includes nine category winners and eight honorable mentions. The buildings represent some of the biggest investments in state history, some of its tallest office towers and largest residential developments, as well as hospital facilities that promise better access to healthcare. Renovation projects that preserved cultural heritage also show up on the list.

Construction contributed $41.4 billion to the state’s gross domestic product last year, about 5.6% of the total. The industry employs about 280,000 workers in the rapidly developing state.

Champion Credit Union Canton

Developer: Champion Credit Union (Canton)

Contractor: NewGround International/Beverly-Grant (Chesterfield, Missouri)

Architect: NewGround International (Chesterfield, Missouri)

Cost: $23 million

Size: 30,000 square feet

Champion Credit Union finished its new headquarters in May, overlooking the former paper mill where seven employees of the former Champion mill came together in 1932 to found what was then known as Champion Savings and Loan. Building plans were announced in 2022, but construction began after Pactiv Evergreen announced the plant’s closing in March 2023, idling more than 1,000 people in a town of 4,400 residents.

The project became a testament to the town’s resiliency and the credit union’s commitment to Canton, says CEO Jake Robinson.

The mostly stone and glass facade offers picturesque views of the surrounding Great Smoky Mountain range. The new building consolidates back office operations and administrative work that had been done in three separate buildings.

The city of Canton bought the credit union’s two former buildings for a new town hall and police department offices. Both need renovations that are expected to be completed over the next 18 months. City staffers still operate out of Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers after Pigeon River flooding during Tropical Storm Fred slammed Canton in August 2021.

Cost: $36 million

Size: 250,000 square feet

A long-vacant textile mill now has 139 apartments to rent in an affordable housing project that city leaders say will be key for downtown redevelopment. Town founder John Smith built the mill in 1896 for his Southern Cotton Mill. It employed more than 400 in its heyday, but closed for good in 1995. After almost 30 years of vacancy, construction started on the project in 2023. The first residents moved into the one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments earlier this year.

The redevelopment preserved the building’s brick exterior and historic features while adding a resident lounge, business center and fitness room. Skylights bring natural light into the building’s interior atriums, illuminating its wooden beams and original flooring.

The North Carolina Housing Finance Agency supported the project with tax-exempt bonds issued by the Gastonia Housing Authority. Bank of America provided construction and permanent financing, as well as equity under the federal

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, the federal Historic Tax Credit program and the state’s Mill Rehabilitation Tax Credit program.

The Lofts at Osage Mill is WinnDevelopment’s first adaptive reuse project in North Carolina. Collaboration with Duke Energy ensured the building’s design conformed to Energy Star guidelines to maximize energy efficiency.

Apartments will be rented to households earning 60% of the area’s median income, which is less than $53,880 for a two-person household. Monthly rent for the 50 one-bedroom apartments will be $1,125; rent will be $1,352 for the 77 two-bedroom units; and $1,160 for the 12 three-bedroom units. As of mid-September, all but 15 of the apartments were occupied.

Wabash Valley Resources will restart a coal gasification plant to produce ammonia fertilizer, investing in a coal community and supporting Corn Belt farmers.

PROJECT SUMMARY

In October 2025, LPO closed a nearly $1.6 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources, LLC to help finance an ammonia fertilizer plant in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The loan from the Energy Dominance Financing Program will restart and repurpose a coal gasification plant idled since 2016 for the production of 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia per year. The gasifier will utilize coal from a nearby Southern Indiana mine and petcoke as feedstock. By investing in a coal community, the Wabash project will bring the gasification plant back online to produce ammonia fertilizer, a vital resource for farmers in the Corn Belt. This project will secure American fertilizer supply chains for American farmers and support President Trump's mission to unleash American energy dominance.

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION

Wabash Valley Resources will be the first domestic producer located in the Corn Belt to produce low-carbon ammonia for local farmers and co-ops in the region.

ECONOMIC IMPACT

A host of economic benefits are expected from the Wabash project: The low-carbon ammonia resulting from this facility will be cost-competitive compared to existing ammonia imports, helping to drive down costs for local businesses and consumers. The project location in West Terre Haute significantly alleviates supply chain risk, helping to secure and create affordable fertilizer supply chains and strengthen national and food security in the U.S. Finally, the project may utilize up to 150,000 tons per year of Indiana coal, supporting good-paying mining jobs and boosting local tax revenues.

The project is projected to create hundreds of jobs for Americans—up to 500 construction positions during the development of the project, up to 125 operational positions, 35 contract maintenance and services positions, and up to 90 local transportation positions for project operations.

The trio of agreements brings Meta’s total solar purchases to over 3 gigawatts of capacity this year. Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.

Meta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.

They follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.

While the Texas power plant won’t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.

The Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power.

Such environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies’ operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.

EACs were introduced years ago when renewables were costly relative to fossil fuel generators. They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions — and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.

But the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don’t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate.

If companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-10-31 19:18:51.823418

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We write to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” rule, to express strong support for the reallocation of 100% of the waived gallons from any granted Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and urge EPA to finalize the rule as quickly as possible.

At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA’s recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and advancing American energy dominance. The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income, and rural economies. These volumes matter —not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans, and other feedstocks that power this economy, and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets, and greater opportunity for rural America.

As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023–2025. Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices.

Congress created the RFS to boost biofuel use for the benefit of American families, the economy, and our energy security. It is critical that the EPA follow the directive outlined in the RFS to issue timely and reflective RVOs. Every day the rule remains unfinished means uncertainty for producers and missed opportunities for rural communities. Promptly finalizing the rule will allow these benefits to take hold sooner—bringing stability, investment, and growth to the places that need it most.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to working with you to quickly finalize a strong rule that ensures that the proposed biofuel volumes are not reduced as a result of SREs.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO.
Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C.
Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.","The Trump administration’s emergency order to keep the huge J.H. Campbell coal plant on Lake Michigan operating past its planned retirement date has cost at least $80 million since May, its operator, Consumers Energy, told regulators and investors this week.

The company said in its third-quarter earnings report Thursday that it would pursue the process laid out in the U.S. Department of Energy’s order for collecting those costs: It will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest.

Even though the peak summer electricity demand season has passed, executives at Consumers, Michigan’s largest energy provider, said that they see no sign of let-up in the emergency orders.

“We expect those to continue for the long-term,” said CEO Garrick Rochow in a conference call for investors. “And we’re prepared to continue to operate the plant and comply with those orders.”

He said the costs—$615,385 per day—should be shared beyond the 1.9 million electricity customers of Consumers Energy. The company plans to propose the tab be split among ratepayers (an estimated 42 million to 45 million electricity customers) in the nine states served by the regional electric grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

“The benefits go to MISO,” Rochow said. “Not just to our customers, they go to MISO.”

Rochow said the Trump administration envisioned this approach. “That order from the Department of Energy has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” he said. Consumers Energy will have to apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in order to pass the costs to the ratepayers, and states that oppose such a cost allocation could move to intervene in those proceedings.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued two consecutive 90-day orders—on May 23 and on Aug. 20—to keep the Campbell plant open under the emergency provisions of the Federal Power Act. In the past, such orders have been used to ensure energy delivery at times of natural disasters. But Wright used the act to execute Trump’s agenda to ramp up energy production, saying Campbell needed to stay open to minimize the risk of power outages and address critical grid security issues in the Midwest.

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Campbell cost figures, nor did MISO. When he extended the Campbell order in August, Wright said that he was directing MISO “to take every step to minimize cost to the American people.”

“This order will help ensure millions of Americans can continue to access affordable, reliable, and secure baseload power,” he said in that statement.

But critics say the operation of the 63-year-old plant is generating unnecessary costs as well as pollution. In a September regulatory filing challenging the DOE’s order, a coalition of environmental groups pointed out that even on the day of highest peak demand this summer, MISO had an unused surplus of resources greater than 10 times the power provided by the Campbell plant.

And indeed, according to recent Environmental Protection Agency data, two of the three units at the Campbell plant were not operating at all for about 30 days of the 131 days from the start of the DOE order through Sept. 30. The third unit at the plant only ran for 18 days. Such stoppages could occur for maintenance or simply because the grid operator did not call on the plant to deliver energy to the grid.

“Forcing this unnecessary coal plant to keep operating is bilking consumers for the benefit of the coal industry,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney for Earthjustice, which is representing the environmental groups.

Because DOE did not respond to their petition for reconsideration of the Campbell order within 30 days, the environmental groups and the states of Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois have asked the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case. The purpose of the litigation, Lenoff said, is “to stop the administration from harming consumers, trampling markets and unlawfully usurping the authority of states and regulators to make decisions in the public interest.”

Campbell is by far the largest of three fossil fuel electricity plants that are staying open beyond their planned retirements under Trump administration emergency orders. Campbell released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. Talen Energy’s Wagner plant near Baltimore and Constellation Energy’s Eddystone plant just south of Philadelphia, both run on oil and natural gas. Some detail on their costs for keeping open may emerge next week, when Talen and Constellation report their third-quarter earnings.

Consumers Energy, which is continuing to work toward its previously stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, had projected that the retirement of the Campbell plant would save its customers $600 million over the next 20 years, or $30 million per year. Instead, running the plant for the past five months has cost close to three times that annual amount.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2225114175-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:18:28.308509

Europe has imposed tariffs on subsidized Chinese electric cars and begun pulling back from Chinese infrastructure.","Advantage Beijing. The just-brokered US-China trade truce demonstrates its ability to withstand Western pressure, while Europe delays decisive action and American power is systematically challenged.

When Washington imposed tariffs around the globe, China flexed its muscles by halting critical mineral exports and magnets crucial for the world’s car, semiconductor, and aerospace industries, not just to the US, but also to Europe. The strategy worked. China agreed only to pause critical mineral export controls for a year. In return, the US cut its tariffs and will allow China to buy sophisticated semiconductors.

Beijing’s success reflects a relentless two-pronged drive to reduce reliance on Western suppliers while pursuing an aggressive, ambitious export offensive. Huawei is producing GPU artificial intelligence chips, reducing dependence on global market leader NVIDIA. European telephone vendors Nokia and Ericsson are losing market share in China as Beijing subjects foreign equipment to new “national security reviews” that slow approvals or block them altogether.

Abroad, Beijing pushes its global footprint through the Belt and Road Initiative, which continues to deliver strategic infrastructure — ports, railways, energy projects — that reinforce Chinese influence on trade arteries from Asia to Africa and the Mediterranean. COSCO’s 67% stake in Greece’s Port of Piraeus, now one of Europe’s busiest container terminals, is a prime example.

In response, the West looks divided. US policymakers see technological dependence on China as a direct national security risk and have taken strong measures to restrict Chinese exports. Europe talks of “de-risking,” but the term has become a linguistic shield against hard choices. By June 2025, only ten of the European Union’s 27 member states had imposed restrictions on “high-risk vendors” such as Huawei and ZTE. Together, those two Chinese telecom firms still hold roughly 30–35% of Europe’s mobile-network infrastructure market — barely down from 2020 levels.

Beyond telecoms, Chinese firms have penetrated clean tech supply chains. Europe’s solar panel industry was hollowed out years ago, and now wind turbines face a similar threat. Chinese producers, heavily subsidized and vertically integrated, undercut European rivals in price and scale. Brussels has responded with investigations and provisional tariffs, but the underlying dependency remains: Europe relies on Chinese components to meet its own climate targets.

The US has gone further in both scope and symbolism. Washington banned Huawei and ZTE from US telecom networks in 2021 and placed them on export control lists that cut off advanced semiconductors and software updates. It has also initiated investigations into possible evasion of those bans, signaling that enforcement — not just rhetoric — matters.

Yet, as the recent Sino-American trade talks revealed, Washington’s ability to decouple from China is limited. China’s monopoly over rare earths is far from its only weapon. Another is China’s dominant position in the global pharmaceutical supply chain, producing 80% to 90% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients that power the generic drugs filling the majority of US prescriptions, including antibiotics.

The US’s ability to shape Europe’s China policy has also diminished. To many Europeans, Beijing has at times appeared a more consistent partner than Washington. Yet this is precisely the moment for America and Europe to close ranks: only through a coordinated transatlantic approach can they hope to meet the China challenge. A realistic China transatlantic strategy must rest on three key measures: de-risking, reciprocity, and industrial resilience.

First, time-bound de-risking. The allies should set explicit “out by” dates for high-risk vendors in critical sectors. Clear timelines create predictability for operators and investors while signaling seriousness to partners. So far, Europe has struggled to match the pace and clarity of such US efforts.

Second, require reciprocity. Access to public tenders, research funding, and infrastructure projects should depend on comparable openness for American and European firms in China. In Europe, the International Procurement Instrument represents a start, but it must be used routinely, not as a diplomatic exception. In the US, there might be little political appetite for collaboration with China on research and R&D — but Europe should step in as a mediator, keeping selective engagement alive where it serves shared Western interests.

Third, promote industrial resilience. Europe and the US must build domestic capacity in strategic technologies. Trade-defense instruments can buy time; they cannot substitute for production. Europe has imposed tariffs on subsidized Chinese electric cars and begun pulling back from Chinese infrastructure. It is attempting to boost domestic semiconductor production, particularly of chips needed for its important automotive business.

The US has done more. Earlier this month, NVIDIA announced that the firm had begun producing its advanced Blackwell AI chips at a TSMC plant in Arizona — marking the first time a Blackwell wafer had been made on American soil. NVIDIA is also assembling its AI supercomputers in Texas and manufacturing networking equipment in California.

None of these measures involves severing economic ties with China. The goal must be to be able to engage on one’s own terms rather than under constraint. In practice, that means diversifying suppliers, enforcing security standards, and ensuring that political leverage cannot be exercised through technical dependencies.

China’s ability to decouple is redefining the global balance of economic power. Its domestic substitution drive, industrial policy coordination, and outbound investment drive give it a competitive advantage. The question is not whether China can decouple — it has already shown that it can, selectively and effectively. The unanswered question is whether Europe and the US can adapt.

The move is a pivot for the company, which was poised to ramp up electric vehicle production until President Donald Trump discontinued federal $7,500 subsidies for EV buyers on September 1.

General Motors will launch the centralized computing platform and next-generation electrical architecture starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.

“The new design represents a fundamental reimagining of how GM vehicles are built, and how they can be updated over time,” the company said in its announcement of the new technology on October 22.

Already, more than 4.5 million GM vehicles can receive over-the-air vehicle system updates, a number growing by about two million vehicles per year. Last year alone, 1.6 million vehicles received coordinated software updates this way.

Now, the company is taking this capability farther to fashion a new approach to mobility that GM says “…unlocks new levels of performance, scalability, and software efficiency.”

The revised architecture cuts the number of vehicle modules needed under the hood, simplifying vehicle design, improving reliability, and enabling faster software updates, GM said.

GM will share software across its portfolio, both electric and gas-powered vehicles, large and small, so that GM vehicles will be always connected, awake, and available, with near-instant responsiveness to remote commands.

GM EV Sales Slow, So Are Tesla’s

In the first quarter of 2024, U.S. year-over-year growth rate for electric cars was 15 percent, compared to the overall market, which was up 4.7 percent. Year-over-year growth of electric car sales did slow compared to the 2022-2023 numbers, which rose by about 50 percent. Still, electric vehicles were 7.8 percent of the new-car market compared to 7.1 percent in the same period of 2023.

Tesla as a brand is experiencing slowing demand as shown in the company’s production and delivery report for Q1 2024. Tesla reported delivery of about 387,000 vehicles, missing its target level of 430,000.

Still, the Tesla Model Y remains the best-selling EV in the United States, and it continues to have “an outsize impact” on overall EV sales, according to Lawrence Yap, writing for the website Green Cars in May 2024.

“There are many reasons why Tesla’s numbers have fallen off. Some pundits have speculated that CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political leanings are beginning to turn off swaths of mainstream buyers, which are key to the success of the Model Y and Model 3,” Yap writes. “A more likely explanation is that, aside from the all-new and low-volume Cybertruck, the brand’s line is aging … and competition from other brands is increasing.”

On April 25, 2023, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said that General Motors’ electric car, the Bolt, and Bolt EUV would be discontinued at the end of 2023 to make room for GM’s “new generation of electric vehicles.”

General Motors phased the electric Bolt out of production, and its sales of electric vehicles dropped 21 percent, as the new Blazer electric SUV faced production delays and stop-sale orders.

One bright spot was the Cadillac Lyriq, which nearly quintupled sales compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Another potential bright spot is the reintroduction of the Chevy Bolt EV for 2027 at a price point that hovers around $30,000.

The 2027 Bolt designers focused on a refined, familiar look paired with the latest safety technologies, software updates, and driver-assistance features. The Bolt is shaping up to be “a practical, budget-conscious EV for everyday drivers,” GM says.

With the Blazer EV and the new Silverado EV now back in production, Yap expects GM’s numbers to grow from its roughly three percent EV share of the market.

GM’s North American President Duncan Aldred said earlier this year, “There’s no doubt we’ll see lower EV sales next quarter after tax credits end, and it may take several months for the market to normalize. We will almost certainly see a smaller EV market for a while, and we won’t overproduce.”

The Role of Tariffs

While starting on a program for producing more electric cars and trucks during the administration of President Joe Biden, GM and other American automakers had to pivot when President Donald Trump took office on January 20. Companies had to change their plans as Trump said immediately that he was going to support the use of fossil fuels, reversing the U.S. policy of working to defeat climate change by limiting the burning of diesel, oil, and gasoline.

On Friday, October 17, Trump issued a Presidential Proclamation invoking Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, imposing a 25 percent tariff on imports of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and related parts as well as a separate 10 percent on imports of buses. These tariffs will take effect at 12:01 am ET on November 1.

The 25 percent tariff on imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts applies to parts used in medium- and heavy-duty trucks, such as engines, transmissions, tires, and chassis.

Medium- and heavy-duty trucks include vehicles like large pick-up trucks.

Under a new Tariff Offset Program manufacturers using U.S. assembled medium- or heavy-duty truck parts may receive a tariff credit equal to 3.75% of the aggregate value of all trucks assembled in the United States from 2025–2030. This reflects the duty owed when a 25% tariff is applied to 15% of the value of a U.S. assembled medium- and heavy-duty truck.

This credit can be used to reduce the tariffs that truck manufacturers owe on medium- and heavy-duty truck parts.

Products subject to this tariff WILL NOT be subject to additional or existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper, cars and car parts, or lumber. They also will not be subject to reciprocal tariffs that the U.S. has placed on Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and India.

In an October 21 Letter to Shareholders, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra thanked President Donald Trump for relieving the pressure of tariffs on the company.

“I also want to thank the President and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday. The MSRP [manufacturers suggested retail price] offset program will help make U.S.-produced vehicles more competitive over the next five years, and GM is very well positioned as we invest to increase our already significant domestic sourcing and manufacturing footprint,” Barra told GM shareholders.

Earlier this year, General Motors announced $4 billion in capital investments to onshore production at plants in Tennessee, Kansas, and Michigan over the next two years, Barra explained.

“Once these investments come online, we plan to produce more than two million vehicles per year in the United States,” she said.

“We are also investing close to $1 billion to build a new generation of advanced, fuel-efficient V8 engines in New York. Importantly, we are maintaining our capital discipline while adding this production and creating new jobs,” Barra declared.

Barra knows GM better than most other people in the automotive universe. She started working for GM in 1980 as a student when she was 18, checking fender panels and inspecting hoods, and she used this job to pay for her college tuition. Later, she held engineering and administrative positions at GM and managed its Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.

GM Takes a Fresh Approach

Now, a new presidential administration with new goals has GM moving toward a centralized computing design that unlocks new levels of performance, scalability, and software efficiency.

The updated architecture builds on GM’s Vehicle Intelligence Platform, which launched in 2020 to allow secure over-the-air updates.

In 2022, GM unified dozens of infotainment modules into a single computing platform. The company also consolidated multiple advanced driver assistance systems into one. The new platform consolidates dozens of electronic control units into a unified computing core that coordinates every subsystem in the vehicle in real time, the company explained.

Much like a smartphone’s single, powerful microprocessor that orchestrates everything from camera to messages, this centralized approach connects every system – propulsion, steering, braking, infotainment, and safety – through a high-speed Ethernet backbone.

This has the potential to drive “dramatic change for customers,” Barra explained to the GM shareholders that hit a series of bullet points.

– Growing to deliver 10 times more software updates for new features than our previous system.

– Real-time safety updates in a self-driving system that reacts in milliseconds and evolves with each autonomous update – even faster than our current system.

– 1,000 times more bandwidth for faster connectivity, richer entertainment, and future AI workloads.

Under the hood

– At the heart of the system is a liquid-cooled central computing unit powered by next-generation processors such as NVIDIA Thor. That core connects to three aggregators, serving as hubs for the vehicle’s different zones. Instead of wiring hundreds of sensors and actuators directly to the central processor, the aggregators act as translators. They convert sensor signals into a unified digital language, and route commands back to the correct hardware.

This design delivers two major advantages, Barra said.

– Hardware freedom: Vehicle-specific components stay isolated from the software layer, so GM can swap suppliers or upgrade parts like brake actuators, cameras, displays, and other components without rewriting core code.

– Radical simplification: The new architecture simplifies the network topology. Instead of hundreds of point-to-point connections creating complex wiring and software integration challenges, you get clean “star-network” topologies with aggregators fanning out to their local zones.

Built to Scale

With up to 35 times more AI computing power, as well as TOPS, trillions of operations per second, for autonomy, and a two-to-four multiplier boost in infotainment performance, GM’s platform is engineered with headroom as the company builds next-generation features, the GM leader explained.

“GM’s new platform is engineered to support both electric and internal-combustion vehicles. A single software and computing foundation means innovations developed for one vehicle type can be rapidly scaled across the entire portfolio,” Barra said, “accelerating feature deployment while upholding GM’s standards for safety, cybersecurity, and reliability.”

Eyes-off Driving?

General Motors says it is evolving into a new era of transportation. The company announced plans to bring “eyes-off” driving to market in 2028, debuting on the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ electric SUV.

GM says it has already mapped 600,000 miles of hands-free roads in North America, and customers have driven 700 million miles with Super Cruise “without a single reported crash attributed to the system.

“This combination of technology, scale, a decade of real-world deployment experience, and safety systems developed and tested for Super Cruise gives us the foundation to deliver the next phase of personal autonomy,” GM reasons.

Barra Welcomes a New Chapter

By combining centralized computing, software consolidation, and GM’s global scale, this architecture marks the beginning of a new chapter for the company’s vehicles, Barra told the shareholders and listed the benefits they will enjoy:

– Cars that learn and improve throughout their lifetime.

– Architectures that deliver real-time intelligence and faster autonomy.

– Platforms that bring the efficiency of the digital world into the physical one.

– Delivering 10 times more software updates for new features than GM’s previous system.

– Real-time safety updates in a self-driving system that reacts in milliseconds and evolves with each autonomous update.

– 1,000 times more bandwidth for faster connectivity, richer entertainment, and future AI workloads.

Barra is not the type of CEO to take a negative view of change. Instead, she took a positive tone, saying, “GM’s new computing platform will connect every GM vehicle to a smarter, faster, and continuously improving future.”

Unlike most states, Virginia does not limit corporate contributions to campaigns, enabling Dominion to spend nearly $8.3 million, as of October 15th, in an attempt to hand-pick some of the representatives who select its regulators responsible for overseeing its business and setting the rates the utility can charge to its customers. The financial stakes are growing as demand for electricity skyrockets from data centers, which could soon account for 50% of Dominion’s revenues, according to Scott Castle, the utility’s Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.

Dominion spread its millions among 75 primary and general election candidates this cycle, with 48 still in the running—including Attorney General (AG) Jason Miyares, the top recipient of Dominion cash this year. Virginia State Board of Elections filings show Miyares has accepted $1.35 million from Dominion, while simultaneously leading the office that serves as the consumer advocate for utility customers in Virginia. Miyares’ office is currently intervening in a Dominion rate case that could increase monthly bills for customers by an average of nearly $22 if approved by the State Corporation Commission (SCC), which is responsible for determining how high to set utility bills and profits.

Virginia is one of only two states that selects commissioners via election by the General Assembly, whose members also pass legislation that determines how utilities are regulated. Dominion is known for using its political influence to shape legislative outcomes, as illustrated by a series of bills that gave Dominion outsized power to raise electricity rates, skirt regulation, and charge customers for excess profits. But a recent wave of utility reform legislation restored base rate-setting authority to the SCC, a power that was previously stripped from the commission in 2015 legislation.

Dominion has pumped over $2.1 million into Virginia’s Attorney General race this year, the most the utility has ever spent on a Virginia race, according to an analysis of state campaign finance filings by the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI).

This election cycle, Dominion hedged its bets for AG and split the record-breaking $2.1 million among two candidates, one on each side of the aisle, to oppose a vocal Dominion critic, former Delegate Jay Jones. Dominion backed the current AG Republican Miyares, and a Democratic challenger to Jones, Shannon Taylor. Dominion poured $775,000 into the Taylor’s campaign. Jones, who prevailed in the Democratic primary against Taylor, advanced to the general election against Miyares. In an opinion essay, Jones called for “a democratized energy system” that is no longer “overwhelmingly dictated by … monopoly utilities, resulting in laws that too often favor utility profit at the expense of the public interest.”

Jones received an endorsement and $325,000 in campaign contributions from Clean Virginia, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Clean Virginia was established to challenge Dominion’s political influence in the state. The group said “Jones [has] taken a principled stance against accepting donations from publicly regulated utility monopolies,” along with Democratic candidate for Governor Abigail Spanberger.

Spanberger’s opponent, Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, accepts contributions from regulated utilities, and has received $200,000 from Dominion in support of her effort to keep her party in the Governor’s mansion. Not all Republicans are following Earle-Sears’ lead, however. Eight Republicans running for re-election this year broke from Dominion despite previously accepting the utility’s money, according to EPI’s analysis of state campaign finance filings.

Republican delegates Lee Ware, Carrie Coyner, Mike Cherry, and Amanda Batten collectively accepted over $220,000 from Dominion since 2021, but now refuse even a cent from any utility monopolies regulated by the SCC, according to a statement from Clean Virginia.

When asked by EPI why Ware stopped accepting Dominion money, Ware’s counsel shared an email that Ware’s political action committee had sent in May, 2024 to a Dominion representative, stating “Friends of Lee Ware has decided, and pledged, no longer to request or to accept donations from Dominion Energy or its subsidiaries,” along with a Virginia Scope article detailing Ware’s 2022 legislative attempt to ban campaign political contributions from public utility companies, like Dominion.

Ware represents part of Chesterfield County, where Dominion—through its allied pro-utility front group Power for Tomorrow—is fighting widespread public opposition to a highly contested methane gas plant it claims is “critical” to meeting data center demand. Ware shares the district with Del. Coyner, who faces a rematch from four years ago when she takes on Democratic challenger Lindsey Dougherty in Tuesday’s general election. Dougherty, who opposes the plant, argued it “would hurt our air, our water, and our wallets, while doing nothing to solve our long-term energy needs.”

Senator Ghazala Hashmi, also a representative of the county, has led 19 other Virginia legislators in urging the Department of Environmental Quality and the SCC to deny the plant’s approval. Hashmi, now the Democratic nominee for Lt. Governor running against Dominion-backed John Reid, stated in the letter that the Chesterfield County plant “undermines Virginia’s pledge to transition to clean energy by 2050 and disregards the Commonwealth’s environmental justice policy.”

China has recently made several bold and unexpected moves related to its trade relations with the United States and India and at the WTO.

These actions suggest that China may be shifting to a more assertive posture in defending its economic interests abroad and shaping the terms of global trade.

They also point to a possible future in which China’s influence and power in the international system is linked to its dominant position in clean energy industries.

In the last six weeks, the Chinese government has made several bold moves related to its trade relations. First, on September 23, Chinese Premier Li Qiang made a surprise announcement that Beijing would no longer seek the “special and differential treatment” privileges (SDT) afforded to developing countries within the WTO system. Then, on October 9, China’s Ministry of Commerce published stringent export controls on rare earth materials and battery manufacturing equipment. Finally, on October 15, China’s WTO delegation initiated a dispute against India over the latter country’s efforts to boost domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and advanced chemistry cell batteries.

These developments may seem unrelated. But all three are a notable departure from China’s usual low profile relative to other economic heavyweights in shaping global trade conditions. Taken together, they signal that China may be shifting to a more assertive posture in defending its economic interests abroad and shaping the terms of global trade. Thus far, the strongest evidence for this shift relates to Beijing’s engagement on an issue that has been a recurring source of tension with its trading partners: clean energy.

Keeping a (relatively) low profile

China’s rapid transformation into the world’s largest exporter following its accession to the WTO, even as it maintained comparatively high barriers on its own economy, has given Beijing a natural interest in maintaining the status quo in the global trade system. Unlike the United States, China is not wielding tariffs coercively in a bid to overturn established trade norms. Unlike the European Union, it is not leveraging its market power to strengthen its trading partners’ labor and environmental standards. Instead, China has primarily focused on building a network of free trade agreements to complement its unrivaled overseas investment footprint.

At the WTO, China has generally taken a more pragmatic approach to its diplomacy than other influential developing economies, such as by joining plurilateral initiatives like the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Agreement (MPIA) and the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions (TESSD). Although Beijing has been involved in many trade controversies, it is usually in a reactive capacity—that is, as a respondent or third party in a WTO dispute or in response to tariffs and countervailing duties that other governments have imposed on Chinese goods.

A shift in strategic posture

In this context, Beijing’s recent moves are significant, but not necessarily for the reasons one might assume. Li’s announcement about SDT is not a major shift in Beijing’s negotiating position. China has routinely declined developing-country privileges at the WTO and the announcement simply codifies this practice into policy. Likewise, China has on many previous occasions imposed export restrictions on rare earths and other mineral elements. China’s dispute with India, meanwhile, mirrors an earlier challenge it brought against the United States related to subsidies established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The significance of these moves is instead in their scope and message, which suggest a shift in strategic posture. Li’s SDT announcement, for example, criticized “unilateralism and protectionism” and warned against “decoupling, severing supply chains, and bloc confrontation.” Li also remarked that China would “continue to promote the green transition” and “shoulder its due responsibilities” to contribute to global development. He drew special attention to China’s role in global clean energy supply chains, observing that it had reduced the costs of both solar and wind energy generation and “carried out green energy cooperation projects with over 100 countries and regions.” These remarks drew an implicit contrast with the Trump administration, which has rejected multilateral cooperation on trade and pressured other countries to buy US oil and gas products.

Washington has for many years been a staunch critic of SDT privileges in the WTO system, particularly for China. By defusing this critique and presenting itself as a fair minded, generous, and collaborative international partner, Beijing is positioning itself for a more prominent role in global governance and burnishing its credentials as a champion of multilateral institutions. In this sense, Li’s remarks dovetailed with another high-profile Chinese policy shift announced in September: the launch of the Global Governance Initiative, which seeks to redefine international cooperation and rule setting under the aegis of “new multilateralism” in opposition to US “hegemonic thinking.”

If Beijing’s pivot on SDT reflects a new appetite to revive and reform multilateral institutions, its other recent moves send a less cooperative message. Its latest export controls, which build on earlier restrictions imposed in response to the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs and appear to be a direct response to a US Commerce Department rulemaking that expanded the number of Chinese or Chinese-linked firms subject to US export restrictions, are significantly stricter and broader than previous controls. Indeed, they pose a grave threat to multiple US industries. The controls were reportedly designed to give Beijing powerful leverage in future trade negotiations with the Trump administration; according to President Trump, China has agreed to suspend the controls for a year as part of a larger deal negotiated between Trump and Xi Jinping on October 30.

China’s dispute at the WTO, meanwhile, targets subsidies and other incentives designed to attract investment to battery and electric vehicle manufacturing in India under the broader “Make in India” campaign launched in 2014. China’s claim is notable in two respects. First, it contests India’s use of industrial policy tools to expand domestic production of clean energy technologies, despite China’s well-documented record of deploying subsidies and domestic content requirements on a far larger scale to support Chinese manufacturing of these same goods. Second, it marks the first time China has initiated a dispute against a country with a lower level of economic development than its own. SDT privileges have been a key component of India’s negotiation strategy at the WTO and New Delhi has strongly opposed reforming WTO rules related to SDT; even before China initiated its dispute, Indian commentators had observed that China’s decision not to seek SDT privileges would put greater scrutiny on this strategy.

Mixed messages, or a turn to green power competition?

At first glance, China’s recent moves may appear to send conflicting signals. On the one hand, Beijing is relinquishing a favorable negotiating position at the WTO with the stated purpose of working arm-in-arm with other countries to reinvigorate international institutions and enable broad deployment of clean energy technologies. On the other hand, it is weaponizing its monopoly on key inputs into clean energy supply chains to inflict pain on a geopolitical rival and contesting a fellow developing country’s green industrial policies.

But these two positions may not be as irreconcilable as they seem. They both point to a vision of China’s role in global affairs in which Chinese dominance of clean energy industries provides both an instrument of and justification for Chinese power and influence. More specifically, China would serve as a benefactor of other countries’ decarbonization and sustainable development ambitions, even if doing so requires undercutting their efforts to build alternatives to Chinese products and investment. In confronting competitors and adversaries seeking to decouple themselves to some extent from Chinese supply chains, Beijing appears willing to risk tensions with other Global South governments and leverage its control of critical chokepoints of global trade, which are primarily clustered in the clean energy sector.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image_How-Chinas-New-Trade-Assertiveness-Is-Linked-to-Its-Clean-Energy-Dominance.png,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:22.257626

In an era defined by digital transformation and geopolitical uncertainty, Canada through its G7 Presidency, is leading work with trusted international partners to strengthen supply chains, reduce dependencies and ensure access to the resources essential for clean energy, advanced manufacturing and defence.

Today, on the margins of the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Toronto, the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, along with G7 and industry partners, announced the first round of strategic projects and measures under the Critical Minerals Production Alliance to accelerate the development of secure critical minerals supply chains.

The Critical Minerals Production Alliance leverages sovereign tools to operationalize projects that will strengthen global critical minerals supply chains. By working together, the Alliance will bring critical mineral projects into production with high standards that drive economic growth and protect national security.

Minister Hodgson announced 26 new investments, partnerships and measures to accelerate and unlock $6.4 billion of critical minerals projects. These include:

Mobilizing public and private capital to accelerate critical mineral projects, including for graphite, rare earth elements and scandium production.

Securing offtake arrangements and co-investments in partnership with nine allied countries and industry partners from France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, the United States, Australia and Ukraine.

Entering offtake arrangements between the Government of Canada and Nouveau Monde Graphite and Rio Tinto for graphite and scandium, respectively.

Releasing the Roadmap to Promote Standards-Based Markets for Critical Minerals, a key deliverable under the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan (CMAP), as a direct followup to the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Kananaskis, Alberta.

Canada’s collaboration with international partners reinforces the country’s reputation as a place to do business, strengthens its position as a trusted supplier and encourages greater investment in Canadian mining and processing projects. As part of the G7 CMAP, Minister Hodgson also highlighted up to $20.2 million in support of projects developed in collaboration with international partners to advance innovation in critical minerals research and development.

To further safeguard Canada’s national security and sovereignty, the Government of Canada intends to leverage the Defence Production Act to stockpile critical minerals in order to:

Strengthen domestic capabilities in strategic sectors critical to national defence;

Mobilize and protect domestic production and ensure secure supply to Canadian and allied defence industries;

Support Arctic sovereignty and domestic and collective stockpiling efforts with trusted partners; and

Advance the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) deterrence and defence goals by expanding transatlantic capacity.

The Critical Minerals Production Alliance stands as proof that the G7 can work together to develop critical minerals supply chains in a time of growing competition and evolving geopolitical context.

In advance of key events such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2026 Ministerial Meeting and the 2026 Prospectors and Developers Annual Conference (PDAC), Canada will continue to take the necessary steps — in close collaboration with G7 and other like-minded countries — to diversify, strengthen and secure critical minerals supply chains to ensure a safe and prosperous future for all Canadians.",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:25.200238

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by four to 546 in the week to October 31, the lowest since September.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

It said oil rigs fell by six to 414 this week, their lowest level since September, while gas rigs rose by four to 125, their highest since August 2023.

FIRMS SHIFT FOCUS AMID LOWER ENERGY PRICES

In Texas, the biggest oil and gas producing state, the rig count fell by one to 235, the lowest since September 2021. In Louisiana, meanwhile, the rig count rose by one to 41, the highest since September 2024.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production (E&P) companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 3% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

US EIA PROJECTED HIGHER OUTPUT

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020.

EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

The hearing will begin at 5:30 PM. Presentation shall commence around 6:00 PM and the event will end at 7:00 PM. The purpose of the public hearing is to offer all interested persons an opportunity to comment on current preliminary design plans to install a roundabout at this intersection in Hancock County. The purpose of the project is to reduce the traffic queues that can develop at the intersection and improve safety. As proposed, the project involves the construction of a single-lane roundabout at the intersection. The work will extend approximately 300’ in each direction of SR 9 and approximately 500’ in each direction of SR 234 from the center of the intersection. Along with the roundabout, new drainage ditches will be graded, and street lighting will be added. The Maintenance of Traffic (MOT) plan for the project involves reducing SR 9 to one-lane and using temporary traffic signals for alternating one-way operation. SR 234 will be closed at the intersection and detoured using US 36, SR 38, and SR 109. MOT details will be presented during the public hearing. Access to all properties will be maintained during construction. INDOT will coordinate with emergency services, local school corporation officials and project stakeholders to ensure potential disruptions and impacts are minimized as much as possible. The project will require approximately 1.89 acres of permanent new right-of-way, in addition, 0.24 acre of temporary right-of-way needed during construction. There are not expected to be any displacements, although that will be made final during the project’s appraising. Federal and state funds are proposed to be used for construction of this project.

New report from Climate Power reveals that Trump’s war on clean energy has canceled or delayed 158,000 clean energy jobs

Washington, D.C. – Days before voters head to the polls in elections where energy costs have taken center stage, a new report from Climate Power details the impacts of Trump’s self-inflicted energy crisis. Climate Power’s Energy Crisis Snapshot shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office.

In a letter to the Trump administration calling out Trump for raising energy costs across the country, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) highlighted the job losses and canceled projects detailed in Climate Power’s report. The findings come as voters increasingly cite energy affordability as a top concern, with 57% of registered voters saying that rising electricity prices are having an impact on their personal finances. Each month, as American families face higher utility bills, Trump and Republicans are making the affordability crisis even worse by canceling clean energy projects that would have brought more energy to the grid.

“Donald Trump promised to lower costs – but instead, he’s making Americans’ lives more expensive, plain and simple,” said New York Governor Kathy Hochul. “He claims he wants energy independence and then launches a full-on assault on clean energy, blocking the very projects that would make power more affordable and increase supply. He imposed reckless tariffs that are driving up the costs of new energy projects or killing them outright, costing our state thousands of jobs. While Trump and his D.C. enablers put American families last, spineless New York Republicans are falling in line instead of fighting for the New Yorkers who put them in office in the first place. We may not agree on everything, but we should all agree on this: the cost of living is too high, and we need more energy, more jobs, and lower bills – now.”

“Trump is taking a sledgehammer to American clean energy manufacturing, and American families are paying the price. More clean energy means lower electricity bills – it’s supply and demand 101 – but Trump’s extreme agenda is taking cheap, reliable energy off the grid at the same time that demand is skyrocketing,” said Climate Power Executive Director Lori Lodes. “Americans face an affordability crisis that Trump and Republicans are making even worse with their war on clean energy. We need more energy, now, and by taking the cheapest energy we have off the table, Trump is directly raising Americans’ utility costs. Next week, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia have an opportunity to bring their power to the polls and hold Trump and Republicans accountable for making life more expensive.”

With the 2025 elections days away, the report reveals that Virginia, New Jersey, and Georgia had some of the highest impacts from Trump’s war on clean energy:

The report’s findings include:

Household electric bills are up 11% nationally since Trump took office, and are poised to spike even further. In July 2025, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans passed the GOP budget bill. This bill is raising utility costs and destroying jobs by removing cheaper, cleaner energy sources from the grid, while funding new tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Donald Trump and Republicans are accelerating their self-inflicted energy crisis, sending utility costs through the roof, closing down factories, and making us more dependent on foreign oil, all while dramatically increasing the pollution of our air and water.

WILDEMAN, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.wane.com/news/national-world/ap-us-news/ap-fast-chargers-are-expanding-quickly-but-american-ev-drivers-still-fear-running-out-of-juice/,"KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.
Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply.
But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.
Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour.
Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

In a letter to Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers also urged the EPA to reallocate 100% of the waived gallons from any granted Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and to finalize the rule swiftly to ensure farmers and biofuel producers don’t lose out.

“At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA’s recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and advancing American energy dominance. The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income, and rural economies. These volumes matter —not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans, and other feedstocks that power this economy, and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets, and greater opportunity for rural America,” the lawmakers wrote.

“As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023–2025. Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won’t reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices,” the lawmakers continued.

Read the letter here.

Background:

In April, Ernst urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability, and growth to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by raising Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. Following the EPA’s June announcement for getting the RFS back on track, Ernst praised the Trump administration for proposing record biofuel volumes, adding domestic feedstock protections, and reversing the Biden-era electric vehicle (EV) mandate – putting America’s farmers and rural communities first.

She also helped introduce the Farmer First Fuel Incentives Act, which she successfully included in the One Big Beautiful Bill to extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and ensure domestic feedstocks are prioritized for biofuel production – opening new markets for farmers.

More broadly, Ernst has been a leading advocate for homegrown Iowa biofuels, securing access to E15 for the summer driving months and pushing for permanent, nationwide availability that would give consumers, farmers, and biofuel producers the certainty they deserve.

They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.
Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said.
The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States.
It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del.","Advocates and lawmakers gathered in Baltimore on Friday to punch back at President Donald Trump’s assault on offshore wind projects, including one planned for Maryland’s coast.

Until Friday, the battle had largely played out in warring court documents traded between the Trump administration and US Wind, the company behind the proposal for up to 121 turbines off the coast of Ocean City.

In September, Trump’s Department of the Interior told a federal judge that it plans to revoke a critical federal permit issued to the US Wind project in the dying days of President Joe Biden’s administration.

The permit had been challenged by the Town of Ocean City, which welcomed the permit reversal. But the judge is still considering the government’s request, which has been ardently opposed by US Wind.

The event in Baltimore was the first of several “Yes to Wind” events planned for states across the country, and attracted two Maryland Democrats: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Rep. Johnny Olszewski.

“What you’re seeing here is people power. Because what you’re seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys,” Van Hollen said. “They don’t like the competition.”

Earlier this year, a coalition of Maryland climate groups, labor unions and renewable energy advocates joined to form the Offshore Wind Alliance. They’ve squared up against the Stop Offshore Wind coalition, sponsored by the Town of Ocean City, Worcester County and business groups from the beach town.

But not everyone on Maryland’s Eastern Shore opposes the project, said Jared Schablein, chairman of the civic organization Shore Progress.

“This project injects new life into our local workforce by bringing real jobs, real investment and real hope into my community,” Schablein said. “It’s about making sure the next generation of shore kids don’t have to move away to find opportunities.”

Much of the messaging on Friday was focused on the economics behind the wind project, with supporters arguing that the project will lower utility bills by bolstering power supply.

“Offshore wind means lower utility bills. Let me say it again: Offshore wind means lower utility bills,” Olszewski said. “Blocking these projects will not lower costs, it will raise them.”

The project’s opponents have argued that, in addition to hurting Ocean City tourism and coastal fisheries, the project will raise power bills, partly because of construction costs.

Paul Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, said it’s possible that the wind farm could cause a “blip” for ratepayers, but urged Marylanders to take a long-term view of the project’s economics.

“With many of these energy projects, whether it’s rooftop solar or offshore wind, there’s an upfront cost, but it can get recovered fairly quickly, and once it’s recovered, the price drops considerably,” Pinsky said.

A January study from the Energy Administration indicated that Maryland is “below trajectory to meet its existing clean energy targets, in particular those renewable targets set for 2030.” The state has an overall goal of reaching 100% carbon-free energy by 2035.

The Trump administration began by halting the issuance of any new offshore wind leases off the coast of the United States. But the administration has since begun targeting projects that already received federal approval — and in some cases, had already started construction, unlike Maryland’s project.

The Trump administration has issued “stop work” orders to Empire Wind in New York (which was rescinded after negotiations with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul) and to Revolution Wind in Rhode Island (which was overturned by a federal judge).

In Maryland, the administration requested to revoke the project’s approval, citing a need to review impacts on coastal fisheries and search-and-rescue efforts in the area.

“It wasn’t enough to raise taxes on clean energy. It wasn’t enough for them to stop offshore wind leases,” said Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery). “They had to actually do stop work orders on projects that were 80% complete, because that’s how much their billionaire fossil fuel buddies are threatened by offshore wind.”

The administration also rescinded $679 million in grant funding for port projects in the U.S., including some tied to offshore wind manufacturing. That included $47.4 million bound for the Sparrows Point Steel turbine manufacturing hub planned for Baltimore County.

“Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a news release at the time.

“This is an administration that has explicitly gone after clean energy projects in Democratic-led states and Democratic-led districts,” Olszewski said. “That is not who we are as Americans. We are better than that.”

Friday’s news conference was held at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 office in Baltimore, which also includes a training center for future electricians.

The center trains about 600 apprentices each year, said Rico Albacarys, political director for the union. In high-voltage training courses taught toward the end of apprentices’ four years of study, the students work on the types of thick cables that run through wind turbines, Albacarys said.

To work on building Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, though, electricians will need a special certification that isn’t offered at the center on Patapsco Avenue in West Baltimore.

Called global wind organization training, the certification costs about $2,000 per person, and it only lasts for two years, Albacarys said. So the Trump administration’s efforts to slow the US Wind project have made it more difficult for the union to plan when it will train its members, Albacarys said.

“We’re trying to thread the needle,” Albacarys said. “We don’t want to start training them too early [so] that they have to get recertified before they actually are able to work on the turbines.”

Regardless of the recent obstacles, Albacarys said he’s confident that Maryland will eventually gain a wind farm on its Atlantic coast.

“It’s only a matter of time,” Albacarys said. “I know it doesn’t feel that way right now, but I think 20 years from now, we’re looking back at: ‘Oh, remember that speed bump?’”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9238-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 17:18:28.277476

A decision to keep the power plant open would mark a new flashpoint between Colorado and the federal government.

A controversial legal strategy to keep coal plants running Hurd’s letter asks Wright to invoke Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.
“DOE actions to prevent coal plants from retiring will increase costs and make electricity less affordable,” Gerhart said.","Congressman Jeff Hurd sent a letter on Friday asking the Trump administration to indefinitely delay the closure of Comanche 2, a coal-fired power plant currently scheduled to shut down at the end of 2025.

Pueblo is home to two operational coal-fired power plants run by Xcel Energy: Comanche 2, slated to close in December, and Comanche 3, a consistently unreliable plant scheduled to shutter by 2031. Comanche 1, an older unit built in 1973, ended operations in 2022.

Hurd’s letter asks Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive from Colorado — to invoke federal emergency powers to keep the lights on at the entire Comanche Generating Station, until certain the utility installs enough generation to replace it. In an interview with CPR News, Hurd, who represents Pueblo, said that the one-two punch of closing Comanche 2 and 3 would create a crisis when demand for power is spiking, driven by data centers used for AI.

“Fundamentally, I think this is an issue of grid stability, which goes beyond the state borders of Colorado,” Hurd said.

A decision to keep the power plant open would mark a new flashpoint between Colorado and the federal government. Colorado utilities have spent years working with state regulators on plans to shutter all six coal-fired power plants across the state by 2031.

It’s clear, however, that the Trump administration is ready to override state authority. In May, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright delayed the closing date for the J.H. Campbell power plant in Michigan, warning the loss would lead to blackouts. Critics claim no emergency exists and ratepayers will end up paying millions to keep the facility on life support.

Hurd’s request faces immediate pushback

A similar fight could soon play out in Colorado.

Neither Xcel Energy nor state regulators have publicly sounded the alarm about an imminent grid reliability crisis that’d require Comanche 2 to stay open. Environmental groups claim the federal government is ready to invent one in order to buoy the coal industry.

‘This is a manufactured crisis,” said Erin Overturf, the clean energy director for Western Resource Advocates. “If we are in a so-called energy emergency, then why is the Trump administration bending over backwards to slow procurement of clean energy resources like wind, solar and battery resources?”

Overturf also worries that extending Comanche’s lifespan would increase energy bills. In Michigan, the utility operating the J.H. Compbell power plant recently reported it’s spent around $615,000 per day to keep the facility running, adding up to $80 million in net costs since May. Customers will eventually pay some of those costs.

Utilities have also guaranteed closing coal fire power plants would save money in Colorado. Xcel Energy announced plans to close Comanche Unit 1 and Comanche Unit 2 in 2017. At the time, Colorado’s largest utility claimed retiring both coal-fired power plants would help protect the environment and save ratepayers $213 million money over the long run.

State utility regulators at the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) unanimously approved the plan in 2018. Roughly four years later, the same panel of regulators approved a settlement to shutter Comanche 3 by 2031.

The PUC and Xcel Energy have also spent years deliberating how to replace Comanche 3. The current plan calls for a massive build out of new renewables and payments to Pueblo County to compensate for tax revenue lost by shuttering the complex.

Some local officials have called on the federal government to interfere, arguing that only new natural gas power plants or even nuclear facilities could offer sufficient jobs and property taxes.

In a written statement, Will Toor, the director of the Colorado Energy Office, said Gov. Polis’ administration is ready to talk to local officials about the best ways to protect air quality and low energy prices

“At the same time, it’s important to point out that wind and solar are cheaper for consumers than expensive and often unreliable coal-fired generation, and utility resource planning is subject to state – not federal – jurisdiction,” Toor said.

Hurd, however, said the state has failed to account for potential grid reliability issues. Comanche 3 — Colorado’s newest coal plant — has been full or partially offline for more than 138 days since August 2023, according to documents obtained by the outlet Big Pivots. With so many outages, Hurd said Colorado can’t afford to shut down Comanche 2, which he claimed provides a consistent source of baseload power.

In a statement, Xcel Energy said it would comply with any orders issued by the federal government to keep its coal plants running.

The U.S. Department of Energy did not reply to a request for comment.

A controversial legal strategy to keep coal plants running

Hurd’s letter asks Wright to invoke Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

The law allows the federal government to order power plants to stay open during emergencies — like during times of war, in the aftermath of disasters or when there’s a shortage of electricity.

The Trump administration has already invoked the law to keep the lights on at the Michigan plant, and another one in Pennsylvania.

The Sierra Club has challenged the Michigan orders in federal court. Matt Gerhart, a staff attorney for the environmental group, said it’s currently monitoring the possibility of a similar order to continue operations at the Comanche Generating Station.

“DOE actions to prevent coal plants from retiring will increase costs and make electricity less affordable,” Gerhart said. “Sierra Club would fight back against any 202(c) issued in Colorado.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/02/240130-pueblo-xcel-comanche-electric-power-hwv-0007.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 16:19:25.230278

As US Wind awaits a variety of legal decisions, the Trump administration continues its fight against offshore wind projects across the coast.","Top Maryland Democrats are coming out in full force to support a massive offshore wind project currently tied up in federal court.

Baltimore-based US Wind has faced an onslaught of challenges in recent months keeping the company from starting construction on a 114-turbine wind farm off the coast of Ocean City, which is estimated to generate enough power for 718,000 Maryland homes.

In October 2024, the Town of Ocean City and numerous plaintiffs representing the fishing and tourism industry filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), challenging the federal permit approval process for US Wind’s project.

This September, the Trump administration asked the court to vacate the project’s Construction and Operations Plan — approved under the Biden administration — and send it back to BOEM for reevaluation, signaling plans to reverse approvals of the necessary permits.

If the court approves such a move, Ocean City’s lawsuit could become moot.

US Wind filed a crossclaim, arguing the federal government’s intent to ""vacate and undermine the federal approvals” are tied to “a wider plan to hinder or kill outright offshore wind projects for political purposes.”

Earlier this month, US Wind also filed for a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from revoking the permits, arguing such a move could bankrupt the company.

The Trump administration’s attempt to revoke the permits follows a federal executive order signed in January that directs agencies to review previously approved offshore wind projects and temporarily halt all offshore wind energy leasing within the Offshore Continental Shelf.

Friday, Maryland U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Jonny Olszewski joined the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 24 in showing support for US Wind’s project.

While the Trump administration argues the permits were granted without properly weighing environmental and commercial impacts, Van Hollen believes the opposition comes down to fossil fuel interests.

“What you're seeing from President Trump in the White House right now is a tip of the hat to the Big Oil guys. They don't like the competition from clean energy, including offshore energy,” Van Hollen said.

Olszewski raised concerns over what revoking those permits and ultimately delaying or canceling the project could have on the region’s economy and energy crisis.

“Pulling the plug on offshore wind is a direct assault on American jobs. It's an attack on our national energy security, and it's an assault on the affordability that Maryland families and American families need so desperately right now,” the congressman said.

Maryland has set an ambitious target of 8,500 megawatts of offshore wind energy generation by 2031 — US Wind’s project could help accomplish roughly a quarter of those generation goals.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown also reiterated support for the project Wednesday, filing an amicus brief advocating for the approval of US Wind’s request for a preliminary injunction.

“Maryland has spent years building our offshore wind future, but the Trump administration's actions threaten that progress and the thousands of jobs this project would create,"" Brown said in a statement. “We're filing this brief to defend critical investments in Maryland communities, good-paying jobs for Marylanders, and the clean energy our families need as electricity demand and utility costs continue rising.""

The Trump administration dealt another blow to US Wind back in August when it cancelled $679 million for offshore wind projects.

The funding withdrawal did not cut money allocated for the project directly but instead revoked a federal grant that was intended to fund construction for the new steel fabrication facility Sparrows Point Steel.

The proposed long-term monopile production facility at Sparrows Point in Baltimore would be specifically equipped for producing materials for the Maryland offshore wind project.

Despite losing the grant, US Wind says it will continue to move forward with the $400 million facility.

The future of the project also rests in the hands of the Delaware Superior Court, where US Wind is appealing a decision from a county council to deny a permit needed to build an electrical substation in Delaware where the generated power would connect to the regional grid.

Ocean City is also challenging an air pollution permit tied to the project issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment.

Clean energy is not the enemy of energy security; it is a central component of it, and veterans are core to the workforce building that capability.","Tens of thousands of American veterans wake up every morning to go to work in the solar and storage industry. They are construction workers, project managers, and electricians that are continuing their service by building the infrastructure that powers our lives.

Veterans make up 8.2% of the U.S. solar workforce, significantly higher than their share of the national labor force. As Washington continues its seemingly daily attacks on clean energy, the truth is that those attacks are disproportionately hurting veterans.

I’m proud to be one of 23,000 veterans working in the solar and storage industry, but my journey here was not smooth. I was an Infantry Officer in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2015 to 2021, and one of 6,000 veterans fired in DOGE cuts. In the months that followed, I’ve watched as Washington has systematically attacked our industry in favor of their preferred energy sources.

This Veterans Day, honoring service shouldn’t be rhetorical. If we truly want to value those who served, let’s align our policy with that promise. We can start by building the industries that secure our energy future while preserving the livelihoods of the veterans who build them.

Cancelled projects and broad cuts to federal clean energy programs don’t fall evenly across the economy. They land hardest in an industry where veterans make up a larger share of the workforce. Add that to the thousands of veterans laid off due to federal staffing cuts, and the result is clear: more veterans are out of work and more military families will lose paychecks due to the Administration’s attacks on the solar and storage industry.

Princeton’s ZERO Lab and other studies estimate a roughly $500 billion reduction in clean energy investment through 2035, and Energy Innovation projects up to 760,000 U.S. jobs could be lost by 2030. Because veterans are represented in the clean energy workforce at roughly double their share of the overall U.S. workforce, those modeling projections imply 68,400–76,000 veterans could be affected.

According to SEIA and Wood Mackenzie forecasts, the Trump administration’s anti-clean energy policies could cause the U.S. to lose up to 125 gigawatts of solar deployment between 2025 and 2030. This represents a significant hit to future hiring and manufacturing that will further depress opportunities for veterans in the sector.

The consequences of this administration’s anti-solar policies reach far beyond jobs. Veterans bring mission discipline and leadership to these projects that strengthen America’s energy infrastructure. When we push veterans out of these roles, we don’t just drive-up unemployment data, we hollow out teams that deliver energy security.

Energy security in 2025 means building resilient, homegrown energy systems that can stand up to supply shocks, extreme weather, and interference from hostile actors. But moving away from domestic clean energy and deepening reliance on imported fuel sources creates vulnerability at the hands of foreign suppliers. Look no further than Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which demonstrated how quickly a geopolitical shock can trigger a global energy crisis. Solar has zero fuel cost and much lower price volatility. Investing in abundant, American-made clean energy is not merely an economic or environmental choice, but a core national-security imperative.

The irony is sharp. This administration talks about “American energy dominance” and “energy security” as pillars of national strength. Yet policies that undercut clean energy deployment and simultaneously place tens of thousands of veterans out of work actively weaken our national security. Clean energy is not the enemy of energy security; it is a central component of it, and veterans are core to the workforce building that capability.

We must do better. If we really mean “thank you for your service,” let’s act like it. Lawmakers should protect the domestic clean energy industries that employ and empower veterans. That means sustaining stable, long-term policy signals that attract investment, expanding programs like Solar Ready Vets, and ensuring that veterans have clear, well-supported pathways into solar, storage, and related trades.

Nearly 23,000 American veterans choose to keep serving in solar and storage. The least we can do is make sure our policy choices don’t force them out of the work they’re doing for their country.

""Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercializing ASSB.""

Martin Schuster, Vice President Battery Cell and Cell Module at the BMW Group, says: “With Samsung SDI joining our partnership with Solid Power, we gain significant momentum on our path advancing the development of new battery cell technologies. This global collaboration is another proof point of our overarching goal: to be always in a position to offer our customers state of the art battery technology.”

The partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology, and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials.

With increased energy density, longer vehicle ranges can be achieved without having to accept disadvantages in terms of weight of the overall storage system.

The BMW Group and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 through an extended “Joint Development Agreement,” which was supported by a BMW Group investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of a financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership. BMW will operate a solid-state cell prototype line at the CMCC in Parsdorf, on the basis of a research and development license and with Solid Power's experience and expertise.

Since 2008, the BMW Group has been consistently building up its competence in the field of battery cell technology. Since 2019, this know-how has been pooled at the BMW Group's Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich. The BCCC covers the entire value chain, from research and development to battery cell design to producibility.

In order to be able to quickly and efficiently implement innovations in the field of battery cell technology, the BMW Group cooperates in a network of around 300 partners, including established companies, start-ups and universities, among others.

Labor unions and business groups hailed the approval.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a federal permit Wednesday to Enbridge for its proposed Line 5 reroute around the Bad River tribe‘s reservation. The company is proposing a $450 million plan to build a new 41-mile segment of the oil and gas pipeline after the tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to shut down and remove Line 5 from its lands.

That permitting decision comes as the federal government remains shut down, and no documents were made available by the agency in its decision.

Environmental groups Midwest Environmental Advocates and Clean Wisconsin say it’s too soon to issue a permit, calling the agency’s decision “unlawful.” Tony Wilkin Gibart, MEA executive director, criticized the Army Corps for issuing the permit to a foreign company without releasing its details to the public. He added that legal action by the tribe and groups to block state permits for the project remain ongoing.

“It’s a violation of federal law for the Army Corps to grant these permits before a final state water quality certification,” Wilkin Gibart told WPR.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources issued the certification last year, but Wilkin Gibart said it’s not final under Wisconsin law due to the ongoing challenge. Groups stress construction can’t begin until the contested case hearing challenging state permits for the project is resolved. A decision is still pending as groups prepare final briefs in the case.

Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in a statement that the company expects a decision on the challenge by the end of the year.

“We’re confident state permits will soon be confirmed,” Kellner said. “Once that occurs, Enbridge expects the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Proffered Permit to be signed and finalized, allowing construction to move forward.”

The project would cross close to 200 waterways and affect around 101 acres of wetlands in Ashland and Iron counties. Construction would include blasting bedrock and drilling in waterways and wetlands upstream from the reservation and internationally recognized wild rice beds.

Bad River Tribal Chair Robert Blanchard didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Gussie Lord, an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribe, called the Army’s decision shortsighted.

“We think it’s really important to protect the Great Lakes for future generations. We know that wetland ecosystems work to provide habitat and protect the watershed and protect homes from flooding,” Lord said. “(Line 5) is an aging piece of infrastructure. It’s outlived its useful life, and it doesn’t belong running through the heart of the greatest freshwater system in North America.”

Supporters of the project, including labor unions and farm groups, said the Army Corps permit is a key milestone for Line 5, which carries up to 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids daily. They’ve touted the 700 jobs that would be created through the project and its roughly $135 million economic impact, including Corey Gall, president of the Wisconsin Pipe Trades Association.

“By our nature, we go from job to job and follow the work, so they’re not temporary jobs. They’re careers,” Gall said. “Many of these men and women who work these pipeline jobs often travel far from home (and) out-of-state. It would be great to have another project within our state that would keep all these folks working close to home.”

He estimated 300 or more pipeline welders or workers in Wisconsin may be working on the project during peak construction. Groups like the Dairy Business Association thanked the Corps for its decision, saying they feared price hikes or a propane shortage if Line 5 were shut down.

The Army Corps of Engineers had been reviewing Enbridge’s application for a permit under the Clean Water Act since 2020. A Corps official said the decision Wednesday would advance President Donald Trump’s energy agenda.

For the first time in nearly five years, voters will decide two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, the powerful utility regulator that controls electricity rates and energy policy statewide.

The commission has gained increased attention as Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric utility with 2.8 million customers, is requesting approval for 10,000 megawatts of new power generation capacity over the next five years.

That demand comes largely from Georgia’s surging data center development, with metro Atlanta becoming the fastest growing market for server farms in the U.S. But the data center boom, driven by the rapid of artificial intelligence and information technology, has raised concerns about the amount of land and energy the complexes consume.

Critics say the costs to power them are falling on Georgia residents and local businesses. Data centers use 10 to 50 times as much energy as a typical office building with the same square footage, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

All that has created a window of opportunity for local Democrats seeking to bring change to the all-Republican commission. The body faces criticism for approving six utility rate hikes since late 2022, increasing the average Georgia Power residential customer’s monthly bill by about $43.

“There are already multiple plans to set up data centers in Georgia, and we’ve seen ample evidence that we could be the ones covering the bill,” said Navy Eger, a 30-year-old Georgia resident. “My hope is that by adding two Democrats to the commission, we stand more of a chance of pushback on these reckless proposals.”

In May, Georgia Power struck a deal with the five commissioners to keep its current base rates in place through 2028.

That rate freeze was touted by Commission Vice Chair Tim Echols.

As he fights to retain his position, he says keeping Georgia’s energy rates low is his top priority.

“Electing Tim Echols again gives you a steady hand at the Public Service Commission in keeping Georgia at the forefront of business in America,” Echols said. “I have moved Georgia into seventh place for installed solar, built the only nuclear energy plant to be completed in 36 years and frozen Georgia Power’s base rates for three years.”

Echols was an unwavering supporter of Plant Vogtle, Georgia’s four-unit nuclear power plant. He said he would like to see the construction of more large nuclear reactors, which are among the safest modes of electricity generation.

Serving on the commission since 2011, the incumbent Republican is now up for reelection.

He faces a new Democratic challenger in his district — Alicia Johnson.

Johnson said she wants to fight against unjust rate increases, advocate for ratepayer protections and push for bolder investment in clean, affordable energy solutions like solar and wind.

She says she wants to hold Georgia Power accountable for its requested increases and ensure they are not overestimating how much power they actually need.

Besides data centers, the company has also been criticized for its use of “trade secret” designations and redacted information in submissions to the commission. One vocal critic, Patty Durand, was arrested last week after she took a booklet labeled “Georgia Power Trade Secrets” during a commission hearing.

Also fueling Democratic engagement: concerns about climate change and support for clean energy.

Last year, renewable resources accounted for 12% of Georgia’s total in-state electricity generation, mostly from solar energy and biomass from wood, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

And yet also last year, the commission green-lit new gas-fired turbines. Earlier this year, they approved a Georgia Power plan to keep coal plants open past their previously approved retirement dates.

In District Three, which includes most of the southern suburbs of Atlanta, incumbent Republican Fitz Johnson is trying to fend off a challenge from Democrat Peter Hubbard.

It will be the first time the Army veteran and businessman faces voters after he was appointed by Republican Governor Brian Kemp in 2021 to replace former commissioner Chuck Eaton, who became a state judge.

Although Johnson voted to allow Georgia Power to push most of $10 billion in costs from the over-budget expansion of Plant Vogtle to the company’s ratepayers, he has blamed the rate increases on inflation and pointed to higher costs in Democratic-led states like California.

“When liberals in Washington tried to force their woke Green New Deal on Georgia and cost our families and crush our businesses, Fitz stood up for ratepayers and stopped their agenda at the state line,” Johnson’s campaign site states.

Hubbard, on the other hand, is a renewable energy advocate. While the solar developer and consultant has not held public office before, he is a familiar face at the commission, having testified in several Georgia Power cases representing his nonprofit, the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions.

With 15 years of experience developing electric utility “Integrated Resource Plans,” Hubbard says he has already prepared ones that prioritize lowering power bills through investments in low-cost and highly reliable solar, battery storage, virtual power plants and energy efficiency.

Against that backdrop, residents of some Georgia cities are also voting on city council and board of education seats.

Some are even choosing a mayor. That includes in Marietta, where 24-year-old Democrat Sam Foster is attempting to become its youngest and first Black chief executive. Foster has garnered wide support from the city’s young adults and Democratic community as he tries to unseat Steve Tumlin, a 78-year-old Republican who has held the position for 15 years.

“We need new blood in the area,” said Morgan Younce, a 33-year-old Marietta resident. “Tumlin is holding back progress and represents old Marietta.”

In Atlanta, the state’s capital and most populous city, Democrat Andre Dickens is attempting to win a second term as mayor. He says his four years in office have reduced violent crime and increased affordable housing units. He faces three challengers: Helmut Domagalski, a corporate consultant; Kalema Jackson, a former Atlanta police officer; and Eddie Meredith, a community advocate.

Over 500,000 voters turned out for early voting ahead of election day on Tuesday, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/sam-foster-mayor-marietta.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-31 17:18:41.531424

The project is meant to move over 1.5 million dekatherms per day of gas and is the largest expansion of gas infrastructure currently proposed in the Southeast. The assessment claims to analyze the environmental impacts of the SSEP’s multiple sections of pipeline, massive gas compressor station expansions and additional infrastructure modifications.

With the release of the assessment, FERC has announced a 30-day comment period, closing on Dec. 1. There have been no FERC public hearings for residents along the route thus far (only scoping meetings where people were required to give comments in private rooms), and the agency is not planning any during this comment period. This project impacts five states, and such a massive project warrants meaningful public participation from those along the impacted route.

FERC’s assessment arrives near the end of a Virginia Department of Environmental Quality public comment period for the SSEP, as a Virginia Water Protection Permit and Upland Certification are being considered through Nov. 10 as part of a Clean Water Act 401 permit review.

Adding to the significant concern about the SSEP’s impacts, Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC plans to build an extension of its pipeline, called “Southgate.” The SSEP and Southgate share similar routes through Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and Rockingham County, North Carolina, causing deep concern for local residents. The co-location of two high-pressure, large-diameter pipelines that cross the same waterways could mean cumulative, devastating impacts for local communities, species and water resources.

Southgate is currently undergoing a simultaneous permitting process, with FERC reviewing an amendment request to change the route, diameter and capacity through Nov. 3, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality undergoing a Clean Water Act 401 permit review through Dec. 5. The pipeline companies have bickered publicly about their access to the area and the need for both pipelines. The Environmental Assessment for Southgate concluded that SSEP could eliminate any need for Southgate.

“More than 90% of the gas from SSEP would go to utility companies across the Southeast for proposed gas plants that carry a lot of uncertainty,” said Juhi Modi, North Carolina Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “Forecasts of energy demand in the Southeast are likely overestimates driven by data centers and other large-load customers that may never materialize. But residential ratepayers would end up on the hook paying for this massive expansion of pipelines and gas plants, no matter what.”

“SSEP would go through communities in North Carolina that already suffer from some of the worst air pollution in the state — communities that have already voiced strong and unified opposition to this project,” said Caroline Hansley, Campaign Organizing Strategist at Sierra Club. “As FERC continues to ignore the impacts on those communities, it’s now more important than ever that local entities and elected officials stand up for their neighbors and oppose SSEP. We are committed to fighting SSEP alongside the impacted communities for as long as it takes.”

“It is absurd for the FERC staff to assert that this huge, destructive project would have ‘no significant impact’ on the precious environments and the people whose lives would be profoundly harmed,” said David Sligh, Wild Virginia’s Water Quality Programs Director. “FERC must complete a full Environmental Impact Statement, disclose the true impacts, and reject this proposal. That’s the only way the commission can meet its duty to protect the public interest.”

“We’re a month into the federal government shutdown, but business as usual continues for the fossil fuel polluters,” said Russell Chisholm, Managing Director of the POWHR Coalition. “Home energy costs keep going up with no relief in sight for communities just trying to survive, never mind keeping up with multiple permits for pipelines on top of pipelines.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-31 16:19:34.995294

We urge the EPA to withdraw this proposed rule and instead strengthen efforts to monitor GHG emissions from all sources, including the industrial sector.","On October 29, Woodwell Climate submitted public comment to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed amendments to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

Woodwell Climate Research Center (Woodwell) strongly opposes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to remove reporting obligations of 46 source categories for the industrial sector under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).1

Woodwell has conducted research on the dangers that greenhouse gases (GHG) pose to human life, property, and the environment since our founding in 1985. In 1986, Dr. George Woodwell, our founder and namesake, testified in the first congressional hearing on climate change.2 In his testimony, he warned his audience of future dangers of increasing emissions, including biological amplification, or the ways in which increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere creates a positive feedback system leading to further increases in emissions.

Woodwell values data transparency and recognizes public reporting programs as essential infrastructure for sound scientific practice and informed policy-making. Transparency is not merely a procedural virtue but a foundational principle of good science because it allows for peer review, reproducibility, and the collective advancement of knowledge that occurs when various experts can examine the same information. The GHGRP exemplifies this principle by making facility-level emissions data publicly available. An informed public is better equipped to participate meaningfully in democratic processes, to advocate for their health and safety, and to support policies grounded in empirical reality. By dismantling

this reporting infrastructure, the EPA would undermine scientific integrity and diminish American citizens’ ability to engage on matters directly related to their health and wellbeing.

Scientific Foundation and EPA’s Flawed Rationale for Rescission

Originally established in 2009, the GHGRP, under the Clean Air Act (CAA), required that the largest industrial emitters reported their emissions annually.3 EPA cited two sections of the CAA that provided authority to create the GHGRP, Sections 114 and 208. Section 114(a)(1) provides the basis for the EPA to require the monitoring and reporting of emissions, and section 208 provides EPA with the authority regarding motor vehicles and their engines.

Since then, the GHGRP has been used for monitoring emissions from 47 source categories, across 8,000 facilities in the United States.4 Efforts support our understanding of climate change as well as air quality, without such monitoring it will be difficult to track progress, or lack of progress, towards reducing emissions and may worsen health outcomes.5

Based on two broad sets of rationales, the EPA proposes to eliminate most of the GHGRP, removing reporting requirements for all source categories except petroleum and natural gas systems (Subpart W), which would be suspended until 2034. Under the proposed rule, EPA argues that Section 114 does not provide authority to collect GHGRP data because the reporting requirements do not serve an underlying statutory purpose under CAA. Specifically, EPA argues that Section 114 requires a greater connection between the continuous regulation obligation and a statutory purpose.6 Moreover, the agency argues that the elimination of most of the GHGRP will not disrupt its ability to meet provisions under the CAA and will not have any harm on human health or the environment.7 Such a claim ignores the substantial and mounting evidence that climate change and associated pollution significantly affect the health and welfare of American communities.

Health and Welfare Consequences

When established, the GHGRP was based upon a strong scientific foundation. Since the establishment of the GHGRP, the science supporting the effects of GHG emissions on public health and welfare has grown stronger, making accurate emissions monitoring more important than ever.

In 2023, the Fifth National Climate Assessment comprehensively assessed the current and future risks to the United States of GHG-induced climate change, including extensive evidence for public health impacts. The authors report existing harm to human health across the U.S. that is only expected to worsen with continued warming. The assessment documents compounding health hazards including: “More severe and frequent extreme events; Wider distribution of infections and vector-borne pathogens; Air quality worsened by smog, wildfire smoke, dust, and increased pollen; and threats to food and water security.”8 Rather than responding to this mounting evidence by strengthening emissions monitoring, the EPA proposes to eliminate the very reporting infrastructure needed to track and address these emission sources.

Threats to public health and welfare are further documented by international scientific assessments. The IPCC, established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), reviews existing scientific research on climate change and produces Assessment Reports that synthesize that knowledge. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report draws upon peer-reviewed scientific literature to conclude with high confidence that climate change has already resulted in “destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, human health and food security.”9 The report documents observed impacts including “Infectious diseases; Displacement; Mental health; Heat, malnutrition and harm from wildfire”10 as widespread and substantial consequences of GHG emissions around the world. The IPCC specifically examines North America, finding with very high confidence that rising temperatures are projected to increase heat-related mortality across all emission scenarios this century, and that smoke from intensified wildfire activity is associated with respiratory distress, with impacts persisting long distances from wildfires and beyond initial high-exposure periods, further underscoring the urgency of maintaining comprehensive emissions data.11

The strengthened scientific evidence cited above makes clear that the GHGRP serves a vital public health function. Accurate emissions data enables researchers, policymakers, and communities to identify pollution sources, track trends, and develop targeted interventions to protect public health. Eliminating reporting requirements would create blind spots in our understanding of emissions sources at the same time as the health consequences of GHG emissions are becoming more severe and better documented.

Case Study: Air Quality & Monitoring

Woodwell’s research demonstrates the connection between air quality and climate change. Exposure to pollutants, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter (PM), are contributors to a range of health issues.12 For example, PMs are microscopic particles that can penetrate deep into the body, exacerbating heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive problems.13,14 Scientists have also found long-term exposure to these pollutants can reduce life expectancy.15 These pollutants are often produced by the burning of fossil fuels, which also emits GHG emissions that drive climate warming. Climate change worsens pollution exposures by trapping pollutants in the atmosphere for longer periods of time, thereby increasing exposure durations and concentrations.16

In September 2025, the EPA released a report that found that intermittent air monitoring has adverse effects. Specifically, when air quality monitoring was offline for certain sites, those same sites saw a significant increase in air pollution levels.17 This report is consistent with what other scientists have found with intermittent monitoring of environmental standards and is known as the pollution gap.18 The pollution gap may lead to higher than allowable and unhealthy exposure, putting American communities at risk. The elimination of most of the GHGRP will only increase this threat.

Conclusion

The overwhelming scientific evidence is clear: GHG emissions pose a serious threat to public health and welfare that demands action, monitoring these emissions are essential for such action. Rescinding the GHGRP reporting obligation would be deeply contrary to the robust scientific evidence for the current and future harms to public health and welfare resulting from unfettered GHG emissions. Doing so would abandon America’s responsibility to protect its citizens and abdicate our leadership in addressing the defining challenge of our time. We urge the EPA to withdraw this proposed rule and instead strengthen efforts to monitor GHG emissions from all sources, including the industrial sector.",https://www.woodwellclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Woodwell_Favicon-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-31 17:05:49.729971

The deals were finalized during his October 2025 Asia tour. They aim to lower reliance on China, which leads to global production of these key materials.

Rare earth elements are vital for many things, including electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, smartphones, and defense systems.

Global demand is rising fast as countries invest more in clean energy and digital technologies. These new partnerships are among the biggest efforts yet to build alternative supply chains for critical minerals.

Japan Deal: Strengthening Industrial and Energy Security

On October 28, 2025, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a key deal. This agreement aims to secure supplies of rare earths, lithium, cobalt, and nickel. The agreement expands past U.S.–Japan cooperation and includes new plans for joint investments, technology sharing, and transparent supply management.

Under the deal, both countries plan to:

Build processing and refining plants for rare earths and battery minerals.

Create strategic stockpiles and improve recycling systems.

Support magnet production for EVs and defense industries.

Explore nuclear fuel supply cooperation for next-generation reactors.

Japan still relies on China for about 65% of its rare earth imports, even after years of trying to diversify. The new deal aims to cut this dependence by sourcing from U.S. allies like Australia and Vietnam. Also, it will process materials locally or in partner nations.

The plan supports Japan’s economic security law, which pushes companies to find new material sources. Tokyo has set aside about ¥400 billion (US$2.7 billion) in funding to help domestic rare earth and battery material projects through 2027.

Southeast Asia: Expanding the Network Beyond China

Trump also announced new cooperation deals with Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Indonesia. These countries hold key mineral reserves and play important roles in regional trade.

Malaysia already operates one of the world’s few large rare-earth processing plants outside China. Vietnam has about 22 million tonnes of rare-earth reserves, second only to China. Indonesia and Thailand are major producers of nickel and tin, vital for EV batteries.

The Southeast Asia deals aim to:

Bring in U.S. and Japanese investments for mining and refining projects.

Train local workers and improve technical skills.

Cut tariffs and export barriers that slow regional trade.

Support cleaner and safer mining technologies under ESG standards.

Experts say these efforts could create an “Indo-Pacific mineral corridor.” This would link mines in Australia, processors in Southeast Asia, and manufacturers in Japan. This network would help reduce China’s control over the middle stages of the supply chain.

Why Rare Earths Matter: A Market Under Strain

Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used in many high-tech and clean energy products. The most valuable are neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. These elements are essential for strong magnets used in EV motors, drones, and wind turbines.

China controls around 60–70% of mining and 85–90% of refining for rare earths. This gives Beijing major influence over countries that depend on these materials.

In 2024, the world produced about 350,000 tonnes of rare earth materials. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects demand to reach over 500,000 tonnes by 2030. Market value could rise from $13 billion in 2024 to over $25 billion by 2030.

The U.S. currently makes about 12% of global rare earth ore, mostly from the Mountain Pass mine in California. However, much of it is still sent to China for processing. That dependence makes the new deals with Japan and Southeast Asia even more important.

Strategic and Economic Significance

For the United States, these deals mark a new stage in mineral diplomacy. Washington aims to safeguard clean energy and defense industries. It plans to do this by securing long-term supply agreements in Asia to help protect against disruptions.

Japan gains stronger support for its automotive, electronics, and robotics sectors. The country is restarting its rare earth recycling programs. These programs slowed down after Chinese export limits in 2010 made prices rise sharply.

For Southeast Asian nations, the agreements promise foreign investment, new jobs, and technology sharing. Malaysia and Vietnam might become key centers for refining and magnet production. This could create jobs for thousands of skilled workers.

The deals also back U.S. efforts to counter China’s export restrictions. In 2024, China limited exports of gallium, germanium, and certain rare earth magnets for “national security” reasons. Those actions disrupted supply chains and forced manufacturers in Japan, Europe, and the U.S. to look elsewhere for materials.

Rare Earth Market Outlook: Rising Demand, Tight Supply

Demand for rare earth magnets, especially neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, might triple by 2035. This rise is fueled by electric vehicles (EVs) and wind turbines. Each electric vehicle needs 1–2 kilograms of these magnets, while one offshore wind turbine can use up to 600 kilograms.

The price of neodymium oxide has climbed from about US$70 per kg in 2020 to more than US$120 per kg in 2025, showing strong pressure on supply. China’s quota limits and environmental checks have made availability uncertain.

The U.S., Japan, and the European Union are expanding recycling programs. They aim to recover rare earths from old motors and electronics. This helps reduce reliance on mined materials. Yet, recycling currently provides less than 5% of total global demand.

The Cost of Breaking Free from China

Building alternative supply chains is difficult. Several challenges include:

High costs: Rare-earth plants are expensive and take years to build.

Environmental risks: Poor waste management can pollute water and soil.

Financing issues: Price swings make investors cautious.

Geopolitical tensions: China may respond by lowering prices or tightening exports.

Experts say that without strong government support, new producers may not compete with China’s scale and low costs. Both the U.S. and Japan are studying tax credits and loan programs to help new projects move forward.

Forging a New Indo-Pacific Supply Chain

These rare earth agreements send a clear message: the U.S. and its allies want to reshape global supply chains around trusted partners. The next steps include choosing priority projects, securing funding, and coordinating trade rules.

If successful, these efforts could shift 15–20% of global refining capacity away from China by the early 2030s. That would mark the biggest industry shift in decades.

For the U.S., Japan, and Southeast Asia, the deals combine economic security, industrial growth, and clean energy goals. They also show how the energy transition and geopolitics are now closely linked.

In the long run, building diverse and stable rare earth supply chains could make clean energy industries stronger and less dependent on any single country.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2227079299.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:18:25.387698

Firstly, there are President Trump’s punitive tariffs – since the EV4 fastback is manufactured in South Korea, unlike the European hatchback, imported vehicles are subject to tariffs of 15 per cent.
In light of these developments, the US market launch of the EV4 is no longer a priority for Kia.
These attributes also apply to its technical sibling, the EV3, which is very popular in South Korea and Europe.
The compact SUV was also originally intended to be offered in the US, but Kia seems to have changed its mind about its US market launch.","While the Kia EV4 is destined to be a classic compact car for the European market, the fastback version was intended to be an international success – especially in the US, where it could have stolen the show from the Tesla Model 3, the perennial bestseller in its segment.

The South Korean carmaker had originally announced a US market launch for the electric hatchback saloon. The model even celebrated its North American debut at the New York Auto Show in April. But since then, market conditions in the United States have changed fundamentally.

Firstly, there are President Trump’s punitive tariffs – since the EV4 fastback is manufactured in South Korea, unlike the European hatchback, imported vehicles are subject to tariffs of 15 per cent. Donald Trump originally wanted to impose a 25 per cent tariff on South Korean EV imports, but the two countries agreed on a reduction at the end of July as part of a trade agreement.

Nevertheless, the vehicle would become significantly more expensive for US customers than had been expected before the change of government. Under the Biden administration, the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, which came into force in 2012, still applied. This provided for duty-free access for Korean passenger cars to the US market.

The end of subsidies is hampering demand

US tax credits for electric cars expired on 30 September. It is still too early for concrete figures, but the cancellation of this government subsidy is likely to result in a significant cooling of the market for fully electric vehicles. Before the end of the programme, there was another rush for pure electric cars, which is why many interested parties are likely to be served for the first time.

In light of these developments, the US market launch of the EV4 is no longer a priority for Kia. It is quite possible that the electric sedan will never find its way to American customers. A spokesperson for the company confirmed this decision to InsideEVs: “However, as market conditions for EVs have changed, the release of the upcoming EV4 electric sedan will be delayed until further notice.”

The Tesla Model 3 competitor is by no means the only electric car that, contrary to original plans, will either not be launched in the United States at all or will be launched much later than expected. Volkswagen’s electric mid-range ID.7, for example, suffered a similar fate. The Nissan Ariya, which was already underperforming in the US, was dealt a fatal blow by Trump’s punitive tariffs on car imports from Japan. After only three years, the model is to be discontinued there.

Under different political conditions, the Kia EV4 Fastback would have had a good chance on the US market – the attractively priced sedan is positioned in one of the most popular segments, stands out visually from the crowd, offers a modern infotainment system and plenty of space, and is among the leaders in its segment in terms of range, with up to 633 kilometres according to WLTP.

It also offers a high level of comfort, as the hatchback version proved in our test drive report. These attributes also apply to its technical sibling, the EV3, which is very popular in South Korea and Europe. The compact SUV was also originally intended to be offered in the US, but Kia seems to have changed its mind about its US market launch.

In recent weeks, the university’s relationship with the Indiana Daily Student has been the subject of understandable concern and scrutiny. I want to speak directly to you — and to our broader community — about where things stand, what we have learned and how we move forward together.

First and foremost, let me reaffirm that our commitment to a free and independent student press has never wavered. More than a publication, the IDS represents a public trust and a cornerstone of Indiana University’s educational mission. For generations, it has embodied the ideals of free inquiry, open debate, and journalistic rigor. I view these as critical values for our campus, as does Dean Tolchinsky.

As you know, a personnel decision was made on our campus regarding a staff member engaged with the IDS. While the university cannot speak about the details of that decision, I will note that it coincided with a convergence of long-term operational concerns related to the Student Media Action Plan and my recognition that an annual deficit approaching $300,000 is not infinitely sustainable. It was within this context that I chose to halt campus support for print editions of the paper.

The juxtaposition of the personnel matter and the budget-related decision to pause printing of the IDS fueled a perception that editorial content drove the decision not to print.

Let me be clear: my decision had nothing to do with editorial content of the IDS. And contrary to what has been posted on social media and published, Indiana University has never attempted to censor editorial content, period. The IDS is, and remains, editorially independent.

But perception, even when it is not grounded in fact, can carry the weight of reality. I recognize and accept that the campus has not handled recent decisions as well as we should have. Communication was uneven and timing imperfect.

At the same time, my examination of the IDS’s history makes clear that the challenges we face today are not new. There has not been a sustainable model for decades, and the long-term financial viability of the IDS cannot be dismissed as trivial, especially in this resource-constrained environment. Put simply, the IDS is not immune to the financial realities of this campus and higher education more generally.

As we move forward, I want to reaffirm three key commitments:

1. Collaboration: We must ensure IDS leaders will have a seat at the table as we develop a plan for future operations.

2. Editorial independence: We defend and will continue to protect the integrity of student journalism as a core tenet of this university.

3. Preparation and support: We must continue providing resources and mentorship that equip student journalists to excel as media professionals, even as we balance essential financial stewardship.

We will continue to uphold a free and open press while responsibly stewarding public funds and families’ tuition dollars and further strengthening the learning experience for our students. That is my commitment.

Let’s take this moment as an opportunity to reset and reaffirm what unites us.

The Task Force on the Editorial Independence and Financial Sustainability of the IDS/Student Media provides us with this opportunity, a path forward to achieve clarity about a model that upholds our values and addresses decades-long financial challenges.

In advance of the task force’s work, I have authorized the financial office to allow the IDS, under the supervision of The Media School, to use their established budget through June 30, 2026, as the editors see fit — so long as they remain true to their budgetary parameters.

The IDS and the university share the same purpose: to serve truth, to educate with integrity and to prepare students for success in a contemporary media landscape.

In this moment, we have an obligation to write the next chapter of the Indiana Daily Student, one built on mutual respect, shared responsibility, and an enduring belief in the power of a free press.

Sincerely,",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/0151e02e-3b7a-40c8-b48f-a96ac74b0778.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-10-31 16:04:59.576931

Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.
A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024.
She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.
“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said.","Kentucky utility regulators could approve a rate increase for Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities customers. They’ve approved new power plants to meet the electricity demands of data centers. Customers may not have known about the hidden cost they’re paying for two coal plants.

In October, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities and other parties came to an agreement in a case before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

Under it, KU customers would pay $9 more a month on average, and LG&E customers would pay $5. The Kentucky commission would have to approve the pact.

The Kentucky PSC has approved a plan by the utilities to spend $3.7 billion on electricity generation projects, including two natural gas power plants costing a combined $2.8 billion.

Behind the rates paid by the companies’ customers is a hidden cost that doesn’t show up on their bills. Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.

Together, the utilities own a share of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC).

OVEC has a plant in Madison, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, and another in Cheshire, Ohio, across the river from West Virginia.

An analysis adapted from a case in Michigan shows that KU and LG&E customers have paid nearly $168 million in losses generated by the OVEC plants in the past seven years.

“That’s bad by any account, and definitely costing ratepayers as compared to what it would have cost them just to self produce their own energy,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024. Mon Power customers in West Virginia have paid more than $10 million.

Indiana customers of two more utilities have paid a combined $167 million in losses. That breaks down to $136 million for Indiana-Michigan Power and $31 million for CenterPoint Energy.

Indiana-Michigan Power and Appalachian Power are subsidiaries of American Electric Power. AEP owns the biggest share of OVEC, at 39%.

Other states have walked away from the OVEC plants. Michigan regulators stopped Indiana-Michigan from charging Michigan customers for the OVEC losses. Ohio lawmakers repealed a scandal-tainted bailout of the plants.

“I think it is helpful to know that other states who are not embroiled in our historical ties to coal have already determined that they are not smart for the ratepayers in their states,” said Elisa Owen, Kentucky senior organizer for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

Indiana regulators decided over the summer that Indiana customers of Indiana-Michigan would pick up the losses no longer absorbed by Michigan customers.

Devi Glick, an energy analyst at Synapse Energy Economics, testified in the Michigan case.

She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.

She said the structure of OVEC’s ownership makes it hard to change anything about the way the plants operate.

“If all of them got together and were saying, ‘Yeah, this is a bad idea,’ they could make a change,” Glick said, “but it’s kind of an a nice, easy way out for them to say, ‘oh, we can’t make a unilateral decision.’”

Liz Pratt, senior communications director for LG&E and KU, said she wasn’t familiar with Glick’s analysis and couldn’t comment on it.

“We dispatch least-cost generation first, and this balanced generation approach gives us the flexibility to hedge against fuel price increases for our customers, while continuing to ensure safe, reliable and affordable service,” she said, adding, “Our residential electric rates remain well below the national average.”

Nationwide, electric utilities are scrambling to meet the demand for power from data centers and advanced manufacturing.

Meanwhile, federal policy has shifted from favoring renewables to supporting fossil fuels, including coal. The Trump administration wants to prevent the retirement of coal plants, and has used its executive power to keep at least one plant on the grid after it was scheduled to shut down.

The price of electricity has risen faster than inflation. Data centers may be driving some of that. The price of natural gas has also gone up, leading to an increase in coal generation.

The contract the region’s utilities have with OVEC runs until 2040, and utility analysts don’t expect the plants to become profitable. The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants were built in 1955, making them older than the average coal plant.

Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce. No new coal plant has been built nationwide since 2013.

“Nobody wants to continue making parts for Oldsmobiles anymore if they’re not going to keep making Oldsmobiles, so the parts just aren’t available,” he said. “And that’s probably only going to get worse and worse.”

Coal generates 68% of Kentucky’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While that’s far less than in the past, and lower than West Virginia’s 86%, the Republican legislative supermajority has made moves to prevent coal plants from retiring.

The Sierra Club’s Owen said that puts pressure on utility regulators, who are appointed by the governor but approved by the state Senate.

“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said. “Now, does it matter that they’re out of the state? I think it helps.”",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2603.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 15:00:46.792727

Sewage has been flowing into San Diego from across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, going back decades. The situation has been described as a crisis by local leaders and residents, as the sewage impacts the city's tourism and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, where Navy SEALs train.

SEALs, who are required to spend hours in the ocean as part of their training, have reported serious illnesses from the contaminated water, including acute gastrointestinal illnesses.

The crisis is blamed on outdated wastewater infrastructure that was strained by the skyrocketing population in Tijuana, Mexico, which has increased by approximately 188% from 1990 to 2025 alone, according to figures compiled by the Mexican government and local universities.

The EPA announced Thursday that it completed a 100-day review of all projects associated with correcting the sewage crisis and wastewater infrastructure along the border, and found it had shaved the timeline of completion for two other projects by another nine months, meaning roughly 12 years in total construction time was cut from the project.

""Important new progress to report on the efforts to implement a permanent, 100% solution to end the decades long Tijuana River Sewage Crisis: Today, EPA is announcing a nine month total reduction in the timelines for two additional key projects on the Mexico side of the border: Rehabilitation of Pump Station 1 and reconstruction of the Tijuana River Gates,"" Zeldin posted to X of the announcement.

Cleaning up the Tijuana, Mexico, sewage crisis was among Zeldin's top priorities in the early months of his tenure as EPA chief, traveling to San Diego and Mexico in April to assess the situation and meet with local leaders.

Zeldin and his Mexican government counterpart, Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in July that streamlined the two governments' efforts to correct the crisis.

The Memorandum of Understanding allows the Minute 328 agreement, which is a 2022 agreement between the U.S. and Mexico through the International Boundary and Water Commission to address the sewage crisis with 17 sanitation infrastructure projects.

This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.” ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand.
“EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule.
Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly.
“It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.","The American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) submitted comments today to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in response to the Agency’s supplemental proposed rule for the “Set 2” Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program covering 2026 and 2027, urging the Agency to fully reallocate the impacts of Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and finalize the rule before year-end.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the Agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly. “It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.",https://ethanol.org/hubfs/Generic%20Photos/Gov%20Affairs/epa-building.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 16:04:37.386536

Nevada’s lithium industry is vital to the nation’s clean-energy goals. In 2025, the state is expected to produce between 25,000 and 40,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), with production growing at an annual rate of about 40% as new projects begin operations. This growth is supported by a surge of new investment and innovation—from lithium mining to advanced battery manufacturing.

Lithium is at the core of this transformation. It is the key metal that powers EVs, grid batteries, and renewable energy systems. As global demand continues to soar, developing a steady domestic supply has become a top U.S. priority.

For the country, it is both an economic and an energy security issue. Nevada is becoming the cornerstone of that vision, with its mineral potential, strong infrastructure, and mining-friendly policies.

Growing Demand for Domestic Lithium

Global lithium demand is expanding rapidly. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects it will increase nearly fivefold by 2040, driven by the global shift to EVs and clean-energy storage. The world’s total known lithium resources now exceed 115 million tonnes, while the U.S. holds about 19 million tonnes—mostly in Nevada and California.

Even so, the U.S. still imports most of its lithium. Domestic production makes up less than 2% of global supply, leaving the country dependent on imports from Chile, Australia, and China. This creates major risks for automakers and energy companies that rely on steady, affordable lithium.

To meet its clean-energy goals, the U.S. must grow its domestic lithium base fast. Nevada’s large claystone and brine deposits make it the natural hub for that expansion. The state’s deposits are unique in both size and accessibility, giving it a strong edge in supplying the raw materials for EV batteries.

Introducing Surge Battery Metals and the Nevada North Lithium Project

At the center of this growth is Surge Battery Metals. The company’s main project, the Nevada North Lithium Project (NNLP) in Elko County, represents one of the highest-grade lithium clay deposits in the U.S.

According to its latest resource estimates, NNLP holds 11.2 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) at an average grade of 3,010 parts per million (ppm) lithium. This grade is higher than most comparable projects across North America.

Surge’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) highlights strong numbers:

Post-tax Net Present Value (NPV8): US$9.2 billion

Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 22.8%

Operating cost: US$5,097/t LCE

Mine life: 42 years

The project is located only 13 kilometers from major power lines and has all-season road access. It has received a Record of Decision and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), allowing expansion across 250 acres. With these clearances in place, Surge is years ahead of many early-stage lithium explorers.

Nevada’s Role in Building the U.S. EV Supply Chain

Nevada’s geography and infrastructure make it the ideal base for America’s EV supply chain. The state hosts both lithium claystone deposits in the north and brine basins in the south. This creates multiple sources for battery materials. It is also close to key automotive and battery hubs in California and Arizona, as well as Tesla’s Gigafactory in Sparks.

This location advantage saves both time and money. Lithium mined in Nevada can be refined, processed, and shipped to nearby gigafactories—all within a few hundred miles.

Compared with importing from overseas, this can reduce transport emissions by up to 70% and cut logistics costs significantly. The shorter distances also lower the carbon footprint of battery production, aligning with U.S. clean-energy policies.

Nevada’s mining and manufacturing sectors are now creating thousands of new jobs and drawing billions in private investment. Projects like the US$1 billion Lyten sulfur battery plant in Reno highlight how the state is becoming a full-scale clean-energy hub, from raw materials to finished batteries.

Surge Battery Metals fits right into this ecosystem. Its Nevada North project could provide the lithium feedstock for future gigafactories, supporting the U.S. plan to localize the entire EV battery supply chain—from mining and processing to assembly and recycling.

Strengthening U.S. Energy Security

By advancing NNLP, Surge Battery Metals directly supports national efforts to secure critical minerals. Producing high-grade lithium within U.S. borders reduces dependency on foreign supply chains and increases resilience against global market shocks.

Unlike imported materials that pass through multiple countries, lithium from Nevada can move straight from mine to factory under stable U.S. regulations. This local sourcing helps ensure long-term supply reliability for automakers while boosting domestic job creation.

Surge Battery Metals also follows environmental, social, and governance (ESG) best practices. Lithium clay mining uses less water and creates lower carbon emissions than many traditional methods.

The company plans to integrate water recycling and land reclamation into its operations to minimize impacts on nearby ecosystems. As environmental scrutiny grows, such responsible practices make projects like NNLP more attractive to both investors and manufacturers seeking sustainable materials.

Challenges, Opportunities, and the Road to EV Independence

Nevada’s lithium boom presents both opportunities and hurdles. Developers must continue working closely with local communities and regulators to manage water use and protect land resources.

Battery-grade lithium production requires careful processing, and achieving consistent 99.9% purity – a goal Surge is testing toward – takes time and investment.

Market volatility remains a factor. Lithium prices have been fluctuating. In 2025, it moved between US$8,300 and US$11,525 per tonne, reflecting tight supply and demand cycles. Yet analysts expect strong long-term growth as EV adoption continues worldwide.

Nevada’s emerging lithium industry offers a rare chance to strengthen U.S. energy independence while creating thousands of high-tech jobs. For investors, it represents both a challenge and an opportunity – a chance to help build a fully domestic clean energy economy.

The push for EV independence is about building cars as well as securing the materials that power them. Nevada is leading that effort, combining resource strength, infrastructure, and innovation.

Surge Battery Metals’ Nevada North Lithium Project embodies this shift. With a high-grade resource, strong economics, and a strategic Nevada location, the company is positioned to become a key supplier in America’s energy transition.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), senior member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, joined U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) to introduce the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act.

The innovative bipartisan legislation would strengthen American competitiveness in fusion energy and secure domestic supply chains for high-tech fusion components. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA).

“The State of Washington is the world’s leading hub for fusion energy, which one day soon could provide vast amounts of the type of power we need to keep electricity prices down and increase America's economic competitiveness,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Providing tax incentives for fusion components will help ensure that the fusion supply chain also will be manufactured and create jobs in the Pacific Northwest.”

“Fusion energy represents the kind of bold, American innovation that built the West and can power our future,” said Sen. Curtis. “This bill ensures we’re not just competing in the fusion race, we’re winning it by manufacturing these critical components here at home, creating good-paying jobs, and securing our energy independence for the next century.”

The Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act would expand IRC Section 45X credit eligibility to include fusion components. Developed with feedback from industry partners, the bill defines components in the supply chain needed to bring the industry to scale. Examples include superconducting magnets, capacitors, fusion chambers, blanket systems, high-energy lasers, and essential materials.

Under the bill, each component would be eligible for a 25% tax credit through 2031, which would then be phased down through 2034.

“Workers are doing their part to hold this country together, our elbows are up, but they’re being squeezed from every direction,” said Bea Bruske, President of the Canadian Labour Congress. “This budget must invest in people and infrastructure”.

Bruske warned that balancing the books on the backs of working people would only deepen inequality and stall economic recovery.

“Any move to shore up Canada’s finances must be done fairly,” she said. “That means asking those who’ve made record profits and amassed the most wealth to pay their share—not cutting services or putting the squeeze on workers.”

Investing in people and communities

Canada’s unions are urging the federal government to launch a new wave of public investment focused on shovel-ready municipal and provincial projects—including housing, schools, transportation, public health, and child care.

“These investments must come with strings attached,” said Bruske. “They must create good union jobs, be community supporting, use Canadian procurement, and guarantee that the jobs stay in Canada for the long term.”

Budget 2025 should also build the next generation of public infrastructure including housing, transit and energy, expand early learning and child care, and make major investments in public health care, including pharmacare and safe long-term care.

“Blank cheques to corporations won’t solve the crises we face,” added Bruske. “Public dollars must deliver public good—good jobs, good wages, and the services working families rely on.”

Protecting jobs and preparing for the future

Canada’s unions are calling for a comprehensive job creation plan built around public infrastructure and a funded net-zero industrial strategy developed with unions. The plan should invest in clean energy, manufacturing, and retrofit programs while ensuring workers in high-emitting sectors can transition to new, secure, unionized jobs with fair wages and benefits.

To help workers through economic shocks, the government must also modernize Employment Insurance—restoring federal contributions, improving benefits, and lowering eligibility requirements—so that no worker falls through the cracks in the next downturn.

Fair taxation and fiscal responsibility

Bruske emphasized that real fiscal responsibility means ensuring everyone pays their fair share.

“Workers shouldn’t be asked to carry the burden of recovery while corporations hoard record profits,” she said.

Canada’s unions are calling for tax fairness measures, including:

Public country-by-country reporting for multinationals;

Maintaining the Digital Services Tax;

Increasing the capital gains inclusion rate;

Introducing wealth and windfall profit taxes; and

Investing in the Canada Revenue Agency to close loopholes and enforce compliance.

“When corporations and the wealthy pay what they owe,” said Bruske, “Canada can invest in housing, health care, and good jobs for everyone.”

Housing for everyone

The rising cost of homes and rents is taking a toll on workers whose wages are not keeping up. Workers want their government to make serious efforts to combat financial speculation in housing, starting with taxing house-flipping and vacant properties to capture windfall real estate gains that go to the wealthiest Canadians.

Canada’s unions are calling on the government to put in place ambitious and direct funding for the construction of new, non-market, affordable public housing, including social housing and co-ops for all, including Indigenous peoples, survivors of domestic violence, and people living with disabilities and particularly for marginalized groups.

Putting workers first

“Workers built this country, and workers will build the future,” said Bruske. “Budget 2025 must put people before profits—by investing in the infrastructure, jobs, and public services that make life more affordable and secure for everyone in Canada.”

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings (non-GAAP) as the primary performance measurement of its results for public communications with analysts and investors. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company’s incentive compensation plans, and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company’s fundamental earnings power. In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, market-related impacts on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, acquisitions, divestitures, or extreme weather events and other natural disasters. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion Energy is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.

Here are five elections where rising power bills, offshore wind, data centers, and the future of clean energy are all on the line.

Georgia Public Service Commission

Every state has an obscure regulatory body that oversees for-profit electric utilities, including their requests to raise rates and build new energy projects. In Georgia, it’s called the Public Service Commission, and unlike in most states, voters get to decide who’s on it.

Georgia’s current five utility commissioners — all Republicans — have been in power beyond their elected terms because lawsuits have delayed elections. On Tuesday, two of those commissioners will finally face voters.

In one race, Republican incumbent Tim Echols faces a challenge from Democrat Alicia Johnson. Echols calls for more nuclear power and battery storage and has touted his support for solar. Johnson wants more solar power and battery storage, including rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources, but is less bullish on nuclear.

In the other PSC race, Democrat Peter Hubbard is looking to unseat Republican incumbent Fitz Johnson (no relation to Alicia Johnson). Hubbard, an energy modeler, has a long track record of challenging the PSC, and told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John he’d push for more solar and less gas if elected. Johnson didn’t respond to Canary’s requests for comment, but has called this election a contest of ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates.”

New Jersey governor

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill is facing off against Republican former state legislator Jack Ciattarelli to lead New Jersey — and energy affordability has become a key issue. The state saw one of the country’s biggest electricity rate increases over the last year, and Sherrill has promised to build more clean energy generation to address the problem.

Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has blamed New Jersey’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for rising power prices. He’s also not a fan of offshore wind — just take a look at the koozies his campaign store is selling.

Virginia governor

Rising power bills are also a hot topic in Virginia, where Democratic former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race.

Virginia is already known as the data-center capital of the world, and continued development could drive up power demand even further. Spanberger has called for exploring energy-efficiency programs and virtual power plants as potential solutions, and supports solar, offshore wind, and nuclear development to meet demand. Earle-Sears is more critical of solar and wind power, but is a strong supporter of small nuclear reactors.

New York City mayor

There’s a three-way race underway to lead New York City, where Democrat Zohran Mamdani is polling ahead of independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The future mayor will have a lot of say in implementation of the city’s landmark law requiring cuts in climate emissions from buildings, and Mamdani has promised to strictly enforce the measure. Mamdani has also woven climate action into his plans to make the city more affordable, including by turning dozens of schools into renewables-equipped resilience hubs.

Sliwa, for his part, has campaigned against battery storage development, and he celebrated when a major battery project planned for Staten Island was canceled this month. (More on that news below.)

More big energy stories

A big week for conventional nuclear reactors

Small nuclear reactors may be generating more buzz, but conventional reactors are at the center of three big nuclear deals announced in the U.S. this past week. The first comes from the Trump administration, which announced an $80 million plan to work with nuclear reactor developer Westinghouse, Brookfield Asset Management, and uranium supplier Cameco to build several Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S.

In Iowa, Google announced it’s partnering with utility NextEra Energy to restart the Duane Arnold nuclear power plant. The facility has been shut down for five years, but Google hopes to get it back online by 2029 to help power its growing data-center fleet. And in South Carolina, state-owned utility Santee Cooper is tapping Brookfield Asset Management to finish construction of two AP1000 reactors that the utility abandoned back in 2018.

A win and a loss for battery storage

Large-scale battery development saw both a breakthrough and a setback over this past week. The good news for storage came from Form Energy, which has started installing its 100-hour iron-air batteries at a Great River Energy storage project in Minnesota. The startup is building those first-of-a-kind batteries at its West Virginia factory, where it hopes to speed up production as it works out some early kinks.

But on New York’s Staten Island, Fullmark Energy has withdrawn plans to build a 650-megawatt battery storage facility. The company didn’t give a reason for the termination, but it did face opposition from residents and local leaders.

Last week, the White House released a list of donors to a ballroom currently under construction where the East Wing once stood. One of those company names has a strong business presence in Jefferson and Gage counties.

NextEra Energy, Inc., is an American energy company that currently owns and operates the Steele Flats Wind Farm, which extends across portions of both counties. It is the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar.

The amounts donors contributed were not included but both individuals and corporations were listed, including such names as Union Pacific, Amazon, Google, Lochhead Martin and Hard Rock International. Donors have the option to remain anonymous, so the only names released were of those that agreed to be released.

NextEra’s support of the White House project might come as a surprise to some given President Trump’s openly hostile feeling toward wind energy. Trump called wind turbines “so pathetic and so bad” during his address to the United Nations General Assembly.

Nuclear Energy

However, NextEra does not just deal in wind and solar energy. NextEra also owns and operates plants that generate power using oil, natural gas and nuclear energy.

Nuclear energy in particular has been touted by many as the best solution to meet increasing demand for electricity as both AI (Artificial Intelligence) and cryptocurrency industries continue to expand, requiring more energy. A number of other donors to the ballroom construction are cryptocurrency or AI businesses.

On Tuesday, October 28, Google and NextEra jointly announced plans to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County, Iowa. It was an Iowa only nuclear power plant and decommissioned in 2020. A press release issued by the companies cited AI as a motivation for the project, “As the U.S. enters a new era of innovation and opportunity driven by AI, this strategic collaboration aims to enable Google to grow its business needs responsibly.”",https://fairburyjournalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/the-white-house-269734_1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:07:02.031223

Last month, CoreWeave secured a $6.3 billion order from Nvidia as per which the chipmaking giant “is obligated to purchase the residual unsold capacity” through April 2032.

The CoreWeave stock fell more than 6% to close at $131.06 on Oct. 30. In comparison, the Core Scientific stock stayed rather flat and it closed at $20.74 on the day.

Bitcoin mining no longer lucrative

Bitcoin mining is the process of solving complex cryptographic functions using high-end computing power to verify and add blocks to the blockchain network. Miners receive rewards in the form of Bitcoin in exchange for securing the network.

Over the years, Bitcoin mining has become a more complex and expensive exercise. The rewards are getting trimmed despite the rising BTC price, forcing miners to pivot to other fields like AI.

Nonetheless, Core Scientific shareholders believed the acquisition deal undervalued the Bitcoin miner.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/thestreet_881/7855b56b5610b6d3e9aad8ecb266bc46,N,,2025-10-31 19:04:40.578117

As we shift from using fossilised sunlight to real-time solar power, the challenge is no longer energy capture, but energy storage.","A self-reinforcing battery boom

We are in the midst of an electricity storage boom, with deployment nearly doubling every year. In 2024, developers deployed over 160 gigawatt-hours of new battery storage, which is nearly as much in one year as in all recorded history. As deployment scales, costs continue to fall; by as much as 40% last year. Recent tender results from China show turnkey costs for stationary storage around $60 per kilowatt-hour, with similar prices in India and Saudi Arabia, indicating prices continue to fall aggressively in 2025. That marks an order-of-magnitude drop compared with typical battery prices just seven years ago.

Battery storage quality has improved dramatically as well — with near “plug-and-play” grid systems cutting installation time and cost, longer lifetimes (some warrantied for as much as 20 years), minimal fire risk, and the rise of sodium-ion batteries that use no critical minerals.

A virtuous cycle has taken hold: lower costs lead to faster deployment, which in turn drives further cost reductions through learning and economies of scale.

This rapid progress has sparked a debate about how big storage could — or should — become. Many still seem to treat electricity storage as a completely novel challenge. It isn’t. The basic problem of how to store a valuable but perishable resource is one humanity has solved many times before.

The energy agricultural revolution

The shift to renewable energy is more than a technical upgrade; it marks a structural change in how societies generate and use energy. We call it the electrotech revolution. For centuries, humans have scoured the planet for fossil fuels, chasing energy across continents. Now we are learning to harvest it in place, from sunlight and wind, reliably and close to home.

There is a clear parallel with the agricultural revolution here. When early societies learned to farm, they began producing food in place — harvesting from the same fields again and again instead of chasing animals across vast territories. That shift unlocked far greater energy yields from the land, rising by roughly two orders of magnitude in most estimates. The result was abundance, settlement, and growth: the foundation of civilisation itself.

An analogous revolution is now underway in energy. By shifting from tracking down and collecting fossil fuels to farming sunshine, wind, water and heat from the ground, we are unlocking a resource base that is more local, steady and vastly larger: capable of supplying orders of magnitude more energy than fossil fuels — with every nation sitting atop renewable resources at least ten times, and for some a thousand times, greater than its demand. As renewable generation scales and electrification carries it through the economy, the age of electrotech marks a new period of energy abundance.

Key unlock for an agriculture revolution: storage

As the energy sector enters its own agricultural revolution, it faces a familiar challenge: how to plan for variable yields and preserve abundance through leaner periods.

Agriculture has always produced perishable goods, and storage has long been the key to transforming volatility into stability. Humanity has grappled with this problem for a very long time; in fact, it lies at the foundation of civilisation itself. More than 10,000 years ago, early societies began building granaries to hold surplus grain through leaner seasons; allowing for settlement and trade.

For millennia afterwards, inadequate storage forced farmers to sell harvests immediately, creating recurring cycles of glut and scarcity. Across global breadbaskets, grain and cereal prices collapsed at harvest and surged months later. Lacking reliable storage, farmers rushed goods to market, overloading transport routes such as shipping and rail networks. Only more advanced storage solutions that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century stabilised the market.

The same logic now applies to renewable electricity. Electricity is the ultimate perishable good; more so than grain, milk, or fruit, as it must be consumed within a fraction of a second. Producers race their output to market — literally at the speed of light — along copper wires, often oversupplying the system and driving curtailment and extreme price swings.

The rise of new electricity storage tech such as batteries addresses much of this challenge, just as previous storage technologies did. Grain silos stabilised harvests; refrigeration globalised fresh food. In every case, storage moved from rare and costly to cheap and ubiquitous. Electricity storage follows the same trajectory, turning the perishable into the persistent.

Comparing this revolution to earlier ones offers useful perspectives for a market still finding its shape. From this historic perspective, four broad takes emerge.

Take 1: Storage will probably be (much) bigger than we think

Seen through the lens of past storage revolutions, one thing becomes clear: forecasts almost certainly underestimate how large electricity storage will become. Most energy outlooks tend to only model the bare minimum needed to balance grids; typically 30–40 TWh globally in the long term. But this ignores two powerful forces: resilience and convenience.

No one ever calculated the cost optimal minimum size of fridge storage space the world required. Once refrigeration became affordable, businesses and households began purchasing their own units for greater flexibility and peace of mind, installing them throughout the supply chain — from farms and distribution centres to supermarkets and homes. The same logic will apply to batteries. As costs fall, they’ll appear everywhere: at solar farms, substations, businesses, and homes — not just where they’re strictly “needed.”

We may even put small batteries in most electrical appliances, from laundry machines to lightbulbs and cooktops — the “batterisation of everything” as energy analyst Gerard Reid calls it. If each device can run independently for a while, homes could smooth their own demand at an outlet-to-outlet level in real time, balancing loads not just across the grid but within the house itself.

Rough assumptions suggest how quickly this could scale. If utilities pair each kilowatt of solar with one or two kilowatt-hours of storage, grid operators install a few hours of storage at each substation, homeowners keep 20–30 kWh systems, and factories maintain a few dozen MWh for backup, the totals add up fast. Across roughly 20 TW solar, 500,000 substations, 3 billion households, and a million large factories, that comes to around 100–180 TWh of stationary storage globally in the long term— three to six times higher than current long-term forecasts. The manufacturing capacity to support this is already being put in place: global battery production is on track to reach twice even the most ambitious (net zero) IEA forecasts by 2030.

As with every previous storage revolution, the end state won’t be a bare-minimum system. It will reflect how people actually live: with buffers, redundancy, and a preference for autonomy.

Take 2: More storage means less transport

One overlooked consequence of storage revolutions is their impact on transport. Before refrigeration, fresh food had to reach markets every day, making supply chains fragile and inefficient. Cold storage changed that. Express “milk trains” once raced into cities like New York every morning to deliver dairy products before they spoiled, driving the construction of new rail lines built to handle that daily rush. When refrigeration spread, goods could be stored near supply centres and demand centres and shipped off-peak. The need for peak transport capacity fell, and much of that overbuilt network was gradually abandoned or repurposed.

Electricity is following a similar path. Today’s grid depends on long-distance transmission because supply needs to meet demand instantly or is lost. That means we build transport capacity to meet the highest peak loads, even though they occur for only a few hours per day or even per year. As storage expands, that urgency fades. Power can move in time, not just in space. Batteries, like cold storage a century ago, smooth the system; storing energy wherever it’s convenient, and allowing transport to spread into off-peak times.

Many grid plans still lag behind this reality. Much of today’s strategy assumes the old race to market: ever more transmission to chase supply in real time. Cheap batteries support a different model of a more distributed system where storage can often substitute for costly grid upgrades. Ignoring this is like building new rail lines in the 1920s to rush dairy products to New York while overlooking the arrival of refrigeration.

Local storage doesn’t just flatten peaks or defer investments; it also adds resilience to transport interruptions. Communities with their own batteries can ride through outages, much as towns with granaries once endured a failed harvest or an interrupted supply line.

Take 3: Storage and production help each other

A common critique of the storage boom is that it can’t last; that storage destroys its own market. The more storage you build, the less prices fluctuate, and the less profitable each storage project becomes. The same is said of solar: the more panels you install, the more oversupply and low prices you get when the sun is shining, and so the lower the revenues for all solar farms. Both arguments make sense in isolation, but together they don’t.

Storage and variable generation obey different economics. Production thrives on price stability; storage profits from volatility. That makes them natural complements.

The food storage analogy makes this easy to see. From the granaries of ancient Egypt to the imperial storehouses of China, societies have long used storage to tame production volatility. The 19th-century American Midwest offers a more recent illustration: as grain silos spread, farmers could hold back their crops rather than flooding the market at harvest, stabilising prices and improving profits. Stability made farming more attractive, drawing investment and expansion — which in turn made more storage worthwhile. Storage and production complemented each other to enable the Midwest’s grain and cereal boom.

The same feedback loop now shapes electricity. When solar expands, midday prices collapse, creating the arbitrage space that makes batteries profitable. Once built, those batteries flatten prices again, allowing even more solar to follow. Meanwhile, solar and batteries themselves continue to get cheaper as they scale, meaning they can thrive under progressively lower prices and thinner arbitrage opportunities. Storage and generation climb together; each expansion justifying the next. Just looking at storage or production economics in isolation seems to suggest cannibalisation; but in reality it is coordination between variable supply and storage.

Take 4: Storage will reset market dynamics

Many of today’s electricity markets trade in hourly and 15-minute intervals. That structure exists not due to preference but by necessity — supply and demand must match instantly because storage has long been scarce. As storage expands, that constraint will ease, and markets will evolve much as they did for other perishable goods.

Perishables like milk once had to be sold daily in market squares or delivered door-to-door for same-day consumption before they spoiled. Then cold storage came in which let shops and households stock food for days and weeks, turning daily markets into weekly shopping trips. Storage reset the cadence of the market from day-to-day to week-to-week.

Electricity will likely follow the same path. Once power can be stored for a few hours, trading shifts from minute-to-minute scarcity to buying the cheapest energy within that few-hour window. As storage grows, that time window — and with it, the structure of the market — widens. Markets that once cleared every hour will clear across days or even weeks instead, with prices reflecting time-shifting rather than instant balancing.

Emerging long-duration energy storage (LDES) technologies will extend that logic further, much like freezing extends the life of food far beyond cooling. As LDES scales, the entire shape of the market can change from fast-cycling spot trades to slower, deeper cycles of accumulation and release, resembling today’s gas or grain markets more than the electricity systems of the past.

The path to energy abundance is paved with storage

We are entering an era of energy abundance. The sun delivers more energy to Earth every five days than all known fossil fuel reserves combined.

And in the first month of the post-tax-credit future for EVs, that's exactly what happened. Both J.D. Power and S&P Global Mobility estimate that October's EV market share plummeted to around 5% in the U.S., from a record high of over 12% in September.

According to S&P Global Mobility, some 64,000 new electric vehicles were sold in October. That's a epic drop from September, when Americans bought or leased nearly 150,000 EVs as they scrambled to cash in on the expiring $7,500 incentive.

OUR MORNING NEWSLETTER IS ALMOST HERE!

Starting in November, Critical Materials will hit your inbox each morning at 8 a.m., delivering the latest EV news curated by our expert staff.

Plug-in hybrids got hit hard too, with their market share dropping from 2.2% in September to just 1% in October, per J.D. Power.

“The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration in the electric vehicle segment in the first month following the expiration of the federal tax credits,"" said Tyson Jominy, J.D. Power's senior vice president of data and analytics.

You could say the EV market is coming to terms with a new reality for consumer demand—one in which electric cars are now unsubsidized, more expensive to buy and have to sell on merit alone. That may be part of what's going on here, and that's certainly going to be a factor over the coming months and years.

Importantly, though, the massive rush to buy electric cars since July has also resulted in what S&P Global Mobility calls an EV volume ""hangover."" In other words, July, August and September stole tons of sales from October and beyond, so it's only natural to see an immediate and precipitous slowdown.

Apparently, it could've been worse.

""Actions by multiple manufacturers to reduce EV prices and increase discounts to offset the loss of the federal credit are helping to maintain EV affordability, thereby preventing an even larger decline in EV sales,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.

Manufacturers are offering thousands in discounts to help make up for the loss of the tax credit and move cars out of inventory. Just after the tax credit lapsed, Hyundai slashed pricing for the 2026 Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800. BMW is offering a $7,500 off of leased EVs through October 31. The list goes on.

The big question, then, is what happens next. Because the tax credit isn't the only big change rocking the EV world.

The Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress have also gutted fuel economy regulations and California's EV mandate, so car companies now face no penalties for electrifying too slowly. That means many will probably choose to dial back their EV growth plans, while doubling down on their gas-burning cash cows for as long as possible.

We've already seen a spate of announcements on that front. Acura last month killed its ZDX SUV after just one model year. Ford is idling production of its F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of the year, although that's also related to aluminum supply. General Motors now plans to make the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt on one shift rather than two, and it laid off 1,750 workers from its EV business this week. Kia on Thursday said it would postpone its upcoming EV4 sedan ""until further notice,"" although that probably had a lot to do with tariffs too.

Given the uncertainty around consumer demand, the hazy future of EV policy and the rapid-fire pullback from automakers, it's not surprising that S&P Global Mobility expects ""continued month-to-month volatility in [battery-electric vehicle] sales and market share"" and ""a significant drop in adoption"" in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Most industry experts believe that Americans will buy more and more EVs over the next several years—even if that growth happens more slowly it would have under friendlier Biden-era policies. But in the near term, it looks like things might get a little ugly.

The United States, for its part, must provide policy clarity on critical mineral agreement negotiations, FTA equivalency, and ESG guidelines.","Amid growing national security concerns about supply chain resiliency and the global energy landscape’s shift toward decarbonization, critical minerals, such as nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements (REEs), copper, lithium, and bauxite, have emerged as indispensable inputs for countries and companies around the world. These minerals are necessary for the developing and manufacturing of emerging technologies ranging from semiconductors to quantum computing, as well as clean technologies including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy infrastructure, and battery storage systems. Soaring demand for these minerals has placed significant pressure on supply chains that are highly concentrated and geopolitically sensitive.

Indonesia, endowed with substantial reserves of critical minerals, is increasingly being recognized as a central link in these vital global supply chains. Ranked as the world’s largest nickel producer and among the top ten producers of copper and bauxite, Indonesia plays a strategic role in the supply of raw materials required to meet global demand. The government’s policy framework emphasizes not only extraction but also downstream processing, aiming to industrialize and increase domestic value capture. Simultaneously, Indonesia is enhancing cooperation with strategic partners, such as the United States, to attract high-quality investment, improve environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards, and gain access to advanced technologies.

This essay analyzes Indonesia’s critical mineral strategy, its bilateral engagement with the United States, and the broader implications for regional and global supply chains. It provides a comprehensive assessment of the opportunities and risks in aligning Indonesia’s mineral wealth with the global decarbonization agenda.

Indonesia’s Critical Mineral Landscape

Indonesia’s mineral endowment is both vast and diverse. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Indonesia holds over 21 million metric tons of nickel reserves—about 22% of global reserves—making it the largest globally. The country produced 1.8 million metric tons of nickel in 2023, a significant increase from 771,000 metric tons in 2020. Indonesia also ranks among the top producers of bauxite, primarily in West Kalimantan and Riau Islands.

Copper production is another critical pillar of Indonesia’s mineral wealth. Grasberg, one of the world’s largest copper and gold mines, is located in Papua and operated by PT Freeport Indonesia. Indonesia’s copper output reached 840,000 metric tons in 2023, positioning it as a strategic supplier for energy infrastructure and semiconductor manufacturing.

Southeast Asia more broadly is home to significant untapped potential in REEs and other strategic minerals. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar possess valuable REE reserves that remain underdeveloped due to technological, regulatory, and ESG barriers.

Indonesia’s Policy Evolution: From Extraction to Industrialization

Indonesia’s approach to critical minerals has evolved significantly in the past decade, with government policies seeking to move the country up the value chain beyond extraction. The 2009 Mining Law introduced a regulatory shift aimed at achieving this by banning the export of unprocessed ores and mandating domestic processing. This was operationalized in 2014 with the nickel ore export ban and was later extended to bauxite and copper. The goal was to stimulate investment in domestic capacity for smelting, refining, and manufacturing.

Between 2014 and 2023, more than 30 nickel smelters were constructed, primarily in Central Sulawesi and North Maluku. The Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park and Weda Bay Industrial Park are two large-scale hubs that now host nickel processing and battery-precursor production. The downstream policy—termed hilirisasi—is credited with increasing Indonesia’s export value of processed minerals, reducing reliance on raw exports, and attracting over $30 billion in foreign direct investment between 2019 and 2023.

The Prabowo administration has reaffirmed Indonesia’s ambition to move beyond mineral processing and capture greater value from the country’s resource endowment through full-scale industrialization. Building on the downstreaming policies initiated under President Jokowi, President Prabowo has emphasized continuity, while adding a focus on accelerating domestic EV battery and vehicle manufacturing. His administration has pledged to streamline permitting processes, expand fiscal incentives, and develop industrial parks dedicated to EV supply chains. These measures are designed to strengthen Indonesia’s role as a regional production hub while ensuring that investments generate skilled jobs and technology transfer within the country.

In parallel, the administration is adopting a more strategic geopolitical posture. Recognizing the intensifying competition between major economies for critical minerals, Prabowo aims to diversify partnerships and avoid overreliance on any single foreign partner. This includes deepening ties with U.S., South Korean, Japanese, and European firms to balance Indonesia’s existing dependence on Chinese investment. By coupling resource nationalism with pragmatic international engagement, the government seeks to secure Indonesia’s position not only as a leading supplier of ESG-compliant minerals but also as a central node in the global EV and clean energy value chains.

Indonesia’s industrial ambitions also extend beyond smelting. The country aims to become a regional hub for EV battery production and EV assembly. Indonesia Battery Corporation, formed as a state holding company in 2021, has signed partnerships with multiple international companies to develop integrated battery value chains.

Furthermore, Indonesia is promoting its role in the semiconductor supply chain. While it does not yet produce semiconductors, it supplies key inputs such as high-purity tin and copper used in chip interconnects. Integrating mineral and semiconductor strategies could create new growth corridors, especially as ASEAN countries jointly enhance their tech ecosystem.

U.S.-Indonesia Cooperation on Critical Minerals

Under the Biden administration, the U.S. government prioritized the diversification of critical mineral supply chains under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Minerals Security Partnership. In this context, Indonesia is viewed as a key partner.

While Indonesia and the United States do not have a free trade agreement, Jakarta has been lobbying for a sectoral agreement or equivalent with the United States. Negotiations have focused on harmonizing ESG standards, facilitating financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, and enabling joint research and development on battery technologies. Additionally, in November 2023, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at enhancing collaboration on critical mineral trade, investment, and ESG compliance.

Critical minerals are still a point of focus under the second Trump administration, demonstrated by an executive order aiming to increase domestic production and reduce reliance on China. With recent U.S. legislation phasing out EV tax credits, however, whether the administration will revive negotiations with Indonesia for a critical minerals agreement remains to be seen.

ESG and Sustainable Mining Challenges

Indonesia’s rapid industrialization of critical minerals has brought with it significant ESG concerns. Environmental damage in nickel mining zones, including deforestation, marine pollution from tailings disposal, and air emissions from coal-fired smelters, has sparked resistance from civil society and environmental watchdogs.

To address these concerns, the government has introduced stricter permitting processes, required environmental impact assessments, and encouraged green smelter development using hydropower and solar energy. Indonesia is also participating in global ESG forums and aiming to adopt OECD-aligned practices in responsible sourcing. Nonetheless, enforcement remains inconsistent, and capacity-building in regulatory institutions is needed.

Building secure and reliable rare earth supply chains is also essential to meeting net-zero goals. Unless developing economies such as Indonesia align their industrial ambitions with ESG standards, they risk their exports being excluded from high-value clean tech markets.

Regional Supply Chain Integration and ASEAN Synergies

ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia are also ramping up their critical mineral strategies, leading to both collaboration and competition. Vietnam is investing in REE refining, while the Philippines is expanding copper and nickel mining. Indonesia has advocated for a regional ASEAN framework on critical minerals to pool resources, align standards, and boost bargaining power in global markets.

Regional integration could be operationalized through ASEAN +3 or via bilateral partnerships. A regional critical minerals platform could also support shared ESG monitoring, knowledge exchange, and coordinated investment promotion.

Trade, Geopolitics, and Investment Risks

Global critical mineral markets are increasingly influenced by geopolitical considerations. Indonesia’s efforts to attract U.S. and Western investment must be balanced against its longstanding ties with China, which remains the largest investor in its mineral sector—for example, around 75% of nickel smelters in the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park are Chinese-backed.

Trade risks also include export-price volatility, restrictive clauses in mineral contracts, and technology transfer disputes. To mitigate these risks, Indonesia needs robust investment protection agreements, arbitration mechanisms, and long-term offtake contracts. The United States, for its part, must provide policy clarity on critical mineral agreement negotiations, FTA equivalency, and ESG guidelines.

Conclusion

To enhance its role in global critical mineral supply chains while fostering sustainable development, Indonesia should consider undertaking the following:

Finalizing a sectoral agreement with the United States that recognizes Indonesia’s ESG-compliant minerals as critical to U.S. supply security, granting preferential trade treatment and investment incentives

Establishing a national ESG certification framework aligned with OECD standards and incorporating traceability mechanisms

Promoting R&D and university-industry collaboration in clean processing technologies, recycling, and battery innovation

Supporting ASEAN-wide critical mineral cooperation, including a shared platform for data exchange, standards alignment, and regional investment hubs

Building regulatory capacity and community engagement to ensure inclusive growth and social license to operate

With coordinated reforms, strategic diplomacy, and technological partnerships, Indonesia can position itself not only as a mineral-rich supplier but as a value-added producer and sustainability leader in the energy transition.

A 3 GW pipeline of contracted and “high probability” data center projects will drive the majority of that growth, according to the company. Leaders believe Xcel’s data center queue could exceed 20 GW if earlier-stage prospects materialize.

Xcel Energy announced a $15 billion addition to its five-year capital plan on Thursday, which CEO Bob Frenzel said will now cover 7.5 MW of new renewable generation, 3 MW of new gas generation, 1.9 MW of energy storage, 1,500 miles of high-voltage transmission and $5 billion for wildfire mitigation.

Xcel and two telecom companies agreed to a $640 million settlement with plaintiffs in a lawsuit over the 2021-2022 Marshall Fire in Colorado in September. The company excluded a $290 million charge from its share of the Marshall Wildfire settlement in Colorado from quarterly earnings metrics, it noted.

“Making sure that we can deliver a cleaner energy product as well as a highly reliable and highly affordable product is very strategic as we approach economic development with data centers,” Frenzel said.

New data center load represents about 60% of Xcel’s anticipated retail sales growth through 2030, but it isn’t the only sector driving increased demand at the utility, according to CFO Brian Van Abel. Another 30% of the company’s growth comes from the electrification of the oil and gas sector, and residential load growth and electrification represent about 10% of total sales growth.

Subsidiary Southwestern Public Service Company, which serves customers in New Mexico and Texas, anticipates the fastest growth, with retails sales expected to rise 8% through 2030. Northern States Power Minnesota, Northern States Power Wisconsin and Public Service Company of Colorado all expect 4% sales growth through 2030, according to data from Xcel.

Investment Strategy

Van Abel said the company aims to bring most of its new generation online in between 2028 and 2030. He acknowledged this means their spending and growth projections are more front-heavy than those of other utilities, but he said the goal was to avoid the 2030 “tax credit cliff” and to match the accelerated pace of customers looking to secure renewable energy resources.

But the pace of spending led some analysts on the call to question how much debt the company plans to accrue, and whether it could lead to credit downgrades.

While maintaining a strong balance sheet and healthy credit ratings remains important, Van Abel described these as longer-term priorities.

Trump said on the campaign trail that he would “cut the price of energy and electricity in half” by the start of 2026.
That’s according to a new analysis from the green group Climate Power, which is based on data from the US Energy Information Administration.
The president has also waged a war on inexpensive wind and solar power, despite soaring electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence datacenters.

Democratic lawmakers highlighted the figures in a letter sent to Donald Trump on Friday. “Your administration has no explanations for its failures and no answers for American families that are hit hard by high energy costs, and it continues to actively pursue policies to make this cost crisis worse,” reads the missive, led by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator.

Trump said on the campaign trail that he would “cut the price of energy and electricity in half” by the start of 2026. Since January, however, average utility prices have gone up by 11% nationally, the lawmakers write.

That’s according to a new analysis from the green group Climate Power, which is based on data from the US Energy Information Administration.

Among the reasons for the increase are Trump’s moves to boost fossil fuels, says the new letter, which was also signed by the senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. That includes coal, the costliest and dirtiest energy source.

The president has also waged a war on inexpensive wind and solar power, despite soaring electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence datacenters. More than 12m US homes could have been powered by the clean energy projects that have been cancelled or delayed since Trump’s re-election, says the letter, citing the new Climate Power analysis.

“In effect, you have created a massive cut in energy supply,” the senators say.

Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said: “Democrats should spend less time writing letters, and more time reversing their green energy policies that drove electricity prices up,” claiming that blue states “continue to have higher electricity prices because of their obsession with unreliable and costly green energy sources like wind and solar”.

Trump’s war on renewable power is also spurring job loss, thereby creating even more economic chaos for US households, the lawmakers note. Since he took office, about 150,000 clean energy jobs have been lost or stalled, with another 150,000 potentially facing the same fate, they wrote, citing an earlier analysis of public data by Climate Power.

The White House has also “made the crisis worse” by proposing to eliminate the $4bn which Congress approved for heating and cooling aid via the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the lawmakers say. He is also seeking to cut or eliminate funding for the Energy Star program, which promotes energy-efficiency and has saved Americans $500bn in energy costs, according to federal data.

Meanwhile, Trump’s “chaotic, widely inconsistent tariffs” on imported goods have raised the cost of materials needed for power transmission, which the lawmakers say is “pushing up utility bills” further.

The senators’ letter follows an inquiry they launched in July, when they wrote to the heads of six federal agencies to ask the administration’s plan to meet its pledge to slash utility costs. The responses were “disappointing”, the new letter says, with departments either not replying or only providing “platitudes”.

To lower energy costs, the three senators say, the Trump administration should “restore funding to thousands of energy projects slated to add much-needed supply to the grid, reverse costly fossil fuel plant mandates, and ensure the public continues to have access to the energy bill assistance they deserve”.

The time to act is now, they write: “With heating costs set to soar this winter, it is time to admit that your energy policy has failed and to reverse course before it is too late.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6857ad9721b6bec6d0d2028ec8b1b42725da95c/400_0_4000_3200/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9fabcfba7937452a25cff38c4bb5726d",N,,2025-10-31 14:07:24.589720

Capital News Service

LANSING – Some environmental agencies and organizations are concerned that carbon capture and storage legislation passed recently by the state Senate will harm Michigan’s environment.

Carbon capture and storage is the practice of capturing carbon dioxide in the air and storing it in rock formations underground.

The bills would establish a state regulatory framework that the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy would oversee instead of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

Under the legislation, an applicant for a state permit would be required to provide notice of the project to all owners of land overlying a proposed storage reservoir, among other requirements.

The legislation “would invite this technology into the state without accounting for critical safeguards necessary to prevent leaks and contamination,” said Grace Noyola, the communications director at the Michigan Environmental Council.

She said that the bills “don’t ensure that sequestration operators are paying their fair share for the use of our state resources, charging only at most 32 cents per ton of stored carbon.”

Noyola also said the legislation might create long-term liability for sequestration projects for Michigan residents because ownership of “closed” projects would fall to the state, along with accountability for any leaks.

And Ben Poulson, the director of government affairs at the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said, “We think that there are better ways to decarbonize the energy sector and support investments in things like wind and solar instead of paying to burn carbon and then capture carbon and then ship it across the state and store it.”

“All of that is very expensive. Just don’t burn carbon in the first place,” Poulson said.

The legislation would also allow operators to use funding from leases or royalties to pay for road construction through state forests.

The sponsors are Sens. Sean McCann, D-Kalamazoo, John Cherry, D-Flint, and Joseph Bellino Jr., R-Monroe.

Dale George, the director of communications at the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, said that in general, the department supports carbon capture and storage, saying the practice aligns with the MI Healthy Climate Plan.

That’s the state’s action plan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

“Carbon capture and storage can play a valuable role in reducing industrial emissions, particularly where eliminating fossil fuels is not feasible,” George said.

“The department believes the practice must be carefully regulated to ensure environmental integrity, public safety and strong community protections,” he said. “ We remain committed to evaluating technologies that support Michigan’s climate goals when implemented responsibly.”

Bogotá thus consolidates itself as a leader in climate and social innovation in Latin America, promoting a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable future for its inhabitants.","Bogotá, Colombia – Within the framework of the World Cities Day celebrations today, a high-level discussion will be held at the Hilton Corferias Hotel in Bogotá to present the results of the Urban Climate Action Programme (UCAP) Climate Action Implementation (CAI) Programme.

As a result of this initiative, which is funded by the UK Government and implemented in collaboration with C40 Cities, Bogotá has made significant progress in implementing strategic projects that integrate sustainable mobility, clean energy, and urban planning with an equity and inclusion approach. These efforts are reflected in the concrete results achieved, such as the Public Pedestrian Policy, the urban energy governance model, and the operation of La Rolita, an electric transport system with a focus on gender equity and care.

The Mayor of Bogotá, Carlos Fernando Galán; the British Ambassador to Colombia, George Hodgson; and Hélène Chartier, Director of Urban Development at C40 Cities, are expected to attend the event, which aims to highlight the political and technical commitment of the city and its allies to reduce emissions, strengthen capacities, and build a more sustainable and inclusive urban future. It will bring together municipal authorities, diplomatic representatives, international organisations, partners, beneficiaries, and key local stakeholders.

The event will showcase the key achievements of a collaboration cycle initiated in 2022 with funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and support from the British Embassy in Colombia, aimed at implementing priority climate actions in the city. It is also a commemoration of the bicentenary of relations between Colombia and the United Kingdom, reaffirming the importance of solid and continuous cooperation among partners and allies.

During the discussion, projects highlighting Bogotá’s progress in inclusive climate action will be presented, including La Rolita, the 100% electric public transport system with a gender equity focus. Featuring 195 electric buses and a workforce with 63% women drivers, the system is a milestone in equitable, sustainable mobility that actively cuts 8,580 tons of CO2 each year and is being replicated in other cities in the region.

The implementation of the Public Pedestrian Policy (PPP) will also be highlighted. It seeks to guarantee safe and inclusive spaces in a city where walking accounts for 36% of daily trips. With C40’s support, eight strategic circuits of more than 20 km were defined, connecting public transport stations – including the future Line 1 of the Bogotá Metro – with the District Care System and other urban facilities such as schools, kindergartens, health centers, parks, and community spaces.

In the energy sector, Bogotá is advancing in the consolidation of an urban energy governance model, which will allow for an increase in the use of clean sources and ensure the integration of climate action with a gender perspective in planning and decision-making. The capital is the first city in Latin America to have a formal urban energy governance model, aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This model opens the door to strategic investments in energy efficiency and clean energies, in addition to generating replicable learnings for other cities in the region.

The interventions recognised Bogotá’s advances in implementing public policies that integrate active and sustainable mobility, long-term urban planning, and the generation of green jobs with a gender focus, highlighting the city as a benchmark for global climate leadership. These results are a testament to what can be achieved by aligning public policy, financing, gender focus, and technical capacity to face the climate crisis and build a more sustainable and just future.

George Hodgson, British Ambassador to Colombia said: “Congratulations to Bogotá and C40 for the successes of their programmes to make Bogotá one of the greenest cities in Latin America. From the United Kingdom, we have been working with Bogotá on different fronts to support its commitment to sustainability. We remain committed to supporting climate action in Bogotá so that it becomes an increasingly inclusive, resilient, and, of course, more sustainable city.”

Carlos Fernando Galán, Mayor of Bogotá said: “Bogotá is today a global benchmark in climate action because we have shown that sustainability and equity can advance hand in hand. Being the host city for World Cities Day commits us even further to this vision. Thanks to the joint work with the United Kingdom and C40, we continue to promote projects that transform urban life and show how cities can lead the fight against climate change, and how international cooperation accelerates the transformations the world needs.”

Hélène Chartier, Director of Urban Development at C40 Cities said: “Bogotá’s results show the impact that can be achieved by aligning policy, finance, and technical capacity in the fight against the climate crisis,” said Hélène Chartier, C40 Director of Urban Planning and Design. “Bogotá is a regional leader, driving ambitious, replicable, and inclusive climate measures that promote a just energy transition and the creation of good green jobs through multiple C40 programs, and demonstrates leadership through concrete actions towards the fulfillment of its NDCs, in line with what science defines.”

The event reaffirms the commitment of the UK Government and the Mayor’s Office of Bogotá to climate action and highlights the importance of continued international cooperation through high-impact projects that integrate active mobility, clean energy, and sustainable and equitable urban planning.

KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile range per charge, on a 400-mile trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

In a blistering attack upon the president, Ford told the Guardian that Trump “doesn’t have any policies, he has whims.
Climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, Trump said during a speech to the United Nations last month.
“Everything we’ve said about climate change has come true.
“I’m confident we can mitigate against [climate change], that we can buy time to change behaviors, to create new technologies, to concentrate more fully on implementation of those policies.","Harrison Ford has said that Donald Trump’s assault upon measures to address the climate crisis “scares the shit out of me” and makes the US president among the worst criminals in history.

In a blistering attack upon the president, Ford told the Guardian that Trump “doesn’t have any policies, he has whims. It scares the shit out of me. The ignorance, the hubris, the lies, the perfidy. [Trump] knows better, but he’s an instrument of the status quo and he’s making money, hand over fist, while the world goes to hell in a handbasket.”

The legendary Star Wars and Indiana Jones actor, who is 83, added: “It’s unbelievable. I don’t know of a greater criminal in history.”

In his second term as president, Trump has set about dismantling climate and clean air protections, halted clean energy projects, urged oil and gas companies to “drill, baby, drill” for the fossil fuels that are overheating the planet, fired hundreds of scientists while deleting their work, and even banned mentions of “climate change” and “emissions” within government.

Trump, who has again withdrawn the US from the Paris climate deal, has also targeted other countries’ climate policies, pressing the UK to tear down its “ugly” wind turbines in favor of more oil drilling and demanding that the European Union roll back its climate rules and purchase more American oil and gas.

Climate change was “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, Trump said during a speech to the United Nations last month. “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”

Ford, a longtime environmental advocate, said Trump’s dislike of wind turbines was because “he has just not seen a gold one” and that the president’s legacy on the climate crisis would be “a clear expression of ignorance, of hubris and purposeful subterfuge”.

The world – including the US, the second largest carbon polluter – continues to lag in the effort to slash planet-heating emissions to curb the sort of disaster suffered this week by Jamaica, which has been lashed by a category 5 hurricane that scientists say was probably accelerated by a warmer atmosphere and ocean.

Earlier this year, Ford himself had to be evacuated from enormous wildfires that engulfed parts of Los Angeles (and were made more likely due to global heating), although his home in Brentwood was spared destruction, unlike those of many other celebrities.

Rising global temperatures are wreaking havoc beyond spectacular disasters such as Hurricane Melissa and the LA fires, too, with a major study this week finding that excess heat is now killing one person a minute around the world.

“I knew it was coming, I have been preaching this stuff for 30 years,” Ford said of these climate-fueled disasters. “Everything we’ve said about climate change has come true. Why is that not sufficient that it alarms people that they change behaviors? Because of the entrenched status quo.”

However, the world is increasingly embracing cleaner forms of energy, albeit at a slower pace than required to stave off escalating climate impacts, and Ford said he was hopeful that Trump’s fossil fuel-dominated vision would not prevail.

“He’s losing ground because everything he says is a lie,” Ford said. “I’m confident we can mitigate against [climate change], that we can buy time to change behaviors, to create new technologies, to concentrate more fully on implementation of those policies.

“But we have to develop the political will and intellectual sophistication to realize that we human beings are capable of change. We are incredibly adaptive, we are incredibly inventive. If we concentrate on a problem we can fix it most times.”

Ford spoke to the Guardian shortly before he was given a conservation leadership award at a ceremony at Chicago’s Field Museum on Wednesday evening. The award was bestowed by the foundation of the late biologist EO Wilson, who coined the term “biodiversity”. Wilson, a myrmecologist, became friends with Ford after they worked on conservation campaigns together and named a species of ant after the actor.

Wilson proposed that half of the planet be protected for nature, to stem ruinous losses to species and ecosystems, an initiative that his foundation, and Ford, continue to support. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have pledged a more modest 30% of land and seas to be preserved by 2030, and although progress has been made in the past year, barely half of this goal has been met, a new report by Wilson’s foundation shows.

“We are teetering on the edge,” Ford said of the ongoing loss of nature via deforestation, pollution and other human-caused destruction.

“Indigenous people are the stewards of much of the remaining standing forests and contain the hope that these precious places can be preserved. The science has proved the value in their preservation but that does not keep them from encroachment, and the protection they are granted is tenuous in some of the countries these assets exist in.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f7055f9ed67a49980b6d16efaeac22ccc96fc9e/506_0_4995_3996/master/4995.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fead72b279b092ff94022d0bf103e683",N,,2025-10-31 13:10:25.792408

Alliant Energy supports the proposal and will provide renewable energy to help power the data center campus.

Data center operator QTS is proposing a multi-billion dollar development in Dane County, and provide a $50 million fund to support Madison Area Technical College and other local institutions.

The company plans to submit a zoning application to the DeForest Village Board in November, according to its Oct. 30 announcement.

Sterling, Virginia-based QTS wants to develop up to five buildings over time − although its plans could change depending on the village approval process. The company has purchase agreements for the project site which are contingent on its rezoning.

QTS will pay for the project's infrastructure if it receives approval, said Tag Greason, co-CEO. Those costs are often paid with property tax revenue generated by new developments.

“We will then also invest in new, renewable energy generation which I think will be a benefit to the community as well,"" Greason told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Greason said QTS will hire area construction firms and workers for the development.

“When we say ‘It’s a project for Dane County,’ it’s about employment opportunities for those who live in and around the region,"" he said.

The data centers would operate with hundreds of workers, Greason said.

QTS, like other data center operators, has a closed-loop liquid cooling system that doesn't require a lot of water for the facilities, Greason said.

""We're not tone deaf to what it means to put a data center in a community,"" Greason said.

Greason said QTS has about 1,200 clients, including large technology companies.

If approved, QTS is also planning on starting a $50 million fund to support local institutions.

Those include scholarships and workforce partnerships with Madison Area Technical College and research partnerships with the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

""My expectation is that we will be successful in our rezoning,"" Greason said.

Alliant Energy on board with proposal

QTS has the support of Alliant Energy with the two companies agreeing on a purchase of 750 megawatts of renewable energy credits to help reduce the impact on Alliant customers.

There's a significant amount of grid capacity in the location where QTS plans to build, said Raja Sundararajan, Alliant executive vice president for strategy and customer solutions

“You won’t see a massive amount of transmission upgrades being built, “ Sundararajan said. “And the local community impact, as a result of new grid upgrades, will be minimum. That’s what made this location so attractive.”

Renewable energy provided by Alliant would help power the data center campus.

""We have an obligation to make sure existing customers are not harmed as a result of QTS coming in,"" Sundararajan said.

But a high school accounting class introduced her to the field and to a retired partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young.
“I am a first-generation college student, but there was never an option that I wasn’t going to go to college,” Thomas says.
And she has some advice for employers looking to recruit and hire job candidates looking for their first job: Choose first-generation college graduates.","First-generation college students come from all sorts of backgrounds and bring myriad perspectives to the University of South Carolina campus.

At USC, about one-fifth of the student population — more than 7,000 — are considered first-generation, meaning their parents did not complete a bachelor’s degree. Across the country, nearly 5 million undergraduate students identified as first-gen in 2020, one in every three students.

“First-generation students are trailblazers and their willingness to be ‘first’ demonstrates their belief in the transformative power of higher education,” says Althea D. Counts, executive director of TRIO Programs at USC. “There are first-generation students in leadership roles on campus and in our classrooms, bringing diverse lived experiences that are essential and enrich our campus environment.”

As the university marks the celebration of First-Gen College Celebration Week Nov. 3-7, we caught up with first-generation students, alumni, faculty and staff who are thriving in the classroom and beyond.

Faces of first-gen

Karra McCray Gibson grew up in the tiny South Carolina community of Dunbar in rural Georgetown County, where her childhood days started with some rules set down by her mother.

“Before we could go outside in the summer, we had to read books. My mom would quiz us and make sure that we could identify the setting and the main characters in the story before going outside. And we had to write,” Gibson says. “I hated it at the time, but I'm so grateful now.”

The commitment to education Gibson's mother stressed in their home served her daughter well. Gibson graduated as the valedictorian of her class at Carvers Bay High School. She had plenty of college options but decided to stay in-state where she received scholarships and the support of programs like the Opportunity Scholars at USC.

“I knew ever since I was a young girl I wanted to go to college,” she says. “It just made the most sense for me to come here. And I was able to graduate undergrad debt-free. So that was a really good decision.”

She was a member of the TRIO program at USC, which helped her adjust from life in a small town to navigating a large campus.

“I remember feeling very overwhelmed but also excited at the same time,” she says. “Being first-gen, in addition to the culture shock, I didn’t really know what I could ask or should ask. I was grateful for opportunities like the TRIO program, because not only were there resources and faculty and staff there who understood, I think it actually provided me with confidence that I could compete and excel academically and socially, even on a large campus.”

Once on campus, she jumped into activities — including being president of Alpha Lambda Delta honor society, pledging Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and holding down a part-time job. She also landed a job with her state representative — who asked her at her high school graduation if she was interested in working for him as a legislative aide at his office in Columbia.

Her original plan was to attend law school, until former TRIO director Paul Beasley suggested she apply for the Ronald McNair Scholars summer program, established to prepare participants for graduate school through research and other scholarly activities. She participated in the program the summer before her senior year, and she says it changed the trajectory of her life.

“Being from a small town, and also first-gen, I didn't necessarily see a professor as a career path. I didn't know that was possible. I didn't know what it would entail. I didn't know the benefits,” she says. “And so it was truly that program and being able to work on an independent research project, where I end up winning an award at the annual conference, that truly ignited my passion and showed me that this was something that I could do, but also that I could be good at it if I worked hard enough.”

After graduating with degrees in political science and English, she went to Howard University for her master’s in Black politics and American politics before heading to the Ivy League where she earned her doctorate from Brown University. She defended her dissertation in June and came home to USC this fall as an assistant professor of political science.

“It’s such a full circle moment that I could not have imagined when I left almost 10 years ago,” she says. “But it’s so rewarding to be back.”

And, now at the front of the classroom, she says she starts each course with an introduction that includes more than just listing her degrees.

“I tell them where I'm from and show it on a map. I say that I'm first-gen. I want all students who come to my class to know that if someone like me could do it, anyone else could.”

Austin LaForest recalls the questions he asked himself during his freshman year as a first-generation college student at Ohio University.

“Do I belong here? Am I going to be found out that I’m not smart enough?” he says. “I hadn’t traveled much outside my area, and there are people here from all over the world and people who have traveled the world. So, I definitely felt out of place. And I struggled academically.”

He remembers the feeling — and he uses it now to counsel and relate to students in his job as director of student care and case management at USC.

After all, it was mentors, faculty and administrators who inspired him as an undergraduate and helped him find his path.

LaForest grew up in Galion, Ohio, a town of about 10,000 people surrounded by cornfields between Cleveland and Columbus. His father worked in the steel mill and his mother held a variety of jobs — from working in a photo lab to a bank.

He credits his mom with pushing him to attend college. She had worked full time while she was in high school and wasn’t able to make her dream of going to the local community college a reality.

“Growing up, her message to me was, ‘I don't care. You are going to work hard in high school. You are going to college. That’s going to be your No. 1 priority.’ So that was a consistent message growing up. I would have been terrified to tell my mom I wasn’t going to college.”

In high school, he had the opportunity to be a part of a first-generation college student program called Seniors to Sophomores. As a senior, he took classes at a community college about 20 minutes from home, earning a full year of college credit by the time he finished high school.

He enrolled at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio as a physics major, switching his second quarter to political science. By the end of his freshman year, he switched to education, and graduated with a degree to teach social studies.

But it was the relationships he built with student affairs administrators as an undergraduate that helped steer his career.

“They were really instrumental in helping me understand what I could do, what my potential was. They made me feel like I belonged,” he says. “Meeting people and getting involved was really life-changing for me.”

By his senior year, he decided to go to graduate school for higher education student affairs.

“And that started my journey of working on college campuses and really being passionate about being a resource for students the way that so many people were for me.”

He arrived at USC in 2018, and now oversees the care and outreach team in Student Affairs. His journey as a first-generation student influences his job now, he says, by making him realize that every student comes to college with different experiences.

“I try not to go into a conversation with assumptions and try to be curious about the student that I'm sitting with. And, especially for students who may feel more like nontraditional students, I share with them that there are many students walking on campus who are also feeling the same way, asking ‘Do I belong here? Do I fit in?’”

He says his job is to reassure them of their place and their value as part of the USC community.

“One first-gen student’s experience can look totally different from another first-gen student. So, it’s not that we necessarily share every single lived experience. It's more about that shared connection of like, ‘Hey, I’m the first person who’s doing this. And I'm proud of overcoming some obstacles and some hurdles.’ That’s a really great connection point that I can make with the students.”

Kelvin Pearson always knew he would attend college. At career day in elementary school, he announced he would be a lawyer, and he hasn’t strayed from that path.

He was a high achiever, always in gifted and talented classes in school. “When I made one C in high school, I almost cried,” he says. “So, yeah, I expected to come to college.”

He graduated at the top of his high school class in Manning, South Carolina, and earned a full ride to USC, where he is a sophomore majoring in political science. And he still has his eyes set on law school.

He also understands the significance of being the first member of his extended family to attend college, and he feels a responsibility to his hometown and his community. The role of “role model” is one he embraces.

“To me, I am very proud to be a first-generation student. It means I’m breaking the stereotypes,” Pearson says. “A lot of people wouldn't have expected someone from my community to come to college. I was the only Black male in the top 20 of our high school class. For someone like me, to do that and break those barriers, it shows not only that we are capable, but it also shows that others like me at my high school can do that as well.

“And I just like being that role model for other people.”

He credits TRIO for helping him find a home — along with friends and mentors — at USC.

“TRIO has meant everything to me. They gave me mentors. They always stayed on me and made sure I got my assignments done. And when I just needed someone to talk to, I had someone to talk to,” he says. “I went through a period when my great-grandmother died, and I just really felt at my lowest. I still had my mentor there to help me. It was like comforting me, make sure I was straight, but also make sure my coursework was still getting done. Because this is still school and life happens, and we do need to grieve but also push past it.”

TRIO also allowed him to have a place to go during his free time where he could meet new people and find friends with similar backgrounds. The tutoring center at TRIO helped him both academically and socially, with tutors becoming friends.

He was named Mr. Freshman by the Association for African American Students and was selected to be a summer orientation leader, helping new freshmen find their paths at USC. And he became more involved in TRIO, serving as co-chair of the student lead team, which advocates for students.

“I can help incoming freshmen by pushing past some of those barriers that I saw myself during my freshman year. As a first-generation student, yes, you’re the first to do what you've done, but you also need to make sure you’re not the last. Continue to help the people that came after you; help them break the barriers that you broke.”

Ashley Thomas saw firsthand what TRIO could do for first-generation students on the USC campus. It made such an impact on her that she worked to implement some of the benefits of the program in her accounting career.

Thomas grew up in Myrtle Beach, thinking she would become an architect. But a high school accounting class introduced her to the field and to a retired partner at accounting firm Ernst & Young. She changed her career sights and made the decision to be a Gamecock.

“I am a first-generation college student, but there was never an option that I wasn’t going to go to college,” Thomas says. “Neither one of my parents went and none of my grandparents went, but I don’t remember a time growing up that it wasn’t like ‘You’re going to college.’”

At USC, she qualified for the Pell Grant, and the TRIO office offered her a scholarship.

“Both my parents were (living) paycheck to paycheck, so I was going for every scholarship I could get,” she says. “So when they reached out and I met them, I got really excited about it.”

She majored in accounting, but taking a class with English professor Ruth Strickland led her to add a minor in English and learn a skillset that she didn’t even know she wanted — the ability to write clear, argumentative papers. Thomas earned her undergraduate degree in accounting in 2006 and stayed on as Strickland’s graduate assistant while she earned her master of accountancy the following year.

As her accounting career took off, she worked for Thermo Fisher Scientific, a massive firm that provides a range of products and services for scientific research, diagnostics and manufacturing. During the summer of 2020, when protests surrounding the death of George Floyd filled the news, Thomas said the company took an active role in reaching out to different groups of people. Thomas became part of the team trying to figure out ways to reach college age students,

“The idea was to get people of color to be scientists or accountants or whatever. So I said, ‘I know this great organization. It’s TRIO.’ We ended up basically creating a partnership between Thermo Fisher and TRIO.”

Thomas said the idea was basic — putting together presentations for first- and second-year college students to teach budgeting skills along with exposing them to types of careers that are possible at Thermo Fisher.

“It was to offer a service to be like, ‘Hey, we’re kind of nerdy accountants. But we can tell you a few things that hopefully can give you some value as college students.’ Some of it was things I wish I would have heard as a freshman, like not to take out that credit card. But we were doing it with students that probably wouldn't know anything about Thermo Fisher because their parents weren't in the scientific research world.”

She says the program reached about 500 students across the country.

“I found so much value in TRIO and what it's doing for students that I continue to want to be involved wherever I can. And a lot of that's because of (USC TRIO director Althea) Counts and the teachers. But it’s also because, while I still would have gone to school without TRIO, I know there are other students that wouldn’t. It’s such a critical organization.”

Thomas has moved to a new job as the global controller for Bioventus, a medical device company. She is based near Chapel Hill, North Carolina. And she says she hopes her new firm will eventually forge a connection with TRIO.

And she has some advice for employers looking to recruit and hire job candidates looking for their first job: Choose first-generation college graduates.

“I guarantee you that person had to work harder,” she says. “And they will work much harder as an employee. I know what they’ve been through. To me, that person is going to be a much more dedicated employee than the person that had their parents pay for their school 100 percent.”

Nobody in Grace Ware’s family expected her to go to college.

An Army brat, she was born in California and grew up on military bases in New York, Arizona and Georgia. She graduated from high school in Myrtle Beach.

Her father was insistent on her joining the military as her older brothers had done. Her mother told her she wasn’t smart enough to go to college, and she would have to get a full ride to attend.

But Ware knew she didn’t want to enter the military. She wanted to go to a research university and look at a career in research or medicine. USC fit the bill. She earned scholarships and qualified for the TRIO program.

She is now a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering and is a teaching assistant in Physics 211.

It hasn’t been the easiest road. Ware says she was a rebellious teen — her mother kicked her out of their house when she turned 18. She stayed at a friend’s house in the months before she moved to Columbia to attend USC.

“It sounds kind of rebellious, but it kind of just proves to me that I can do really difficult stuff just on my own, and I don't necessarily have to rely on others,” she says. “I have the work ethic and dedication to push through and do something myself and figure out the hard stuff.”

Once she arrived at USC, she found TRIO on campus. While her classes and research have taught and challenged her, TRIO has given her community.

“It was like a support group, almost. If I needed someone to hang out with, I had TRIO,” she says. “I could hang out in the lounge or go and study in the lounge. And they had all the tutoring and mentoring programs.”

She says she initially came to the university interested in working with nerve generation and prosthetics, after seeing veterans, including her father, deal with the effects of injuries. Now she is interested in working with stem cells and organoids, three-dimensional, miniature versions of organs that provide an accurate model of real human organs.

“I joined a research lab at the medical school, and they do cell biology with organoids, testing CGRP peptides. And then they use that to study how it stimulates regeneration in other tissues,” she says. “And I just thought that was so cool. So, I’ve kind of shifted from wanting to do prosthetics to wanting to do cell and biomaterials/biophysics with organoids specifically.”",https://www.sc.edu/uofsc/images/twitter_images/2025/11-twitter-first-gen-stories.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:10:16.011282

(GEV) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","The demand for clean electricity is accelerating worldwide, driven by multiple structural and technological shifts. With this increasing demand, utility stocks like GE Vernova GEV and Enphase Energy ENPH are becoming attractive investment options.

The swift expansion of extensive artificial intelligence-driven data centers is leading to a substantial rise in energy usage, as these operations need considerable electricity to run servers and cooling systems around the clock. Increasing global temperatures are exacerbating electricity requirements, particularly for air conditioning and cooling mechanisms, while the growing use of electric vehicles (EVs) is generating new, ongoing demands for electricity.

Government decarbonization targets and clean energy mandates are also pushing utilities and corporations to transition toward renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Grid modernization initiatives are also gaining momentum, aimed at integrating intermittent renewables and improving reliability and resilience.

Furthermore, the increasing demand for effective energy storage technologies, which are essential for maintaining supply and demand balance, underlines the strategic significance of businesses positioned as integrators of sustainable energy. Together, these patterns support the long-term growth prospects of companies engaged in energy storage, smart grid technologies, and renewable energy production.

The Standpoint of GEV

GE Vernova benefits from its diversified business across Power, Wind, and Electrification, which allows it to provide customers with a full suite of solutions, from gas and nuclear to wind energy and grid technology. Because of its flexibility, the business appeals to a broad range of customers and remains resilient to market changes.

The company's strategy includes developing sustainable products, modernizing existing power plants, and investing in research and innovation to accelerate the transition to a more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future. During the third quarter of 2025, GEV’s Power unit signed over 12 gigawatts (GW) of new gas equipment contracts, including 12 GW of slot reservation agreements and 1 GW of orders. It converted 7 GW of existing slot reservation agreements to orders and shipped 4 GW of equipment. Its Wind unit secured 0.3 GW of onshore wind repowering orders, with 0.6 GW booked year to date.

The Standpoint of ENPH

Enphase Energy is a pioneer in energy storage, household energy management, and solar microinverter systems. ENPH is a solid investment in the decentralized clean energy future due to its advancements in distributed energy resources and its global presence in residential solar installations. Under each solar panel, ENPH's microinverters transform DC power into AC power individually. This method improves system reliability as well as effectiveness over conventional string inverters.

In October 2025, ENPH announced expanded support for virtual power plants (VPP) across Europe. Its products now enable advanced energy market steering and smart grid features, such as one-minute data streaming, instant alerts for VPP events and system maintenance, and home solar curtailment to support grid constraints. Additionally, the company is extending its ties with top energy providers to support regulating EV chargers and heat pumps.

Initially, Duke's proposal suggested the Cayuga station's aging coal plants would be shut down.
Per the final ruling from the IURC on October 29, 2025, Duke will retain clean energy financial incentives while building the new natural gas units.
During testimony, one estimate projected Duke customers will pay an addition $29 a month by the time the two natural gas units are up and running.
Both natural gas and coal plants emit carbon dioxide, which blankets the earth's atmosphere and is the leading contributor to global warming.","Duke Energy Indiana has received approval for two new natural gas units at Cayuga Station in Vermillion County, Indiana, after about six months of sparring with opponents before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).

One recurring sticking point: Would Duke have a financial incentive to embark on clean energy projects to replace coal plants? Initially, Duke's proposal suggested the Cayuga station's aging coal plants would be shut down.

But after pushback and then a settlement with the coal trade association Reliable Energy Inc. (REI) in June, Duke will now investigate the feasibility of keeping the coal plants online to be sold to a third party.

Per the final ruling from the IURC on October 29, 2025, Duke will retain clean energy financial incentives while building the new natural gas units. Alongside them, the coal plants might continue running.

The clean energy incentive, called Construction Work in Progress, allows Duke to charge ratepayers for the project while the plant is being constructed, which reduces financing costs for the utility. Angeline Protogere, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy Indiana, said this kind of financing will save customers more than $800 million over the life of the new plant.

That's still too much for consumer advocates. During testimony, one estimate projected Duke customers will pay an addition $29 a month by the time the two natural gas units are up and running.

""Bills are going to go up — dramatically,"" said Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group that intervened on the case. Ratepayers ""can't afford to pay what they're paying today. And disappointingly, the commission somehow justified that this proposal satisfies the affordability pillar of state policy.""

A strained grid

Duke contends that the project is necessary given the pressure on Indiana's electric grid and the utility's service area. Duke has added about 126,000 new customers since 2013, and the coal plants at Cayuga Station are nearly 60 years old.

Duke has already felt the effects of the squeeze: in advance of the summer of 2025, the utility had to purchase 470 megawatts of power to satisfy regional reliability requirements.

""It's our responsibility to constantly evaluate the demand for power on our system, and to make sure that we meet that demand,"" Protogere said.

The two natural gas units at Cayuga are designed to bridge the gap, adding 1,476 megawatts to the grid — 470 megawatts of capacity more than what the site's coal units currently offer.

Big bills, more emissions

Opponents to the project expressed frustration that financial incentives for clean energy are being used to fund fossil fuel projects without retiring coal plants as the original bill intended. Both natural gas and coal plants emit carbon dioxide, which blankets the earth's atmosphere and is the leading contributor to global warming.

Duke ""got everything they wanted,"" Olson said. ""It's just really, really disheartening and disappointing.""

The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the state agency tasked to advocate for ratepayers, recommended that the state deny the utility's petition on the grounds of affordability. In addition, multiple advocacy groups testified against Duke's petition over the past several months.

But IURC's final ruling found that Duke's proposal satisfied Indiana's five pillars of energy policy: reliability, resilience, stability, affordability, and environmental sustainability. Olson, however, does not think Duke's approach to affordability and environmental sustainability is a good one.

""This is going to increase fossil fuel use in Indiana, carbon emissions, exacerbate public health problems, the climate crisis. There's that aspect of this order, which is really, really frustrating and sad,"" he said. ""But there's also the significant economic aspect of this order, which means higher prices on monthly utility bills, hitting Duke rate payers, and it's just — whatever sort of adjective you want to put in there — it's just really frustrating.""

One Virginia voter, Kim Wilson, lamented at a town hall recently that her electricity bill seems to go up every month, no matter how much she tries to mitigate the costs. She was drawn to the event in part by its title: “The energy bills are too damn high.”

“It’s way too high,” Wilson readily agreed.

In New Jersey, Herb Michitsch of Kenilworth said his electric bill has climbed to nearly $400 a month, or more than four times what it was when he and his wife moved into their home half a century ago.

“Something really has to be done,” Michitsch said.

That something must be done is pretty much where the agreement ends. It’s what must be done that splits politicians back into rival camps.

Democratic candidates in the two states are far more likely to embrace clean energy options like wind and solar than their Republican opponents. The two states’ Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal. New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is occurring, but he says Democrats have driven up costs with their clean energy push.

Which side voters land on in the off-year elections will give both parties plenty to consider in what feels destined to be an emerging economic issue heading into next year’s midterm elections.

At a recent rally in New Jersey, Democratic state Sen. Vin Gopal made clear that he stood with Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in support of her plans to lower costs. But Gopal acknowledged that the outcome could signal whether voters are ready to embrace the president’s approach or have simply grown weary of national politics.

“The whole country is watching what happens,” he said.

Technology drives up costs

The debate comes as people in the two states grapple with double-digit percentage increases in monthly electricity bills. The exploding costs are driven by soaring demand, particularly from data centers, and by the rapid onset of energy-intensive artificial intelligence technology. Virginia’s largest energy utility also has linked potential future rate increases to inflation and other costs.

In Virginia’s open race to succeed a term-limited GOP incumbent, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are at odds over the development of renewable energy sources.

Spanberger has laid out a plan to expand solar and wind production in underused locations, praising a wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. In a debate against her opponent, she also said she would “ensure that data centers pay their fair share” as costs rise. The state is home to the world’s largest data center market,

Republican Winsome Earle-Sears wasn’t having it.

“That’s all she wants, is solar and wind,” Earle-Sears said of Spanberger at the debate. “Well, if you look outside, the sun isn’t shining and the breeze isn’t blowing, and then what, Abigail, what will you do?”

In New Jersey, where Ciattarelli’s endorsement by Trump included recent social media posts praising his energy affordability plans, the GOP nominee blames rising costs on eight years of Democratic control of state government.

Ciattarelli says he would pull New Jersey out of a regional greenhouse gas trading bloc, which Democratic incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy reentered when he first took office in 2018.

“It’s been a failure,” Ciattarelli said at the final debate of the campaign. “Electricity is at an all-time high.”

He’s also come out as a strident opponent of wind energy off the state’s coast, an effort Democrats spearheaded under Murphy. A major offshore wind project ground to a halt when the Danish company overseeing it scrapped projects, citing supply chain problems and high interest rates.

At the center of Sherrill’s campaign promise on the issue is an executive order to freeze rates and build cheaper and cleaner power generation.

“I know my opponent laughs at it,” Sherrill said recently.

A growing concern among voters

The candidates’ focus on affordability and utility rates reflects an unease among voters. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found electricity bills are a “major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults, at a time when data center development for AI could further strain the power grid.

Perhaps that’s why the statewide races have become something of an energy proxy battle in Virginia. Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization. GOP statewide candidates, meanwhile, have accepted money from Dominion Energy, the largest electric utility in Virginia.

To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.

Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, who represents the southwest edge of Virginia, had failed to alter part of the state’s Clean Economy Act earlier this year. Kilgore, whose top donor is Dominion Energy, said in February: “If their bills go any higher, there are folks in my region that are not able to pay them now, they’re definitely not going to be able to pay them in the future.”

Evan Vaughn, executive director of MAREC Action, a group of Mid-Atlantic renewable energy developers, said candidates from both parties are in a tough spot because bringing down prices quickly will be difficult given broader market dynamics.

“Voters should look to which candidate they think can do the best to stabilize prices by bringing more generation online,” he said. “That’s really going to be the key to affordability.”

Michitsch, who’s backing Sherrill in the governor’s race and said he would campaign for her, said her proposal shows she’s willing to do something to address spiraling costs.

“We need to change,” he said. “And I think she is here to change things.”

The US and China are forecast to both see massive increase in power demand from AI data centres, in particular, as the two countries compete to dominate in the technology.
A report yesterday from Wood Mackenzie said that the growth of AI data centre demand is a barrier to reaching global net zero and meeting the Paris Climate Agreement global warming commitments.
Analysis from the firm said the surge in AI data centre demand “threatens electricity crises and higher tariffs while derailing 2030 clean power commitments”.

Through funding the sites, Meta will put the environmental attributes, like renewable energy credits, towards its decarbonisation statistics.

“When we announced our AI data centre in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year, we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid—and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta.

These firms could “more than meet” their electricity needs by paying for residential solar and energy storage systems across the US, the report said, by reducing demand and load on the grid, particularly at peak times, and simultaneously reducing energy bills for consumers.

This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.” ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand.
“EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule.
Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly.
“It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.","Sioux Falls, SD – The American Coalition for Ethanol (ACE) submitted comments today to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in response to the Agency’s supplemental proposed rule for the “Set 2” Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program covering 2026 and 2027, urging the Agency to fully reallocate the impacts of Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) and finalize the rule before year-end.

“We appreciate the important step EPA is taking with this supplemental proposal to rectify and reallocate the impacts of SREs issued for the 2023 and 2024 RFS compliance years, as well as reallocation for SREs anticipated for 2025,” said ACE CEO Brian Jennings in written comments. “If the volumes of renewable fuel represented by the SREs are not reallocated, obligated parties could use the oversupply of low-priced RINs to satisfy future renewable volume obligations instead of buying and blending physical gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuel. This type of demand destruction would undermine the integrity of the RFS.”

ACE emphasized that history has shown how harmful SREs can be to ethanol demand. “SRE-induced demand destruction occurred in 2018 and 2019 when D6 RIN values cratered from $1.00 per gallon to $0.20 or less following EPA’s decision to grant 85 SREs covering the 2016 through 2018 compliance years,” Jennings noted. “More than 4 billion gallons of blending obligations were effectively erased for refiners through EPA’s action at that time, discouraging refiners from blending ethanol above E10 and restraining sales of E15, E30, and E85.”

Jennings said EPA has an opportunity to prevent that from happening again. “EPA must reallocate 100% of the 2023 through 2025 exempted RVOs – an estimated 2.18 billion gallons – to the final Set 2 rule. The 100% full reallocation approach is the only way to ensure blending obligations remain whole for 2026 and 2027.”

Beyond reallocation, ACE reiterated support for EPA’s proposal to set record-high renewable fuel volumes and encouraged EPA to consider conventional biofuel levels exceeding 15 billion gallons to offset potential export market losses and ensure conventional ethanol maintains its role in the fuel supply.

ACE’s comments also backed EPA’s proposal to reduce RIN generation for imported fuels and foreign feedstocks and called for improvements to the Agency’s lifecycle modeling for biofuels. “We encourage EPA to modify its methodology to align with real-world observations and actions taken by Congress, including use of GREET and GTAP-BIO modeling approaches,” Jennings said.

Finally, ACE pressed EPA to act swiftly. “It is imperative to finalize this rulemaking before the end of the 2025 calendar year to get the RFS back on track and provide certainty to all parties,” Jennings concluded.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2470/2023/09/20221806/Untitled-1021-x-640-px-9-898x563.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:07:15.714145

This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy.","The Illinois Senate passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, also known as SB25, on Thursday. The bill passed the House on Wednesday, so it's now headed to the governor's desk. It's a move that's getting mixed reactions.

State Senator Jil Tracy (R-Quincy) issued a statement criticizing the passage of the ""so-called 'Energy Omnibus Bill.'""

“Democratic policies have created a mess for Illinois families, and this latest energy bill only digs the hole deeper,"" Senator Tracy said. ""Just when we thought things couldn’t get more chaotic after the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), this proposal removes crucial protections, hands unelected bureaucrats unchecked power to raise utility rates, and risks closing reliable local power plants while subsidizing unreliable energy. The result? Families face skyrocketing bills while billions flow to special interest groups and not to the people who actually pay the bills. Illinoisans deserve affordable, reliable energy, not this mess.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition says the bill protects consumers from energy price spikes and safeguards Illinois’ climate commitments made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

“With the passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, Illinois is standing up to President Trump’s dismantling of the clean energy economy and boldly leading the way forward. At a time when utility bills are rising due to unprecedented demand for energy, largely driven by data centers, Illinois is taking decisive action to mitigate rising costs while solidifying our clean energy economy for generations to come,"" the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition said in a statement Thursday night.

“The CRGA Act makes transformative investments in the most cost-effective, reliable resources needed to meet growing demand: battery storage, energy efficiency, and wind and solar. This is how we protect Illinoisans from bill spikes and grow Illinois’ clean energy economy. It is also how we step away from the status quo of Illinois families paying too much to prop up expensive dirty energy plants that pad the profits of out of state fossil fuel corporations instead of building cost-effective, new clean energy resources that are better for consumers and boost economic development. We applaud the General Assembly for taking action.

“As Illinois steps forward to responsibly tackle our energy and affordability challenges, this victory must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centers, the primary driver of rising utility bills, join the solution instead of continuing to be the problem. Illinois has proven that it can tackle complex energy policy issues while keeping equity, consumers, and worker protections at the forefront, and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition looks forward to working with stakeholders next spring to build on that progress.”

The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association says the sweeping energy proposal doesn't go far enough to address the underlying issues. The association said in a statement Thursday night the bill will result in massive electric rate hikes on businesses and consumers.

“Manufacturers need reliable and affordable energy to produce the goods consumers rely on, including food, pharmaceuticals, machinery and household products. Unfortunately, this proposal repeats mistakes of the past, raising costs on manufacturers and working families without addressing underlying capacity and supply issues that are projected to lead to energy shortfalls,” said Mark Denzler, President and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “While there are some provisions of this legislation we support, including lifting the moratorium on nuclear facilities, more work needs to be done to strengthen our state’s energy marketplace, protect consumers and encourage long-term economic investment. We remain committed to offering workable solutions, including advocating for an all-of-the-above approach that includes renewables, maintains operations at current baseload plants, adds new power generation, and invests in more transmission lines and affordable technologies.”",https://foxillinois.com/resources/media/a01141ed-4601-4554-ad4d-320d65970e2a-IMG_0532.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:08:55.433894

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. released a report the same year finding that natural gas-fired units represented 58% of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages and other issues at that time. Wind made up 27%, coal made up 6%, and solar made up 2%.

“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said. “They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ad4fbd2/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F63%2F179975d947c3bd49ff759c5d1216%2Fgettyimages-1303397752.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:09:01.119136

This sustainable solution is called Soleolico, which is the world’s first hybrid generator that is responsible for producing wind and solar power while absorbing CO₂ at the same time. According to Carlos Serrada, president and founder of Soleolico, the wind turbine that absorbs CO₂ was the result of many people working and researching together.

A combination of wind and solar power in an absorbing gadget

Soleolico is a vertical-axis turbine that operates silently at seven revolutions per minute. This wind and solar solution is a wildlife-friendly design that is meant to reduce noise pollution. The Soleolico can be installed in all areas, including heavily populated areas.

Wind can be captured from all directions as the turbine has a magnetic blade guidance system. The good news is that this turbine can result in 25% higher performance when compared to the more traditional turbines. While harnessing the power of the wind, solar integration ensures constant power generation.

During the day, the embedded solar cells are able to gain energy directly from the sun, and the wind turbine aspect ensures that power is generated at night and when the sun doesn’t shine. The system is thus able to generate power 24/7 with further support from advanced battery storage.

A generator that works to absorb CO₂ from the air, too

While Soleolico is well known for its 7,5 kW capacity that enables the generator to power homes, offices, and the community at large, the best feature of the Soleolico is that it features an air-purifying surface. The tower and the sails are coated with 3-D printed material that absorbs CO₂ and transforms it into harmless byproducts.

The 3-D printed material was developed by LaMáquina using Pure. Tech technology to absorb the CO₂. As has been said by the director of Pure. Tech, installing 1,000 units of Soleolico would result in the absorption of as much CO₂ as 287 trees in just a year. The design can be customized by 3-D printing so as to effortlessly blend into an environment.

Soleolico called the first-ever technological tree

Soleolico achieved quite a name for itself, being called the first-ever technological tree. In fact, the term “technological tree” was given by Serrada. The feat for Serrada is that the Soleolico can even work in the park, producing clean air whilst ridding the Earth of CO₂. While vertical wind turbines are always set to beat solar panels, the Soleolico ensures that a wind generator can work alongside solar panels.

One of the reasons why Soleolico is so valued is that it can coexist in all settings. Soleolico’s versatility is another reason why it is such an impressive generator.

Stepping closer to a cleaner power future

Serrada’s company has a goal to capture 1% of the global renewable energy market over the next decade. To reach this ambitious goal, the company will have to produce 3 million Soleolico units while generating over €100 billion in revenue. To achieve this goal, Soleolico will build its first manufacturing facility in Spain while expanding on partnerships in all regions.

Production capacity is set to exceed 25,000 units per month, with the company planning for the generator to be located all over cities. Soleolico has come in at the right time, offering some hope for a cleaner planet. This combination of wind, sun, and technology is reimagining what renewable power could mean for us. When wind meets solar in a wild fusion, the results are quite amazing, and Soleolico proves this.

However, that reality may be coming to an end soon, as the Baltic Industrial Group, a Polish manufacturer of onshore wind towers, has recently announced a strategic partnership with Vensys Energy, a German wind tower component manufacturing company, to supply onshore wind towers in a new pan-European contract that not only boosts the wind power sector, but also enables Europe to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel energy generation towards the renewable energy sector.

Under the new partnership, the Baltic Industrial Group will supply wind towers to several European nations

For far too long, the world has stagnated in its embrace of the wind power sector while solar and nuclear hold the torch for the renewable energy industry. The global community has been contemplating the best form of energy production that does not harm the environment. Our continued reliance on fossil fuels has devastated the world and resulted in significant climate change.

The new strategic partnership between two of the world’s leading wind power companies will supply essential components for wind tower manufacturing across several European nations.

The Baltic Industrial Group will manufacture five towers for a new wind power project in the United Kingdom, along with seven towers headed for new wind projects in France, Poland, and Germany.

The group will also supply essential components for a project in Portugal

The group has also noted that it will supply five ESC sections for a new wind power project in Portugal. These exemplify the group’s expertise in the wind manufacturing sector, as these components are exceedingly complicated and require expert levels of engineering ability.

“For us, the cooperation with VENSYS is not only a new contract, but also a strategic step towards further development in the renewable energy sector. Our goal is for the towers built in Gdańsk to operate throughout Europe – from the Atlantic coast to the southern regions of the continent. This proves that the Baltic Industrial Group is ready to implement the most demanding projects in the renewable energy sector.” – Remigiusz Paszkiewicz, President of the Management Board of the Baltic Industrial Group

Europe’s cooperative dialogue between companies has boosted the appeal of the wind power sector

With the exceedingly cold European winter approaching, many European nations are turning to the renewable energy sector to increase energy supply to alleviate concerns over increasing demand.

The strategic partnership between the Baltic Industrial Group and VENSYS, which should be noted, is based in Germany but owned by China, and will complete the delivery in several phases. The new partnership covers the entire process, from designing the wind towers with a specialized team from VENSYS, manufacturing of said wind towers, and developing efficient transport logistics.

The wind power sector has seen tremendous growth in Europe as of late, with MingYang, a Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, unveiling its plans to enter the European wind energy sector in the next few years. This points to a new future where wind will be embraced by the powers that be on the continent.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles.
But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles.
Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles.","Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's.

The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a fire at an aluminum plant that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis.

Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year.

Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline.

Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from Japan and Europe from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with Korea. While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers.

Meanwhile, a recent policy change eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars.

Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from rising car prices. Companies have been cautious about passing tariff costs along to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to emissions requirements that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles.

Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs.

Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for ""regulatory credits,"" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated.

Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by the rush to buy EVs as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk, as usual, was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is leaning heavily into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a previous focus on electrification.

But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. ""EVs remain our North Star,"" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on improved EV batteries.

Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles. But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities.

""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors.

So Ford still plans to move forward with a $30,000 electric pickup, despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. ""We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,"" Farley said.

Their goal is to power the entire farmers market, and eventually, Purdue, with sustainable energy.
“If the roof of every building on Purdue campus is covered with solar panels, we can produce most of the energy, if not all, to run the campus,” Kudinov said.
“I wish people knew how feasible (sustainable energy) is,” said Eddie Petrenko, the operations manager for the club.
The SEC welcomes people from every field to learn more about sustainable energy and get hands-on with the processes.","Thursday marked the end of the West Lafayette Farmers Market for the season, but for the Sustainability Energy Club at Purdue, the day was just a beginning for a more sustainable future.

Founded last spring semester, the SEC is a club made up of mostly freshmen, but the spirit of its members more than makes up for their lack of experience. Being the only club at Purdue advocating for sustainable energy, their mission is to educate people and to make a bigger push for sustainable energy at Purdue.

The SEC set up eight pairs of solar panels central to the farmers market, each one generating power for one tent at the market: KNOW Eatery, a vegan restaurant with an emphasis on sustainability consciousness.

But KNOW Eatery is only the start for the SEC. Their goal is to power the entire farmers market, and eventually, Purdue, with sustainable energy.

Andrei Kudinov, a junior in mechanical engineering, is co-president of the club.

“If the roof of every building on Purdue campus is covered with solar panels, we can produce most of the energy, if not all, to run the campus,” Kudinov said. “With just this array, in one hour, we'll probably save six pounds of carbon emissions.”

While the goal of a fully sustainable energy-run campus is far away, the members of the SEC work on smaller projects that make a big impact around campus.

The SEC is planning on implementing wind turbines on campus during the winter months, a time when it’s not as sunny for solar panels to be effective. The SEC also does research with Hydroponics, plants that are grown without soil, as research for plant growth in space.

Another project that the SEC is working on is a DC house, or a house that is run completely off of solar power. The DC house, located near Armstrong, will help the club research energy savings with their own data and observations.

“We're starting off small, but it's the first step in creating bigger projects that help the community,” said Alexis Fornero, a member of the SEC’s fundamentals branch and a sophomore in civil engineering. “Even just powering one booth at the farmers market is taking that first step.”

One of the SEC’s goals is to educate people on how simple and accessible sustainable energy can be.

“I wish people knew how feasible (sustainable energy) is,” said Eddie Petrenko, the operations manager for the club. “Everything we got here was ordered off Amazon. The solar panels are $60, and we trained a bunch of freshmen to set them up in a few weeks.”

In educating people about sustainable energy, the SEC combats stigmas that many people hold towards clean energy, which especially affects nuclear energy.

The SEC also works to influence Purdue’s plan, or lack thereof, for sustainability.

“Our poly branch is working on a climate action plan for Purdue, because we're the only Big 10 school that doesn't have one,” said Abhitej Kanuri, the SEC secretary. “That’s one of the big focuses right now.”

But the main focus of the SEC rests in the future.

“There's a huge cultural and business shift right now,” Kanuri said. “Sustainable and renewable energy is going to be the future. When technology is at the point where sustainable energy is the most important form of energy, Purdue needs to have systems in place to produce engineers who know how to work with that kind of energy.”

The impending shift towards sustainable energy has piqued the interest of many students at Purdue, which is something that excites the members of the SEC. The SEC welcomes people from every field to learn more about sustainable energy and get hands-on with the processes.

“Anybody can join, you don't have to know anything,” said Sammie Van Hoose, an FYE student and outreach coordinator for SEC. “You don't need any experience; you can learn something and help out the community. It’s simpler than it looks.”

The enthusiasm of the members themselves also acts as a motivator for the club to continue its hard work and dedication to implementing sustainable energy at Purdue.

“It's easy to stay positive when we are seeing so much of a positive impact from our work,” Van Hoose said. “We have a lot of people that, because of their hard work, we're able to see our impact firsthand, and we get a lot of positive results. A lot of our members are very passionate about this.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/purdueexponent.org/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/09/409bdcac-f4f5-4166-9373-47eaf9e3190d/6904c819b1c60.preview.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-31 11:26:43.884181

(AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

LAS VEGAS (Oct. 31, 2025) – Pushing the limits of electric vehicle performance, Toyota will debut its first-ever battery-electric SEMA concept build with the bZ Time Attack Concept at the 2025 SEMA Show—a purpose-built, BEV machine engineered to take on both time attack circuits and hill climbs.

Designed to explore the performance potential of Toyota’s BEV technology, this vehicle showcases competition aerodynamics, motorsports-grade suspension and engineering, and a significant increase in all-electric horsepower over stock.

The concept begins with a strong foundation: the 26MY AWD bZ, which already delivers 338 horsepower and a 0–60 mph time of just 4.9 seconds in showroom form. Looking ahead, Toyota is also expanding its all-electric lineup with an all-new bZ model arriving for the 2026 model year, bringing improved range, power, and charging capabilities. In addition, Toyota will introduce two all-new BEVs in 2026—the bZ Woodland and the C-HR—further broadening customer choice and underscoring the company’s commitment to electrified performance and innovation.

“This year at SEMA, we wanted to push ourselves into unexplored territory,” said Marty Schwerter, lead builder and director of operations at Toyota’s Motorsports Technical Center. “It’s a chance to explore, learn, and create something that shows just how much potential exists within Toyota’s BEV platforms.”

Schwerter and his Toyota Motorsports Garage team have collaborated on standout Toyota SEMA builds for more than two decades. Still, the bZ Time Attack Concept presented several unique challenges, from balancing battery performance with weight distribution to designing an aggressive widebody and aero package suited for motorsports. Unlike conventional builds, the team had to rethink how aerodynamics and fitment could be achieved on an EV platform, while helping to provide safety and durability under extreme conditions.

“The goal wasn’t to simply create a showpiece—It was to see how far the new bZ platform could be pushed in a motorsport setting,” said Schwerter. “And that meant that we had to tackle the two biggest hurdles for any electric competition car: battery performance and aerodynamic integration.”

Packaging a widebody and full aero suite onto an EV chassis presented challenges not found in conventional builds, driving the team to rethink everything from airflow management to cooling strategies.

The solution came through a hybridized approach to fabrication. Toyota R&D, TRD, and a network of advanced suppliers combined laser scanning, CAD development, and large-scale 3D printing to bring the design to life. Fender arches were digitally modeled, printed at full scale, then hand-finished for strength and precision. Key to this process was Toyota’s Add Lab in Georgetown, Kentucky— led by Sr. Engineering Manager Greg Stewart and Additive Manufacturing Engineer Dallas Martin— whose rapid prototyping capabilities gave R&D the flexibility to hit tight deadlines. This method drastically cut prototyping time, allowing for rapid iterations of the one-off widebody and aero system.

The result: a car lowered a whopping six inches from stock ride height, with massive six-inch track increase and a fully integrated aero package including rear wing, side skirts, front splitter, and rear diffuser.

Under the skin, the bZ Time Attack Concept starts with a 2026 Toyota bZ AWD platform. Power delivery to all four wheels comes from Toyota R&D-tuned electric motors delivering over 300 kW (400+ hp), managed through bespoke ECU calibration. TEIN coilovers and springs suspend the chassis, while drastically improved braking performance comes by way of an Alcon system with Hawk pads adapted from Toyota’s 86 Cup and Corolla TC race programs. A full FIA-spec 4130 chromoly cage stiffens the chassis, while the interior is fitted with OMP HTE-R racing seats and OMP harnesses. The chassis rolls on 19×11-inch BBS Unlimited wheels shod with huge 305/30ZR19 XL Continental Extreme Contact Sport 02 tires, adding substantial mechanical grip to go along with the impressive aerodynamic downforce.

Every aspect of the build reflects Toyota’s willingness to experiment with nontraditional fabrication methods. The bodywork, finished in a custom PPG pearl/metallic white, metallic black, and red tri-color scheme, demonstrates what happens when additive manufacturing and traditional race-car craftsmanship intersect. From CAD modeling at Dark Matter Laser Works to the 3D-printed components produced by Toyota’s Add Lab, the project embodies a new way of thinking about concept-to-competition builds. For Toyota, the bZ Time Attack Concept isn’t just a concept car—it’s a rolling test bed for the next generation of EV motorsport development.

“Every SEMA build challenges Toyota’s engineering and design teams to outdo themselves from the year before,” said Mike Tripp, group vice president, Toyota Marketing. “With the bZ Time Attack Concept, the challenge was greater than ever: transforming an all-electric Toyota vehicle into motorsport reality. The bZ Time Attack Concept is not only a striking visual concept but also a serious performance contender.”

The bZ Time Attack Concept will be on display at the 2025 SEMA Show from November 4-7 at the Las Vegas Convention Center in the Toyota booth (Central Hall, Booth 22200). The concept is just one of over two dozen displays in support of this year’s display theme: Powered by Possibility, where Toyota celebrates innovation with a build for every powertrain, including gasoline internal combustion (ICE), BEV, hybrid (HEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and Fuel Cell Electric (FCEV). Attendees are invited to visit Toyota’s booth to experience this innovative concept build up close and discover how Toyota continues to imagine what could come next.

The utility plans to replace two aging coal-fired units with a pair of advanced combined-cycle natural gas units. The proposed investment is approximately US $3.3 billion, plus financing and contingency costs. Construction is slated for completion of the first gas unit by 2029 and the second by 2030, enabling retirement of the coal units thereafter. The move addresses growing electricity demand in the region and aligns with regulatory filings citing generation shortfall risks.

Project Factsheet

Utility: Duke Energy Indiana

Location: Cayuga Generating Station, Vermillion County, Indiana

Investment: $3.3 billion (plus financing costs)

New capacity: Adds ~470 MW to existing ~1,005 MW at the facility

Future of coal units: Study on third-party operation; retirement scheduled 2029–2030

Ratepayer impact: First tracker adds ~$1.87/month; watchdog predicts up to ~$19.37 /month

Significance of the Project

From a construction-industry perspective, this conversion offers a vast and complex project pipeline: demolition of coal-steam infrastructure, heavy civil works for new foundations, erection of combustion turbines, installation of heat-recovery steam generators, and integration of modern utility systems. Similarly, the Samsung Engineering America low-carbon ammonia plant in Indiana, reflects growing investment in clean-energy and decarbonization projects that demand advanced engineering and construction expertise. According to project documents, the capacity increase is about 471 MW over the retiring units, meaning large structural, mechanical and electrical scopes. Moreover, the project’s regulatory context introduces cost-recovery mechanisms such as construction-work-in-progress ratemaking, which has implications for contractor project-phasing and financing.

The settlement with coal-industry stakeholders has also required a feasibility study for third-party operation of existing coal units, a novel approach that underscores the layered planning and stakeholder-management complexity. Finally, the heavy-industry nature of the work (power-plant scale) elevates opportunities for mechanical contractors, heavy-lift logistics firms, structural steel fabricators and specialist trade subcontractors, particularly those capable of working in large-site, high-specification energy-transition projects.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Project-16.avif,N,,2025-10-31 16:05:10.808616

But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Worries remain on charging

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the United States.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high.

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, said Thursday. “If we do nothing… the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

Renewable industry, environmentalists celebrate

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shockwaves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

Criticism from Republicans, business groups

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Frankfort, and Sen. Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a long-time advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/251030-solar-aa.jpg?h=0caf38e4&itok=bD7VSwKJ,N,,2025-10-31 12:09:24.698660

“For too long, America has been dependent on foreign sources of fertilizer,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release.
“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said.

“For too long, America has been dependent on foreign sources of fertilizer,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release. “Under President (Donald) Trump’s leadership, we are changing that by putting America first, relying on American coal, American workers, and American innovation to power our farms and feed our families.”

Wabash Valley Resources intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant.

‘Too many unknowns’: As company forges on with carbon sequestration project, residents mobilize

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.

The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.

A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”

The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”

“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”

Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”

“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.

Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.

“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.

“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”

The groups observed the loan was initiated under former President Joe Biden’s administration but frozen under Trump’s, and the project description no longer boasts of the undertaking’s carbon dioxide sequestration components.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_3523-scaled-e1747664494591-1024x7681761919507.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=G9NmJIbT,N,,2025-10-31 11:00:34.948319

Instead, the analysis shows bills are spiking largely because of a host of add-ons for natural-gas fuel and other expenses.
Utilities often tout their relatively low base rates, said Kendl Kobbervig, advocacy and communications director for the nonprofit Clean Virginia.
But analysts propose to change the rate rollercoaster for consumers by requiring Appalachian Power and Dominion to take on some portion of those fuel costs.
“A strong path to pursue immediately” Fuel costs aren’t the only pass-throughs that researchers recommend constraining.","In the final days before the election, candidates around the country are putting rising electricity bills on center stage — and that’s especially true in Virginia, where voters are on edge about the explosion of data centers and their voracious demand for energy.

But it’s one thing to complain about costs. What can candidates actually do to rein in electricity prices once they’re in a position to govern? A new study from the state’s utilities commission offers a road map for Virginia officials post-election.

Polls generally show Democrats poised to win a trifecta in Richmond, with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D) favored to replace Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), who is limited to one term, and Democrats likely to retain a majority in the House of Delegates. The party already narrowly controls the state’s upper chamber, where senators are on a four-year cycle that ends in 2027.

Still, the new analysis suggests that winning could be the easy part for whoever prevails Nov. 4. Tamping down electricity prices and decarbonizing in the face of unprecedented demand growth in the world’s data-center capital will be a much more complicated task.

“An affordability challenge is building”

Mandated by a 2024 bipartisan resolution from the General Assembly, the 93-page document was commissioned by utility regulators and conducted by consultants Great Plains Institute and Current Energy Group.

“Although Virginia electricity rates have historically been competitive and relatively low,” the authors write, ​“an affordability challenge is building and looms larger in the years ahead.” Virginians served by the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, may be hit particularly hard: the company predicts expenditures to grow a whopping 68% before decade’s end.

“Additional factors will determine the ultimate rates and total bills paid by customers,” the report says, ​“but in general, the forecasted increase in capital expenditures will be directly borne by customers as a commensurate increase to their electricity bill.”

The problem isn’t so much the so-called ​“base rates,” the core per-kilowatt-hour charges that are heavily scrutinized by the utilities commission in exhaustive proceedings, the researchers suggest. Those are mostly stable for now and expected to creep up modestly.

Instead, the analysis shows bills are spiking largely because of a host of add-ons for natural-gas fuel and other expenses. These ​“riders” typically aren’t subjected to the same dissection from regulators and now make up more than half of the monthly electric costs for the average residential utility consumer.

Utilities often tout their relatively low base rates, said Kendl Kobbervig, advocacy and communications director for the nonprofit Clean Virginia. ​“But average customers do not pay rates. They pay bills — that’s what they’re getting in the mail every month.”

In Dominion territory in northern and eastern Virginia, rider prices jumped 27% between 2021 and 2024, according to the report. In the state’s southwest corner, Appalachian Power customers saw even steeper hikes of 63% in the same period, including an eye-popping doubling of fuel charges.

“Weekly, I hear from constituents about $250, $500, $1000, even $2000 monthly energy bills,” Delegate Sam Rasoul, a Democrat running for reelection in Roanoke, part of Appalachian Power territory, wrote on social media. ​“This is a nonpartisan issue — lower the damn bills!”

Indeed, Republican Delegate Jason Ballard, who represents a New River Valley district to the west, also cited the high cost of Appalachian Power bills online, writing, ​“Energy costs are one of the biggest burdens on Virginia families and we’ve been working hard to bring relief.”

Ballard touted an announcement from Appalachian Power that it will lower fuel costs by almost a quarter starting Nov. 1 — undoubted relief for customers who pay 100% of the utility’s expenses for coal, natural gas, and the like.

But analysts propose to change the rate rollercoaster for consumers by requiring Appalachian Power and Dominion to take on some portion of those fuel costs.

Under the current regime, ​“the utility doesn’t have an incentive to responsibly manage fuel — there’s no incentive for efficiency,” Kobbervig said. ​“It also means the utility doesn’t have an incentive to transition away from fuel-based resources to things like solar and wind.”

Like many of the proposals in the report, fuel-cost sharing would need a green light from the General Assembly to move forward. Promoting it is a key legislative priority for Clean Virginia.

“That is directly at the nexus of clean energy and affordability policy,” Kobbervig said.

“A strong path to pursue immediately”

Fuel costs aren’t the only pass-throughs that researchers recommend constraining. Other riders, aka rate-adjustment clauses, are getting out of hand, the authors say, especially for Dominion Energy. And unlike fuel costs, utilities tend to earn a profit on these rider expenses, such as the cost of building renewable energy to comply with the state’s 2020 decarbonization law.

“This creates a ​‘best of both worlds’ scenario for utility cost recovery and earning,” the analysis says, in which utilities can pass on expenses with less regulatory examination and still earn a profit on them.

While the legislature reduced the number of rate-adjustment clauses in 2023, the study concludes that further refinement is needed. ​“Significant improvement opportunities remain,” the authors write.

To restrain costs in the face of unprecedented demand growth, analysts also suggest a new paradigm for building power plants. Currently, the process is utility-led and technology specific: Dominion proposes set amounts of gas-fired plants, solar farms, and other energy sources to supply electricity to data centers and other customers in its long-term plans, followed up by permit applications for certain plants.

For instance, the report notes, in Dominion’s bid to build the controversial Chesterfield gas complex outside of Richmond, it expressly stated that ​“solar wind, and energy storage resources will not be considered.”

In the proposed paradigm, called ​“all-source competitive procurement,” the utility would ask for bids from a variety of different power producers to fulfill a specific need, then select the cheapest proposal that also ensures reliability.

“Virginia will likely need to add significant new generation and capacity in the years ahead to address growing load forecasts and support economic development in the state,” the report says. ​“Such resource additions, however, should not come at the expense of ratepayer affordability.”

“Utilities are not always incentivized to prioritize operational solutions like energy efficiency or cheaper energy alternatives,” said Kajsa Foskey, director of the Virginia Energy Consumer Alliance. ​“The recommendations around competitive all-source procurement would be a strong path to pursue immediately” in the General Assembly, she said.

A one-time legislative aide in the House of Delegates, Foskey believes the new blueprint will be vital in educating part-time lawmakers who meet for only two months next year, starting in mid-January, so that they can hit the ground running.

Politicians and members of the community gathered for the ceremony at the site of the data center, on the Energy Way Industrial Park.

The cloud and e-commerce giant announced its plan for a $10 billion investment in digital infrastructure in North Carolina earlier this year, without going into specifics of the project.

It is expected that the data center campus will feature up to 20 buildings at full build-out, each of which is likely to span more than 200,000 sq ft (18,580 sqm).

The data center will be located near the Sherwood H Smith Jr energy complex, a power plant operated by Duke Energy producing more than 2.24GW of output via natural gas turbines. It has not been revealed how the data center will be powered, what its eventual capacity will be, or when it might open.

Amazon has promised the development will create 500 permanent jobs.

(AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.
Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply.
But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn’t buy an EV. That’s significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That’s a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans’ anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that’s long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut’s state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He’s taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

Selected remarks from the discussion:

Vernice Miller-Travis: “People live where they live…not because they chose to live there, but because they were forced to live there. And many of those places were ecologically vulnerable from the beginning…. The places that were vulnerable to begin with, of course, are going to be even more vulnerable from the threats of climate change…. So the vulnerability is not accidental. It’s just like what we found in toxic waste and race. It is by design. And if you want to unpack that, if you want to make communities safer, you’ve got to go back to the source. And the source is residential segregation.”

Abre’ Conner: “What the future of this work needs to look like is having folks who are doing work in policy, advocacy, mobilization, research in academia, or traditional organizers and activists…. Communications, for sure, has been a major factor in how we’ve been able to shift the narrative…by highlighting this in the media and shaming a lot of these tech companies for what they’re doing, but [we need] to have all of those components working together in an intersectional way to amplify that we’re going to put up a united front.”",https://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/OHO_Environmental_Justice_Initiative_Launch_02.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:59:58.978646

Instead, traditional energy storage systems are stepping up, delivering real, high-impact resilience across US grids right now.
Charting a resilient energy future The Iberian blackout serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern power grids.
This transformation requires a diversified approach that builds on proven technologies like battery energy storage systems and taps into underutilised assets like hydropower to provide dependable, dispatchable support.","On April 28, 2025, the sudden and massive blackout that plunged Spain and Portugal into darkness disrupted daily life across the Iberian Peninsula, as within five seconds, the region lost approximately 15GW of power, accounting for about 60% of its electricity supply.

This rapid cascade was triggered by voltage surges and inadequate grid planning, leading to a chain reaction of disconnections that overwhelmed its systems. The April 28 blackout across Spain and Portugal sent more than just homes into darkness; it sent a warning to grid operators around the world.

As electricity demand spikes and renewable integration accelerates, the risks of poorly coordinated infrastructure grow. For the US, this wasn’t just someone else’s crisis: it was a glimpse into what could happen without more agile, flexible and resilient grid solutions. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the liabilities inherent in modern power grids, especially as nations accelerate the integration of various energy sources and energy demand skyrockets. This was a clear signal: waiting until the lights go out isn’t a plan.

While growing energy demand affects both the US and European power grids, their underlying structures highlight important differences. In the European Union, grids like those in Spain and Portugal are centrally managed by national operators and aligned under EU-wide standards. This coordination helps with planning but can also create shared vulnerabilities, as seen in the Iberian blackout.

The stark contrast between Europe’s centralised grid and America’s patchwork of regional systems isn’t just a policy quirk—it’s the difference between a blackout that cascades across nations and one that’s isolated to a single state.

— Barrett Bilotta, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Agilitas Energy

The US, by contrast, runs a patchwork of three major interconnections - Eastern, Western and Texas (ERCOT) - each with distinct rules and authorities. While this fragmentation can prevent one region’s failure from toppling another, it also makes coordination harder.

The stark contrast between Europe’s centralised grid and America’s patchwork of regional systems isn’t just a policy quirk: it’s the difference between a blackout that cascades across nations and one that’s isolated to a single state. Spain’s recent grid failure showed how rapidly disruption can spread when systems lack flexibility and rapid-response tools.

In the US, we face a different risk: fragmentation that slows coordination and modernization. Here we’ll explore what the Iberian blackout revealed about grid resilience and make the case for why the US must double down on technologies and planning strategies that respond faster, recover smarter and prevent small disruptions from becoming national crises.

Report reveals timeline of Iberia blackout catastrophe

UK grid is resilient to Iberia-style blackout says NESO report

Foundation for resilience

Spain’s blackout revealed how quickly a highly centralised grid can spiral out of control. When one part fails, the rest often follows. In contrast, the US grid, divided into those three interconnections, limits that kind of cascading failure. But it brings its own challenges.

Regionalisation gives US regions autonomy and room to innovate, yet it also leads to fragmented oversight, inconsistent investment and slower modernisation. No single authority manages national planning, which makes coordinating upgrades and integrating renewables harder. Texas, in particular, with its famously independent grid, remains largely cut off from other states. As Winter Storm Uri proved in 2021, this isolation can be devastating when local generation falters.

Ultimately, neither model offers a perfect blueprint. Europe’s centralised approach enables more seamless renewable integration and cross-border coordination but amplifies the risk of widespread disruption. The US, while insulated from cascading failures, faces persistent challenges due to its distributed planning and regulatory landscape.

Strengthening grid resilience will require a hybrid approach—one that enhances coordination and planning across regions without undermining the flexibility and innovation that decentralised systems can provide.

Harnessing technology

The Iberian and Winter Storm Uri blackouts serve as cautionary tales, highlighting the need for proactive measures to enhance grid resilience. In the US, addressing similar vulnerabilities requires a multifaceted approach that leverages advanced technologies to manage increasing energy demands and the integration of renewable sources.

Distributed energy storage systems emerge as a critical solution in this strategy. By providing rapid-response capabilities, these systems can effectively balance supply and demand fluctuations, mitigating the risk of widespread outages. These systems are particularly adept at addressing the intermittency of renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which can cause sudden drops in power generation.

Deployed at the front-of-the-meter, these systems also deliver fast frequency response, responding within milliseconds to seconds to arrest frequency deviations during potential disturbances. Put simply, storage brings persistency to intermittent power sources.

Complementing storage, AI offers transformative potential in grid operations. AI-driven predictive dispatch strategies enable more accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply, facilitating real-time adjustments to maintain grid stability. For instance, AI algorithms can analyse vast datasets, including weather patterns and consumption trends, to optimise minute-to-minute energy distribution and preemptively address potential disruptions.

This proactive approach enhances the grid’s adaptability to dynamic conditions, reducing the likelihood of failures akin to the Iberian blackout. These tools are already being piloted in US markets, helping grid operators monitor real-time supply and demand balances and isolate faults faster than human teams ever could on their own.

These systems aren’t just about energy arbitrage; they promise to deliver the sustained support that renewables alone can’t provide during prolonged lulls or cascading failures.

— Barrett Bilotta, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Agilitas Energy

Yet, even as AI and fast-response systems tighten grid operations by the minute, significant gaps remain in bridging extended periods of low renewable output. A key part of the solution lies not just in technology deployment, but in accelerating deployment pathways.

Project delays driven by congested interconnection queues mean storage and energy projects sit idle for years, wasting both time and grid resilience benefits. Yet real momentum is emerging. Recently, Google and PJM announced that they are deploying AI-enhanced planning tools to streamline PJM’s interconnection process and cut completion times for new service requests.

AI scaling already helped PJM process 140GW of applications and aims to shrink interconnection timelines from over 40 months down to just 1–2 years by 2026. That matters because every month shaved off the queue means faster dispatch of batteries and renewables, improved outage prevention and real-world resilience instead of theory.

By pairing rapid-acting storage and smart dispatch with faster interconnection pathways, operators can ensure resilience is not only possible but deployable when and where it’s needed.

Long duration storage

Spain’s blackout exposed a critical gap: even fast-response storage and renewable generation can’t maintain grid stability over prolonged disruption. Long-duration energy Storage (LDES) systems, capable of 10+ hour discharge, could potentially address that gap. These systems aren’t just about energy arbitrage; they promise to deliver the sustained support that renewables alone can’t provide during prolonged lulls or cascading failures. These are often touted as a linchpin for deep renewable integration. But the realities of the landscape require adjustments to policies and timelines.

While LDES technologies are demonstrably viable, market and economic signals lag behind. First, most US wholesale and capacity markets only reward storage that lasts a few hours, not days. This leaves LDES undercompensated for the developers who would otherwise build them, despite the technology’s ability to bridge prolonged renewable gaps.

Second, the lack of steady, duration-based revenue means that LDES often sits idle unless governments incentivise it or markets are reformed. Third, CapEx is high and financing is complex. These systems often require specific siting or geological conditions and are significantly costlier compared to the more common short-duration battery storage assets in operation today.

Instead, traditional energy storage systems are stepping up, delivering real, high-impact resilience across US grids right now. These systems are scaling fast: utility-scale battery storage saw a record 10.3 GW added in 2024 and is on track for an even bigger leap of 18.2 GW in 2025 and is projected to reach up to a total of 65 GW by the end of 2026. This surge signals a new era of fast-acting resilience and trust that storage systems can deploy quickly, shore up grid stability under pressure and unlock tangible value across energy markets.

But batteries can only go so far. When disruptions stretch longer or inertia is needed to arrest frequency swings, hydropower can step in.

Hydropower for resilience

Hydropower’s enduring reliability is why it remains a vital complement to storage-based resilience tools. For decades, hydropower has quietly anchored power grids, offering reliable, stable generation and fast-response flexibility crucial for preventing blackouts. Its spinning generators supply mechanical inertia that helps maintain grid frequency during disturbances and can ramp output in seconds to minutes, much like distributed energy storage systems, making it a powerful tool for restoring balance when other sources are unable.

Recent analysis underscores why this matters: during the Iberian blackout, hydropower plants’ self-start capability and rapid output ramping enabled system operators to restore power to the grid, a real-world demonstration of hydropower’s crisis resilience.

In the US, hydropower projects remain vital resilience tools. Reservoir-based operators can sustain full output for hours or even weeks, aiding long-duration grid balancing during low-renewable periods. As the grid weathers more heatwaves, storms and variable renewable patterns, hydropower’s controllable output and long operational life make it a natural complement to solar and battery energy storage, offering reliability and stability. Growing international investment in modernising hydropower through AI incorporation, retrofits and small modular systems further highlights its evolving role in next-generation grid architecture.

Charting a resilient energy future

The Iberian blackout serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern power grids. For the United States, this event underscores the urgency of reimagining grid infrastructure to enhance resilience, flexibility and real-time adaptability.

This transformation requires a diversified approach that builds on proven technologies like battery energy storage systems and taps into underutilised assets like hydropower to provide dependable, dispatchable support. As more renewable energy comes online, grid operators and developers will need to look beyond capacity alone, prioritising systems that can react, recover and stabilize under pressure.

By learning from global grid failures and embracing a layered mix of technologies, the US can build a future-ready grid that’s not just about storing electrons but about supplying uninterrupted, system-wide stability whenever and wherever it is needed.

Wabash Valley Resources intends to pipe and inject 1.67 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce “low-carbon-intensity” anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant.

The gasifier will use coal and petroleum coke — an oil refining byproduct — as feedstock, according to a project summary.

The DOE’s loan was for $1.559 billion.

A panoply of political and business leaders celebrated the announcement, including Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

“Wabash Valley Resources is putting America first — transforming an idle fossil energy plant into a fertilizer engine that strengthens our farmers, bolsters energy independence, and revitalizes coal country,” he said. “This is the kind of vision and leadership we need to compete globally.”

The company’s CEO, Dan Williams, called the project “more than an investment.”

“It’s a new chapter for a world-class facility and the community that built it,” he said. The project is “restoring good-paying jobs and proving that rural Indiana can help lead America’s clean energy future.”

Williams also praised organized labor, “whose skill and professionalism will bring this vision to life.”

But groups of Hoosier landowners and other opponents denounced the project as a “scam.”

“It is shameful that this administration would hand out $1.5 billion to a privately owned, Korean-backed corporation during a shutdown when everyday people can’t receive basic government services and government employees go unpaid. That is not the American way,” Janet Cianteo, a member of the Concerned Citizens Against Wabash Valley Resources and Indiana Action Team.

Korean firms Hanwha Asset Management and Korea Investment Real Asset Management have invested in Wabash Valley Resources, and the Korean government has also been involved, according to the company’s news release.

“This company and its foreign partners will be hard pressed to ever have majority support in our community,” Cianteo said. “We are steadfast in our commitment to protecting Hoosier land and lives from this dangerous scheme.”

The Indiana Action Team is part of the Nebraska-based Bold Alliance, best known for its opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline extension.

“It is disgraceful that this project is being foisted on Hoosiers with the backing of our government and our public money,” said Emma Schmit, the Bold Alliance’s pipeline fighters director. “Enough is enough. We should not have to sacrifice our property rights or take on the risks of a proven-to-fail technology so Wabash Valley Resources’ investors can afford another private island.”

Ohioans and Environmental Organizations File Lawsuit Challenging Constitutionality of Air Pollution Amendment in State Budget

Columbus, OH — On Thursday, October 30th, the Ohio Environmental Council, Sierra Club, SOBE Concerned Citizens, Donna Ballinger, and the Freshwater Accountability Project filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Their complaint alleges that select sections of H.B. 96, Ohio’s state budget passed this summer, violate the One-Subject Rule of the Ohio Constitution.

The Ohio General Assembly snuck anti-environment provisions into H.B. 96 at the last minute that removed important protections for Ohioans who want to file complaints against polluters while taking away Ohioans’ ability to protect themselves using community air monitoring data. These statutory changes have no relationship to Ohio’s budget and thus violate the Ohio Constitution’s requirement that all legislation include only one subject.

Key Facts about the Unconstitutional Provisions

H.B. 96 created R.C. 3704.0310, which requires the Ohio EPA to repeal the Air Nuisance Rule provisions of its Clean Air Act State Implementation Plan.

The Air Nuisance Rule has historically provided an enforcement mechanism for Ohioans to hold polluters accountable for their nuisance pollution impacting fenceline communities.

H.B. 96 also amended R.C. 3704.01, among other provisions, prohibiting the Ohio EPA from relying on “community air monitoring,” data collected by community members using community air monitors installed throughout their community to protect them from air pollution.

Together, these provisions form the Air Pollution Amendment to H.B. 96, which does not include any appropriations or language relevant to Ohio’s state budget.

Counsel from the Case Western Reserve University Environmental Law Clinic, AltmanNewman, Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services, and the Ohio Environmental Council represent the parties.

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Neil Waggoner, Midwest Beyond Coal Campaign Manager for the Sierra Club:

“Ohio’s Air Nuisance Rule has been a critical tool for the public to hold polluters accountable for decades. There has been strong opposition to efforts to roll this rule back for years, which might be part of the reason why the legislature snuck it into the budget bill and conducted no public debate on their scheme. The legislature’s action was not just a violation of the single subject rule; it’s a violation of the public trust and seeks to further violate our rights to take action to protect our communities from polluters.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Fair Shake Environmental Legal Services:

“At Fair Shake, we believe that everyone should have the right to make decisions about the air, water, and land where they live. This unconstitutional attack attempts to strip Ohioans of their ability to hold polluters accountable through public monitoring and the courts. That is why we are proud to join this lawsuit alongside the Case Western Environmental Law Clinic, the Ohio Environmental Council, and Altman Newman.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Leatra Harper on behalf of Freshwater Accountability:

“At the behest of industry, the Ohio legislature took away the Air Nuisance Rule that has been available for over fifty years to residents seeking protection from harmful air pollution. The people need this rule, and its removal harms the ability of everyday Ohioans to protect themselves from toxic air pollution. This is another example of some legislators in Ohio caring more about protecting polluters than protecting Ohioans.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Lynn Anderson on behalf of SOBE Concerned Citizens:

“The Ohio legislature needs to provide stronger protections for the citizens of Ohio against toxic air pollution in the form of stricter regulation, monitoring, and remediation. By taking away the Air Nuisance Rule and community monitoring provisions, however, they are weakening our existing protections and leaving Ohio communities harmed by toxic air pollution behind.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Dave Altman of AltmanNewman Co. LPA:

“If this illegal action by the State is not corrected, you will still be free to defend your property with firearms, but not with air monitors.”

The following quote can be attributed, in whole or in part, to Chris Tavenor, General Counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council (OEC):

“The Ohio General Assembly has once again violated the Ohio Constitution by slipping substantive provisions into its budget bill that have nothing to do with the state budget. This action, on its own, needs to be called out as unconstitutional. But the impact it has on Ohioans seeking to protect their communities from air pollution is just as harmful. The General Assembly should be applauding Ohioans who gather data about air pollution and use it to hold polluters accountable, rather than punishing them.”

As world leaders prepare to convene at next month’s COP30 climate summit, the solar power industry has surged far beyond expectations, offering a rare note of progress amid persistent political rifts and uneven commitments to carbon reduction.

According to multiple analyses, there is now four times more installed solar capacity worldwide than experts in 2010 had projected for 2035. This unprecedented expansion has helped temper earlier fears of runaway global warming: temperature rise predictions once as high as 4°C by century’s end have now been revised down to around 2.6°C, driven in large part by renewable energy adoption and declining reliance on fossil fuels.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) describes this transformation as “the fastest energy technology deployment in history.” Once seen as an expensive alternative, solar is now the cheapest form of electricity in most parts of the world, spurring investment, reshaping power markets, and altering the geopolitical balance of energy dependence.

Yet even as the global picture brightens, momentum remains uneven. Nowhere is this contrast clearer than in the United States, where President Donald Trump’s administration has dismantled clean energy incentives, slashed subsidies, and tightened permitting rules, stalling the very progress that once positioned America at the forefront of the renewable revolution.

While US states such as California and Texas continue to see strong private-sector investment, national policy has turned sharply inward. Trump’s rollback of federal clean energy tax credits, combined with his administration’s expansion of oil and gas drilling, has left the country lagging behind China, the European Union, and India in new solar installations.

A backdrop of progress ahead of COP30

Next month, delegates will gather for the COP30 climate conference amid both hope and uncertainty. The boom in renewable energy particularly solar, provides a strong counterpoint to fears of climate inaction. Yet, even as countries like China, Britain and Australia announce ambitious climate targets, the European Union remains divided on its 2040 emission goals.

According to EU documents seen by Reuters, bloc members have failed to reach consensus on cutting emissions by 90% by 2040, with final negotiations expected just days before the summit. “We are walking a knife’s edge,” one EU diplomat said, warning that failure could weaken the EU’s climate leadership at COP30.

Europe’s divisions cloud its leadership claim

The EU’s inability to finalise its climate target highlights the growing tension between ambition and economic reality. Wealthier members such as Sweden and Spain back aggressive emission cuts, while others, notably Poland and Italy have voiced concerns that rapid decarbonisation could harm domestic industries.

A particularly divisive issue is the use of foreign carbon credits. France has proposed that countries be allowed to offset up to 5% of emissions using credits from developing nations, while Germany supports a stricter 3% cap. Poland has pushed for an even higher threshold, citing industrial competitiveness. A French proposal to include an “emergency brake”, allowing countries to ease their targets if forest carbon absorption underperforms has also divided opinion.

Global solar power gains but uneven momentum

Even as Europe wrestles with internal disagreements, solar power’s rise has tempered global pessimism on climate goals. According to WebProNews, solar capacity worldwide is expanding at a pace far beyond earlier expectations driven by lower costs, mass manufacturing in Asia, and breakthroughs in storage technologies.

However, this progress is uneven across regions. China leads the charge, accounting for more than half of global solar additions, followed by rapid growth in India, the EU, and parts of Latin America. By contrast, the United States has seen momentum stall sharply amid policy reversals under the Trump administration.

Trump’s rollback slows US transition

US support for solar has collapsed following President Donald Trump’s decision to scrap subsidies and roll back renewable energy incentives. New permitting rules have further complicated project approvals, creating uncertainty for investors. Analysts warn that this policy reversal could make the US one of the few major economies to fall short of its renewable capacity targets by 2030.

While states like California and New York continue to push aggressive clean energy mandates, the lack of federal coordination has left America lagging behind global peers. Industry experts say this slowdown threatens not just climate commitments but also energy security, as the world moves towards decentralised, renewable-driven grids.

Outlook: optimism, tempered by politics

The solar boom demonstrates what coordinated investment and innovation can achieve in a relatively short span. But political divisions, both within the EU and the US threaten to blunt the full potential of this transformation.

As COP30 approaches, the world faces a paradox: technological progress has outstripped expectations, yet political will remains fragmented. Whether the coming decade delivers on the promise of a renewable revolution may depend less on engineering breakthroughs and more on governments finding consensus to sustain the momentum already underway.

(AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle.

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

Fifty members of Congress, led by Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA), sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin Thursday to express strong support for the reallocation of 100% of the waived gallons from any granted SREs, and to urge the EPA to finalize the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) “Set 2” rule as quickly as possible.

“President Trump and his administration have done great work to lower prices at the pump for American families. A final, timely Set 2 rule that includes strong RVOs and necessary reallocation represents the most meaningful commitment to farmers and rural communities, homegrown American energy, and affordability for consumers,” said Rep. Feenstra.

The Renewable Fuels Association submitted comments today strongly urged EPA to reallocate 100 percent of exempted renewable fuel volumes, given the agency’s statutory obligation to ensure that finalized blending requirements are met. Additionally, RFA reiterated its position that EPA must prospectively reallocate exempted volumes anticipated for 2026 and 2027.

RFA expressed serious concern with the agency’s continued reliance on an outdated and flawed Department of Energy study to evaluate petitions for small refinery exemption, and emphasized that EPA should modernize its evaluation process for exemption petitions by using current market data, transparent metrics, and rigorous economic analysis when determining claims of “disproportionate economic hardship.” According to the association, doing so would help ensure a more level playing field across the refining sector and protect the integrity of the RFS program.

In its comments to EPA Friday, Clean Fuels Alliance America also urged the agency to adopt supplemental “SRE reallocation volumes” and updated estimates of exempted volumes for 2026 and 2027 representing 100% of all granted, pending, and expected exemptions for the 2023 – 2025 compliance years. Clean Fuels also asked the agency to be judicious in granting exemptions.

Published 7:20 am Friday, October 31, 2025

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

It’s impossible to ignore the headlines announcing another major company relocating to Texas or the census data showing a historic influx of new residents. This isn’t a fleeting trend; it’s a foundational economic shift drawing the nation’s center of gravity toward the Lone Star State. What are the underlying conditions causing this remarkable growth?

Think of it as diagnosing a thriving patient. You can see the outward signs of health, but to understand the prognosis, you must examine the vital systems working in concert. We need to look past the surface to see the anatomy of this business powerhouse.

What is Fueling This Unprecedented Growth Spurt?

Texas’s appeal stems from the “Texas Model,” a strategy built on low taxes, no state income tax, and simple regulations. This approach minimizes business friction, enabling reinvestment and innovation across sectors like energy, technology, manufacturing, and life sciences—attracting major companies such as Oracle and Tesla.

Why is the Texas Economy More Resilient Than People Think?

Today, technology, professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare contribute enormously to the state’s GDP, creating a well-diversified economic base. This strength is reinforced by targeted workforce initiatives. According to a study by UpperCutSEO, an Austin SEO company, one such program offers up to $1,800 per trainee to assist Texas public community and technical colleges to finance customized job training for local businesses.

Texas’s diversified economy acts like a balanced diet when one sector slows, others sustain growth, ensuring long-term economic stability and investor confidence.

How Does the State’s Infrastructure Support This Expansion?

A healthy body needs a strong skeleton and circulatory system to support its growth. Similarly, Texas’s economic vitality depends on its robust physical and human infrastructure. Here are the core components that enable this rapid expansion:

The Role of Logistics and Transportation

Texas’s central location gives businesses a powerful logistical edge. With highways, railways, airports, and major ports like Houston, companies can manage supply chains efficiently, cutting costs and shortening delivery times nationwide.

The Energy Sector’s Modern Evolution

Texas is not just an oil and gas titan; it’s also the nation’s leader in wind power generation. This dual-strength energy profile provides businesses with reliable, abundant, and increasingly sustainable power options. This versatility ensures operational stability and helps companies meet modern environmental standards.

Where are the Primary Hubs of Innovation Emerging?

Texas’s growth centers on the “Texas Triangle”: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio, each with unique strengths. DFW thrives in finance, Houston in energy and medicine, and Austin, known as “Silicon Hills,” drives global tech and venture capital expansion through its hyper-competitive digital market.

What Practical Steps Should Businesses Consider Before Relocating?

Expanding into Texas demands precision and planning. Each region offers distinct advantages, so assess which city’s talent, supply chain, and customer base align with your goals. While costs are lower, competition for specialized talent is fierce. Understanding wage trends and offering competitive packages ensures sustainable success.

Plan for a Pro-Growth Regulatory Environment

Take the time to understand local zoning laws, permitting processes, and tax incentive programs to ensure a smooth launch and capitalize on the opportunities available from day one. One such opportunity is the Texas Small Business Credit Initiative (TSBCI), which allocates $472 million to strengthen the state’s small business ecosystem. The State of Texas is actively monitoring updates from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to ensure optimal implementation of this initiative.

What Does the Future Hold for the Lone Star State?

Texas’s outlook remains strong, with major investments in future industries like aerospace, biotech, and life sciences shaping lasting growth. Yet challenges persist—power grid strain, congestion, and housing costs. How effectively Texas manages these pressures will define its next stage of sustainable development.

Frequently Asked Questions

Is the Texas economy still too dependent on oil prices?

No. While the energy sector remains important, technology, manufacturing, and professional services are now massive contributors to the state’s GDP. This diversification makes it far more stable and resilient to fluctuations in oil prices than in the past.

What is the biggest challenge for businesses moving to Texas?

The primary challenge is often the intense competition for talent in high-growth metro areas like Austin and Dallas. While the overall workforce is large, securing specialized skills requires a strong recruitment strategy and competitive compensation packages.

Is the low cost of living advantage in Texas disappearing?

While housing costs have risen sharply in major cities, the overall cost of living in Texas remains below that of other major economic hubs like California and New York",https://www.leaderpub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/whisk2-1024x617.png,N,,2025-10-31 12:09:12.364817

Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.","KENT, Conn. (AP) — For most Americans, there’s less reason than ever to worry about finding chargers to fuel up an electric vehicle. But charging worries remain a top hesitation for potential buyers, second only to sticker shock.

Those concerns linger even as fast chargers multiply. More than 12,000 have been added within a mile of U.S. highways and interstates just this year, an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows. That’s about a fifth of quick-charging ports now in operation.

Yet a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago finds about 4 in 10 of U.S. adults still point to range and charging time as “major” reasons they wouldn't buy an EV. That's significant considering only about 2 in 10 Americans say they would be “extremely” or “very” likely to make a new or used electric vehicle their next car purchase.

That's a perception Daphne Dixon, leader of a nonprofit that advocates for clean transportation, has been trying to fight. She has taken a coast-to-coast road trip in an EV each year since 2022. Always sporting hot pink and waving a bubblegum checkered race flag to match, Dixon posts snapshots of the charging experience along her 3,000-mile (4,828-kilometer) route, hoping to “bust” Americans' anxiety about range and charging.

Dixon said she has repeatedly found that “range anxiety is stuck in people’s heads,” even though the gap in price between gas and electric cars is closing and more chargers are being installed.

“A lot of people still fear that there’s not enough chargers, but what they’re not seeing is that chargers are being put in every single day,” she said.

Fast chargers expand, but worries remain

Traveling on Interstate 80, the longest American interstate, a driver will encounter few stretches that are more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from a fast charger, all the way from New York City to Des Moines. Out West, coverage is spottier. But the miles on I-80 covered by fast chargers has increased by 44% since 2021, the AP analysis found.

Drivers would have a similar experience on other major roads. Nearly 70% of the combined length of the 10 longest interstates is within 10 miles of a fast charger — up from about half just five years ago.

Installing fast chargers is considered critical to supporting EV adoption because they can refill a fully electric vehicle in 20 minutes to an hour. Compare that to home chargers, which often take four to 10 hours.

In Dixon’s home state of Connecticut, drivers still fret about charging. In the fall, Dixon takes a shorter trip along Route 7, a scenic drive full of river bends and antiques barns. Fast chargers are scarce along the route, as they still are in many rural parts of the U.S.

The only plug in Kent, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Norwalk, is an aging machine at town hall that's long been defunct, said Lynn Mellis Worthington, chair of the town’s sustainability team.

Connecticut's state government plans to use $1.3 million in federal funds to install eight fast-charging plugs at two stations in New Milford, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) down Route 7 from Kent. The Trump administration sought to cancel those federal funds earlier this year, before reinstating them in August after multiple states sued over the halt of the $5 billion program. Congress had approved the funds in 2021 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Mellis Worthington and her husband considered an EV when they replaced their 15-year-old Pontiac Vibe this year. She said prices for cars with enough range to make her husband feel comfortable with his commute were still too high. So despite her high hopes of going full electric, they went with a hybrid instead.

“Our next car will definitely be an EV,” she said.

Vehicle price still top barrier for buyers

While many are concerned about charging, price is still the reason U.S. adults most commonly gave when asked why they would not buy one, the AP-NORC/EPIC poll shows. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults said the high cost is “not a reason” for holding off on an EV purchase.

Electric vehicles held about 8% of the U.S. market share in 2024, up from 1.9% five years prior, according to data from Atlas Public Policy.

In the long run, owning an EV may be cheaper due to lower maintenance costs and the lower price of electricity compared to fuel in many places, said Daniel Wilkins, a policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy.

Still, “everyday Americans are focused more on the sticker price upfront,” he said.

And with federal incentives expiring at the end of September, the final bill for many prospective buyers has effectively increased by $7,500 for a new EV.

Electric vehicle advocates are quick to point out the average U.S. resident drives no more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) per day, according to AAA, well within the range modern EVs offer. Most electric vehicle owners, like Bloomfield resident Jim Warner and his wife, do the majority of their charging at home.

Warner has one EV and one plug-in hybrid vehicle. He's taken the EV, a Chevy Bolt with a roughly 250-mile (402 kilometer) range per charge, on a 400-mile (643-kilometer) trip to Maine twice since he bought it in 2022.

“The first trip, I turned the heat off. I made sure I drove 65,” Warner said. “The second time I just drove normally and had no problem.”

Accounting for 100% of the exemptions granted and expected is the only way to ensure that robust 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes will be met.""
The National Oilseed Processors Association called on the EPA to finalize the 2026-2027 volumes proposal.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Forty-nine members of Congress asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to reallocate 100% of biofuels gallons exempted from 2023-2025 to small-refinery exemptions from the Renewable Fuel Standard, as the public comment period on the agency's proposal ends on Friday.

In September the Trump administration launched the public comment period on a proposal to reallocate SRE gallons at a rate from zero, to 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%.

Biofuels groups in the past month have expressed support for reallocating all those gallons, estimated at around 2 billion gallons.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a group of 49 representatives and senators put their weight behind 100% reallocation and finalize the rule as ""quickly"" as possible.

""At a time when farm families and rural communities face tough markets and economic uncertainty, we appreciate EPA's recognition of the vital role American biofuels and agriculture play in lowering fuel prices and

advancing American energy dominance,"" the letter said.

""The proposed volumes in the Set 2 rule represent a meaningful commitment to supporting cheaper homegrown fuels, farm income and rural economies. These volumes matter not just to biofuel producers, but to the farmers who grow the corn, soybeans and other feedstocks that power this economy and to every American who enjoys lower prices at the pump because of biofuels. A strong RVO means stronger commodity prices, more stable markets and greater opportunity for rural America.""

The letter signed by 49 federal lawmakers was led by Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, who was joined by Reps. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill.; Brad Finstad, R-Minn., and Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Mich.; along with and Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.

""As EPA considers its supplemental proposal, we urge the agency to fully reallocate 100% of the waived gallons for compliance years 2023-2025,"" the lawmakers said.

""Without full restoration the benefits of the original proposal won't reach the farm gate or lower prices at the pump. Farmers and rural businesses will ultimately bear the brunt of weakened demand and lower prices. Congress created the RFS to boost biofuel use for the benefit of American families, the economy and our energy security. It is critical that the EPA follow the directive outlined in the RFS to issue timely and reflective RVOs. Every day the rule remains unfinished means uncertainty for producers and missed opportunities for rural communities.""

In comments to EPA on Friday, Clean Fuels Alliance America also called on the agency to reallocate 100% of SRE gallons.

""Clean Fuels appreciates EPA's acknowledgement that small-refinery exemptions will destroy demand for biomass-based diesel over the next several years by enabling refiners to avoid RFS obligations,"" Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement.

""Small-refinery exemptions should not come at the expense of clean fuel producers and farmers. Accounting for 100% of the exemptions granted and expected is the only way to ensure that robust 2026 and 2027 RFS volumes will be met.""

The Renewable Fuels Association also called for complete reallocation and expressed concern about the data used by EPA when considering SRE petitions.

""RFA appreciates EPA's recognition that a strong RFS is crucially important to rural America and we applaud the decision to return expired RINs to exempted refiners for RFS compliance years that are already closed,"" RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper said in a statement.

""However, it is critically important that EPA reallocate 100% of exempted volumes for compliance years that are still open and for future years and we remain deeply concerned about EPA's reliance on a 14-year-old department of energy study that no longer reflects the realities of today's energy and fuels markets. If EPA returns 'live' RINs to small refiners for their 2023-2025 exemptions and then fails to reallocate those volumes, the effects on RIN values and biofuel marketplace could be catastrophic.""

The National Oilseed Processors Association called on the EPA to finalize the 2026-2027 volumes proposal.

The group said in a news release that in a ""break from tradition"" NOPA submitted a single-page comment, a ""deliberate choice to emphasize that the time for further deliberation has passed and that swift action is urgently needed"" to provide market certainty for America's farmers, oilseed processors and renewable fuel producers.

""Our message to EPA is simple: finalize the rule now,"" said Devin Mogler, president and CEO of NOPA.

""Every day of delay adds more uncertainty for farmers and processors -- the EPA has already done an excellent job with a proposal that includes BBD volumes reflective of the industry's capacity and a half-RIN provision that prioritizes domestic feedstocks.""

Climate First President: 'These Notes provide the capital and flexibility to continue to invest in America's renewable energy independence'

Climate First Bancorp, the holding company for Climate First Bank and OneEthos, today announced it had completed a $30 million private placement offering of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes. Climate First Bancorp will use the net proceeds from the offering to continue the company's rapid national growth, especially in its residential solar financing business.

Piper Sandler & Co. served as sole placement agent for the Notes, which bear a fixed-rate interest of eight percent for the first five years and mature on November 1, 2035. Jack Greeley of Smith Mackinnon PA served as legal counsel to Climate First Bancorp and Alston & Bird, LLP served as placement agent's counsel to Piper Sandler & Co. EJF Capital, a global institutional alternative asset management firm, is a lead investor.

The new Notes come as Climate First Bank, the world's first FDIC-insured, values-based, digital-forward community bank founded to combat the climate crisis, announced that it had financed more than $60 million in residential solar deals in October alone - powered by its fintech arm OneEthos. October's total marked the bank's largest solar financing month ever, nearly double the amount financed in September.

The strong demand comes as the latest tax and spend package by Congress sunset residential solar tax credits at the end of the year.

'The strong demand for these Notes makes it clear that investments into America's renewable energy infrastructure - from residential and commercial solar and wind farms to battery energy storage - are only just beginning,' said Ken LaRoe, CEO of Climate First Bancorp. 'By fighting climate change, we aren't just on the right side of climate history moving forward, we are on the right side of the consumer and capital markets today.'

'With the Federal solar tax credits coming to an end, homeowners and installers across the country are racing to finalize deals. These Notes will not only help us support their work, but provide us with the capital and flexibility to invest in America's renewable energy independence,' said Lex Ford, President of Climate First Bancorp.

'Together, Climate First Bank and OneEthos offer the best, easiest-to-use solar platform on the market today - both for installers and homeowners,' said Marcio deOliveira, CEO of OneEthos. 'While other providers have stepped away from the industry, we are doubling down, investing in the people and technology that will make us a market leader for the next generation. That's critical in our fight against climate change.'

Additional Background on Climate First Bancorp's $30 Million Subordinated Notes

The Notes will initially bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.00% for the first five years, payable semi-annually in arrears, to be excluding November 1, 2030, at which time the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual floating rate equal to the then current three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 472 basis points, with interest during this period payable quarterly in arrears.

Climate First Bancorp may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after November 1, 2030, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon other specified events.

The Notes have been structured to qualify for Tier 2 capital for Climate First Bancorp for regulatory capital purposes.

RFA emphasized that EPA should modernize its evaluation process for exemption petitions by using current market data, transparent metrics, and rigorous economic analysis when determining claims of “disproportionate economic hardship.” According to the association, doing so would help ensure a more level playing field across the refining sector and protect the integrity of the RFS program.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/796/1000/EPA-Offices.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:27:43.970681

(TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) (“Ucore” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a non-binding Heads of Agreement (HoA) with Wyloo Gascoyne Pty Ltd (“Wyloo”) and Hastings Technology Metals Ltd (“Hastings”) to:

Establish a long-term supply pathway for Yangibana rare earth concentrate; and

Evaluate hydrometallurgical (“Hydromet”) processing options in the United States, with Louisiana as the priority location.

The HoA links Australian feedstock from the Yangibana Rare Earths and Niobium Project (Western Australia) with U.S. mid-stream processing and separation at Ucore’s Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) – aligning with Ucore’s objective to establish a North American, ex-China rare earth supply chain and leverage the critical materials frameworks amid unprecedented policy convergence with allied jurisdictions, notably the United States, Canada and Australia.

The HoA was signed at the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers Meeting. Left to Right: The Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources (Canada); Dr. Ahmad Hussein, Director of Government Relations (Ucore); Pat Ryan, Chairman and CEO (Ucore); Nanette Trask, CFO (Wyloo); Vince Catania, CEO (Hastings); The Hon Madeleine King MP, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia (Australia)

“This HoA represents another key step in building the mine-to-oxide pathway between allied nations,” stated Pat Ryan, P.Eng., Ucore’s Chairman and CEO. “By partnering with Wyloo and Hastings, we are securing potential feedstock for our Louisiana SMC and exploring U.S. Hydromet options that add flexibility and scale to our DoD-backed RapidSX™ separation program.“

Chief Executive Officer, Mr Vince Catania said: “We are delighted to partner with Ucore on this strategically significant HoA. This agreement represents a major step forward in de-risking the Yangibana Project by securing a pathway to a long-term offtake partner in the key North American market. More importantly, the joint evaluation of a downstream Hyrdromet plant in the US demonstrates the efforts by Wyloo, Ucore and Hastings to access the financing and commercial opportunities arising from the recently announced rare earth deal by the US and Australian governments to jointly support “ready to go” projects.“

Geoff Atkins, VP Business Development at Ucore, added: “Yangibana is one of the world’s most advanced, shovel-ready rare earth projects, with amongst the highest distributions of NdPr of any known deposit. This agreement is an important step in Ucore securing a fully aligned mine-to-oxide supply chain across trusted jurisdictions.”

Expanded Details on the HoA

Under the HoA, Wyloo and Hastings (through their 60:40 Yangibana Joint Venture) and Ucore will work collaboratively to advance a potential long-term offtake and Hydromet partnership.

Feedstock Framework: The HoA contemplates up to 37,000 tonnes per annum of Yangibana rare earth concentrate, sourced from the Stage 1 mine and beneficiation circuit of the Yangibana Project. Pricing is to be based on a per-DMT formula or fixed structure to be defined in the definitive offtake agreement.

U.S. Hydromet Evaluation: The parties will jointly complete a Gap Analysis and techno-economic assessment of a new Hydromet facility in Louisiana, or a qualified third-party U.S. facility, to convert concentrate into mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) suitable for downstream separation at Ucore’s SMC.

Strategic Alignment: The project supports the United States-Australia Framework for Securing of Supply in the Mining and Processing of Critical Minerals and Rare Earths (“U.S.-Australia Framework”) announced on October 20, 2025, which aims to build integrated supply chains across allied jurisdictions. The HoA directly responds to this initiative by linking Australian concentrate production with U.S. mid-stream processing and separation.

Timeline and Governance: The HoA is non-binding (except for clauses related to confidentiality and governing law, which is Australian), has a 24-month term, and may be extended by mutual consent.

Strategic Benefits

For Ucore: Anchors an allied feedstock source for Ucore’s DoD-funded Louisiana SMC, supporting commissioning in H2-2026 and establishing one of the first U.S. facilities capable of producing separated rare earth oxides at commercial scale.

For Wyloo and Hastings: Opens a U.S. downstream channel into the magnet materials market through a government-supported separation platform, strengthening financing and offtake options during the Yangibana Project’s ramp-up.

For Allied supply chains: Reinforces U.S.-Australia cooperation on critical minerals and expands ex-China sources of NdPr, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Tb, key to defense, EV, and clean energy manufacturing.

For Policy Makers: Demonstrates practical progress under the U.S.-Australia Framework through a tangible mine-to-oxide collaboration designed to deliver diversified, secure, and transparent rare earth supply chains.

Co-located with the 3rd edition of The Battery Show India (TBSI), the three-day event, from October 30 to November 1, 2025, brings together the world’s most influential voices in renewable energy under the theme “Decoding Pathways to Achieve Net Zero.”

Together, REI and TBSI form South Asia’s most comprehensive clean energy showcase—uniting global manufacturers, innovators, investors, and policymakers to advance sustainable technologies, boost cross-border collaboration, and accelerate the transition toward a carbon-neutral future. The inaugural session was attended by a distinguished lineup of leaders and dignitaries, including Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI; Debashish Das, Head, RE Nodal Agency, Government of Odisha; HRH Prince Narithipong Norodom of Cambodia; Dr Ewa Suwara, Deputy Head of Delegation, European Union to India; Dr Philipp Ackermann, Ambassador of Germany to India; Manu Srivastava, Additional Chief Secretary, Power and Renewable Energy Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh; Peter Hall, President, IMEA Region, Informa Markets; Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India; and Rajneesh Khattar, Senior Group Director, Informa Markets in India.

Manu Srivastava (IAS), Additional Chief Secretary, Government of Madhya Pradesh, emphasized that India’s renewable energy sector is now “a perfect intersection of innovation, economics, and sustainability.” He noted India’s success in achieving sub-₹3 per unit tariffs without subsidies and powering 65% of Delhi Metro’s daytime demand through renewables. Madhya Pradesh recently achieved ₹2.70 per unit (3 US cents) for solar-plus-storage power, setting a new global benchmark supported by partners such as the World Bank, IFC, ADB, and UC Berkeley. He highlighted the 440 MW solar-plus-storage project in Morena, which ensures 95% energy availability during peak hours, proving that stored solar power can be commercially viable and reliable.

Debashish Das, Head of the RE Nodal Agency, Government of Odisha, stated that the state is at a decisive point in its energy transition. Despite being a coal- and mineral-rich state contributing 25% of India’s coal reserves and 40% of its steel production, Odisha is committed to reducing emissions and expanding renewables under the Odisha Renewable Energy Policy. With initiatives such as floating solar projects across 2.25 lakh sq. km of reservoirs and pumped storage systems, the state aims to ensure affordable, accessible, and sustainable power while attracting international investment into its clean energy ecosystem.

Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, emphasized that India has already installed 127 GW of solar capacity and is on track toward 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030. She noted that government programs like the National Green Hydrogen Mission and Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for solar and battery manufacturing are building a strong domestic supply chain. “India’s solar potential is estimated at 10,800 GW,” she said, adding that agri-photovoltaic initiatives can spur rural growth while aligning industrial competitiveness with sustainability goals.

Dr Philipp Ackermann, German Ambassador to India, lauded the participation of 46 German companies at REI 2025, calling it a “powerful signal of Europe’s commitment to India’s green transition.” He reaffirmed Germany’s support through the Green and Sustainable Development Partnership (2022), highlighting collaborative initiatives such as the India-Germany Solar and Wind Energy Working Groups to boost manufacturing, mobilize green capital, and develop a skilled global workforce.

Dr Ewa Suwara, Deputy Head of Delegation, European Union to India, cited an ADB report forecasting a potential 24.7% GDP loss by 2070 due to climate change, stressing that “clean industries are not optional—they are essential.” She underscored the EU’s commitment to climate resilience and innovation through Indo-EU cooperation.

HRH Prince Narithipong Norodom of Cambodia praised India’s leadership in sustainability and expressed a desire to strengthen bilateral collaboration. “India has been a long-standing friend and partner to Cambodia,” he said. “Platforms like the Renewable Energy India Expo create opportunities for knowledge sharing and joint innovation that can power mutual growth.”

Yogesh Mudras, Managing Director, Informa Markets in India, noted that India’s renewable capacity has surpassed 250 GW in 2025 and is steadily advancing toward 500 GW by 2030. He highlighted the government’s ₹5,400 crore Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for 30 GWh Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), expected to attract ₹33,000 crore in investment by 2028. He added, “This year’s REI and TBSI—the largest editions yet—serve as a critical nexus for innovation, manufacturing, and sustainability dialogue.”

The 2025 edition of REI features over 700 exhibitors, 1,000 brands, and 250 thought leaders, drawing more than 35,000 visitors from across the world. Covering the full spectrum of renewable technologies—from solar PV and energy storage to wind, bioenergy, and EV infrastructure—the event facilitates partnerships, investments, and policy dialogue.

“Oracle is excited for Michigan to be the next site for our Stargate project with OpenAI.
Founded in 1972, privately-owned Related Companies has more than $70 billion in assets owned or under development.
The company launched its data center arm, Related Digital, earlier this year.
""Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.","It will be part of Stargate, OpenAI's sprawling project to invest $500bn in digital infrastructure over the next four years to support the firm's compute needs.

“We are proud to be developing this critical project exclusively for Oracle and contributing to keeping our nation competitive in the global AI race,” said Jeff T. Blau, CEO of Related Companies and chairman of Related Digital. “This historic, multi-billion-dollar investment will ensure that Michigan plays a leading role in developing the digital infrastructure American companies need.”

The 250-acre site – known as The Barn – will consist of three 550,000 sq ft (51,097 sqm) single-story buildings, and reportedly use a closed-loop cooling system to reduce water use.

Pending approval by the Michigan Public Service Commission, construction is set to start in early 2026. Walbridge is to serve as the general contractor on the project.

DTE Energy is supplying 100 percent of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment – financed entirely by the project.

Related first pitched plans for a large-scale data center campus in Saline Township back in August. At the time, the company was pitching a 575-acre project totaling 2.2 million sq ft (204,385 sqm) floorspace across five buildings. The company filed a lawsuit against the township after a rezoning request for the project was refused, which was settled earlier this month.

“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice president of industrial compute. “By expanding Stargate to Michigan, we can strengthen domestic supply chains, create good jobs, and help more communities share in the economic opportunities AI is creating. We’re proud to work with Oracle, Related Digital, DTE Energy, and other partners to bring this project to life in a way that benefits the local community.”

The companies noted the project is part of OpenAI and Oracle’s previously announced partnership to deliver 4.5GW of additional Stargate capacity.

“Oracle is excited for Michigan to be the next site for our Stargate project with OpenAI. Historically, Michigan has been at the forefront of innovation and industry in America, and this strong legacy will continue as we work with Related Digital to rapidly expand our cloud capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for AI,” said Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “Oracle’s highly performant, secure, and cost-effective AI infrastructure is powering advanced AI systems to help ensure the US maintains its leadership in technology innovation for generations to come.”

Stargate was launched by OpenAI in January, in partnership with SoftBank, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi's MGX. As well as the now-live project in Abilene, Texas, Stargate campuses are in development across the US in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and Port Washington, Wisconsin. Internationally, OpenAI has projects in the works across South Korea, Canada, the UK, Germany, Norway, and Argentina – with rumored projects possibly coming to Canada and India.

Founded in 1972, privately-owned Related Companies has more than $70 billion in assets owned or under development. Its investments include mixed-use, residential, retail, office, and hospitality developments. The company launched its data center arm, Related Digital, earlier this year.

As well as a 64MW project in Ontario, Canada, the company said its pipeline includes a 1GW 400-acre campus in Chicago, Illinois; a 500-acre, 1GW campus in Illinois; a 600-acre, 1.2GW site in Missouri; and a 115-acre, 250MW campus in Wyoming.

Saline Township, located outside Saline city, is located some 45 miles (72km) west of downtown Detroit. Despite not being a traditional data center hotspot, demand for data centers has pushed operators into the area. This includes Thor Equities, which has faced pushback from local officials after seeking to develop an 800-acre campus in Washtenaw County’s Augusta Township. Operators around Detroit include EdgeConneX, US Signal, Cogent, 365, Lumen, Verizon, and several local providers.

""Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,"" said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. “I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries. This investment from Oracle and Related Digital sends a simple message to anyone who wants to build the future—you can build it in Michigan.”",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Related_Digital.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-31 12:08:22.731617

Fortunately, Long Island elected officials in both parties have stepped up.
Not to mention, Long Islanders had ample opportunity to weigh in on the energy planning process, a clear understanding that local control is sacred to us on Long Island.
Republican representatives Andrew Garbarino and Nick Lalota have remained steadfast in their support for offshore wind at a time when it could have been politically convenient to abandon ship.
It is a practical bridge that ensures our communities have reliable, lower-carbon energy while offshore wind, community solar and utility scale battery energy storage scale up.","Long Island sits at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean; beautiful, vulnerable and exposed. We are in the heart of storm season, and do not have to dig deep to recall Superstorm Sandy, Tropical Storm Isaias and countless nor’easters that have ripped apart our shorelines, flooded basements and disrupted our lives. And yet, working people remain caught in the crossfire of political gamesmanship. How we power our economy is constantly presented as a choice between a clean environment and a strong economy. The reality is that we can and must have both.

Fortunately, Long Island elected officials in both parties have stepped up. Dan Panico, the Republican Brookhaven town supervisor, and Kathee Burke-Gonzalez the Democratic East Hampton town supervisor have allowed facts and information to guide their respective town’s policy making. They have done the hard work of connecting with residents, and holding education forums with independent experts to alleviate residents’ concerns. Suffolk County Executive Ed Romaine, a Republican, has continued to champion green initiatives such as Solar Up Suffolk, as well as offshore wind—both as supervisor and county executive—despite the political headwinds.

New York State recently held a series of public hearings on a draft energy plan put forward by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, which creates a path forward for an all-of-the-above energy strategy that combats climate change and creates good union jobs. Not to mention, Long Islanders had ample opportunity to weigh in on the energy planning process, a clear understanding that local control is sacred to us on Long Island. Republican representatives Andrew Garbarino and Nick Lalota have remained steadfast in their support for offshore wind at a time when it could have been politically convenient to abandon ship. Their advocacy undoubtedly protected projects that have created millions of work hours with good union wages, for Long Islanders across the region.

Therefore, we must not let bad faith actors reframe the energy discussion as a zero-sum game. We have clear evidence of a bipartisan understanding that Long Island’s energy system must withstand extreme weather, rising seas and arguably the most dangerous threat of our time, political chaos.

The Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) project fits squarely within that vision. It is a practical bridge that ensures our communities have reliable, lower-carbon energy while offshore wind, community solar and utility scale battery energy storage scale up. Natural gas delivered through modern infrastructure significantly reduces carbon emissions when compared with heating oil and coal, which still power too many older buildings and backup generators across Long Island and New York City.

Concurrently, NESE will create good-paying, union construction jobs with healthcare, apprenticeship training and the economic stability that lifts whole communities. These types of investments sustain local economies, support small businesses and allow workers to raise families. They also protect existing union jobs in industries that depend on safe, reliable energy delivery; from the proud members of IBEW Local 1049 who maintain the grid, to manufacturing and food-service employees who rely on stable heating and power to support their industries. Every step toward modernizing our energy network is a step toward securing those livelihoods and a cleaner future.

Critics sometimes suggest that supporting a project like NESE contradicts New York’s climate leadership. That is simply not true. We cannot power hospitals, schools and subways by limiting our generation options. The bridge to a clean-energy future must be built, literally, by working people. On Long Island, that means a need for massive infrastructure investment in transmission lines, offshore wind, utility scale battery energy storage, and yes, modern gas infrastructure that keeps homes warm and lights on while we lean in on proven utility scale renewable energy technologies.

Long Island’s labor movement is ready to lead. Our true north star must be the economic security of working families. Without them, there is no just transition and no sustainable future. We can confront climate change, strengthen our economy, and put people to work, all at once. The Northeast Supply Enhancement Project is not the end of our journey toward a cleaner world; it’s one necessary step on the way.",https://libn.com/files/2025/03/John-Durso2.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:27:28.843190

Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization.
To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.","FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — If there's agreement on anything in the two states with governor's races this year, it's that utility bills are a growing concern among voters.

One Virginia voter, Kim Wilson, lamented at a town hall recently that her electricity bill seems to go up every month, no matter how much she tries to mitigate the costs. She was drawn to the event in part by its title: “The energy bills are too damn high.”

“It’s way too high,” Wilson readily agreed.

In New Jersey, Herb Michitsch of Kenilworth said his electric bill has climbed to nearly $400 a month, or more than four times what it was when he and his wife moved into their home half a century ago.

“Something really has to be done,” Michitsch said.

That something must be done is pretty much where the agreement ends. It's what must be done that splits politicians back into rival camps.

Democratic candidates in the two states are far more likely to embrace clean energy options like wind and solar than their Republican opponents. The two states’ Republican nominees are more closely aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a “con job” and promotes more traditional energy sources like gas and coal. New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli has acknowledged that human-caused climate change is occurring, but he says Democrats have driven up costs with their clean energy push.

Which side voters land on in the off-year elections will give both parties plenty to consider in what feels destined to be an emerging economic issue heading into next year's midterm elections.

At a recent rally in New Jersey, Democratic state Sen. Vin Gopal made clear that he stood with Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill in support of her plans to lower costs. But Gopal acknowledged that the outcome could signal whether voters are ready to embrace the president’s approach or have simply grown weary of national politics.

“The whole country is watching what happens,” he said.

Technology drives up costs

The debate comes as people in the two states grapple with double-digit percentage increases in monthly electricity bills. The exploding costs are driven by soaring demand, particularly from data centers, and by the rapid onset of energy-intensive artificial intelligence technology.

In Virginia’s open race to succeed a term-limited GOP incumbent, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are at odds over the development of renewable energy sources.

Spanberger has laid out a plan to expand solar and wind production in underused locations, praising a wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. In a debate against her opponent, she also said she would “ensure that data centers pay their fair share” as costs rise. The state is home to the world’s largest data center market,

Republican Winsome Earle-Sears wasn't having it.

“That’s all she wants, is solar and wind,” Earle-Sears said of Spanberger at the debate. “Well, if you look outside, the sun isn’t shining and the breeze isn’t blowing, and then what, Abigail, what will you do?”

In New Jersey, where Ciattarelli's endorsement by Trump included recent social media posts praising his energy affordability plans, the GOP nominee blames rising costs on eight years of Democratic control of state government.

Ciattarelli says he would pull New Jersey out of a regional greenhouse gas trading bloc, which Democratic incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy reentered when he first took office in 2018.

“It’s been a failure,” Ciattarelli said at the final debate of the campaign. “Electricity is at an all-time high.”

He’s also come out as a strident opponent of wind energy off the state’s coast, an effort Democrats spearheaded under Murphy. A major offshore wind project ground to a halt when the Danish company overseeing it scrapped projects, citing supply chain problems and high interest rates.

At the center of Sherrill’s campaign promise on the issue is an executive order to freeze rates and build cheaper and cleaner power generation.

“I know my opponent laughs at it,” Sherrill said recently.

A growing concern among voters

The candidates’ focus on affordability and utility rates reflects an unease among voters. A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found electricity bills are a ""major” source of stress for 36% of U.S. adults, at a time when data center development for AI could further strain the power grid.

Perhaps that's why the statewide races have become something of an energy proxy battle in Virginia. Clean Virginia, a clean energy advocacy group that targets utility corruption, has backed all three Democratic candidates for statewide office in Virginia — a first for the organization. GOP statewide candidates, meanwhile, have accepted money from Dominion Energy, the largest electric utility in Virginia.

To further complicate an already complex issue: Virginia has passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which calls for utilities to sunset carbon energy production methods by 2045.

Republican House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, who represents the southwest edge of Virginia, had failed to alter part of the state's Clean Economy Act earlier this year. Kilgore, whose top donor is Dominion Energy, said in February: “If their bills go any higher, there are folks in my region that are not able to pay them now, they’re definitely not going to be able to pay them in the future.”

Evan Vaughn, executive director of MAREC Action, a group of Mid-Atlantic renewable energy developers, said candidates from both parties are in a tough spot because bringing down prices quickly will be difficult given broader market dynamics.

“Voters should look to which candidate they think can do the best to stabilize prices by bringing more generation online,” he said. “That’s really going to be the key to affordability.”

Michitsch, who’s backing Sherrill in the governor's race and said he would campaign for her, said her proposal shows she's willing to do something to address spiraling costs.

“We need to change,” he said. “And I think she is here to change things.”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/8d24ea2/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F3a%2Fd059c444ac4c48c2e9045196280b7e%2F2d1e242fffbd4d74ab663c4369c7de7dElection_2026_Redistricting_37610.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:01:12.621854

The purpose of this public notice is to solicit comments from the public regarding the work described below:

APPLICANT:

Metro Machine Corp. dba General Dynamics Nassco Norfolk

Attn: Paul Clifford

200 Ligon Street

Norfolk, VA 23523

AGENT:

Rebecca Francese - VHB

321 Cleveland Place

Virginia Beach, VA 23462

WATERWAY AND LOCATION: The project would affect waters of the United States and navigable waters of the United States associated with the Elizabeth River. The project/review area is located at 2 Harper Avenue, at the confluence of Scott Creek and the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Virginia.

PROPOSED WORK and PURPOSE: The applicant requests authorization to perform new (deepening and berth extension) and maintenance (future) dredging of the Metro Machine Corp-Nassco Norfolk-Harper berthing areas (Pier 1 North and South, Pier 2 North and South) and the widener (total dredge area: 1,045,350 SF/24.00 acres) to the maximum depths ranging from -27 ft MLLW (widener) to -38 ft MLLW (Piers 1 & 2). The proposed dredging would remove approximately 213,775 cy (and approximately 100,000 cy every 5 years) and would be either hydraulically dredged and pumped directly to CIDDMA, or mechanically dredged and barged to the Rehandling Basin, Shirley Plantation, and/or Dominion.

AVOIDANCE AND MINIMIZATION: The applicant has provided the following information in support of efforts to avoid and/or minimize impacts to the aquatic environment: The existing berth areas in the vicinity of Pier 1 and Pier 2 are currently permitted to -36 ft MLW, which means that they can only dredge to ~-34.0 ft to avoid overdepth violations. Due to the expansion projects in the federal channel, larger ships are calling at the facility and NASSCO Harper requires a minimum depth of -36 ft and larger berths in order to stay competitive in the ship repair industry. In order to reach a design depth of -36 ft – the permitted depth needs to be two feet deeper to avoid a dredging violation. There is also a small widener associated with the northern most berth at Pier 1. Originally the design included the widener to a depth of -38 ft as well – but since that area will primarily be used as a tug shelf and to allow a little more flexibility in maneuvering ships into the slip, the depth was reduced to -27 ft. When practicable, turbidity curtains and an environmental or enclosed bucket will be used during dredge to reduce turbidity and benthic impacts.

A copy of the joint permit application can be found on the Virginia Marine Resources Commission’s website (hyperlink).

COMPENSATORY MITIGATION:

The applicant has provided the following explanation why compensatory mitigation should not be required: Mitigation is not offered for this project, other than the dredging royalties to VMRC.

Buu Nygren, the leader of the Navajo Nation, posted a selfie on Facebook, beaming as he stood shoulder to shoulder with President Trump at the White House.

The U.S. president had just signed executive orders to promote coal production, and Mr. Nygren was thrilled: “The harmful policies of the past have unfairly targeted coal, but those tides are turning,” he wrote.

The angry Facebook comments rolled in: Mr. Nygren had betrayed his people and his support of coal would lead to the degradation of the land and water, they said.

But other voices surfaced, too. Stop complaining, they said. Coal meant jobs.

For decades, coal has been a divisive subject in the Navajo Nation, which spans portions of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. As an economic engine for the region, it provides well-paid jobs on the reservation, where nearly 40 percent of the residents live in poverty. But it has also used up water, polluted the air and raised health concerns.

As elsewhere, coal production and coal power generation has slowed over the years on the reservation, as companies pivoted to cheaper forms of energy, like natural gas, and Biden-era policies sought to elevate greener forms of energy, like wind and solar.

With Mr. Trump’s re-election, however, and his exhortations to “drill, baby, drill,” along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s calls to “mine, baby, mine,” coal supporters, including Mr. Nygren, see the potential to boost coal jobs — or at least slow their departure.

This growth is expected to be driven by jobs in solar, energy storage systems and low-carbon electricity imports as

Singapore commits to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050

.

The nation’s power sector accounts for about 40 per cent of emissions and efforts are under way to reduce the carbon footprint of this sector, such as by increasing solar capacity and importing clean electricity, among other things.

Speaking on the final day of the Singapore International Energy Week conference, Ms Gan said the power sector is expected to continue expanding and hiring in the coming decade.

“We are pivoting towards cleaner energy sources and we will need more people with new skills.”

This includes jobs such as solar panel design and asset performance engineers, and specialists working on the design, operation and maintenance of subsea interconnectors.

Nascent areas such as carbon capture and storage will present more opportunities, she said.

The data came from manpower and workforce planning surveys commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA).

Currently, Singapore’s power sector is dependent largely on natural gas, a fossil fuel, which is mainly piped in from its neighbours or imported from all over the world in liquified form.

As work is under way to explore cleaner energy forms, the Government has said that natural gas will continue to be a core part of Singapore’s energy mix.

EMA said in a statement on Oct 31 that the traditional power and gas workforce is expected to grow by about 13 per cent, or 800 workers, in the next 10 years.

This is driven by workforce growth in the electricity transmission and distribution, power generation and gas sub-sectors.

From 2022 to 2024, the power sector’s workforce grew by 4 per cent, or 310 workers, said Ms Gan. Professionals with technical expertise were especially in demand, she added, pointing to an increase of 180 engineers and 110 skilled technical officers among the number .

EMA said it will continue to collaborate with institutes of higher learning and industry partners to develop a skilled and future-ready workforce to drive the energy transition.

For example, the authority has partnered Ngee Ann Polytechnic on a revised curriculum for a diploma in electrical engineering. Separately, the Institute of Technical Education has introduced a new technical engineer diploma in electrical engineering.

EMA said it has refreshed its resources to highlight emerging trends, jobs and skill sets in demand across the energy sector. Such resources can help Singaporeans make more informed decisions on working in the sector .

Firms are also taking steps to strengthen its workforce by investing in them, Ms Gan noted.

For instance, Sembcorp Solar Singapore is partnering Singapore Polytechnic to upgrade the skill sets in the solar industry, with a goal to train up to 100 professionals by 2027.

Areas of focus include digital system design tools and the use of artificial intelligence-assisted remotely operated vehicles to inspect specific parts of floating solar farms.

At the same time, companies like SP Group is looking to maintain its underground electricity network through robotics and digitalisation, said Ms Gan.

Its maintenance team is training a robotic dog, which is equipped with video and thermal cameras, to make routine inspections safer and more efficient.

“We use robotics to help us in a safer and more sustainable way. It improves productivity as well and frees up the maintenance team so that humans can focus on higher-value work,” she said.

Mr Greg Brittian, director for Asia-Pacific at sustainability recruitment firm Acre, said that clean energy sector jobs will not only require technical expertise, but also people with the skills to be able to bridge technology, finance and strategy.

Besides rising demand for jobs like solar and grid engineers, carbon management specialists and energy data analysts, he said that there will also be a strong need for project managers and regional integration experts.

These roles can help advance cross-border grid connectivity across Asean as energy systems become increasingly interlinked, he said.

One challenge is for the workforce to keep pace as clean energy technologies evolve rapidly. Said Mr Brittian: “Singapore’s opportunity lies in its proven ability to respond quickly through collaboration between government, academia and industry.”

It will also be vital to retrain workers, especially those from adjacent sectors such as oil and gas, infrastructure or digital technology, and leverage their transferable skills for the clean energy sector, he added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/892a103d26a20c31bdc64b9c6f50dee871ca929fb890645ce1e13ca1140d310f,N,,2025-10-31 08:18:32.662975

• House Bill 4125: Unclear “increased costs” for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.
• House Bill 4126: Creation of the Nuclear and Hydrogen Education Grant Program Fund with unspecified associated costs or a revenue source.
This time, the bills passed out of the House Energy Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support.
These units are portable, reliable and will secure consistent and affordable energy production in even the most remote corners of the U.P.”","(The Center Square) – The Republican-led Michigan House has passed a bipartisan bill package looking to encourage the use of nuclear energy in the state.

This will be done largely via tax incentives and taxpayer-funded grants.

The plan was first proposed by State Rep. Jamie Thompson, R-Brownstown. She hailed its passage as a great victory for Michigan and its citizens.

“Our state has long had significant manufacturing prowess, and these bills would create jobs and opportunity in the energy sector,” Bierlein said. “As this evolving technology continues to come online, job providers are going to be looking to states that have the proper foundation in place – with operational know-how, a workforce and adequate facilities – to accommodate production. Through these bills, we can assemble that foundation.”

House Bills 4124-29 lay out a number of different corporate tax credits –specifically for small modular nuclear reactors – education grant programs and employment incentives.

House Democrats have also expressed support for the plan, with some even sponsoring or joining as co-sponsors. They argued its passage will establish Michigan as a leader in “clean, reliable energy technology.”

“This package will help advance nuclear technology and build the talent pipeline that will power Michigan’s energy future,” said state Rep. Joey Andrews, D-St. Joseph. Andrews sponsored one of the bills. “By creating educational opportunities in the nuclear and hydrogen energy fields and providing pathways for students to stay, grow and build their careers right here at home, we’re positioning Michigan at the forefront of energy innovation and workforce development, securing a prosperous future for our state.”

According to fiscal analyses conducted by the state in the spring, the bills would cost the taxpayers an estimated:

• House Bill 4124: A drop in state revenue by about $2.5 million annually starting in 2026.

• House Bill 4125: Unclear “increased costs” for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.

• House Bill 4126: Creation of the Nuclear and Hydrogen Education Grant Program Fund with unspecified associated costs or a revenue source.

• House Bill 4127: No fiscal impact.

• House Bill 4128: An “indeterminate” loss in state revenue. The bill would prohibit a taxpayer from claiming a credit for more than 10 years and limit the total credit claimed for an individual taxpayer to $10 million.

• House Bill 4129: Unclear “increased costs” for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Creation of the Nuclear and Hydrogen Graduate Attraction and Retention Program Fund with unspecified associated costs or a revenue source.

This is the second time the six-bill package was introduced, after it stalled in the legislature last year.

This time, the bills passed out of the House Energy Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. On Tuesday, they also passed the House. They have now been referred to the Senate for consideration in its Energy and Environment Committee.

Multiple environmental groups have expressed concern with the bills. The Michigan Chapter of the Sierra Club is one of those. It submitted testimony in March expressing its opposition to the bill package.

“While proponents claim small modular nuclear reactors are a clean and innovative energy solution, the reality is that they are an expensive, unproven technology that diverts critical public funds away from more cost-effective and immediately available renewable energy options,” said Tim Minotas, Sierra deputy legislative and political director. “Rather than subsidizing an industry with an uncertain future, our state should invest in proven, rapidly deployable clean energy sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, and battery storage.”

Supporters of the legislation said that these incentives will help advance nuclear and hydrogen energy as the next generation of energy for Michigan. Some even say it could be Michigan’s “only” energy option moving forward.

“In the U.P., small modular reactors are our most likely pathway forward,” said state Rep. Dave Prestin, R-Cedar River. “With the ridiculous new green energy mandates—which will never work—being forced here in Michigan, paired with the unreliability and astronomical expenses associated with wind and solar energy production, unique production methods like SMRs will be our only option. These units are portable, reliable and will secure consistent and affordable energy production in even the most remote corners of the U.P.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/e5/1e52a505-80cc-4bd4-a1bb-b78c546b28b1/68dc300cf33d8.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:05:58.230220

Introduction

When I joined the hydropower community five years ago, the conversation around clean energy was very different. The focus was on how quickly renewables could grow to deliver net zero. Now, as the International Hydropower Association (IHA) marks its 30th anniversary, the focus is about how we keep energy systems secure, reliable and resilient as they transform.

Two recent publications have captured that shift for me: the IEA’s Renewables 2025 report and with that, their Executive Director, Fatih Birol’s renewed call for the world to stop treating hydropower as 'the forgotten giant of electricity.' Both point to the same reality: the clean-energy transition is accelerating - but speed alone is not enough. Only hydropower provides security and stability at scale.

From growth to security

The IEA Renewables 2025 report marks a turning point. It shows that global renewable capacity is set to nearly double between 2023 and 2028, meeting over 95% of power expansion worldwide. An expansion at this speed and scale raises the critical question: can power systems built for stability adapt to rapid change?

Hydropower, the established, stable and proven technology, doesn’t just generate clean, green electricity; it underpins energy security. It provides long-duration storage and grid stability through inertia, voltage control and black-start capability. It’s also largely a domestic resource built to last for generations and one of the few clean technologies that strengthens energy security on every front.

Most importantly, it will continue to do so in the future. The 2025 World Hydropower Outlook shows that in 2024, global hydropower generation rose 10% to 4,578 TWh, despite droughts in several regions. Installed capacity reached 1,443 GW, including 189 GW of pumped storage — more than 90% of the world’s energy storage. And another 600 GW of pumped storage is in development.

In other words, the backbone of the renewable grid already exists. The challenge now is to strengthen it.

Modernising the foundation

As Fatih Birol reminds us, hydropower provides a tried and tested foundation for the energy transition. We must cherish it.

Cherishing has practical implications because around 40% of the world’s hydropower plants are now over 40 years old. To turn 40 years assets into even more productive forever assets, they need reinvestment and modernisation, to support the variable renewable energies that are coming online rapidly.

Resilience in action

What is needed is a change in how we collectively look at grids. We need to reframe our focus from generation output to flexible systems that tolerate intermittent influxes. Hydropower can provide this security.

Solar and wind power provide essential energy, but they depend on the weather. Batteries can bridge short gaps but are measured in hours. Hydropower, by contrast, can respond instantly, sustain that response for weeks, and store energy across seasons. It is the technology that keeps renewable systems stable and keeps our lights on.

Furthermore, it is not reliant on long, complicated supply chains. Water and elevation is available in almost every country. Concrete is easy to produce and the turbine market buoyant.

Energy security for people

In many regions, decentralised hydropower remains one of the most practical ways to provide clean, reliable power to off-grid communities.

When done sustainably, hydropower of any scale builds jobs, skills and local resilience. That is why at IHA we always go back to the San José Declaration on Sustainable Hydropower: “sustainable hydropower is a clean, green, modern and affordable solution to climate change. Going forward, the only acceptable hydropower is sustainable hydropower”. For us, energy security and sustainability are inseparable.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

FERC and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. released a report the same year finding that natural gas-fired units represented 58% of all generating units experiencing unplanned outages and other issues at that time. Wind made up 27%, coal made up 6%, and solar made up 2%.

“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said. “They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/ad4fbd2/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F63%2F179975d947c3bd49ff759c5d1216%2Fgettyimages-1303397752.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:18:05.917282

Report author and Environmental Integrity Project research manager Alexandra Shaykevich spoke at a press event about the “terrible compliance record” for the LNG industry, noting that Southwest Louisiana facilities in particular have been in “nearly continuous” violation of the Clean Air Act for the past three years.

Venture Global and Cameron LNG did not respond to requests for comment on the report. Cheniere Energy had no comment.

Cameron Parish resident John Allaire lives within 30 miles of the three LNG facilities highlighted in the report – and six more that are planned or under construction.

“I live in the eye of this LNG hurricane,” Allaire said at a news conference this week announcing the report’s release.

Allaire’s home sits close enough to the Venture Global facility for him to see fiery plumes of methane flares from his patio. The Commonwealth LNG facility is planned 750 feet away from his property line, he said.

“I’m surrounded on all sides,” he said. “It’s not the same coastal wetland estuary that it used to be.”

While each terminal provided varying explanations for its violations, Shaykevich said, common ones include:

failure to report excess emissions and permit deviations to state regulators;

exceeding allowed pollution limits for contaminants such as nitrous oxide, volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide; and

failure to properly operate equipment meant to control pollution levels.

Cameron LNG’s Clean Air Act violations included at least 89 instances of excess pollution that released thousands of pounds of benzine, a known carcinogen, from the facility into the surrounding environment, according to the report’s analysis of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality records.

“We need these companies to actually be good neighbors and not to continue causing suffering in the communities in which they operate,” said James Hiatt, director of local nonprofit For a Better Bayou at the news conference.

Each of the three facilities had only two air enforcement actions opened from LDEQ, according to the report. Cheniere Energy had paid $225,000 in fines as of July 29, when state records were analyzed, for air quality violations. Financial penalties hadn’t yet been finalized for the other two facilities before the Environmental Integrity Project published its report.

The report also included tallies of Clean Water Act violations for LNG terminals in Southwest Louisiana. Sabine Pass was out of compliance with the act’s standards for 8 of the past 12 quarters. Cameron LNG had violations in seven quarters, and Calcasieu had just one quarter with water-related infractions.

Cameron LNG had 27 effluent violations from July 2020 through June 2025. Sabine Pass had nine and Calcasieu Pass recorded one over the same period, according to the report’s analysis. The violations at Cameron LNG and Sabine Pass involved fecal coliform and suspended solids, such as algae, bacteria and industrial particles. The lone issue at Calcalsieu Pass involved only suspended solids.

Shaykevich said the pattern of permit violations for existing facilities should be a factor in approving new facilities as the LNG industry continues its rapid expansion.

“President Trump has aggressively promoted the liquefied natural gas industry, including by directing agencies to fast track certain approvals for LNG projects,” he said. “State and federal agencies should be slowing down and more carefully scrutinizing new applications for LNG export projects instead of speeding up permit reviews.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/louisiana_illuminator_articles_680/f7401521e7d212c75db134daac575531,N,,2025-10-31 09:17:28.113432

The initiative, led by Wabash Valley Resources (WVR), aims to bolster domestic fertilizer supply while cutting emissions at scale.

WVR recently secured a $1.559 billion US Department of Energy (DOE) loan, part of a federal effort to strengthen US energy independence by modernizing legacy industrial assets. The funding will support the restart and expansion of a former gasification plant in West Terre Haute, transforming it into a major producer of hydrogen-derived anhydrous ammonia.

At full capacity, the facility is expected to generate 500,000 metric tons of ammonia per year, helping meet agricultural demand across the Midwest. WVR projects the plant could replace half of current fertilizer imports for farmers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and surrounding states, potentially easing price volatility in the region.

Large-Scale Carbon Capture for US Agriculture

Central to the project is Honeywell’s Advanced Solvent Carbon Capture (ASCC) technology, which will enable the facility to capture and permanently store nearly 1.65 million tons of CO2 annually.

According to Honeywell, that volume of CO2 is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by 1.65 million acres of US forest in a single year.

“As energy demand increases, Honeywell’s carbon capture technologies help customers like Wabash Valley Resources optimize operations and reduce emissions to help boost the domestic production of important inputs like ammonia to support American agriculture,” said Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions.

He emphasized that the project reflects the value of public-private partnerships in modernizing traditional energy and industrial sectors.

Dan Williams, CEO of WVR, said the facility will reinforce U.S. fertilizer security and advance cleaner production methods: “By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States.”

The center indicated that if Project 2025 were implemented, West Virginia residents would eventually:

Back then, President Donald Trump claimed he knew nothing about it. Yes, Trump never read it. However, he appointed Russell Vought — the mastermind behind Project 2025 — to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Post election, Trump stated he would be meeting with “Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.”

In his second term, Trump has been following Project 2025 right down to the smallest details.

For example:

— Under Project 2025, the Affordable Care Act (p 468) was to be gutted. Medicaid expansion would be limited by adding bureaucratic, unenforceable “work requirements.” Mission accomplished and numerous West Virginia residents will suffer.

— Project 2025 politicizes health care, stating, “Cultural institutions like public libraries and public health agencies are only as ‘independent’ from public accountability as elected officials and voters permit.” Classifying public health departments as “cultural” versus health care provisions opens public health up to politics. Thus, it opens the way for a lawyer like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be undercutting science and redefining the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccines policy. Mission accomplished.

— The conservative plan advocated doing away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (p 869) which it incorrectly classifies “as a shakedown mechanism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.” The Trump administration is vocally advocating for this approach and is well on its way to succeeding. Thus, consumers will again be left with no advocate for their interests while big business (Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, etc.) contributes money to the MAGA cause.

— Project 2025 (p 693) advocates “legislation that would ‘effectively abolish’ the Federal Reserve and replace it with ‘free banking,’ whereby ‘neither interest rates nor the supply of money’ would be ‘controlled by government.’” Trump’s moves to gain control of the Fed are the first step towards accomplishing this goal. Such a move would have disastrous economic consequences, leading to another Great Depression.

— Project 2025’s plan is to slash the size of the federal workforce (p 20), politicizing it while hindering its ability to function. This is based on the radical right assumption that there exists a “largely underworked, over-compensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce.” Along the same lines, the Trump administration is advised to “fill its ranks with political appointees” who would “overcome the federal government’s obstructionist Human Resources departments.” Mission accomplished.

— The federal Department of Education (c11, p365) would be abolished, and student aid slashed under Project 2025(c11, p385). Our public education system (c11, p390) would be undercut in favor of a stronger private sector presence. Trump is implementing these policies.

— Project 2025 slashes environmental regulations on businesses (c13, p440) while gutting Environmental Protection Agency regulations as well (p425/p 450). The strange rationale given is that the EPA is a “breeding ground for expansion of federal government influence” and that Democrats have a “global climate themed agenda.” Clearly, the authors want to ignore the severe climate threat facing the world.

— Energy production via fossil fuels would be increased on federal lands (c16, p600) while federal funding for renewable energy projects would be cut (c12, p405). “A new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders, reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda” (p 521). The Trump administration is implementing these policies while the environmental impact of these changes is ignored.

The bill that cleared the General Assembly Thursday funds energy storage systems through a new charge to Illinois electric customers that will take effect in 2030. The bill also lifts a longtime ban on new nuclear power developments and gives new authority to state utility regulators.

Proponents say the bill will lower costs for utility customers, but critics worry that a lack of cost-control measures will increase electricity prices for Illinois residents.

“Here’s the bottom line in my view: this package is about making energy more affordable for ratepayers in years ahead. We’re getting more energy on the grid,” bill sponsor Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, said Thursday. “If we do nothing… the rates are going to continue to go up.”

The Illinois Senate approved Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — Thursday evening, 37-22. That follows the House of Representatives approving it Wednesday night, 70-37.

It next heads to Gov. JB Pritzker, who pledged to sign the bill Thursday, noting that “what we’re trying to do is lower electricity costs.”

Pritzker’s office was heavily involved in negotiations around the bill throughout its tumultuous legislative history.

Versions of the bill date back to negotiations in 2024, with initial talks of an energy package cropping up in the weeks ahead of a January 2025 lame duck session. Drafts of the bill circulated throughout the spring legislative session before ultimately being abandoned.

What’s in the bill?

Senate Bill 25 — which supporters call the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — is the largest change to Illinois’ energy policy in at least four years. Among its core policies:

Battery storage. The core of the bill is a new incentive structure for energy storage projects. The incentives are broadly similar to how the state funds renewable developments like wind and solar power. They will result in new charges to ratepayers, although proponents say that savings from more storage on the grid will offset costs.

Energy efficiency. The bill adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at natural gas and electric utilities. These are aimed at reducing energy demand and proponents of the measure say they will lower prices for consumers.

Nuclear power. The bill lifts a longstanding moratorium on large-scale nuclear power plants, but it also hikes fees for nuclear plant operators.

New authority for regulators. The Illinois Commerce Commission, the state’s utility regulator, would gain new authority for “integrated resource planning,” a way of setting long-term plans to control both supply-side issues, like plans for electric generation, as well as managing demand.

Labor protections. New requirements for community solar projects would close a loophole that some developers were using to avoid hiring union labor. This was a major priority for organized labor groups during negotiations.

Data centers air regulations. The bill places new requirements on the backup generators used by data centers, which require always-on power to operate.

Virtual power plants and time-of-use. The bill requires large utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs and time-of-use rate plans. This allows utilities to use small-scale residential solar and battery projects to deliver energy throughout the day.

Geothermal energy. The bill outlines a program to fund geothermal heating, a technology which uses naturally occurring heat from underground to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel-based heating.

Thermal energy networks. A new state-backed loan program would fund thermal energy network projects. These use water-filled pipes to transfer heat between energy-intensive buildings, wastewater systems and bodies of water. They can also use geothermal energy to manage heat.

Renewable industry, environmentalists celebrate

A cadre of advocacy groups, renewable industry associations and lawmakers praised the bill’s passage.

The governor said the bill was a positive step toward affordability at a time when renewable energy faces expensive headwinds across the U.S.

“For far too long, private grid operators have been hiking up rates that are making it harder for Illinois families to pay their utility bills,” Pritzker said in a statement. “At the same time, the Trump Administration has been blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

President Donald Trump’s domestic policy package, passed earlier this summer, sent shockwaves through the renewable industry as it ended subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles, wind power projects, solar installation and other policies key to funding renewable development.

David Braun, head of sales and marketing for the Illinois-based renewable tech company Intelligent Generation, said that law caused “a lot of shock and uncertainty” but that the industry was “figuring it out.”

Illinois’ bill, according to Braun, signals that the future is bright for renewables.

“It’s good news for the industry, and I think it’s good news for the state of Illinois and for ratepayers,” Braun said.

The bill incentivizes new storage projects, which state officials at the Illinois Power Agency found will suppress electricity prices in an analysis they provided to lawmakers. It also mandates new programs to decrease strain on the grid, like energy efficiency programs.

Amy Heart, senior vice president for policy at the California-based solar company Sunrun, said the bill’s “virtual power plant” program will allow utilities to aggregate resources like residential solar and storage installations and coordinate them.

“The idea of utilizing electrons that are already stored in the batteries that are in houses and businesses — but adding them all up and dispatching them at times we need them the most in Illinois — reduces the amount of energy that ComEd or Ameren has to go to the wholesale market and buy from other states,” Heart said.

Environmental groups also praised the bill, with representatives of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and others saying the policy was a major step in keeping prices low.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement.

After a prolonged negotiation, labor groups also signed on to support the bill. They held out full support until lawmakers moved to close a loophole that allowed community solar developers to avoid using project labor agreements. Joe Duffy, head of the labor-affiliated Climate Jobs Illinois, lauded the bill’s passage. He noted that it “ensures the clean energy transition delivers good-paying, local union jobs.”

Criticism from Republicans, business groups

While affordability was at the center of proponents’ commendations of the policy, it was also central to critics’ attacks. The bill’s energy storage funding mechanism will put a guaranteed increase to Illinois consumers’ utility bills, which sparked significant opposition from Republicans, business groups and some Democrats.

Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, broke with his party as one of three Senate Democrats to vote against the bill. Sen. Michael Hastings, D-Frankfort, and Sen. Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, also voted no.

“This is about standing for integrity, for people who do not have armies of lobbyists down here giving talking points to people to justify raising their bills when they’re already struggling,” Preston said. “I have to vote no.”

Preston had advocated for an alternative funding mechanism — one that used state-backed loans and not an increase to ratepayers — in the months leading up to the bill’s passage.

Groups representing large businesses cited similar concerns. Illinois Industrial Electric Consumers Chair Phillip Golden said the bill’s funding “makes no sense, especially when the same objectives are achievable without forcing more costs on ratepayers.”

Business groups and Republicans also raised concerns over a provision that grants the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates utilities, the authority to create long-term “integrated resource plans.” These plans could include goals for the supply of electricity and managing demand.

By giving the ICC that authority, according to critics, the General Assembly is ceding too much authority to the executive branch.

“This is a huge overreach by the governor’s administration,” Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, said. “In this bill, he just gave all of the power for energy making decisions to the ICC — five unelected officials that he appoints.”

Rezin, a long-time advocate for allowing more nuclear construction in the state, said the bill’s elimination of the state’s nuclear moratorium might not mean more nuclear power because of the authority granted to the governor’s appointees.

“Do you think they’re going to bring nuclear online? In the past, they’ve shown they don’t support it,” Rezin said. “They’re going to go towards wind, solar, battery and transmission.”

Ready to Capitalise on Critical Minerals Investment Opportunities?","What Defines South Africa's Thin-Incentive Critical Minerals Strategy?

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy has adopted what industry analysts describe as a minimal-incentive approach to critical minerals development, standing in stark contrast to the aggressive financial packages offered by competing mining jurisdictions. This strategic framework prioritises regulatory stability and sustainable development over short-term investment attraction through tax breaks and subsidies.

The thin-incentive model operates through several key mechanisms that distinguish it from international competitors. Unlike the Australian tax incentives with substantial research and development tax credits or Canada's flow-through share programs, South Africa maintains standard corporate tax rates across all mineral categories without differentiation for strategic resources.

Core Elements of the Thin-Incentive Framework:

Uniform royalty structures applied regardless of mineral classification

Limited government co-funding for exploration activities

Standard regulatory treatment across commodity types

Absence of specialised tax holidays for critical mineral projects

Minimal direct government investment in mining infrastructure

This approach reflects a broader philosophy that sustainable mining development should rely on strong geological fundamentals rather than artificial fiscal incentives. The strategy assumes that South Africa's exceptional mineral endowments will attract investment based on resource quality and long-term profitability rather than short-term tax advantages.

Comparative Analysis with Global Mining Jurisdictions

The contrast between South Africa's approach and international best practices becomes apparent when examining specific policy mechanisms. Australia's Exploration Development Incentive provides direct tax credits for grassroots mineral exploration, whilst Canada's Super Flow-Through Share programme offers enhanced tax deductions for critical mineral investments.

Policy Tool South Africa Australia Canada Chile Exploration Tax Credits None Up to 100% 15-25% additional Regional variations Royalty Relief Programmes Standard rates Project-specific Provincial discretion Sliding scale Infrastructure Co-funding Limited Substantial Federal-provincial State investment Fast-track Permitting Standard process Expedited for critical minerals Enhanced review Streamlined approvals

Understanding South Africa's Critical Minerals Classification System

The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy has developed a comprehensive strategic minerals list that identifies resources based on economic significance, supply chain vulnerability, and technological importance. This classification system represents one of the most detailed national assessments of critical mineral resources globally.

Tier 1 Strategic Minerals (Dominant Global Position):

Platinum Group Metals: South Africa controls approximately 80% of global platinum reserves and 70% of rhodium reserves

Manganese: The country possesses roughly 75% of identified global manganese reserves, primarily in the Northern Cape's Kalahari Manganese Field

Chrome Ore: Contains nearly 70% of world chrome reserves, concentrated in the Bushveld Complex

Vanadium: Holds about 45% of global vanadium reserves

Tier 2 Strategic Resources (Significant but Competitive):

Iron Ore: Substantial reserves in the Northern Cape, though not globally dominant

Titanium Minerals: Significant heavy mineral sands deposits along the eastern coast

Rare Earth Elements: Emerging potential in various geological formations

Gold: Declining but still economically important reserves

The classification system extends beyond simple reserve calculations to include processing capabilities, downstream beneficiation potential, and strategic trade relationships. This multidimensional approach recognises that raw mineral abundance alone does not guarantee strategic advantage in global supply chains.

Geological Distribution and Regional Concentrations

South Africa's critical minerals exhibit distinct geographical clustering that creates both opportunities and infrastructure challenges. The Bushveld Igneous Complex represents one of the world's most significant repositories of strategic minerals, containing the majority of global platinum group metal reserves alongside substantial chrome and vanadium resources.

Key Mining Regions:

Bushveld Complex (Limpopo and North West Provinces): Primary source of platinum, palladium, rhodium, chrome, and vanadium

Witwatersrand Basin (Gauteng): Historic gold production region with ongoing deep-level operations

Kalahari Manganese Field (Northern Cape): World's largest manganese ore deposits

Aggeneys-Gamsberg Area (Northern Cape): Zinc, lead, and emerging copper resources

Core Components of the Strategic Framework

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy operates through multiple policy mechanisms designed to maximise domestic value addition whilst maintaining export competitiveness. The framework emphasises downstream beneficiation as a pathway to economic diversification and industrial development.

Primary Strategic Objectives:

Value Addition Mandate: Encouraging local processing of raw minerals before export

Technology Transfer: Facilitating knowledge sharing between international investors and domestic entities

Skills Development: Building local expertise in specialised mining and processing technologies

Supply Chain Integration: Creating linkages between mining operations and manufacturing sectors

Sustainable Development: Ensuring environmental and social responsibility in resource extraction

The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act provides the regulatory foundation for this approach, establishing requirements for Social and Labour Plans that mandate local community investment and skills development programmes. Furthermore, the government has explored mineral beneficiation opportunities as a key component of industrial development.

Beneficiation Requirements and Implementation Challenges

The concurrent review of beneficiation policies reflects ongoing tensions between immediate revenue generation through raw material exports and long-term economic development through value-added processing. Current regulations require mining companies to demonstrate efforts toward local beneficiation without imposing absolute restrictions on raw material exports.

Implementation Complexities:

Power Supply Constraints: Unreliable electricity supply affects energy-intensive processing operations

Water Resource Limitations: Processing facilities require substantial water resources in water-scarce regions

Skills Shortages: Limited availability of specialised technical expertise for advanced processing technologies

Capital Requirements: High upfront investment costs for beneficiation infrastructure

Market Access: Challenges in competing with established international processing centres

Why Industry Analysts Question This Approach

Mining industry experts have raised concerns about South Africa's ability to attract sufficient investment under current policy frameworks, particularly when competing against jurisdictions offering substantial financial incentives for critical mineral development.

Primary Investment Barriers:

Regulatory Uncertainty: Unclear implementation timelines for new mining legislation and beneficiation requirements

Infrastructure Deficits: Persistent challenges with electricity supply, rail transportation, and port capacity

Administrative Complexity: Lengthy permitting processes and multiple regulatory approvals required

Political Risk Perceptions: International investor concerns about policy stability and property rights

Labour Relations: Ongoing tensions between mining companies and labour unions affecting operational predictability

Additionally, the approach contrasts sharply with the critical minerals strategy pivot seen in other jurisdictions that prioritise aggressive investment attraction through fiscal incentives.

Competitive Disadvantage Analysis

Global mining investment flows increasingly favour jurisdictions offering comprehensive support packages for critical mineral projects. The United States Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial tax credits for domestic critical mineral processing, whilst the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act establishes fast-track permitting for strategic projects.

Investment Attractiveness Factor Weighting South Africa Score Global Average Geological Prospectivity 30% 9.2/10 6.5/10 Policy Stability 25% 6.1/10 7.2/10 Fiscal Competitiveness 20% 5.8/10 7.0/10 Infrastructure Quality 15% 5.5/10 6.8/10 Regulatory Efficiency 10% 5.2/10 6.9/10

According to recent G20 analysis, South Africa's approach has been characterised as having limited incentive structures compared to global best practices.

Global Supply Chain Implications

South Africa's strategic importance in global critical mineral supply chains extends far beyond its domestic economic interests, with policy decisions affecting international technology development, renewable energy deployment, and automotive manufacturing. However, this also plays into broader critical minerals energy transition considerations globally.

Critical Supply Chain Positions:

Automotive Catalysts: Platinum and palladium essential for internal combustion engine emissions control

Hydrogen Economy: Platinum group metals crucial for fuel cell technology development

Stainless Steel Production: Chrome ore fundamental to stainless steel manufacturing globally

Battery Technology: Emerging importance of manganese in next-generation battery chemistries

Infrastructure Development: Vanadium increasingly important for energy storage applications

The concentration of global supply in South African operations creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities for international supply chains. Geopolitical tensions, labour disputes, or infrastructure failures can have immediate global impacts on critical technology sectors.

Regional Integration and SADC Cooperation

The Southern African Development Community framework provides opportunities for regional integration of critical mineral value chains, though implementation remains limited. Zambia's copper resources, Botswana's diamond operations, and Zimbabwe's platinum deposits could complement South African production within integrated regional supply chains.

Regional Integration Challenges:

Infrastructure Connectivity: Limited transportation links between regional mining operations

Regulatory Harmonisation: Different mining codes and tax systems across SADC member states

Currency Stability: Exchange rate volatility affecting cross-border investment flows

Skills Mobility: Barriers to movement of technical expertise across regional boundaries

Long-Term Consequences of Minimal Investment Incentives

South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy may result in delayed development of critical mineral projects, potentially affecting both domestic economic objectives and international supply security. This outcome could have significant implications for South Africa's position in global mineral markets.

Potential Positive Outcomes:

Fiscal Sustainability: Reduced government expenditure on mining subsidies

Project Selectivity: Focus on economically robust projects with strong fundamentals

Sustainable Development: Emphasis on long-term value creation rather than short-term extraction

Technology Development: Incentivising innovation in processing and beneficiation technologies

Risk Scenarios:

Investment Diversion: Loss of potential projects to more competitive jurisdictions

Delayed Development: Slower pace of new mine development and expansion projects

Technology Gaps: Limited adoption of advanced mining and processing technologies

Market Share Loss: Gradual erosion of global market position in key commodities

Alternative Development Models and International Precedents

Several countries have successfully implemented differentiated incentive structures specifically targeting critical minerals whilst maintaining overall fiscal discipline. Norway's Government Pension Fund provides patient capital for strategic mineral investments, while Chile's lithium strategy balances resource conservation with development incentives.

As outlined in Africa Policy Institute analysis, there are both promises and paradoxes in South Africa's current approach that require careful consideration.

Successful Alternative Models:

Targeted Tax Credits: Specific incentives for critical mineral processing rather than broad-based mining subsidies

Infrastructure Co-investment: Government participation in strategic transportation and power infrastructure

Research and Development Support: Public funding for mining technology innovation and skills development

Fast-track Permitting: Expedited regulatory approval processes for strategic mineral projects

Export Financing: Government-backed financing for critical mineral trade relationships

Enhancing South Africa's Critical Minerals Competitiveness

Policy refinements could address current limitations whilst maintaining fiscal responsibility and sustainable development principles. Targeted interventions could improve investment attractiveness without abandoning the core philosophy of the thin-incentive approach, particularly considering broader mining industry innovation trends.

Strategic Enhancement Opportunities:

Infrastructure Investment Programmes: Government-led improvements in electricity supply reliability and rail transportation capacity

Regulatory Streamlining: Clear timelines and single-window approval processes for critical mineral projects

Technology Partnerships: Enhanced collaboration between government research institutions and private mining companies

Skills Development Initiatives: Specialised training programmes for advanced mining and processing technologies

Export Promotion: Trade facilitation measures for value-added mineral products

Implementation Timeline and Practical Considerations

Effective policy modifications require careful sequencing to avoid disrupting existing operations whilst encouraging new investment. Gradual implementation of enhanced incentives could test effectiveness before broader application across the mining sector.

Phase 1 (Immediate – 6 months):

Regulatory clarity on beneficiation requirements

Infrastructure investment announcements

Fast-track permitting pilot programmes

Phase 2 (Short-term – 12-24 months):

Targeted tax incentives for processing facilities

Skills development programme implementation

Technology transfer facilitation mechanisms

Phase 3 (Medium-term – 2-5 years):

Infrastructure project completion

Full regulatory framework implementation

Performance evaluation and adjustment

Strategic Implications for Investors and Industry Stakeholders

Understanding South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy helps inform investment decisions and strategic planning for companies involved in critical mineral supply chains. Long-term investors may find opportunities in the current framework's emphasis on sustainable development and resource optimisation.

Investment Strategy Considerations:

Project Economics: Higher reliance on commodity price cycles and operational efficiency rather than fiscal incentives

Partnership Approaches: Collaboration with local entities may provide operational and regulatory advantages

Technology Focus: Emphasis on innovative processing and beneficiation technologies to maximise value addition

Risk Management: Comprehensive assessment of infrastructure, regulatory, and political risk factors

Market Positioning: Understanding of global supply chain dynamics and long-term demand trends

Stakeholder Engagement Priorities:

Government Relations: Active participation in policy development and regulatory consultation processes

Community Investment: Substantial commitment to local economic development and social responsibility

Environmental Compliance: Proactive approach to environmental management and rehabilitation

Skills Development: Investment in local capacity building and technology transfer

Supply Chain Integration: Development of domestic linkages and value-added processing capabilities

The success of South Africa's thin-incentive critical minerals strategy ultimately depends on balancing fiscal discipline with investment attractiveness whilst leveraging the country's exceptional geological advantages. Future policy developments will likely determine whether this approach can achieve its dual objectives of sustainable resource development and global competitiveness in critical mineral supply chains.

This analysis is based on current policy frameworks and industry assessments as of October 2025. Mining investment decisions should consider multiple factors including geological, technical, regulatory, and market considerations. Readers should consult current government publications and industry reports for the most recent policy developments.

But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles.
Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles.","Automakers have been footing a hefty tariff bill — to the tune of $30 billion across the industry this year, according to a recent analysis from Moody's.

The industry is also grappling with a shortage of semiconductors, leaving them without the chips they need to build some vehicles, as well as a fire at an aluminum plant that's hurting the supply chain for Ford and Stellantis.

Despite those headwinds, quarterly earnings reports from automakers are so far showing resilience. General Motors reported $3.4 billion in profits last quarter and Ford brought in $2.6 billion, both beating expectations. Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, increased its revenues by 13% year over year. Hyundai, despite seeing a 29% decline in profits compared to the same quarter last year, still plans to meet its targets for the year.

Volkswagen Group, on the other hand, reported a more than billion-dollar loss, as it faced the combined costs of tariffs and Porsche's pivot from electric vehicles back to gasoline.

Part of the reason for automakers' positive reports is that Trump lowered tariffs on goods from Japan and Europe from 25% to 15%, and just recently announced a similar deal with Korea. While a 15% tariff is still substantial, the changes were welcomed by automakers.

Meanwhile, a recent policy change eased the burden of tariffs on imported parts that go into U.S.-built cars.

Automakers' bottom lines are also getting a boost from rising car prices. Companies have been cautious about passing tariff costs along to consumers, in part because cars are already so expensive — over $50,000 on average, according to Kelley Blue Book. There are real questions about how much more consumers are willing or able to pay. But gradual increases are now visible. Across the industry, prices are up about .5% this year, Ford says.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's rollback of environmental rules is benefitting some automakers substantially — in particular, changes to emissions requirements that used to penalize automakers if they made too many high-polluting vehicles.

Suddenly, automakers do not have to manufacture electric vehicles, which they have struggled to make profitably. And they can build as many large pickup trucks as they can sell — which are both more polluting and more profitable. That's been a boost to companies like GM, Stellantis and Ford, offsetting the costs of tariffs.

Of course, that same policy change is a setback for all-electric automakers like Tesla and Rivian. Under the previous rules, automakers that wanted to make gas guzzlers could pay EV manufacturers for ""regulatory credits,"" allowing them to borrow their rivals' green halos — and comply with federal rules. Now, that revenue stream for EV makers is being eliminated.

Tesla had strong sales last quarter, helped by the rush to buy EVs as consumers tried to take advantage of the now-eliminated consumer EV tax credit. But profits fell. (On Tesla's quarterly call with investors, Musk, as usual, was less interested in talking about those EV sales and much more interested in talking about the humanoid robots that he plans to sell.) Rivian is expected to report earnings next week.

Those policy changes are slowing the transition to electric vehicles. GM is ending production of its electric commercial van, and Stellantis is leaning heavily into inefficient Hemi engines, as a new CEO pivots away from a previous focus on electrification.

But executives are also consistently saying they still plan to invest in electric vehicles. ""EVs remain our North Star,"" said Mary Barra, explaining that GM will continue to work on improved EV batteries.

Partly, that's because of competitive pressure, as Chinese automakers make increasingly attractive and affordable electric vehicles. But automakers also know that just as the Trump administration did a U-turn on EVs, a future administration might once again make climate change and air pollution major priorities.

""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market [will] continue to evolve — and maybe even regulations evolve,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors.

So Ford still plans to move forward with a $30,000 electric pickup, despite the lack of federal tax credits or regulations that would encourage it. ""We think this product is literally at the center of the future of the EV market in the U.S.,"" Farley said.

What's next?

The Mining and Energy Union has warned government intervention might be needed.

One of Australia's largest electricity companies, AGL, is preparing to shed hundreds of jobs as part of a massive restructure aimed at freeing up capital to accelerate its transition away from coal and towards renewables.

The company owns the Bayswater coal-fired power station in the Hunter Valley and the Loy Yang A plant in the Latrobe Valley, which the Victorian government is paying to keep operating until 2035.

In a presentation to workers earlier today, AGL — whose biggest shareholder is billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes — announced its plans to cut up to 300 positions from the two coal-fired stations and across the company's hydro sites.

""As we transition our portfolio, and connect our customers to a sustainable future, we need to ensure that today's business remains productive and competitive in this changing market while we continue to invest in our business for tomorrow,"" AGL said in a statement.

Hunter region reels from potential job losses

The news caps off a difficult week for the New South Wales Hunter Region after Rio Tinto announced it was considering closing its Tomago aluminium smelter — an AGL customer — which employs more than 1,000 workers.

Mining and Energy Union general secretary Grahame Kelly described AGL's restructure as a ""kick in the guts for power station workers in the lead up to Christmas"" and warned government intervention may be needed.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.
Texas Resiliency Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.
“I think that these technologies—wind, solar, storage, demand response—they’re not experiments anymore,” Boms said.
“They’re the backbone of the Texas grid and the economy.”","Texas’ efforts to maintain a resilient power grid in the face of rising demand and storm threats are being tested by the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy.

The Lone Star state is unique compared to others because it allowed the market to determine what resources to invest in, leading to extensive transmission lines transporting solar and wind energy. Those renewables are particularly abundant due to Texas’ extensive and sunny landscape, and have been supported by the state’s growth of battery storage.

“Texas is number one in wind and solar not by accident, but because we have the resources, the infrastructure, and the market design to make it happen,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance under Advanced Energy United.

All of that is strained by President Donald Trump demanding the end of clean energy subsidies and restricting federal funding for renewables programs, provoking one Texas county to fight back in the courts.

“Infrastructure has been a big part of Texas’ success story in renewables,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. “A lot of this progress in Texas is under threat from recent acts in Congress and by the administration.”

“The challenge right now is from the federal government” which has “reduced and curtailed tax credits available to the solar and storage industries” and is “likely to decrease the amount of supply that comes online,” Gallagher said.

New Energy Landscape

Renewables helped make Texas’ grid more stable in the summer, but there’s still concern for the winter because “the Trump administration has responded by just completely making it so difficult to add more energy to the grid,” saidHannah Malus, vice president of strategy and advocacy at Clean Energy for America.

“The lives and livelihoods of Texans are just collateral damage resulting from this administration picking winners and losers and energy sources instead of just letting the market decide,” Malus said.

Wind and solar generation have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system—which maintains the state’s electric grid—since 2023 and are increasingly meeting rising demand, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

For example, from June 1 to Aug. 31, solar met 15.2% of all demand in the ERCOT system, according to the council’s data.

“The political economy of energy in Texas demonstrates that clean energy—it shouldn’t be partisan,” Malus said.

Harris County—Texas’ largest county and home to Houston—in October sued the Environmental Protection Agency for canceling $250 million it was awarded to fund solar energy infrastructure in low-income communities. Other states and organizations have also filed challenges over the Solar For All program.

“The whole purpose of the grant is to lower skyrocketing energy costs, to create clean energy jobs, to improve community health safety and resilience, and, of course, to support domestic manufacturing,” said Christian Menefee, Harris County’s chief civil lawyer.

The county on Oct. 24 moved for a preliminary injunction to stop the EPA from implementing the cancellation of the program. The section of the July tax and spending bill that rescinds “unobligated balances” violates the Administrative Procedure Act and US Constitution, the motion said.

“I agree with the overall sentiment that this sector is poised to continue growing, but I think you’d have to be a bit foolish to think that that growth won’t be slowed or stunted because of the actions of the Trump administration,” Menefee said.

The EPA said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation since Solar For All is the subject of different lawsuits. The Energy Department and ERCOT didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

ERCOT’s CEO, Pablo Vegas, testified before Congress in March about the grid.

“A reliable grid must have a balanced mix of generation resources, especially with the ‘all of the above’ approach” found in Texas, he said.

Texas Resiliency

Though these developments will affect Texas resources, ERCOT itself sets the state apart from others.

“ERCOT is mostly isolated from other grids in the country, and that means that Texas has more autonomy on how the market is designed and operated,” Boms said. This allows the state to avoid lengthy oversight processes from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the interstate transmission of gas and electricity.

The state’s infrastructure also plays a big role.

“There was a really important transmission build out that happened about 20 years ago to connect remote wind and solar projects to the urban hubs in Texas,” Boms said. That “allowed billions of dollars in private investment to flow into Texas because the transmission was in place.”

“Federal policies will have an impact, but generally speaking, the industry is here to stay, and it’s really up to state leadership,” he said.

There have been recent attempts in the state legislature to pass bills that would add obstacles for renewables, but they didn’t go far.

One Republican-led bill, SB 819, would have added new permit requirements on wind and solar generating facilities, according to law firm K&L Gates.

Another, SB 715—also led by state Republicans—would have moved up the effective dates of new generation reliability requirements, according to S&P Global.

“There have been threats over the last few legislative sessions and some anti-renewable proposals, but luckily, none of those have passed,” Boms said.

Texas also invested in stronger weatherization following Winter Storm Uri in 2021, which left about 4.5 million Texans without electricity during extremely low temperatures.

This time, the shift is driven by tariffs.

According to a new report from the Anderson Economic Group (AEG), U.S. automakers have already paid more than $10 billion in tariffs this year on vehicles and parts imported from Canada and Mexico. That’s not a typo — $10 billion, and counting.

These costs aren’t just numbers on a balance sheet. They’re reshaping where companies build, how they source materials, and even which vehicles Americans will be able to buy in the coming years.

A price tag on globalization

The Anderson report, released October 16, offers a detailed look at how trade policy is rippling through the automotive economy. Between January and July 2025 alone, automakers incurred $6.45 billion in duties on North American imports. By the end of October, that figure is projected to exceed $10.6 billion, factoring in delayed Census Bureau corrections and missing import data.

AEG’s CEO, Patrick L. Anderson, emphasized that this number still understates the real cost. It only includes two major categories of vehicle imports and excludes separate tariffs on steel, aluminum, and imports from Europe or Asia.

That means the real financial hit could be significantly higher — a reality that’s already affecting corporate strategy and consumer prices.

Trump’s “build it here” tariff doctrine

At the heart of this transformation is a simple message from former President Donald Trump: build it in America, or pay the price.

During an April White House press event announcing his reciprocal tariff policy, Trump declared:

“If you want your tariff rate to be zero, then you build your product right here in America, because there is no tariff if you build your plant, your product in America.”

His goal, he said, was to rebalance decades of offshoring that sent millions of U.S. manufacturing jobs abroad. And the policy is beginning to do exactly that.

While critics argue that tariffs can raise prices for consumers, supporters note that they also create strong incentives for domestic production — and recent corporate moves suggest the message is being heard loud and clear.

Stellantis makes its move

The most dramatic example so far comes from Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram.

In April, Stellantis temporarily paused production at two major assembly plants — one in Canada, one in Mexico — amid growing tariff costs and supply chain disruptions. Then, on October 14, the company announced a stunning $13 billion investment to expand U.S. manufacturing, marking the largest single commitment in its history.

The move includes plans to expand facilities in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, and to repurpose underused plants for new hybrid and electric models. While Stellantis hasn’t directly tied its decision to tariffs, the timing is telling.

Industry analysts note that tariff exposure on cross-border parts and vehicles likely played a major role. The company’s North American production mix has historically relied heavily on Canadian and Mexican plants for lower labor costs — but tariffs have narrowed that advantage.

“When the cost difference between building in Windsor and building in Toledo shrinks, you start to see companies doing the math,” said one senior industry economist. “Tariffs are effectively a relocation tax.”

The ripple effect across the industry

Stellantis isn’t alone. Ford, General Motors, and even foreign automakers with U.S. operations are reassessing how and where they build.

Some are accelerating plans to “nearshore” supply chains — moving critical component manufacturing from Asia to Mexico or the southern United States to limit tariff exposure. Others are exploring dual sourcing strategies, splitting production between domestic and foreign facilities to hedge risk.

According to AEG’s analysis, U.S. imports of completed vehicles from Mexico have declined slightly since the reciprocal tariffs were announced, while domestic output has edged upward.

That’s precisely the outcome trade hawks have been aiming for.

Still, not every automaker can easily adapt. Companies with smaller U.S. footprints or heavy reliance on imported components face tough decisions: absorb the cost, pass it on to consumers, or invest billions in new domestic infrastructure.

The real cost to consumers

Tariffs can be a political flashpoint, but for consumers, the effects are straightforward: higher prices — at least in the short term.

Automakers typically pass along a portion of tariff costs through modest price hikes. On a $40,000 vehicle, even a 2–3% increase in parts cost can add $800 to $1,200 to the final sticker price.

But tariffs also create jobs and stimulate domestic investment — benefits that ripple through the broader economy.

When Stellantis spends $13 billion expanding U.S. facilities, that means new construction contracts, local supplier growth, and thousands of jobs in manufacturing towns that have struggled since the last wave of plant closures.

It’s a short-term cost for a long-term gain, and one that many industry observers say could finally start reversing decades of offshoring.

A balancing act for automakers

Manufacturers are walking a fine line between staying competitive globally and complying with evolving trade rules at home.

For decades, North American production was built around the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) framework, which replaced NAFTA. The agreement allows tariff-free trade between the three countries, but only if vehicles meet strict “rules of origin” — requiring that a high percentage of parts come from North America.

Recent tariff expansions complicate that picture. Even when cars meet USMCA thresholds, they may still face additional duties under reciprocal tariffs or on specific raw materials like steel and aluminum.

For automakers, that’s like playing 3D chess: navigating overlapping trade rules, currency swings, and political shifts while keeping costs under control.

The bigger picture: Auto parts under pressure

While the major automakers have enough resources to adjust, smaller auto parts suppliers are in a far more precarious position.

The same week Anderson’s report was released, analysts warned that auto parts bankruptcies are surging across the U.S. — a troubling trend for the high-yield credit market.

Many of these suppliers operate on razor-thin margins. When tariffs raise input costs by even a few percentage points, those increases can push small companies into insolvency.

That, in turn, affects the entire supply chain. As suppliers close or consolidate, automakers face higher component prices and longer lead times. And for consumers, that can mean fewer affordable models and longer wait times for vehicle repairs.

Are tariffs working?

The effectiveness of tariffs often depends on your perspective.

Economists who favor free trade argue that tariffs distort markets and can backfire by increasing consumer prices or triggering retaliatory duties from trading partners.

Supporters, however, point to early signs of manufacturing reshoring, new capital investment, and stronger domestic job growth in industrial states.

From that standpoint, tariffs are doing exactly what they’re designed to do — making it more attractive to build in the United States and less profitable to rely on foreign factories.

“We’ve heard for years that automakers can’t afford to build here,” said one policy analyst familiar with the Anderson report. “Now, we’re seeing that they can — and that they’re starting to do it.”

Lessons from the past

The U.S. has used tariffs as a strategic tool before — sometimes successfully, sometimes not. In the 1980s, the Reagan administration imposed voluntary export restraints on Japanese automakers to protect domestic manufacturers.

At first, the move was controversial. But within a decade, many Japanese brands had built U.S. factories to avoid quotas — creating tens of thousands of American jobs in states like Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama.

Tariffs and trade pressure, in other words, don’t have to end globalization; they can redirect it. Instead of importing cars, companies start building them where the consumers are.

The future of American auto manufacturing

If the current trend continues, America’s auto industry could look very different by the end of the decade.

Instead of relying heavily on Canada and Mexico for assembly, companies may shift more final production to U.S. soil — particularly for higher-margin models like trucks, SUVs, and premium vehicles.

Electric vehicles, too, could see more U.S.-based manufacturing, as automakers race to qualify for domestic-production incentives under federal and state programs.

This shift could help rebuild the American industrial base — but it will also test whether the U.S. can compete on cost, logistics, and labor flexibility against long-established global supply chains.

The next big question is sustainability — not environmental, but economic.

If tariffs continue at this scale, automakers will need to offset costs through automation, localized supply chains, or price increases. For now, the industry seems to be absorbing the shock without major layoffs or price spikes, but that could change if trade tensions escalate or if other nations impose retaliatory duties.

And with major elections on the horizon, tariff policy will likely remain front and center. Both policymakers and manufacturers know that the future of the U.S. auto industry — and millions of jobs tied to it — hangs in the balance.

The new era of tariffs isn’t just a story about taxes or trade statistics. It’s about how America defines economic independence.

For decades, automakers built their strategies around global efficiency. Today, they’re being pushed — by policy, economics, and public sentiment — to prioritize domestic resilience.

That may mean slightly higher prices at the dealership today, but it also means more factories, more jobs, and more control over the country’s industrial destiny tomorrow.

The $10 billion price tag may seem steep. But for an industry that helped define America’s middle class, it might just be the cost of taking the driver’s seat again.

Destry Jarvis, Josh Jackson",,,,,https://www.hcn.org/articles/fix-our-forests-act-divides-environmental-community/,"The Fix Our Forests Act, sponsored by U.S. Sens.
The Forest Service currently treats about 4 million acres each year, a drop in the bucket of the nation’s 193 million acres of forest.
Medema and Miller-McFeeley said both of these provisions will give the Forest Service permission to start massive projects with little public oversight.
It also says that neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management would be required to always work with the U.S.
“You tie those together, and it’s an existential threat to our forests and communities that survive because of them,” said Miller-McFeeley.","A new bill poised to pass the Senate after clearing the House will govern how the federal government thins, burns and otherwise manages nearly 200 million acres of the nation’s forests.

The Fix Our Forests Act, sponsored by U.S. Sens. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., John Curtis, R-Utah, Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., and Alex Padilla, D-Calif., passed out of Senate committee recently in a rare show of bipartisan support, with 18 senators in favor and only five opposed.

“There is a wildfire crisis across much of the country — our communities need action now,” said Hickenlooper in a news release. “Wildfires won’t wait.”

The proposed legislation — the first major congressional effort to fight wildfires in recent history — includes provisions that promote prescribed burning and forest thinning in fire-prone areas along with working with communities to create defensible space around vulnerable homes. The bill formally recognizes wetlands as buffers against wildfires and encourages cross-boundary programs among counties, states and tribes. It also reauthorizes the 2009 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, which provides money for groups working together on fire mitigation and forest health, said Michael O’Casey, public-lands director for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.

“When you’re out hunting and in the woods in Western forests, you can see a lot of woods aren’t in good shape,” he said. “They’re too thick and ready for fire, frankly.”

Over a century of fire suppression has left the forests in a weakened state, he added, creating problems that drought, climate change and disease have only intensified. O’Casey hopes the bill can help prevent the megafires that have increasingly scorched the West.

The Forest Service currently treats about 4 million acres each year, a drop in the bucket of the nation’s 193 million acres of forest. Forest managers need to get to work now in the places “where it’s needed most,” O’Casey said. “I have hope it will facilitate more management on forest lands to keep the health of ecosystems in mind.”

But the bill also comes with provisions that some say will streamline projects while others say it will fracture the nation’s bedrock environmental laws. Right now, for example, the Forest Service is permitted to log, burn or otherwise alter sections of forest only after a period of public comment or by following the National Environmental Policy Act process, unless the proposed project is relatively small and would not “have a significant effect on the human environment.” This kind of exemption has been permitted as an emergency declaration of sorts that generally only applies to projects up to 2,000 or 3,000 acres in size, said the Sierra Club’s Anna Medema. But the new bill would increase that threshold to 10,000 acres.

Another controversial provision would allow the Forest Service to log and change landscapes across a “fireshed management area” without first consulting with tribes and the public or following the environmental review process. A fireshed can be up to 250,000 acres in size, which is as large as many Western national forest ranger districts, said Blaine Miller-McFeeley, a legislative representative with Earth Justice.

Medema and Miller-McFeeley said both of these provisions will give the Forest Service permission to start massive projects with little public oversight. But O’Casey argued that they will enable the agency to act quickly to tackle projects that may have previously been mired in red tape.

Similarly, the bill limits judicial review by changing the current statute of limitations for lawsuits from six years to a mere 150 days. It also says that neither the Forest Service nor the Bureau of Land Management would be required to always work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to update forest plans to reflect newly listed endangered species or new information about currently listed species.

Other critics point out that the legislation appropriates no new funding for thinning forests or creating defensible space around houses threatened by fire. And the Forest Service is already drastically underfunded and understaffed; the Department of Agriculture has fired thousands of employees, said Susan Jane Brown, an Oregon-based staff attorney for Silvix Resources, a nonprofit environmental law firm.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill mandated that the Forest Service meet annual timber quotas, meaning the agency’s remaining staffers will likely be directed to approve logging projects, Miller-McFeeley cautioned.

“You tie those together, and it’s an existential threat to our forests and communities that survive because of them,” said Miller-McFeeley.

O’Casey understands the critics’ concerns. Any bipartisan bill requires compromise, he acknowledged. But he insists that the bill is not a congressionally authorized logging free-for-all. Plenty of Western forests have thick stands of timber of low commercial value, such as ponderosa and juniper, he said, and the forests need to be thinned. O’Casey believes the bill will encourage that work using the best available science. In the long term, he sees it as a net positive for old-growth forests, water supplies and fire-prone communities.

However, since the bill doesn’t come with appropriated new funds, he noted that cities, counties, tribal nations, states and nonprofits will have to continue to lobby to pay for projects like wetland restoration and community fire resiliency.

“There are a lot of people who are really afraid of the bill for what it could do rather than excited about what it could do,” he said.

“Government shutdowns impose real, escalating costs. While exact figures vary, public estimates of the current funding lapse suggest $10 billion–$15 billion per week in lost output and economic activity. The longer the shutdown persists, the larger and more durable the economic damage becomes — and some of it could never be recovered.

“Among many other impacts, each day the government remains closed increases the permitting backlog for major infrastructure projects. The nation’s air traffic control system and its workforce are also showing signs of stress.

“We urge Congress to swiftly pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the federal government. Immediately reopening the government would avert further economic disruption and give Congress and the Administration time to negotiate a longer-term funding package and address other pressing issues.”

The call comes as the Chamber released a new analysis and interactive map showing 65,500 small business contractors in the United States have nearly $3 billion a week at risk because of the shutdown, with $12 billion just in the month of October alone.

For weeks, the Chamber has stressed the negative impact of the government shutdown and called for the administration and Congress to work together to reopen the government. On October 2, the Chamber sent a memo to its members outlining the implications of a government shutdown and the outlook for reopening the government. The Chamber also sent a letter to the Senate urging passage of the Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2026.

Earlier this month, the Chamber hosted dozens of small businesses for a Capitol Hill fly-in. Businesses met with lawmakers and their staffs to share their priorities. The Chamber also published new stories from small businesses nationwide who are feeling the shutdown’s effects firsthand:

Signers of the letter include Airlines for America, American Hotel & Lodging Association, Associated General Contractors of America Association of Equipment Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, National Association of Manufacturers, National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, National Electrical Manufacturers Association, National Retail Federation, National Association of Home Builders, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Batteries have quickly become a crucial part of the U.S. electricity grid — and a whole lot more are about to come online.

Over the next five years, the country will build nearly 67 gigawatts’ worth of new utility-scale batteries, per data from research firm BloombergNEF, enough to send almost 284 gigawatt-hours of stored-up electricity back to the grid.

Those are massive figures. Should the forecast bear out, the U.S. will have roughly three times more battery capacity in 2030 than it does now. Such rapid growth is familiar territory for the sector, which jumped from just 1.5 GW of total capacity in 2020 to a whopping 27.3 GW by the end of last year.

The transition to renewable energy — particularly solar — relies on batteries. That’s because communities with lots of solar arrays often generate more power than the grid needs at a particular moment in time. Batteries let these solar-saturated states save that extra energy for later use.

California and Texas, the U.S.’s two leaders on solar, have built the vast majority of the country’s utility-scale storage. Already, the states are reaping the benefits. By spring of 2024, California’s battery fleet had grown large enough to begin displacing some natural-gas use in the evening. Meanwhile, batteries have helped Texas stave off summertime grid emergencies for two years running.

As battery developers propose more, bigger projects, the sector has started to run into some opposition. Just last week, news broke that plans to build New York’s biggest battery on Staten Island fell through following fervent protest from the local community. Fears of battery fires have spread around the country following the massive blaze at California’s Moss Landing facility in January, even though that disaster stemmed from the project’s outdated design.

Still, several broader trends suggest the sector’s growth will continue.

For one, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act left incentives for battery storage relatively untouched, even as it yanked away tax credits for solar and wind projects. Then there’s the fact that solar is growing steadily around the country, which will eventually create a need for storage in other states just as it has in California and Texas. Most important of all, demand for electricity is surging nationwide — and batteries are among the cheapest and quickest ways to get more capacity onto the grid.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/COTW-battery-boom-1.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=6590816efb583b2b370da1c7b8800587,N,,2025-10-31 05:04:51.216083

In Georgia, they're on the ballot. - Canary Media",Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/georgia-regulator-psc-elections-energy-affordability,"That’s particularly true for the 2.8 million customers of the state’s major utility, Georgia Power, for whom costs have ballooned in recent years.
“Utility bills in Georgia are literally on the ballot,” said Charles Hua, executive director of consumer-education nonprofit PowerLines, during an October webinar.
The race comes as Georgia Power faces fervent criticism over its plan to spend billions of dollars building new natural-gas power plants.
“We’re always reacting to what Georgia Power is putting in front of us,” he said.
Georgia Power has pointed to challenges in expanding its power grid to allow these projects to interconnect.","The race for two seats on the obscure board that regulates Georgia’s utilities is drawing national attention — and could have major implications both for electricity affordability and one of the biggest planned fossil-fuel buildouts in the nation.

Next Tuesday, Georgia voters will choose whether to keep the state’s five-person Public Service Commission as it is, or elevate two outsiders to shake up the status quo.

Historically, PSC races have drawn a very small number of voters, but turnout in Georgia may be higher than usual this year. For one, legal issues have postponed the state’s PSC elections since 2022. The bigger driver, however, could be an issue that is rising in political salience around the country: Electricity is getting way too expensive. That’s particularly true for the 2.8 million customers of the state’s major utility, Georgia Power, for whom costs have ballooned in recent years.

“Utility bills in Georgia are literally on the ballot,” said Charles Hua, executive director of consumer-education nonprofit PowerLines, during an October webinar.

The race comes as Georgia Power faces fervent criticism over its plan to spend billions of dollars building new natural-gas power plants. Energy experts, consumer advocates, and climate activists have pressed the utility to instead prioritize solar and battery storage, which they argue is not only better for the planet but for consumers’ wallets, too.

It’s a criticism that has been echoed by both of the Democratic challengers up for election next week. Of particular note, however, is the pushback from the candidate Peter Hubbard, a 13-year energy-industry veteran with expertise in complex grid and power-resource modeling. Hubbard has personally run the numbers to back up the claims from himself and others that Georgia Power can meet its growing energy needs with clean energy, rather than gas.

If elected, Hubbard, who runs the one-person policy modeling shop Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, said he’d push Georgia Power to consider these cleaner, cheaper options — and press the commission to be more proactive in shaping the utility’s plans.

“We’re always reacting to what Georgia Power is putting in front of us,” he said. But there’s no reason why commissioners can’t drive the agenda and ​“put something in front of them” instead.

Alicia Johnson, who is running as a Democrat for the other PSC seat, has also called for more clean energy and more active oversight from the PSC to combat rising costs, particularly for disadvantaged households. Johnson is a healthcare-focused consultant and community advocate and is challenging Commissioner Tim Echols, a Republican who was first elected in 2010.

Hubbard is up against Fitz Johnson, a U.S. Army veteran and businessman who was appointed to his seat in 2021 by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican. Kemp has thrown his financial and political support behind Johnson and Echols.

“My opponent wants to take away your coal. He wants to take away your natural gas,” Fitz Johnson said during an October campaign event covered by the Macon Telegraph newspaper. ​“He wants to bring in this Green New Deal energy policy that they have in California. And I already told them, don’t California my Georgia.”

Fitz Johnson has promoted ​‘round-the-clock power from large-scale plants as the key to Georgia’s economic prosperity; in a recent Facebook post, he framed voters’ choice as one between ​“affordable, reliable energy vs. costly climate mandates and rolling blackouts.” Fitz Johnson did not respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

Taking on the utility — and the rest of the PSC

For the average household served by Georgia Power, monthly electricity bills are now a whopping $43 more than they were two years ago, according to data from the Southern Environmental Law Center.

There are several reasons for this rise, but the big two are massive cost overruns for construction of the utility’s nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused a spike in the price of gas that Georgia Power passed on to its consumers.

The current PSC signed off on both of those rate hikes. Now, Hubbard and a growing chorus of energy experts, climate activists, and consumer advocates are worried that will happen again with Georgia Power’s push to expand its gas fleet.

In July, the utility presented a new plan to the commission calling for the addition of 10 gigawatts of capacity by 2031 to its current portfolio of 14.7 gigawatts. About 60% of the infrastructure the company hopes to construct would be gas-fired power, while the remainder would be batteries. Georgia Power’s justification for the massive buildout is a projected surge in electricity demand — an expectation based almost entirely on forecast growth in data-center construction.

Rick Anderson, senior vice president and senior production officer for Georgia Power, said in a statement that the plan will ​“help us meet the needs of a growing Georgia with reliable and resilient energy while delivering long-term value for all of our customers.”

But Hubbard and others say the utility might be significantly underestimating the price tag of building and fueling new gas-fired plants.

Though Georgia Power says the buildout would cost $15.7 billion, Hubbard said the true total may reach ​“north of $20 billion,” once taxes and potential cost overruns that could be added in under construction-work-in-progress provisions are bundled in.

Hubbard is also concerned that the data centers underpinning Georgia Power’s expansion plan may fail to materialize. If the AI bubble bursts and those facilities are never built, or if developers simply choose to build in another state, customers would be stuck with even higher utility bills to pay for assets they don’t need.

A Georgia Power spokesperson told Canary Media that the utility has options to contain cost impacts on its customers if its power-demand forecasts turn out to be too high; for example, it could delay or cancel construction or sell capacity on the wholesale market.

“Nothing about the Company’s current request binds the Commission’s hands on taking actions to re-examine a certificate if forecasted needs were to change,” the spokesperson said in a September email.

But Hubbard worries that these kinds of remedial actions won’t be effective. Once the utility starts ordering power turbines, expanding gas-pipeline capacity, and taking on other construction costs, ​“you can’t unring the bell,” he said. ​“The best way to prevent that is to not make the mistake in the first place.”

To be clear, it’s not certain that Hubbard or his fellow Democratic challenger in next week’s election will have the power to make major changes at the commission. If she and Hubbard win seats on the commission, they’d have to convince at least one of the three Republicans to side with them in any decision.

Hubbard conceded that his pro-environmental stances have put him at odds with current commissioners. He’s on the record opposing the commission’s decisions this year on Georgia Power’s integrated resource plan and on a temporary rate freeze that critics say obscures the looming costs that customers may end up paying for the utility’s fossil-fuel-heavy resource mix. Hubbard has also blasted the regulatory group for being too in step with the utility.

“Frankly, the five Republican commissioners on the commission take their cues from Georgia Power,” he said.

He’s not alone in that viewpoint. Robert Baker, a Republican PSC commissioner from 1993 to 2011, told Canary Media in September that he thinks the current commission has failed to sufficiently push back on the utility’s plans.

“You’re dealing with a commission that basically rubber-stamps everything that comes its way from Georgia Power,” he said. ​“That makes it very difficult for people who have a differing opinion about what should happen, or how it should happen, to have serious input into the process.”

Even if it is an uphill battle, Hubbard said that if elected, he’d at least have the ​“bully pulpit” to raise visibility for his concerns — and push for better regulation.

The case for solar and batteries in Georgia

Right now, big solar farms are the cheapest, fastest way to add new electrons to the grid — and Georgia is one of the top states for growth of the renewable energy resource.

Meanwhile, gas turbines are in very short supply, with current estimates of backlogs for new gas-power plants stretching into the early 2030s.

That’s why Georgia Power’s proposal to focus on building out fossil-fueled infrastructure defies logic, Hubbard said.

Georgia Power has put a ​“thumb on the scale” against solar over the past half-decade or so, Hubbard said. The reason, he believes, is that the PSC has mandated that most of the utility’s solar expansion be built by third-party developers rather than Georgia Power itself. But these third-party resources are less lucrative to vertically integrated utilities like Georgia Power, which earn a guaranteed profit on the projects they build and operate.

In recent years, the utility has delayed and rejected solar procurements under competitive structures. Nearly 18 gigawatts of solar and battery projects from outside developers are now seeking to interconnect in Georgia, as Hubbard noted in May testimony to the commission — a pool of resources that could be brought online to meet the load growth the utility is facing.

Georgia Power has pointed to challenges in expanding its power grid to allow these projects to interconnect. Similar grid bottlenecks are holding back new solar, wind, and battery projects across the country.

But Hubbard said the commission could push the utility to find less congested parts of its grid where solar and battery projects could be fast-tracked. In fact, he’s familiar with the Georgia Power maps that can reveal such ​“sweet spots,” due to his work as a grid expert for solar developers in the state.

“This could tell you whether developing a solar and battery plant here could bear far higher costs than developing it at this other location,” he said. ​“What often kills a project are the interconnection costs — and those aren’t known until you go through the whole interconnection study process.”

But as a commissioner, he’d be able to access the underlying data to determine the exact mix of clean power versus fossil gas that would be most cost-effective.

“I’m going to tread carefully on all this,” he said. ​“Once I have access to all that information, I’m not sure what I’ll find. … But I want to do it.”

Your Excellencies and distinguished guests: Good afternoon. It is an honor to be here representing Citigroup, and to thank our hosts in Gyeongju for bringing us together.

For Citi, the location for this year’s APEC meetings carries special meaning. We opened our first branch in Seoul in early 1967, making Citi the first foreign bank in Korea. Since then, we’ve stood with our clients here through every transformation in the regional and global economy. And whilst it’s a privilege to speak in Korea, today’s story is far bigger than any one country.

At Citi, we see the APEC economies as an interconnected engine of global progress — spanning Asia, the Americas and the Pacific. What happens here doesn’t stay here; it shapes how the world grows, trades and connects.

Globalization isn’t vanishing; it’s changing. Growth is becoming more balanced, more digital and more distributed. The APEC economies sit at the center of that change — together accounting for 61% of global GDP and over half of global trade.

Since I last addressed APEC in 2023, we’ve seen a shift from reaction to reinvention. Back then, clients were reacting to shocks. Now, they’re investing for the long term — redesigning supply chains, digitizing operations and embedding resilience.

Three themes define how this rewiring is taking shape. First, resilience — the ability to adjust and keep moving through uncertainty. Second, innovation — new technologies and energy systems reshaping how we live and work. And third, broad-based growth — ensuring the benefits of progress reach more people, more sectors and more places.

Together, these three forces are turning APEC into a unified driver of global progress.

Let’s begin with resilience. Across APEC, resilience means more than endurance. It’s the capacity to flex, adapt and grow through disruption.

We see it in Citi’s transaction data: trade volumes and payments moving steadily across a more diverse mix of routes. Supply chains becoming multi-hub networks instead of single corridors.

This is resilience in action — from advanced manufacturing in the U.S. and Mexico to energy and logistics in Canada to semiconductors in Korea and electronics in Malaysia.

U.S.-Asia trade remains one of the fastest growing corridors for our clients. And across those flows, we’re helping them find efficiencies so tariff and transport costs don’t reach consumers.

That same spirit of adaptability is shaping the rest of the region. Korea’s evolution from agriculture to advanced technology tells that story — with Samsung, LG, Hyundai and SK now operating in more than 70 markets. So does Vietnam’s emergence as a manufacturing powerhouse. And Indonesia’s rise in energy and minerals. And Australia’s role in critical raw materials.

Across the APEC economies, resilience has become a shared advantage. And we’ve seen that resilience take shape in real time. Recent bilateral agreements between the U.S. and China, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia are practical steps toward strengthening trade stability and regional connectivity. They’re reminders that cooperation remains the foundation of resilience, even when competition is part of the equation.

If resilience is the foundation, then innovation is the engine.

The next industrial era is taking shape across the APEC economies — powered by technology, clean energy and digital connectivity.

Since 2020, more than $200 billion in private capital has flowed into frontier technologies across APEC. Generative AI alone accounts for over half of that, whilst investments in robotics and decentralized finance are accelerating rapidly. The U.S. remains the world’s largest investor in AI — about $109 billion last year — while economies throughout Asia are driving application and scale.

Together, APEC economies are forming a dynamic innovation loop: pairing North American R&D and venture capital with Asia’s manufacturing depth and speed. That partnership is delivering breakthroughs that benefit the world.

Clean-energy investment tells a similar story. Energy-transition spending across APEC now averages two percent to three percent of GDP annually. Central to this effort is China, the leader in EV and battery exports. Korea and the U.S. are expanding next-generation semiconductors and energy storage. And Japan and Australia are advancing hydrogen and carbon-capture.

In Thailand, we see this transition vividly: new EV supply chains are emerging alongside traditional ones. Chinese EV manufacturers are building in parallel with Japanese firms long anchored in internal-combustion engines.

Digital infrastructure is the connective tissue. Data centers are rising in Singapore and Malaysia. Fintech platforms are scaling in the Philippines, Chile and Mexico. And Citi’s own digital networks are ensuring that capital moves as efficiently as ideas.

In many ways, APEC is where the future is being built — one network, one innovation, one connection at a time.

Finally, broad-based growth. For globalization to endure, growth must be widely shared.

Asia’s rising middle class will represent two-thirds of global consumers by 2030. That will create new markets for U.S. exports and expand opportunity for emerging economies. Manufacturing excellence in the APEC economies is now being matched by the expanding services trade — in finance, technology, education, entertainment. Digital services alone have grown by more than three percentage points of exports since 2012.

This is where APEC can lead: pairing world-class innovation and capital with deep production capability and a youthful consumer base across Asia and the Pacific.

At Citi, we see that growth in real time. Half of our new trade-finance clients in Asia are small- and medium-sized enterprises. We’re helping women entrepreneurs access working capital. We’re financing sustainable infrastructure so smaller firms can compete globally. Because when more people and more places participate in the economy, opportunity expands and the foundations of growth become stronger.

Standing here in Gyeongju, it’s impossible not to feel the weight of history and speed of change. Centuries ago, artisans in the Silla Dynasty crafted treasures that defined an era. Today, engineers in this region — and across the Americas — are building technologies that will define the next.

The economies of APEC are not on parallel tracks. They’re interconnected engines of global progress. Each depends on the other — for markets, capital, innovation, stability.

At Citi, we’ve witnessed that interdependence for more than 120 years in this region. We came to Asia to help companies grow. Today we’re helping firms across the region expand globally. In recent months, APEC members have announced hundreds of billions in planned investments in the U.S. — a powerful signal of confidence in American enterprise and in the ties that bind this community together. Citi is proud to play a role in enabling that growth, linking capital with ideas, and ambition with opportunity.

Because in the end, the true direction of globalization isn’t east or west. It’s forward. And the future will belong to those who build it together.

Competitive Power Ventures will use the loan from the Texas Energy Fund to construct a 1,350-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant — among the more efficient types of fossil-fuel generation — in the Permian that’s expected to start up by 2029, CPV said Thursday in a statement. That’s enough to supply about 850,000 homes in West Texas, an emerging hub for data centers to run artificial intelligence.

While the $1.9 billion project has been in development for years, “I’m not sure we would have started construction without this loan,” CPV Chief Executive Officer Sherman Knight said in an interview. Because power demand had flatlined until the last couple of years, “we don’t have the muscle memory to meet load growth in many of the markets and Texas is the first. The load growth started there.”

CPV plans to tap gas supplies from Coterra Energy Inc., Devon Energy Corp. and Diamondback Energy Inc. Multiple sources of gas will enable the power plant “to maintain consistent performance during extreme weather and other critical events,” CPV said in statement. The company also said the facility will use turbines from GE Vernova Inc. The project is also fully permitted for carbon capture, which could be added in future phases, Knight said.

Texas launched the fund to build so-called dispatchable generation — plants that can easily be turned on or off — after cascading power and gas failures during an intense winter storm in 2021 left millions of people in the dark for days and killed more than 200. The legislature appropriated $5 billion for the fund for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, with an additional $4 billion added for the following two years.

The fund is targeting the construction of about 10 gigawatts of gas plants. Those projects are intended to help keep the lights on amid the rise of renewables, which provide power intermittently, and booming electricity demand from data centers. Supply-chain bottlenecks and soaring costs had forced some projects to pull out of the Texas program.

CPV is considering building other power plants in Texas as AI accelerates strong growth in electricity demand already coming from industrial users, Knight said. He declined to say whether the developer would apply for additional loans.

“I don’t know how somebody could start honestly from scratch in this type of environment and build the relationship and the coalition needed,” said Knight.

AUSTIN – Governor Greg Abbott announced the fifth Texas Energy Fund (TxEF) loan agreement for a 1,350 megawatt (MW) natural gas power plant in Ward County. Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) Basin Ranch will build the plant, which is expected to begin generating power for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power region in 2029.

“The Texas Energy Fund secured the largest capacity project to date, with 1,350 MW of new, reliable power generation coming online that will further fortify our state grid and support our growing economy for decades,” said Governor Abbott. “As one of the largest sources of dispatchable power generation for the grid, this investment is just the latest example of why Texas is the energy capital of the world. We will take every step necessary to ensure affordability and electric reliability for Texas homes and businesses across our great state.”

“The Texas Energy Fund has now financed the addition of over 3,100 MW of new, reliable power for the State of Texas,” said Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Chairman Thomas Gleeson. “There is important work still ahead, but this newest commitment to invest in Texas is a clear demonstration of the value and reliability benefits the TxEF is bringing to bear.”

“We thank Governor Greg Abbott, his administration, the Texas Legislature, the PUC, and Ward County for their continued support of the CPV Basin Ranch Energy Center that will provide critical baseload power to the citizens of Texas,” said Competitive Power Ventures CEO Sherman Knight. “Through incentives and available natural resources, Texas is paving the way for new investments and development across the state; CPV looks forward to playing a role in that future.”

At 1,350 MW, the facility has the largest capacity of any project financed by the TxEF to date. Once connected, the CPV project will become one of the largest sources of dispatchable generation capacity for the ERCOT grid.

The loan agreement between the PUC and CPV is the fifth under the TxEF’s In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans for projects that add new, dispatchable power to the ERCOT region. Under the loan agreement, total project costs are estimated to be $1.88 billion. The PUC is providing a 20-year TxEF loan of $1.12 billion, or 60% of the total project cost, at a 3% interest rate. The loan term runs from Oct. 28, 2025, through Oct. 28, 2045.

The natural gas generation facility will be built at CPV’s Basin Ranch Energy Center in Ward County. The project will interconnect in the ERCOT West Load Zone.

Under the loan agreement, the facility must meet minimum performance standards, as outlined in the In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program rules.

The TxEF is administered by the PUC through a competitive application process and rigorous financial review of proposed projects.

There are 12 TxEF In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program applications moving through a due diligence review process. Together, the projects represent 5,861 MW of proposed, new dispatchable generation for the ERCOT grid.",https://texasborderbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Power-GRid.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:59:47.970848

Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.
Duke Energy can afford to pay for this, ratepayers cannot,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a statement.
“It is Duke Energy and their investors who stand to realize enormous profits from this project,” he continued.
The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030.","Indiana regulators on Wednesday approved Duke Energy Indiana’s $3.3 billion plan — plus financing costs — to replace two coal-powered units at the west-central Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas versions.

Included was a settlement agreement with coal producers to study third-party operation of the retired coal units.

“For generations, our Cayuga power plant in Vermillion County has served the state, and today’s decision ensures it will continue to be a major source of our state’s power generation for decades to come,” a Duke Energy Indiana statement reads, in part.

After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.

After the replacement, the two combined-cycle natural gas units would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s current 1005-megawatt capacity.

The undertaking was approved as a “clean energy” project with financial incentives, including the authority to charge ratepayers for financing while the units are under construction.

Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.

The rate impact will hit in six-month increments, helping “reduce any rate shock that could be otherwise associated with implementing a construction project in base rates through a single step,” the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday order reads.

The state agency tasked with protecting utility customers previously asked regulators to reject the plan, calling it “ill-advised” in May. Office of Utility Consumer Counselor witnesses cited the sheer cost, rapidly changing regulations and technological advancements in their testimony.

Duke has estimated that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the OUCC predicting a total impact of $19.37 monthly.

Asked for a response to the approval, agency spokeswoman Olivia Rodrigo wrote, “After the IURC issues an order, the OUCC begins extensive legal and technical review. This order is 80 pages, and our staff has begun the review process, which will take time. I can not offer additional information or comment at this time as I must allow time for staff to conduct their review.”

But another intervenor in the case, utility advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition, condemned the commission’s decision.

“Forcing struggling Hoosier ratepayers to shoulder the burden of the costs and risks associated with the construction and financing of this extraordinarily expensive project is simply unfair and immoral. Duke Energy can afford to pay for this, ratepayers cannot,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a statement.

“It is Duke Energy and their investors who stand to realize enormous profits from this project,” he continued. “Profit is supposed to be a reward for risk, but the IURC order shifts the risk to ratepayers. That’s not right. Hoosier ratepayers can no longer afford to be used as cash cows for these out of state energy holding companies. It’s exceptionally unfortunate that the State of Indiana is continuing to allow this to happen.”

Olson also called the approval a “loss” for the environment, adding, “Doubling down on fossil fuels will not only increase our State’s massive contribution to climate change, but will do nothing to improve the quality of the air we breathe and the water we drink. There’s a better, cheaper, and cleaner alternative path forward that will improve outcomes for all Hoosiers. This order is taking us in the wrong direction.”

Coal unit settlement

Duke Energy Indiana’s regulatory win comes with a settlement with Reliable Energy, a trade association representing major Indiana coal producers, for a study that could result in third-party operation of the coal units at Cayuga. The group previously opposed the coal-to-gas plan.

Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement “represents a significant step toward Governor (Mike) Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply.”

“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online,” she continued. “Enabling third parties to help advance that effort demonstrates the innovative, entrepreneurial approach that defines Indiana’s energy strategy.”

The proceeds from any sale would flow to the utility’s ratepayers.

Duke Energy Indiana also invoked Braun’s name, saying the settlement “aligns” with recent executive orders “encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies and making sure there’s careful evaluation before retiring coal units.”

The utility will look at the technical feasibility of simultaneously operating the coal and natural gas units, including the potential for “full(y) decoupling” the units.

The study was set to begin as soon as regulators approved the coal-to-gas replacement and has to be done in eight months, at most, according to the settlement agreement.

The filing lays out a detailed list of what must be studied, plus a timeline for Duke Energy Indiana to follow on stakeholder engagement, a request for proposals and bidding process, a due diligence and a negotiations period.

The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030. The utility agreed not to shut them down before 2029 — and to pause demolition during the request for proposals process, until regulators say demolition can continue.",http://indianaeconomicdigest.net/Images/Images/163963.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 11:28:12.492779

EPBC Act means the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth).","Executive summary

Australia’s long-awaited overhaul of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) took a major step forward yesterday, with the introduction of a package of reform bills to Parliament.

The Australian Government tabled the Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth), along with a suite of additional bills (collectively, the EPBC Act Reforms), representing the most ambitious reform of federal environmental law in a quarter of a century.

The key features of the reforms fall under the following themes:

National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA): establishes an independent regulator with the power to enforce compliance, require audits and issue environmental protection orders. It is likely that NEPA will assess and approve proposals under delegation, with the Minister for the Environment and Water (Minister) retaining final approval powers.

National Environmental Standards (Standards): introduces legally binding, measurable Standards for matters of national environmental significance (MNES), regional planning, restoration actions and contributions, community engagement and consultation, and First Nations engagement.

Streamlined environmental impact assessment: introduces a new streamlined assessment process to replace three of the current pathways. Actions with ‘unacceptable impacts’ on protected matters will not be approved. The Minister will have the power to approve ‘national interest proposals’ (such as social housing and renewable energy projects) which do not have to strictly comply with the Standards, may have unacceptable impacts and may not be required to deliver a net gain for nature. The Bill also retains and expands the national interest exemption.

Offsets and restoration contributions: completely revamps the offset framework. Proponents will have to deliver a ‘net gain’ for nature via traditional land-based offsets or payments to a new Restoration Contributions Special Account, which will be managed by an independent Restoration Contributions Holder for restoration actions.

Regional (bioregional) planning: introduces bioregional plans to map areas for development and protection, and seeks to streamline approvals for compliant projects. Certain restricted actions will be prohibited in high-value areas (called ‘conservation zones’). Priority actions will be permitted without assessment and approval in ‘development zones’ and offset delivery will be coordinated. Pilots are already underway in some states.

Environment Information Australia (EIA): establishes the EIA as an independent body responsible for producing State of the Environment reports every two years. It will also provide the Minister, NEPA, and the public with access to high quality environmental information and data, while maintaining environmental economic accounts and a public register of national environmental information assets.

Working with First Nations partners: embeds First Nations involvement in assessment and planning processes, and in the development of Standards and bioregional plans. Additional details will follow in regulations and policy.

Despite extensive debate, there is no new ‘climate trigger’. Proponents will be required to disclose emissions and mitigation measures, but greenhouse gas considerations are simply informational.

The EPBC Act Reforms seek to reduce duplication and increase certainty for proponents. Proponents that adapt early - by designing projects in accordance with the Standards, engaging with First Nations partners from the outset, and planning for direct offsets or restoration contributions - are likely to navigate this transition more effectively. Transitional provisions will apply to projects already subject to assessment, so understanding how they operate will be critical.

What’s driving the reform

The case for environmental law reform is not new. The Samuel Review concluded that the existing federal framework is not fit for purpose. It was criticised as being too complex, slow, and ineffective in protecting biodiversity. The Government’s ‘Nature Positive Plan’, released in December 2022, responded to these findings by committing to a suite of reforms.

The current reform package represents a second attempt to legislate these commitments after earlier proposals stalled in 2024.

You can find more details about the background of these reforms in our previous article here.

Currently, the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee is expected to report back on its inquiry by 24 March 2026, with submissions closing on 5 December 2025.

Deep-dive analysis of the key elements of the reforms

National Environmental Protection Agency

The NEPA Bill proposes to establish a new independent statutory entity, the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), with broad ranging powers and functions, including the power to:

Issue Environment Protection Orders (EPO), requiring (for example) work to cease;

Require a broader range of people to carry out a directed environmental audit; and

Require a new form of audit called a compliance audit.

Background

The Samuel Review included several recommendations related to the compliance and enforcement regime under the EPBC Act. While the Samuel Review did not recommend the establishment of the NEPA, it did recommend consolidating compliance and enforcement powers, and emphasised that the current regime is ineffective for several reasons:

Powers for enforcement and compliance are restrictive and outdated and can only be applied in a piecemeal fashion;

‘Serious enforcement action’ is rarely used;

Increased surveillance and monitoring of compliance with the EPBC Act is required; and

Penalties are not commensurate to the offences.

At a high level, the reforms respond to the recommendations in the Samuel Review.

NEPA’s functions and powers

NEPA will administer Australia’s national environmental laws that implement Australia’s international commitments and obligations, including the EPBC Act, and laws that regulate sea dumping, hazardous waste, ozone protection and synthetic greenhouse gas management, product emissions, recycling and waste reduction, and underwater cultural heritage.

It will have significant compliance and enforcement powers (more below).

What’s new?

The core function of NEPA will be to act as independent regulator with administration and enforcement powers and functions.

Under the current EPBC Act, the Minister has the power to apply to the Federal Court for an injunction or remediation order. However, often this does not provide the Minister with adequate powers to prevent imminent or serious damage to MNES.

The reforms will empower the CEO of NEPA to issue Environment Protection Orders which may require work to cease - either in writing or in urgent circumstances, verbally. This power may be exercised if there is a likely or actual contravention of the EPBC Act which poses an imminent risk of serious damage to the environment. Notably, the CEO is not required to observe any requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in issuing an Environment Protection Order.

As part of its compliance function, the CEO:

Will have powers to require a broader range of people to carry out a directed environmental audit, extending beyond the holder of an approval, to persons who are subject to an EPO, a conservation order, a remediation determination, or a remediation order; and

Can require a new form of audit called a compliance audit, to monitor compliance with matters such as approval conditions, EPO requirements or the scope of an exemption.

These audits must be carried out by an authorised officer (that is, a warden or inspector) or registered auditor. NEPA will establish a register of third party auditors for the purposes of the Act. Regulations will determine such matters as the form and content of the register, how it is published and the requirements auditors must meet in order to maintain registration.

The CEO will also have the power to:

Issue various permits including trading of, keeping or moving listed marine species of wildlife, (noting that the CEO must take the precautionary principle into account in making certain decisions;

Request information relating to the performance of the CEO’s functions from any person or body;

Disclose information to various Commonwealth entities, State or Territory bodies for the purposes of law enforcement, to assist the Head of Environment Information Australia or if the CEO reasonably believes the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious risk to the environment or human health;

Monitor and audit the operation of:

Declarations made by the Minister:

That a specified class of actions do not require approval because they are approved under an accredited management or authorisation framework;

Accrediting a management arrangement or authorisation (i.e. ensuring the Minister does not give preference to one State over another in accreditation);

Bilateral agreements; and

Bioregional plans

Make recommendations to the Minister to improve regulation.

Increase in penalties

The reforms significantly increase the maximum penalties that can be imposed under the EPBC Act. The reforms propose to introduce a new formula for determining penalties which take into account the benefit derived by the non-compliance and ensure that non-compliance is not perceived as merely the ‘cost of doing business’. While the penalty units for the offences remain consistent with current penalties, the ability to seek fines as a proportion of turnover could result in a penalty of up to $825,000,000.

We set out a comparison of the current maximum civil penalties that can be imposed under the EPBC Act and the maximum penalties under the EPBC Act reforms (including for breaching a condition of an approval issued under the EPBC Act and a range of other offences):

Current EPBC Act Proposed reforms Individual $1,650,000 The higher of:

5,000 penalty units; (i.e. $1,650,000) or

3 x the total value of any benefit obtained and/or detriment avoided as a result of the contravention (if the court can determine these amounts).

Body corporate $16,500,000 The higher of:

50,000 penalty units (i.e. $16,500,000);

3 x the total value of any benefit obtained and/or detriment avoided as a result of the contravention (if the court can determine these amounts); or

10% of the company’s annual turnover for the 12 months ending at the end of the month in which the contravention occurred (up to a maximum of 2.5 million penalty units (i.e. $825,000,000)).

National environmental standards

Consistent with a central recommendation in the Samuel Review, the Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) (the Bill) introduces a power for the Minister to make, vary and revoke National Environmental Standards (Standards) by legislative instrument.

The Standards are therefore not included in the Bill, but Minister Watt has indicated that draft Standards relating to at least offsets and MNES will be published imminently.

A Standard must prescribe outcomes or objectives, and may also prescribe parameters, principles, processes or actions for achieving the outcomes or objectives. The Minister has a broad discretion to make a Standard, subject to following a prescribed procedure (including public consultation), and being satisfied that the Standard promotes the objects of the EPBC Act and is not inconsistent with relevant international agreements. In revoking or varying a Standard, the Minister must comply with a ‘no regression’ principle by ensuring that environmental protections are not reduced.

The Bill provides for the mandatory use of the Standard in a number of decision-making processes, although regulations (which are not yet available) will prescribe which Standards are to be applied in each case. For example, the following actions by the Minister under the EPBC Act must not be inconsistent with a relevant Standard (to be prescribed by regulation):

A decision to approve the taking of an action;

A decision to revoke, vary or add to a condition of an approval;

A decision to extend an approval period;

A decision to enter into a bilateral agreement, or to accredit a State or Territory management or authorisation framework; and

A decision to make a bioregional plan or protection statement.

Additionally, the Bill will also give the Minister power to make rulings on how the law, regulations or subordinate instruments (including the Standards) should be applied in particular circumstances. The Minister, the CEO of NEPA and other delegated decision makers must act consistently with any such ruling. How, and how often, this power is intended to be used by the Minister is yet unknown.

The existing list of MNES has not been amended, with the new Standards mainly shaping how those existing matters are assessed and protected.

Even where a Standard is not required to be applied in making a decision under the EPBC Act, a decision maker can still choose to have regard to it in making a decision if they consider it to be relevant to the decision.

Transitional arrangements

The Minister’s power to make Standards will commence on the day after the Bill receives Royal Assent. The provisions that provide for the Standards to be applied in decision-making processes will commence on the earlier of a day (or days) fixed by Proclamation, or 12 months after the provisions receive Royal Assent.

The Standards will be relevant to all projects which trigger the need for assessment under the EPBC Act. As enabling legislation, the Bill leaves much of the detail to the subordinate regulations and the Standards themselves.

New streamlined assessment process and a focus on assessment and approval bilateral agreements

The Bill proposes several changes to the assessment framework for controlled actions, which are intended to streamline assessments and achieve a quicker turnaround on approvals.

Mechanisms to streamline the assessment framework include:

Repealing existing Division 3A (assessment on referral information), Division 4 (assessment on preliminary documentation) and Division 5 (assessment by public environment report) of Part 8 of the EPBC Act and replacing them with a new Division 5A, which would contain a new streamlined assessment pathway; and

Clarifying that if approval of the taking of an action is dealt with in another way (such as under a bilateral agreement or in a bioregional plan), the action cannot generally be referred for assessment.

One key change relates to Ministerial decisions that a referred proposal is not a controlled action (including decisions that it is not a controlled action if undertaken in a particular manner). Such decisions will cease to have effect after five years if the action is not substantially commenced.

Significant changes have been made to the bilateral agreement framework and the reconsideration framework. We will provide more detailed updates on these critical processes in the near future.

Unacceptable impacts

For each protected matter, the Bill sets out a range of unacceptable impacts. An approval cannot be granted for a proposal which will have an unacceptable impact.

National interest proposals

The Minister will, however, have a specific discretionary power to approve the taking of an action that would be inconsistent with a Standard, results in unacceptable impacts, or does not deliver a net gain for nature, in circumstances where:

The proposed action is a ‘national interest proposal’; and

The Minister is satisfied that, if the approval of the taking of the action is inconsistent with one or more of the Standards, the inconsistencies are reasonably necessary for the taking of the action to result in the intended outcome for national interest.

The Bill provides a process for a proponent to apply to the Minister for a determination that the taking of an action is a ‘national interest proposal’. The information that is required to be included in any such application will be included in subsequent regulations. In considering the proposal, the Minister will consider the intended outcome of the proposal and whether that outcome is in Australia’s national interest. This may include considerations of Australia’s defence, security, strategic interests or international obligations.

National interest exemption

The Bill provides for an expanded national interest exemption, which would be subject to conditions and limited to a specific timeframe. When deciding whether to grant a national interest exemption, the Minister may consider Australia’s defence, security or a national emergency (but may consider other matters). The exemption was recommended in the Samuel Review as something to be granted in only extraordinary and rare circumstances. However, the provisions in the Bill do not constrain the Minister’s power or discretion. Any decision to grant a national interest exemption must be supported by a statement of reasons.

No climate trigger – but emissions reporting mandatory

Despite extensive debate, there is no new ‘climate trigger’. Proponents will be required to disclose emissions and mitigation measures, but greenhouse gas considerations are simply informational. We foreshadowed this in our previous article (which you can find here), which reflects the Government’s intention to continue addressing climate policy through the Safeguard Mechanism.

Transitional arrangements

If the Bill passes, the provisions will commence by proclamation, or within 12 months of Royal Assent (whichever is earlier). Different transitional arrangements will apply to different projects:

Projects with a referral decision but no final decision will continue to be assessed under the current provisions of the EPBC Act (including projects assessed under existing bilateral arrangements);

Projects with no referral decision at the time the provisions commence will generally be subject to the amended legislation; and

Amendments to the bilateral agreement framework will generally apply to agreements entered into or varied on or after the date of commencement.

The new assessment and approval requirements will not apply to projects currently under assessment which have received a referral decision but are yet to be finally determined.

These amendments will have a significant impact in project design and assessment timelines, particularly for major infrastructure, renewable energy, critical mineral, and housing projects.

Offsets and restoration contributions

The Samuel Review criticised the EPBC Act environmental offsets policy, finding that it was “ineffective at compensating for loss and inconsistently implemented”.

Currently, environmental offsets may be required as a condition of EPBC Act approval to ensure that a project does not result in a net loss to protected matters.

Offsets, ‘net gain’ and mitigation hierarchy enshrined

The EPBC Act Reforms propose to enshrine environmental offsets in the EPBC Act, consistent with a new “avoid, mitigate, repair, offset” hierarchy (the ‘mitigation hierarchy’) and net gain requirement,

When might offsets be required?

Under the EPBC Act Reforms, offsets may be required if an approval to undertake a controlled action is issued and there is a “residual significant impact” on protected matters (i.e. where they will not be avoided, mitigated or repaired).

Where an action will have a residual significant impact on a protected matter, the Minister can impose conditions on the approval, requiring the project proponent to:

Compensate or offset the impact; and/or

Pay a restoration contribution charge.

In making such a decision, the Minister must consider whether the project proponent has taken appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate or repair the relevant impact or damage to protected matters.

Offsets for residual significant impacts must also pass the ‘net gain test’ under the Bill, without which the taking of an action cannot be approved by the Minister. The net gain test is met if the approval includes a condition requiring the holder to compensate for damage and / or pay a restoration contribution charge, and requirements prescribed in the regulations are met. It is possible for the Minister to approval a national interest proposal even where the net gain test is not satisfied.

Payment as alternative to securing direct offsets (restoration contribution charge)

The Minister cannot impose a condition on an approval requiring the payment of a restoration contribution charge unless the proponent consents to the condition.

The amount of the restoration contribution charge will be calculated using a methodology to be prescribed in further regulations. This will factor in the complex range of costs that would be required to deliver restoration actions, including monitoring, management and other administrative costs.

The restoration contribution charge will be paid into the new Restoration Contributions Special Account. A new independent office of the Restoration Contributions Holder will be created to deliver on restoration actions strategically directed at offsetting aggregated impacts from projects which have been approved subject to conditions requiring a ‘net gain’.

It is understood that a Standard for offsets will be released shortly, which will contain the requirements for delivery of offsets.

Nature Repair Market certificates’ use for offsetting purpose

The Bill will modify the current prohibition under the Nature Repair Act 2023 (Cth) on using biodiversity certificates issued under that Act for an environmental offsetting purposes.

Certificates will be able to be used to offset impacts if:

The methodology determination for the registered biodiversity project specifies that a biodiversity certificate for the project may be used for an environmental offsetting purpose; and

Any requirements under the Nature Repair Market are met.

When offsets cannot be used

As an approval cannot generally be granted for a proposal which will have an unacceptable impact, offsets cannot be used to compensate for unacceptable impacts on protected matters.

Potential impacts

Creating a government procurer of offsets (that is, the Restoration Contributions Holder) will provide flexibility to achieve larger, landscape-scale conservation and restoration actions funded by project proponents. This may also create potential revenue streams for landowners within conservation zones.

The ability for biodiversity certificates to be used for environmental offsetting purposes brings an opportunity to increase the demand for biodiversity certificates under the Nature Repair Market.

Regional planning

The EPBC Act currently includes two mechanisms for approving actions at a landscape scale, thereby facilitating the consideration of cumulative impacts. These are bioregional plans and secondly, endorsement of a policy, plan or program following a strategic assessment. Actions undertaken in accordance with a bioregional plan or an endorsed policy, plan or program do not require separate approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act.

The Samuel Review concluded that both bioregional plans and strategic assessments have a history of limited use. The Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) seeks to address recommendations of the Samuel Review in relation to bioregional plans and strategic assessments. The Bill does not propose to make wholesale changes to strategic assessment so we have focused on the bioregional planning framework below.

Bioregional plans

The Environment Protection Reform Bill 2025 (Cth) repeals most, if not all, of the existing provisions pertaining to bioregional plans and starts afresh. Under the new regime, a bioregional plan will apply to a specified region, and will identify:

Development zones, and the class of action (or classes of actions) that can be undertaken in each development zone (referred to as a ‘priority action’);

Conservation zones, and the class of action (or classes of actions) that are prohibited in each conservation zone (referred to as a ‘restricted action’); and

Bioregional restoration measures (i.e. measures required to mitigate, repair or compensate for likely damage to nationally protected matters, such as the payment of a bioregional plan restoration contribution).

A proponent will be able to undertake priority actions in development zones without requiring further approvals under the EPBC Act, if they have registered the priority action and comply with the relevant conditions contained in the bioregional plan. Restricted actions will not be able to be undertaken in a conservation zone, unless the proponent has obtained an exemption.

The boundaries of development zones and conservation zones will be determined having regard to certain specified matters such as the location and habitat of any listed threatened species, ecological communities or migratory species.

A proponent will (generally) not be able to refer an action for assessment and approval under other relevant provisions of the EPBC Act if the action is addressed under a bioregional plan.

Before making a bioregional plan, the Minister must be satisfied that impacted nationally protected matters will be compensated to a net gain. Bioregional plans will be initiated and developed in collaboration with States and Territories, and they cannot be made by the Minister without the relevant State or Territory’s agreement.

Implications

The new bioregional plans will allow proponents to identify both ‘go’ and ‘no-go’ zones for development, providing greater certainty in relation to project approvals and reducing assessment timelines in ‘go’ zones.

It is understood that a number of bioregional plans are already in the pipeline, including plans relating to renewable energy projects (Victoria and Queensland), critical mineral projects (Victoria and Queensland), and urban development (South East Queensland and New South Wales).

While increased certainty is good for proponents, it is also anticipated that an uptake in the use of strategic assessments and bioregional plans will result in better environmental outcomes, by shifting the focus from impacts at a project level to a landscape scale, thereby better accounting for and addressing cumulative impacts.

However, the determination of ‘no go zones’ will need to be carefully managed to ensure they do not adversely affect property values.

Environment Information Australia

A separate Environment Information Australia Bill 2025 (Cth) (EIA Bill) has been reintroduced, remaining largely consistent with the 2024 version (discussed here), with the exception that the definition of ‘nature positive’ and associated monitoring and reporting frameworks have been removed. The EIA Bill establishes a new statutory framework for the provision, management and reporting of environmental information and data at the national level.

The EIA Bill creates the independent position of Head of Environment Information Australia (Head), located within the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) but operating independently of direction by the Secretary or Minister. The Head is responsible for:

Providing the Minister and the CEO of NEPA with high quality environmental information and data relevant to their statutory functions;

Providing the community with access to high quality information and data relating to the environment;

Preparing and publishing biennial State of the Environment reports by 15 December, drawing on scientific and First Nations knowledge;

Developing environmental economic accounts in collaboration with the Australian Bureau of Statistics, to statistically describe the condition of the environment and its relationship with the economy, which will be tabled in Parliament; and

Declaring and maintaining a register of national environmental information assets.

Within six months of each State of the Environment report, the Minister will be required to table a response in Parliament, specifying the environmental targets to be achieved and the period to achieve them. These are the national environmental goals.

The Explanatory Memorandum states:

These responsibilities would require the Government to regularly consider its environmental policy settings and targets and respond with actions to protect the environment.

The provision of a public environment data portal is also anticipated.

Entrusted persons will be able to use or disclose certain information in accordance with the EIA Bill, with civil penalties for unauthorised use or disclosure of protected information. An entrusted person is defined narrowly and includes the Head, public servants in DCCEEW and prescribed persons performing functions or exercising powers under the EIA Bill.

The EIA Act will commence concurrently with the National Environmental Protection Agency Act, and will be subject to five-yearly independent reviews. Further detail will be provided in ministerial rules and the anticipated Standard for environmental data, once available.

Working with First Nations partners

The Samuel Review identified shortcomings in the EPBC Act for failing to fulfil its objectives regarding the role of Indigenous Australians in protecting and conserving biodiversity, working in partnership with them and promoting the respectful use of their knowledge. The EPBC Act does not require explicit consideration of First Nations’ values and knowledge when making environmental and heritage management decisions.

Consultation and engagement

The EPBC Act Reforms seek to improve and enshrine consultation and engagement requirements with First Nations peoples.

Under the reforms, the Minister must invite the Indigenous Advisory Committee to provide comments before making, varying or revoking a Standard that relates to engagement with Indigenous Australians. The proposed ‘no regression principle’ will require the Minister to be satisfied that appropriate consultation or engagement with Indigenous persons will not be reduced, before varying or revoking a Standard.

The Government has indicated that a separate Standard for First Nations consultation will be released in due course, We are unaware of any consultations on the Standard to date.

The EPBC Act Reforms propose to also expand the role of the Indigenous Advisory Committee to providing input on a range of matters, including the environment, policies, plans or programs developed under the EPBC Act, and responding to requests for advice from DCCEEW or NEPA.

Heritage protections

Anticipated concurrent reforms to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (Cth) have not yet been tabled, and there is no indication from the Government about whether we are likely to see a draft package of amendments to this Act.

The Government has not sought to establish an Indigenous Engagement and Participation Committee and has instead maintained the existing Indigenous Advisory Committee, a strictly advisory body that is unable to make binding requirements on matters relevant to First Nations peoples.

Next steps and how to have your say

The EPBC Act Reform bills have now been introduced to Parliament, and the reform process has entered its next phase. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee is tasked with examining the legislation and yesterday confirmed that the inquiry, which was initially expected to conclude within a month, will instead report in five months.

While the Government originally signalled an intention to expedite passage of the legislation before the end of 2025, this timeline has since been revised.

The extension provides stakeholders with a longer window in which to engage with the detail of the reforms, and make submissions before the deadline on 5 December 2025.

Please contact us if you would like more information about the reforms, assistance with planning for future projects, or support in preparing submissions for the Senate Committee.

We will be hosting a series of sector-focused roundtables and webinars exploring the reforms. You can subscribe for future updates here.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely.
GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present after earlier layoffs at the plant.
“The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond,” Fain said.
In a separate restructuring move, GM cut about 500 white-collar jobs in the last week, the company said.","General Motors said it will cut U.S. electric vehicle and battery production and 1,200 factory jobs at its EV plant in Detroit along with 550 jobs at an Ohio battery plant as the automaker responds to a significant slowdown in demand for its battery cars.

The Detroit automaker said it will halt battery cell production at its two U.S. joint-venture battery plants – in Tennessee and Ohio – in January for about six months. It added it will also temporarily lay off about 1,550 workers at the battery factories.

In addition, at the Ohio plant, GM said it will lay off 550 workers indefinitely. GM operates the Ohio plant jointly with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution 373220.KS.

GM said it will cut production at its Detroit EV plant to just one shift starting in January, compared with the two shifts at present after earlier layoffs at the plant. This will cut output by about 50%, it said. The plant produces three large electric pickup trucks, including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, as well as the EV Escalade IQ and Hummer SUV.

Slower EV Adoption

GM said the cuts were “in response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment.” GM lobbied Congress and the White House to ease emissions requirements and last month also cut its EV production.

Automakers in the U.S. are backpedaling hard on their EV plans, anticipating a sharp drop in consumer demand following the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers. Some executives and analysts have said EV sales – which exceeded 10% of overall U.S. car sales over the summer – could fall by half in coming months.

Nissan 7201.T, Jeep-maker Stellantis STLAM.MI and other automakers have canceled plans for future electric models. Earlier this month, GM said it was canceling production of its electric BrightDrop van, citing slow development in the commercial EV van market.

Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions, said he expected more U.S. auto industry EV job cuts to follow and “lower EV production than we’ve seen over the last few years and higher prices.”

GM has been paring its outlook for EV sales and made other EV production cuts this year.

United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain blasted GM for the job cuts, noting the company raised expected annual profits to $13 billion this month. “The UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both (internal combustion engine) and EV production at GM and beyond,” Fain said.

In a separate restructuring move, GM cut about 500 white-collar jobs in the last week, the company said.

In 2021, GM said it planned to transition to all EV sales by 2035 and boosted spending, but has since been retrenching.

GM CEO Mary Barra said last week “with an evolving regulatory framework and the end of the federal consumer incentives, it’s clear that near-term EV adoption will be much lower than planned.”

She added that GM expected to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond.

The company took a $1.6 billion charge earlier this month related to changes in its EV strategy.

GM shares closed down 1% at $69.19 at midday on Wednesday. The shares have gained more than 35% so far this year.

The measure contains multiple provisions to tackle rising energy costs while transitioning Illinois to a cleaner, more reliable grid.
The legislation incentivizes measures that lower electricity prices by addressing the demand for energy and increasing grid capacity through things like energy storage.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples.
Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation.

According to the report, total electricity demand in ERCOT rose 4.2% year over year in Q3 2025, marking a 25% increase since 2020, as population, industrial activity, and data center growth continue to expand. Natural gas supplied 47.6% of ERCOT’s total generation, more than wind and solar combined, while thermal and other dispatchable resources provided at least half of ERCOT’s power in more than 90% of all hours this quarter.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples. “Reliable and affordable electricity is a key pillar in the foundation of the Lone State State’s economy, and natural gas generation continues to ensure both, powering homes, businesses, and industry while supporting continued economic prosperity and environmental progress.”

ERCOT’s total generation has increased nearly 25% over the past five years, with natural gas, wind, and solar driving most of the gains. Yet even as renewable generation expands, firm, dispatchable power remains essential. The region’s net peak load, the maximum hourly level of power required when wind and solar output decline, reached approximately 70 gigawatts (GW) in Q3 2025, underscoring the capacity ERCOT must maintain to ensure grid reliability.

“Natural gas remains the single most important source of power in ERCOT,” TXOGA Chief Economist Dr. Dean Foreman said in a news release. “It offers unmatched scale, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness — the stability Texans depend on to meet rising demand, integrate renewables, and keep electricity affordable.”

The report also highlights the abundance of Texas natural gas supply. TXOGA estimates that Texas produced an average of 28.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry natural gas in Q3 2025, about four times more than ERCOT’s power sector consumed. Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation. Since 2020, power-sector gas use has increased 15%, reflecting sustained growth in dispatchable generation and industrial demand.

The Texas Electricity Power Pulse will be published quarterly to provide policymakers, media, and the public with clear, fact-based insights into how ERCOT’s performance and Texas’ natural gas production together underpin the state’s energy reliability and economic vitality.

TXOGA remains committed to advancing policies and investments that ensure safe, reliable, and affordable energy for Texas, the nation, and global partners. For more insights and data, and to view the full TEPP report, visit txoga.org/economics.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-10-31 04:03:59+00:00,Crain's Detroit Business,ChatGPT creator OpenAI plans massive data center in Michigan | Crain's Detroit Business,"Crain's Detroit Business, www.facebook.com, Kurt Nagl, David Eggert",,,,,https://www.crainsdetroit.com/economic-development/chatgpt-creator-openai-plans-massive-data-center-michigan,"Much of the investment in a data center is in the computing equipment that the center houses.
Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.
DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project.
The project, when completed, may be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center amid a surge of demand for AI and cloud computing capacity.
Whitmer met virtually with OpenAI’s boss, as well as representatives from Related Digital and DTE, in mid-March for a more formal conversation.","“Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,” Whitmer said in a Thursday news release.

The announcement comes in the wake of some high-profile flameouts on major manufacturing projects, including a proposed microchip factory near Flint that previously could have been the largest economic project in Michigan history until backers pulled the plug earlier this year.

OpenAI's push comes amid a mad dash of spending on data centers that has accompanied the gold rush in AI.

Part of OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project in the U.S., the Saline Township data center is being developed by Dallas-based Related Digital and would be operated by Austin-based Oracle Corp., which would lease the computing power to OpenAI.

The data center, spanning 1.65 million square feet across three buildings, would come with 450 permanent “high-skill, high-paying” jobs on site as well as 1,500 permanent jobs throughout Washtenaw County to support the project. The state and developers did not immediately respond to Crain's inquiries on what those jobs would consist of.

Construction is expected to start early next year, creating 2,500 union trades jobs, according to the release.

Michigan is not providing cash subsidies to the project, according to Whitmer’s office, though data centers do have incentives to build in the state. Thursday’s announcement comes 10 months after the governor signed bills to exempt data centers from paying the state’s 6% sales and use tax on equipment if they spend at least $250 million to build or expand.

A sponsor of that legislation, Sen. Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores, said it ""served as the catalyst for us to secure the largest investment in Michigan's history. This is a monumental win for the hardworking families who call our state home.""

The companies would not disclose a dollar figure for the project cost, but the governor's office said it is higher than the largest corporate investment announced previously in Michigan, which was General Motors Co.’s $7 billion electrification expansion. Much of the investment in a data center is in the computing equipment that the center houses.

“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice president of industrial compute, in a Related Digital news release. “By expanding Stargate to Michigan, we can strengthen domestic supply chains, create good jobs, and help more communities share in the economic opportunities AI is creating.”

Data centers have been cropping up across communities throughout the U.S. as Google, Meta, Amazon and others plunge massive amounts of capital into the AI arms race.

Not all communities have been welcoming.

In Washtenaw County alone, plans for a $1.2 billion University of Michigan-Los Alamos supercomputer in Ypsilanti Township sparked public backlash, a proposed data center in Augusta Township sought by New York City-based Thor Equities faces resident pushback and in Saline Township — where OpenAI announced Thursday it will plant its flag — board trustees tried unsuccessfully to block the development.

“We’re a bunch of farmers and want to keep it that way. I hate to say it, but we’re the last of them,” Tom Hammond, a Saline Township board trustee, told Crain’s in July. “We’ve always promoted staying rural. We love our farming community and everything. I guess that’s my stance on it.”

In September, Related Digital and three sets of local property owners sued the township after its board, with support from residents, blocked the developer’s request that the agricultural land be rezoned as industrial/research property. The lawsuit alleged “exclusionary zoning.”

The parties settled a month later, with the township agreeing to the rezoning and Related agreeing to pay $14 million, including $8 million to fire departments, $4 million to preserve farmland and $2 million for “community investment.”

Data centers have stoked concern among residents over environmental impact, water usage and increased energy costs for ratepayers. Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.

DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project. She said the utility’s customers would not pay more due to the data center and would benefit because the company would not have to seek as high of a rate increase in the future.

""DTE Energy is supplying 100% of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment — financed entirely by the project — in a way that ensures there is no impact on DTE’s existing customers’ energy supply or rates,"" the release said.

Developers are also boasting that the project is a LEED-certified design, which uses a closed-loop system for cooling, limiting daily water use “to levels comparable to an office building.”

“We are proud to be developing this critical project exclusively for Oracle and contributing to keeping our nation competitive in the global AI race,” said Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies and Chairman of Related Digital, in the release.

Related Digital is a subsidiary of New York City-based Related Cos., which was founded by University of Michigan megadonor Stephen Ross in 1972. Ross has no formal role with Related Digital, a spokesperson said. He is the nonexecutive chairman of Related Cos but stepped away from operations last year to launch a new company, Related Ross, focused on development in West Palm Beach, Fla.

The project, when completed, may be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center amid a surge of demand for AI and cloud computing capacity. Jackson-based Consumers Energy, whose electric service territory includes much of the Lower Peninsula outside of metro Detroit and the Thumb, announced a hyperscale data center in July but has not released the center’s developer or its location pending a final agreement.

The Saline Township project, nicknamed “The Barn” in a nod to a historic red barn being preserved near the site entrance, is composed of three 550,000-square-foot buildings. It is being funded by a “consortium of leading private investors and financial institutions.”

Detroit-based Walbridge was selected as the general contractor for the project, which still must be approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michigan has been hurting for a big economic development win, having seen a flurry of electric vehicle and cleantech projects go kaput in recent months, including the collapse of the Gotion factory near Big Rapids. A $60 billion Sandisk microchip factory near Flint fell from its grasp this summer.

Whitmer had her eyes on OpenAI for the past year and her office reached out to the company in the second half of 2024, spokesman Bobby Leddy said.

October 2025 Gaps Progress Report Released by ANSI Electric Vehicles Standards Panel

NEW YORK, Oct. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In an effort to support the safe, widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and associated infrastructure across the nation, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) released today the October 2025 Gaps Progress Report. This vital document reflects efforts by standards developing organizations (SDOs) and other stakeholders to address the gaps identified in the Roadmap of Standards and Codes for Electric Vehicles at Scale, published in 2023 by the ANSI Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP). The progress report provides updates on standards, research, and conformity assessment activities against 31 previously identified gaps. It also captures suggested modifications to existing gaps, such as prioritization and scoping, and identifies 21 additional gaps to be considered for future roadmaps.

The June 2023 roadmap identified 37 standardization gaps and corresponding recommendations across the areas of vehicle systems, charging infrastructure, grid integration, and cybersecurity. Of the 37 gaps, 14 were identified as high priority, 20 as medium priority, and three as low priority. In 23 cases, additional pre-standardization research and development activities were identified as needed. Representatives from 130 public- and private-sector organizations supported the roadmap's development, including U.S. federal government agencies and national laboratories, SDOs, industry, academia, and others.

The gaps report is not a consensus document, but rather is intended to serve as a ""living document"" that will be maintained and periodically re-published as standards development work continues or until the EVSP undertakes a next version of its roadmap.

The ANSI EVSP is a cross-sector coordinating body whose objective is to foster coordination and collaboration on standardization matters among public- and private-sector stakeholders to enable the safe, mass deployment of EVs and associated infrastructure in the United States with international coordination, adaptability, and engagement. It does not itself develop standards.

The next gaps progress report is expected to be issued in spring 2026. To receive future updates, suggest edits to the report, or to get involved in EVSP activities, email evsp@ansi.org. For more information, visit www.ansi.org/evsp.

CHARLOTTE, NC, UNITED STATES, October 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Solatube Premier Dealer Carolina Skylights has announced a limited-time promotion on bundled daylighting systems and accessories. Homeowners across North and South Carolina can now take advantage of special year-end pricing on Solatube Tubular Skylights and home ventilation products designed to enhance comfort, improve indoor air quality, and reduce energy costs. This promotion aligns with the final months of the 30% federal solar tax credit, set to expire at the end of the year, creating a unique opportunity for homeowners to maximize savings on eligible daylighting installations.

Advanced Technology for Naturally Lit Interiors

Solatube Daylighting Systems use advanced optical domes and patented tubing to capture sunlight from the roof and deliver it deep into interior spaces, helping to brighten rooms without direct roof access. Unlike traditional skylights, Solatube systems are engineered for minimal heat gain, consistent, glare-free illumination, and fast, mess-free installation.

The highly reflective, sealed tubing allows daylight to travel around attic obstacles and through tight spaces, brightening kitchens, bathrooms, closets, hallways, and other interior rooms that often lack natural light. Homeowners frequently report reduced reliance on artificial lighting, improved visual comfort, more vibrant colors, and rooms that feel larger and more inviting. Increased exposure to natural light can also support circadian rhythm regulation, contributing to better mood and improved sleep quality.

“Now is the perfect time for Carolinians to rethink their lighting, comfort, and energy use,” said Rachel Metz of Carolina Skylights. “With the federal solar tax credit nearing its end, our goal is to make healthy, energy-efficient daylight accessible to every homeowner.”

In 2009, at least 12 Duke Energy employees submitted comments to EPA advocating for weak coal ash regulations that would do little to change coal ash disposal practices.
They deny that coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, or that it harms North Carolina’s waterways.
Capping and sealing is highly ineffective as it leaves coal ash in place to pollute in perpetuity.
While the public continues to bear the costs of coal ash pollution, Duke Energy spent $5.99 million in 2013 alone on federal lobbying including efforts to block protective coal ash regulations.","Four days after the Southeast’s most recent coal ash disaster began, Duke Energy has yet to stop coal ash flowing into the Dan River. The impoundment failure is now the nation’s 3rd worst coal ash disaster and 13 additional Duke Energy power plants lurk across the state with old ash impoundments, already cited in lawsuits as problematic. The murky grey plume of toxic waste continues to travel downstream and is now entering Danville, VA’s drinking water intake. Officials there continue to say the water is safe to drink despite the lack of lab results from NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) testing for toxic heavy metals in the contaminated river or the drinking water itself.

Test results from Waterkeeper Alliance show that heavy metal levels are significantly higher than drinking water standards allow. Their independently verified samples taken at the site of the spill show arsenic levels that are 35 times higher and lead at 1,000 times greater than EPA drinking water standards. Since the spill began, both Duke Energy and the NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources have been slow to update the public on developments. Groups on the ground now tell us the utility may be trying to block public access to the river near the coal ash spill.

Today, Duke Energy announced it will address coal ash storage issues at eight retired plant sites across North Carolina, including at the Dan River plant. It’s a shame and a sham for the public that it takes this kind of disaster for Duke Energy to finally admit their impoundments are outdated and to start doing the right thing to clean up its coal ash. Duke has fought against proper, comprehensive regulation of the toxic waste for years.

In 2009, at least 12 Duke Energy employees submitted comments to EPA advocating for weak coal ash regulations that would do little to change coal ash disposal practices. In these comments, Duke argued that protective safeguards will cost the utility too much to implement and claim everything is fine. They deny that coal ash contains toxic heavy metals, or that it harms North Carolina’s waterways.

“Utilities have safely managed [coal combustion residuals (CCRs)] in hundreds of surface impoundments for decades… Our surface impoundments are sound, and we are committed to continue operating them safely.” Testified George Everette, Director of Environmental and Legislative Affairs for Duke Energy at public hearings for a federal coal ash rule on Sept. 14, 2010.

In today’s statement, a Duke spokesperson said the utility will consider two methods for closing impoundments: “capping and sealing” where ash is left in place and covered with a thick membrane and complete removal of ash to lined landfills. Unfortunately this announcement sounds much better than it really is and has no binding timeline or commitment.

Capping and sealing is highly ineffective as it leaves coal ash in place to pollute in perpetuity. The absence of an impermeable linerunderneath the ash means toxic heavy metals can continue to leach into soil, ground and surface waters. Capping is an outdated closure method and would not have prevented the Dan River spill. It is an unacceptable plan for dealing with Duke’s 16.7 billion gallons of ash across the state.

Before this disaster, DENR had determined the Dan River plant was operating illegally and Duke chose to do nothing. This spill was a failure of Duke’s routine maintenance, it wasn’t caused by a natural disaster or extenuating circumstances, reinforcing the reality that it’s nearly impossible to safely operate these old coal ash impoundments. The only effective means of addressing these impoundments is to remove the ash away into new dry, lined landfills that are safely away from public waterways, just like Santee Cooper plans to do in South Carolina.

There is plenty of evidence (in addition to the ongoing Dan River spill) to the contrary; that’s why the state of North Carolina is suing Duke Energy to stop coal ash pollution. While the public continues to bear the costs of coal ash pollution, Duke Energy spent $5.99 million in 2013 alone on federal lobbying including efforts to block protective coal ash regulations.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-31 01:58:27.460420

The Fight for a Just Transition in Lithium Valley One Year Later,Gladys Malibiran,,,,,https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/2025/10/30/charging-forward-or-sliding-back-lithium-valley/,"The Trump administration has rolled back federal clean-energy programs, cut EV infrastructure funding, and opened new channels of support for fossil fuels.
And nowhere are those tensions more visible than in California’s Lithium Valley, the geothermal-rich region around the Salton Sea that our book Charging Forward spotlighted last year as a microcosm of the broad climate challenges we face.
From Promise to Pushback A year ago, we argued in Charging Forward that the clean-energy transition would only be part of a “just transition” if the communities living at its frontlines were full partners in shaping it.
Meanwhile, a new frontier is opening in Arkansas, where companies are tapping the Smackover formation for direct lithium extraction.
Lithium Valley can’t assume it will be the nation’s lithium hub by default — it must prove it can deliver both production and justice.","California just broke a record. Nearly three in ten new cars sold in the state in the third quarter of 2025 were zero-emission vehicles, the highest share ever recorded. While the demand was partly driven by the sunsetting of federal tax credits for new EV purchases, analysts also think the fundamentals are in place: consumer interest in clean transportation remains strong, and California continues to lead the nation toward a more sustainable future.

But even as the state accelerates toward electrification, Washington is putting on the brakes. The Trump administration has rolled back federal clean-energy programs, cut EV infrastructure funding, and opened new channels of support for fossil fuels. At the same time, it has taken an equity stake in the Nevada-based Thacker Pass mine, which is developing an environmentally destructive hard-rock lithium mining operation over the objection of environmental organizations and most local Native American tribes. In short, the race to build America’s clean-energy future has become a contest—not just between technologies or regions, but between competing visions of what a transition to clean transportation and energy means. And nowhere are those tensions more visible than in California’s Lithium Valley, the geothermal-rich region around the Salton Sea that our book Charging Forward spotlighted last year as a microcosm of the broad climate challenges we face.

From Promise to Pushback

A year ago, we argued in Charging Forward that the clean-energy transition would only be part of a “just transition” if the communities living at its frontlines were full partners in shaping it. That principle is being tested now in the fight over the Hell’s Kitchen Lithium and Power Project being spearheaded by one of the major would-be producers, Controlled Thermal Resources.

In September 2025, Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) (‘Civic Committee of the Valley’) and Earthworks released The Devil is in the Details, a powerful report detailing deep community concerns with the project’s Environmental Impact Report. They argue it underestimates the risks to water supplies, ignores air-quality and toxic-waste implications, and fails to safeguard sacred Indigenous lands around the Salton Sea.

But this is not just a story of opposition. A new regional coalition, Valle Unido por Beneficios Comunitarios (‘United Valley for Community Benefits’), is pressing for a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) that would guarantee tangible returns to frontline communities such Niland, Westmoreland and Calipatria. The coalition is committed to securing a CBA with all the major companies pursuing lithium extraction, while ensuring the highest environmental mitigation measures in projects and developments in the region. The fight highlights what was foreshadowed in the documentary A Better Next Big Thing by our colleague Jacob Kornbluth: to ensure that clean energy doesn’t reproduce the extractive dynamics of the past, “community benefits” shouldn’t be about handouts after the fact, but about shared governance from the start.

Imperial County’s Stalled Lithium Valley Plan

Imperial County’s ambitious Lithium Valley Specific Plan (LVSP) is supposed to help further shared governance by offering a blueprint for managing the region’s transformation — a 51,000-acre plan for clean-energy industry, infrastructure, and community development around the lithium extraction sites. But nearly a year after the draft was released, the LVSP remains unfinished and over budget. The county extended public comments into May, and in July approved another round of funding that brought the contract’s total cost above $3.2 million. The accompanying Environmental Impact Report still hasn’t been finalized.

As San Diego State University builds out a state-funded $80 million STEM facility in the region to support lithium related research and education, its president recently expressed concern that the delay has bred frustration and risk. Developers want certainty, community groups want safeguards, and both are losing faith in the process. Without a completed plan, every project becomes an ad hoc negotiation, weakening oversight and eroding public trust.

Thacker Pass, Arkansas, and the Battle for Lithium’s Future

While California tries to balance the speed of the market with the speed of trust, other regions are racing full speed ahead. The Thacker Pass mine in Nevada is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of national policy, but the joint venture between Lithium Americas and General Motors has been criticized for its extensive surveillance and monitoring of multiple community, Indigenous, and environmental groups opposed to the environmentally destructive project. The Trump Administration recently took an equity stake in the operation, effectively turning the federal government into a shareholder in the most damaging form of commercial lithium extraction.

Meanwhile, a new frontier is opening in Arkansas, where companies are tapping the Smackover formation for direct lithium extraction. This geological formation has long been exploited for oil and gas extraction. The Standard Lithium/Equinor project recently received a $225 million DOE grant and published a positive feasibility study showing promising results. The Arkansas Lithium Technology Accelerator was launched this summer to support down-stream lithium supply chain companies, and even gas-giant Chevron is getting into the game with a pilot well in the region, their first commercial foray into lithium extraction.

Little wonder that the interest is there: despite the Trump administration’s effort to take us back to dirty fuel, automakers know the future lies in EV’s. Globally, electric car sales were more than 17 million in 2024, accounting for more than 20% of all cars sold. Nearly half of all cars sold in China are EVs, and emerging markets in Asia and Latin America saw electric car sales expand by over 60% in 2024. This resilience highlights a central contradiction of the moment: while federal policy veers toward fossil retrenchment, market and consumer momentum continue to accelerate the clean transition from below.

The Crossroads of Power and Justice

One year after Charging Forward was published, the tensions it explored have become sharper than ever. The Salton Sea’s geothermal brine remains uniquely rich, but its high-temperature and complex chemistry makes extraction challenging and commercially uncertain. Lower-temperature brines in Arkansas may be easier to manage, and Nevada’s environmentally destructive projects now enjoy federal backing. Lithium Valley can’t assume it will be the nation’s lithium hub by default — it must prove it can deliver both production and justice.

Bridging that divide is more complex than ever. Communities in Imperial County are organizing for fair treatment. Imperial County’s long-promised development plan languishes, while rival regions advance their own lithium strategies. Federal policy has swung toward fossil favoritism, seeming to buck clear trends in global and other markets.

The big question now isn’t whether the clean-energy transition will happen: it will. But the question is where, how, and for whom. The outcome will depend on whether communities like those around the Salton Sea can secure a real voice in shaping the industry that will transform their landscape, and whether California’s momentum can withstand federal retrenchment and competitive headwinds.

Charging Forward argued that a just transition must be built, not assumed. One year later, that remains the challenge. The race is on, and it’s not just about who extracts the lithium first: it’s about who builds the future right.",https://dornsife.usc.edu/eri/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/Charging-Forward-Blog-Post-Featured-Image-1024x589.png,N,,2025-10-31 01:18:05.277642

JB Pritzker, who signaled he would sign the measure into law.

Legislative Democrats said the legislation would eventually lower electric bills for Illinois consumers burdened by utility rate spikes driven by rising power grid demand, while Republicans noted the massive battery installations would be backed in part by a surcharge on consumers’ monthly bills.

The disagreement over the 1,020-page energy bill, mostly along party lines, was reflected in the final 37-22 vote in the Senate on Thursday night, the final day of the General Assembly’s fall session and the last scheduled legislative day of 2025. On Wednesday night, the House approved the bill 70-37. Democrats hold supermajorities in the House and Senate.

After the Senate passed the legislation, Pritzker said in a statement that the bill, dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, is “an important step that will help lower utility bills and make our electrical grid stronger.”

“Illinois is leading an ambitious clean energy effort that will make our electrical grid more resilient, power our economy, and make energy more affordable for everyone,” the governor said. “I am grateful for working with the Illinois General Assembly and I look forward to signing this bill into law and help Illinoisans keep costs lower and keep the lights on.”

The legislation’s passage comes despite concerns from Republicans, particularly those downstate who’ve repeatedly raised alarms in the last several months about increased utility rates, that the energy policy changes would actually raise monthly electric bills.

The bill was a result of negotiations between lawmakers, organized labor, environmental interests and other groups in response to an especially high demand for electricity in the last couple of years.

Part of this has been attributed to the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims to promote greater use of renewable energy by 2030 and eventually phase out fossil fuels, and to the prevalence of data centers that have taken up a significant share of the electrical supply due to the emergence of artificial intelligence technology.

State Rep. Jay Hoffman of Swansea, the energy bill’s main House sponsor, warned during floor debate Wednesday night about how not passing the legislation could have grave consequences for consumers, especially at a time when the federal government has sought to cut spending.

“Some would say let’s do nothing. Let’s put our head in the sand and act like just everything’s going to be OK and do nothing. Don’t do planning. Don’t put more capacity on the grid. Don’t make sure that we have energy efficiency,” he said. “But let me tell you this: Without immediate actions, Illinois stands to pay $9.5 billion in increased energy costs by 2034. Utility bills will directly increase by $1 billion by 2030, and Illinois will lose more than 50,000 manufacturing and energy jobs because of the federal budget cuts.”

But House Republicans questioned the delayed gratification the new bill promised.

Some savings from CEJA “never materialized,” Republican state Rep. Dan Ugaste of Geneva said, “and now we’re taking another swipe at it, hoping we get some cost savings at some point in the not-too-distant future. Our ratepayers are suffering now.”

Republican state Rep. Brad Halbrook, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who represents Shelbyville, took it even further, calling the bill and previous attempts at energy legislation a “worship service at the altar of the dead green God.”

“We were promised clean energy would mean lower costs, more jobs and a stronger grid. They promised a climate salvation that doesn’t exist,” Halbrook said.

State Rep. Ann Williams, a Chicago Democrat who was one of the lead sponsors of CEJA, disputed claims that the 2021 law won’t save money for consumers by 2030, and also said battery storage in the new bill will “increase power on the grid and keep costs down.”

“Affordability is at the very heart of this energy package and a direct response to consumer concerns about rising utility rates,” she said during Wednesday’s floor debate.

As part of the energy bill, legislators called for adding 3 gigawatts of battery storage to the state’s electricity grid by 2030 — though Republicans and Democrats still disagreed on whether and how quickly the batteries would lower monthly bills enough to pay for themselves.

The batteries would work in tandem with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply less intermittent.

They require billions of dollars in upfront investment, to be financed by battery developers and secured through surcharges on consumers’ monthly utility bills.

But according to an estimate released Monday by the Illinois Power Agency, the batteries would shave a few dollars per month off average residential electricity bills by 2031 by lowering anticipated rate increases for future space on regional electricity grids.

The cost of getting 3 gigawatts of batteries up and running on the grid by 2031 would add 58 to 68 cents per month to the average residential bill for Ameren customers in mostly downstate Illinois and 40 to 48 cents for Commonwealth Edison customers in the Chicago region, according to the IPA analysis.

However, the agency said, the batteries would pay for themselves by reducing the anticipated rate increases for future space on regional transmission grids. In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, the agency said.

Including all its other provisions, the energy bill would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $4.49 to $10.59 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $2.03 per month by 2031, the IPA said.

In one big policy change from the new energy bill, for the first time since deregulating energy markets in 1997, the legislature would allow the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allow higher utility bills to procure new sources of electrical generation in the state.

Deregulation didn’t provide as much new electricity for the state as hoped, said Mark Pruitt, former director of the Illinois Power Agency, a state energy regulator.

That’s because regional grid operators, such as the Midwest Independent System Operator and PJM Interconnection, have been reluctant to hook up intermittent sources such as wind and solar, despite their declining cost, he said.

The state’s policy shift comes as Illinois faces looming electricity shortages not just because of rising demand from data centers, but also because of its plan to close 28 gigawatts of coal and natural gas generating plants by 2045 to improve air quality.

The ICC and other agencies plan to issue a final report by mid-December on the adequacy of the state’s electricity supply through 2030.

In addition, the bill would fund pilot programs for geothermal energy networks, repeal the existing moratorium on new large-scale nuclear construction and increase subsidies to retrofit homes to use less energy.

Mark Denzler, president of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, dismissed the projected savings as the kind of Springfield promise that often fails to materialize.

“There’s too much of a rate hike that we think is going to cause a negative reaction for Illinois families and Illinois businesses,” Denzler said in a news conference on Monday.

Even with its new batteries, Illinois won’t have enough round-the-clock or baseload power and will still need to delay the planned closing of coal and natural gas power plants, Denzler said.

Jen Walling, executive director of the Illinois Environmental Council, said her group supports the bill as a way to offset changes in federal policies, such as the phasing out of tax incentives for wind and solar power.

“This is us responding to the federal cuts in a really robust way that no other state has done,” Walling said.

“It’s going to mean we’ll save more through efficiency. It’s going to mean building more renewable energy. It means new money for battery storage, but we expect that to be a savings very quickly to consumers, as it has been in other states,’’ she said.

“The program is not a quota program,” West said Thursday.
“This program was passed when (George) W. Bush was governor of Texas, and he was not a governor that would have accepted a quota program.
“All it does is create opportunities for smaller, disadvantaged businesses to be part of the procurement network for the state of Texas,” West added.
The law also set statewide goals for HUB participation in state contracts based on the 2009 State of Texas Disparity Study.","The state program intended to give additional exposure to businesses owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans seeking state contracts was frozen by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts’ office this week, the latest instance of Republican state officials targeting a program perceived as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

Information regarding the Historically Underutilized Business program was removed from the comptroller’s website and the office said it was pausing the issuance of all new and renewed certifications for state procurement, according to a statement by the comptroller’s office.

The office said it was freezing the program to allow for a review to ensure it is constitutional and complies with Gov. Greg Abbott’s January executive order banning DEI programs from state agencies.

“Businesses deserve a level playing field where government contracts are earned by performance and best value — not race or sex quotas,” acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock wrote on social media Tuesday. “We must END ALL DEI in Texas!”

Hancock’s social media posts were coupled with a memo to state agencies and universities saying they are prohibited from granting contracts on the basis of race, ethnicity or sex.

While his office has stopped issuing new certifications, Hancock does not have the power to end the program altogether.

The program, in its current form, was written into state law over the course of several legislative sessions during the 1990s. Doing away with the program would require either a court ruling it unconstitutional or the Legislature repealing the law.

State Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, co-authored the 1999 bill that codified the program into state law and said its opponents misunderstand the program’s intent and effectiveness.

“The program is not a quota program,” West said Thursday. “This program was passed when (George) W. Bush was governor of Texas, and he was not a governor that would have accepted a quota program. We were able to strike what we thought was a good compromise, a fair program that made sure agencies would go out and make an effort to seek procurement opportunities.

“All it does is create opportunities for smaller, disadvantaged businesses to be part of the procurement network for the state of Texas,” West added.

That legislation placed the program under the purview of the comptroller’s office, which is tasked with certifying HUB businesses and monitoring other state agencies for compliance in their procurement processes. A business can be certified under the program if a majority of its ownership is determined to be an “economically disadvantaged person,” defined by the state as Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and disabled veterans.

The law sets requirements for state agencies to solicit bids from a set number of HUB-certified businesses, but does not require that a HUB-certified business must be selected for a given contract.

The law also set statewide goals for HUB participation in state contracts based on the 2009 State of Texas Disparity Study. That study was also removed from the comptroller’s office on Tuesday.

Michael Adams, a professor and director of the Master of Public Affairs Graduate Program at Texas Southern University, said programs seeking to increase the participation of women and minority-owned businesses in the public procurement process are present in all levels of government across the country.

With government representation of minorities still lagging behind their population, programs like Texas’ HUB program were seen as a way of helping historically disenfranchised groups by taking advantage of government’s status as the nation’s largest employer to fight discrimination, Adams said.

“How do you move beyond the public welfare state if you don’t have the opportunity to strike out and create a business and create opportunity for yourself?” Adams said. “In terms of policy outputs, the HUBs have been a way of doing that.”

West said the program has not been a political issue throughout most of its existence, arguing the recent attention is a result of Republican attempts during President Donald Trump’s second term to roll back decades of progress toward societal equity.

“It’s all part of the Project 2025 plan,” West said, referencing an ultra-conservative political initiative published by Heritage Foundation in preparation for Trump’s second term. “Many of the cultural wars in America start in Texas … Now we’re trying to further Trump’s goals to do away with any programs that give people a hand up, not a hand down.”

West noted that women-owned businesses are by far the biggest benefactor of the HUB program, “but the focus by Republicans has been on the poster child, which are African American owned businesses.”

Hancock took office in July in an acting role after former Comptroller Glen Hegar was named chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. Hancock said the review of the program has been a top priority since he took office.

The decision comes after Austin-based recruiting company Aerospace Solutions sued the state last November arguing the HUB program puts it at a disadvantage when bidding for state contracts because it is not a HUB-certified company.

Then, the citizen support towards climate action is actually higher than we perceive.","Ultimately, they found that the 180 largest fossil fuel and cement companies have been responsible for about half of the world’s carbon emissions dating back to the 19th century. Moreover, many 21st-century heat waves would not have been possible without them. “We knew it was going to cause some noise,” Quilcaille says. “So, we went above and beyond to make sure what he had was clear and that it was as robust as possible.”

The study has already created a stir among climate scientists, and Quilcaille expects that its findings will be used in legal proceedings against emitters. (He stresses that while the study assesses contributions, it does not assign direct responsibility for climate events.) “My hope is that more will follow in these tracks,” he says of the need for further accountability research. “It’s important for society to know how these big actors are impacting our lives.”

Quilcaille answered TIME’s survey on the state of the climate movement:

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

The financial support towards the production of fossil fuels must be transferred towards renewable energies. Mitigating climate change requires rapid reductions in emissions, and fossil fuels are the biggest source. Their production continues due to sustained financial support, despite renewable energies now being cheaper than fossil fuels. Thus financial institutions need to acknowledge that it is now a rational action, for the environment and for the economy, for today and for the future.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

I will continue shifting my diet, towards more plant-based food. Changing my habits takes time, but it makes sense for my health, our environment, and global well-being.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

While I have mentioned that we already have the solutions to phase out fossil fuels, there is a broader issue. Most of us are consuming and wasting too much: food, transport, energy, transport, clothing, etc. The priority should be on goods that are better distributed, with less waste, of higher quality, and that lasts longer. Thanks to our consuming choices, we can redefine the markets and reduce our individual footprints.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

First, it is not in my personality to give up: I have set my mind to make as much of a difference as I can, so I will. Then, the citizen support towards climate action is actually higher than we perceive. We have the solutions, we have the motivations, so I hope that we are getting close from a societal threshold that would trigger cascading decisive actions.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

Today, you have a chance to change the world. Instead of plunging towards a fragmented and decaying world, you have the power to progress together towards a sustainable world. This path is the most rational for our economies, our societies, our resources and the environment, be it today and tomorrow.

(October 30, 2025)—The Illinois General Assembly passed a comprehensive energy bill today, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA, SB25), that further cements the state as a leader in pursuing an equitable clean energy transition. The bill comes amid relentless attacks against clean energy by the Trump administration and its fossil fuel allies, as well as spikes in electricity bills caused in part by increased demand from data centers.

The legislation strives to increase customer savings and equity in several ways. It introduces new energy planning tools for Illinois agencies and utilities, expands cost-saving energy efficiency programs, solidifies funding for wind and solar power, and creates new programs and incentives to help all customers benefit from resources like rooftop solar and residential batteries. The bill also adopts policy recommendations made by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) to deploy battery storage resources in Illinois, improving access to clean electricity and helping lower costs when replacing old, polluting fossil fuel power plants. CRGA also bolsters workforce and contractor development programs geared toward persons who would benefit most from equitable investments by the state.

Below is a statement by James Gignac, Midwest policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.

“Passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act underscores a powerful commitment by state legislators to a healthier, more prosperous and more affordable energy future for all of Illinois. The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power.

The Bills are intended to respond to and implement the recommendations of the Samuel Review.

While EDO lawyers continue to pore over the details of the hundreds of pages in the Bills, here is a quick update on what we know so far.

Climate impacts will still not be required to be assessed under Australia’s federal environment laws

Contrary to the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice, the government has put forward Bills that still do not require federal assessment and mitigation of the greenhouse gas emissions of proposed activities.

The Advisory Opinion clarified that nations, including Australia, have a duty to prevent transboundary environmental harm, which includes regulating all greenhouse gas emitting activities and ensuring adequate environmental impact assessment is undertaken to understand and minimise emissions. The Bills fail to meet these requirements, and, if passed, may expose Australia to legal action to address this failure to meet international obligations.

The Bills do not require:

disclosure of scope 3 emissions, which are typically the most significant emissions from fossil fuel projects, although the Bills provide a requirement for disclosure of scope 1 and 2 emissions; or

assessment of these emissions in deciding whether the activity is allowed to go ahead.

Claims the Safeguard Mechanism is adequately regulating greenhouse gas emissions in Australia are false and unfounded.

The Safeguard Mechanism only comes into effect after activities are approved for those activities that meet the threshold. The mechanism does not prevent approval of emitting activities in the first place. See our briefing note here for more information.

Large-scale deforestation and other harmful activities still supported with exemptions from the Act

The Bills do not remove exemptions that have allowed unsustainable activities to continue around Australia without EPBC Act oversight.

The exemptions for prior authorisations or “continuations of use” have been relied on by proponents of certain activities, such as agricultural deforestation or the use of shark nets, to continue without federal assessment and approval – even where these activities have significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance (MNES).

The environment has declined in health since the Act commenced in 2000, and so the impact of these activities on matters of national environmental significance has increased drastically.

Australia has obligations to protect these matters of national significance under international agreements and commitments, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, which Australia is arguably failing to meet by maintaining this exemption.

Native forest logging is also exempt from EPBC Act assessment under the Regional Forest Agreements, even though forestry activities can have significant impacts to many threatened species that rely on these forests as vital habitat.

The bulldozing of forests is pushing some of our most iconic species, including the greater glider, koala and grey-headed flying fox, to the brink of extinction.

It is clear the Regional Forest Agreements are not regulating forestry impacts sufficiently to ensure Australia’s species of national significance are not at threat.

EPBC Act reform is an opportunity to ensure that all activities that have or are likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance, including land clearing and forestry, can be assessed and regulated under Commonwealth law.

National Environmental Standards power and restrictions on unacceptable impacts are in the Bills

The implementation of National Environmental Standards was the centrepiece of the Samuel Review’s recommendations.

The Bills provide a new power to create National Environmental Standards, and where the standards are prescribed for a decision, generally requires decision makers to not be inconsistent with the standards. A regulation can be made to vary the way the Standards are to be applied to some decisions though.

The specific drafting of the National Environmental Standards is yet to be seen, but will be integral to determine whether they meet the threshold set by the Samuels Review recommendations and actually lead to increased environmental protection.

The Bills also introduce a requirement that Standards are subject to the “no regression” principle.

This requirement must be applied by the minister before varying or revoking a National Environmental Standard to ensure any change for the Standard will not reduce:

environmental protections;

consultation rights;

access to environmental data or information; or

the likelihood that outcomes or objectives specified in the standard are achieved.

Unfortunately, this principle won’t apply at the first review of the Standards which must occur 18 months after commencement.

The Bills also introduce a definition of “unacceptable impacts”, and stipulate that the minster can only approve a project if they are satisfied it will not have or be likely to have unacceptable impacts.

This is a key safeguard, but ambiguities in terms used within the definition must be removed to ensure it is effective.

New National Environmental Protection Agency and stronger enforcement powers and penalties

The Bills seek to create a new national environmental regulator, the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). The proposal to create the NEPA is very similar to the framework proposed but not passed in the Nature Positive package last year for Environment Protection Australia.

The Bills create the NEPA as a listed entity under the Public Governance Performance and Accountability Act 2013. They also create the office of the NEPA CEO.

NEPA, through its CEO, will be responsible for compliance and enforcement of several national environmental laws, including the EPBC Actand the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018.

NEPA’s CEO will be directly vested with permitting powers, including in relation to the wildlife trade, and offshore carbon capture and storage under the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981.

The minister will retain EPBCActassessment and approval functions but can delegate these to the NEPA CEO.

A key difference to the 2024 proposal, and one that significantly undermines the independence of those decisions, is a provision that delegated decision makers are subject to the direction of the delegator.

This means that NEPA would have to abide by any directions made by the minister if making delegated decisions.

EDO has long advocated for an independent and empowered national environment protection regulator.

Establishing the NEPA is, in our view, a step in the right direction.

However, there are some significant deficiencies in the design of the proposed NEPA, deficiencies that will potentially undermine its independence and reduce its accountability.

These deficiencies do not inspire confidence that NEPA will be the tough cop on the beat the government claims and nature desperately needs.

For further detail, see our blog post on the 2024 Nature Positive Bills and our briefing note on the 2024 EPA proposal.

The Bills also provide two new compliance and enforcement options in the EPBC Act — compliance audits and environmental protection orders — and significantly increase maximum penalties the court can impose for breaking the law.

These improvements are consistent with the Samuel Review, which found that under the current EPBC Act, compliance and enforcement was weak and ineffective, and that penalties must be sufficient to be an active deterrent rather than a “cost of doing business”.

Devolution of federal EPBC approval powers is back on the table

The Bills facilitate increased devolution of Commonwealth Government powers under the EPBC Act for assessment and approval to state and territory governments and other entities.

The Bills empower the minister to declare or to enter into a bilateral agreement that removes the need for federal assessment or approval under the EPBC Act on the basis of an accredited framework.

There are existing powers in the current EPBC Act to devolve assessment and approval powers, however, the devolution of approval powers (the riskiest part of devolution) has never been used due to legal ambiguities with existing provisions.

Clarification of the authority to devolve EPBC Act approval powers has been attempted multiple times by various governments, and each time it has failed to pass the Senate due to the significant risks posed to integrity and environmental protections in decision making.

The Commonwealth Government has an obligation to maintain responsibility for the protection of matters of national environmental significance, in accordance with Australia’s international agreements and the fact that the protected matters are important to all Australians.

Accreditation is a devolution of this responsibility. There are too many risks in accrediting states and territories with approval powers at a time when Australia needs strong federal leadership and strengthened environmental laws.

Introduces ‘Pay to Destroy’ provisions to offsets framework

The Commonwealth Federal Government is proposing to replace its existing Environmental Offsets Policy, with a new legislative framework for Restoration Actions and Restoration Contributions (Offsets Framework).

The Offsets Framework will be implemented via direct amendments to the EPBC Act, including a new Part 12B to establish a Restoration Contributions Holder and Restoration Contributions Special Account, and a proposed new National Environmental Standard for Environmental Offsets.

The Offsets Framework will interact with new provisions in the EPBC Act that:

require consideration of the mitigation hierarchy, which states offsets are a last resort after action to avoid, mitigate and repair impacts;

provide that offsets cannot be used to overcome unacceptable impacts; and

require that offsets adequately compensate for “residual significant impacts” to deliver a net gain.

While introducing the mitigation hierarchy into the Act, the minister is only required to “consider” the hierarchy, rather than ensure that it is adequately applied.

Significant questions have been raised about the effectiveness of environmental offsets and their ability to deliver environmental outcomes that genuinely compensate for the negative impacts of projects.

Where environmental offsets are used, they must always be in accordance with best practice principles to ensure that offsets can achieve real environmental outcomes that compensate for the impacts of projects. This is not reflected by the Bills.

As proposed, the Offsets Framework contains too much flexibility, including a new option to pay a “restoration contribution charge” in lieu of securing direct, upfront offsets and inadequate accountability measures.

The ability to pay money into a fund is not offsetting; it is essentially “payment for destruction”. The use of offsets contributions in other jurisdictions as been highly criticised. In NSW, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has recommended the phasing out of the Biodiversity Conservation Fund, and the NSW Government is taking steps to limit the use of the Fund.

Further, offsetting should not be seen as commensurate with restoration. Offsets have the specific task of ‘compensating’ for the specific impacts of a project on the environment. While this may include some component of restoration, the restoration is first predicated on something being damaged or destroyed., equating to net zero at a landscape scale. Restoration needs to be done independent of the offsets scheme and will require investment, strategy and data.

In its current form, the Offsets Framework will allow projects to be approved with no real guarantee that genuine offsets will be delivered or that environmental outcomes will be achieved.

Fast-tracking development approvals – safeguards needed

The Bills introduce various new pathways designed to fast-track development approvals.

Faster assessment and approval processes has been a key platform of Minister Watt’s plans for these reforms, particularly for housing and renewable energy.

Concerningly, there are no limits on the scale of risk of activities that can be fast-tracked through the new pathways, which may lead to weaker environmental assessment and less public scrutiny for even large-scale fossil fuel projects under current drafting.

The Bill introduces streamlined assessment, which is designed to encourage proponents needing EPBC approval to do the environmental assessment work in advance and provide a comprehensive application on referral.

If the minister is satisfied they have sufficient information to make an informed decision whether or not to approve the activity for each matter of national environmental significance that may be significantly impacted, and if the application includes greenhouse gas information for the action, streamlined assessment can be allowed.

There are no requirements as to what level of information should be required, even large-scale projects that would normally be assessed via environmental impact statement may be pushed through this assessment process under current drafting.

There is scope for a regulation to specify criteria that may apply to limit what types of activities can be streamline assessed, but no requirements in the Bills as to what the regulation should specify.

The only public consultation for streamlined assessment will be at the point of referral on deciding whether the activity requires assessment under the EPBC Act.

Once the streamlined assessment pathway has been decided, a recommendation report must be drafted as soon as practicable as to whether the activity should be approved and if so on what conditions.

The decision on the application must be made within 30 business days from the point of deciding the streamlined assessment pathway.

This pathway has less public oversight and assessment rigour than any current assessment pathway under the EPBC Act.

The bioregional planning process in the current Act is also being amended to encourage this pathway to be used for faster development. Under the reforms there can be two types of plans:​

Bioregional guidance plans. These plans will have no regulatory function.

Bioregional plans. These plans will have a regulatory function, including establishing development zones and priority actions, conservation zones and restricted actions, and bioregional restoration measures.​

The intention is that through landscape-scale planning, which designates where conservation values exist and where a class of actions may be most suitable for priority actions, those priority actions can be develop more quickly under a bioregional plan in a development zone, and development of priority actions in conservation zones is discouraged.

Once a class of action has been specified as priority actions, they will no longer need EPBC assessment or approval.

While there is unfortunately no requirement in the Bills to consider cumulative impacts, landscape-scale planning may encourage smarter planning for development that is considered appropriate for streamlined assessment.

Unfortunately, there are some loopholes that make this framework dangerous on current drafting:

There are no limits on the kinds of activities that can be a “priority action”, and this could be used to streamline fossil fuel activities;

There are no specific requirements to undertake any type of assessment that will ensure quality landscape-scale and site-specific assessment are undertaken;

Conservation zones won’t operate as strict “no go zones” – only prescribed activities are restricted in these zones but even they can be allowed to develop in a conservation zone through broad exemptions under the Bills;

Proponents wanting to develop in a development zone must put in a registration request, which can be approved or refused by the minister – there is no requirement for full assessment of the activity, and no public consultation on development proposals; and

Public consultation on a bioregional plan will be for 30 business days, a very quick turn around for such a powerful plan.

Both of these reforms are in strong need of tighter guardrails to ensure they are not misused to fast-track risky, impactful development activities without proper environmental assessment and public scrutiny.

Discretion, exemptions and loopholes

It’s clear that the Bills propose some positive new protection mechanisms, but they may be undermined by the level of discretion, exemptions and loopholes.

The Samuel Review found that a fundamental shortcoming of the EPBC Act is that it does not provide sufficient constraints on discretion, and this considerable discretion in decision making has resulted in uncertainty and poor environmental outcomes.

It is disappointing to see that the government has not used this important opportunity to implement recommendations to increase accountability and integrity.

In our view, the proposed amendments may exacerbate existing flaws in the EPBC Act identified by the Samuel Review by entrenching and extending discretional decision-making powers of the minister and their delegates.

Many key aspects of the reforms are framed as subjective and discretionary, which erodes certainty and accountability.

Nearlyallprovisionsincludecriteriathatmustbemetunder a subjective test — “to the satisfaction of the minister” — rather than an objective test simply requiring compliance with a particular criteria.

Most provisions, including the application of the National Environmental Standards to decisions on development proposals and accreditation of other frameworks to take over EPBC assessment or approval powers, involve a weaker test of “not inconsistent” with criteria, rather than a positive test such as “in accordance with” or “complies with”.

These terms are throughout the current EPBC Act and constitute the “discretion” that the Samuel Review points to as a failing of the Act.

The First Independent Review of the EPBC Act (the Hawke Review) also found the use of double negatives, such as “not inconsistent” weakens provisions significantly and recommended this language be replaced with stronger tests.

In practice, “not inconsistent” has been interpreted as lowering the threshold of decision-making obligations.

Where new safeguards are introduced, they are often undermined by discretionary exemptions, such as exemptions to restrict activities in conservation zones and broad national interest exemptions with no limit on what can be considered “in the national interest”.

What’s more, the Bills introduce new powers to make ‘rulings’, under which the minister (or the CEO of NEPA in relation to the CEO’s powers), on their discretion, can override or stand in the shoes of the judiciary and parliament by making binding decisions on how the law should be applied by other decision makers.

We understand rulings are also intended to be used to partially accredit a process as satisfying EPBC Act requirements, without going through the formal accreditation requirements and safeguards.

The power to make binding rulings is a very unusual power that does not exist in other environmental laws in Australia to our knowledge.

It appears to be inspired by the rulings feature of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth), however that power is exercised by the independent Commissioner of Taxation, not an elected minister.

This power risks further politicisation and uncertainty around the application of the EPBC Act, contrary to the Samuel Review’s recommendation for constrained discretion and clear outcomes-based rules.

Conservation planning to protect and recover species and ecological communities and abate threats

Conservation planning to ensure we are taking action to protect and recover species and ecological communities and abate threats must be a priority in any EPBC Act reforms.

The Act currently provides for the listing of species at risk of extinction and the making of recovery plans, conservation advices and threat abatement plans to direct action to support their recovery.

The reforms will introduce provisions allowing the minister to issue “protection statements”.

These statements are intended to clarify what a decision maker must consider during the approval of actions in protecting threatened species or ecological communities.

Protection statements could be a useful tool that supports the implementation of new environmental protection mechanisms in the Act, such as considering whether a project will have unacceptable impacts.

However, as drafted, the Bills will make these new protection statements the primary regulatory document.

This approach modifies existing requirements that the minister not act inconsistently with a recovery plan and must have regard to conservation advices.

Instead, the reforms will require only that the minister not act inconsistently with protection statements. This is a backwards step.

Protection statements must complement, not override or diminish the role of existing conservation planning documents, such as recovery plans, threat abatement plans and conservation advices.

The Bills also introduce a new, single definition of critical habitat, which will help address confusion about multiple terms in the Act currently.

While this is helpful, most important will be how the Act protects critical habitat as defined under the current Act.

As proposed, protection will be limited. For example, offence provisions will only apply to critical habitat that is identified on the register (and only if it is in or on a Commonwealth area) and there is nothing to compel the government to add the critical habitat to the register.

However, new requirements to prevent unacceptable impacts, including on critical habitat, may lead to greater protection for these crucial areas.

Disappointingly, the Bills fail to take broader steps to improve the conservation planning framework. Notably, the Bills do not:

mandate requirements to make conservation planning documents, such as recovery plans and threat abatement plans;

mandate the registration of critical habitat;

require decision makers to consider new listings in project assessments;

establish a mechanism for responding to emergency events (like bushfire and floods); nor

strengthen reporting on progress on achieving threatened species and ecological community recovery.

Amendments are needed to restore trust in the EPBC Act and to ensure it delivers on the core principles of stronger environmental protection, and greater accountability and transparency in environmental decision-making.

The Bills have elements that, if strengthened, could further this. However, there are key weaknesses in the proposal that risk undermining the Act and the meagre protection it currently provides.

The former must be strengthened and safeguards placed around the latter for the Bills to stop and turn around the decline of nature across Australia and to protect our precious natural heritage.",https://www.edo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Warkworth-coal-mine-by-John-Krey-1024x685.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 01:58:14.471424

Fremont (USA) – Enphase Energy, a global leader in microinverter-based solar and battery systems, has released its financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

In Q3 2025, Enphase achieved revenue of $410.4 million (Q2 2025: $363.2 million). This marks the company’s highest quarterly revenue in two years, and significantly exceeds analyst expectations of around $360 million.

The gross margin was 47.8% (GAAP) and 49.2% (non-GAAP), including a negative impact of 4.9 percentage points from tariffs. GAAP operating income came in at $66.2 million, while non-GAAP operating income totaled $123.4 million.

GAAP net income amounted to $66.6 million, with non-GAAP net income of $117.3 million. On a diluted basis, earnings per share were $0.50 (GAAP) and $0.90 (non-GAAP). According to financial research site Zacks, analysts had expected only $0.62 per share (non-GAAP). Free cash flow stood at $5.9 million.

During the quarter, Enphase shipped approximately 1.77 million microinverters, corresponding to 784.6 MW DC, and a record 195 MWh of IQ® Batteries. From its U.S. manufacturing facilities alone, the company shipped 1.53 million microinverters and 67.5 MWh of IQ Batteries.

Despite strong quarterly results, Enphase disappointed investors with its outlook for the next quarter. For Q4 2025, the company expects revenue between $310 million and $350 million, meaning the top end of the range is about $60 million below Q3 levels. The projected gross margin is also weaker at 40.0%–43.0% (GAAP) and 42.0%–45.0% (non-GAAP), including an approximately five-percentage-point headwind from tariffs.

Although Enphase exceeded expectations on both revenue and profit in the third quarter, the company’s stock fell sharply by 12.6% to €27.50 (closing price, October 29, 2025, Stuttgart Stock Exchange). The decline was driven by the disappointing Q4 outlook and ongoing tariff-related headwinds.

As a result of the Mexico City Public Forum on 24 July 2025, the Joint Public Advisory Committee (JPAC) submitted an Advice to the CEC Council on the application of Circular Models and Nature-based Solutions across the region, and how their integration can accelerate the transition to more sustainable and more equitable economic systems. Discussions at the Public Forum focused on the enabling conditions, such as policy frameworks, financing mechanisms, public-private partnerships and regional cooperation, that make such transformations possible.

The Advice gathered public insights and highlighted opportunities for coordinated action across North America, supportive policy frameworks and innovative approaches to strengthen regional sustainability and resilience. JPAC provided recommendations in five key areas, including the establishment of an online North American Nature-based Solutions Knowledge Platform, as well as the development of initiatives that will pave the way for a North American Circular Economy and Innovation Corridor.

About the CEC

The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) was established in 1994 by the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States through the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, a parallel environmental agreement to NAFTA. As of 2020, the CEC is recognized and maintained by the Environmental Cooperation Agreement, in parallel with the new Free Trade Agreement of North America. The CEC brings together a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, Indigenous people, youth, nongovernmental organizations, academia, and the business sector, to seek solutions to protect North America’s shared environment while supporting sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations

The CEC is governed and funded equally by the Government of Canada through Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Government of the United States of Mexico through the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, and the Government of the United States of America through the Environmental Protection Agency.

In Texas, dozens of events took place across the state - uniting tens of thousands of Texans under a single truth: power belongs to the people. Now, our task is to stay vigilant, stay united, and continue to push back.

Turning Out At the Texas Capitol

The Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter and local Austin Sierra Club group gathered dozens of people in the Austin area to attend our local No Kings march. We came together to resist the right-wing, mega-corporations that influence policy at the Texas state Legislature, as well as at the federal level. These special interest groups often hire lobbyists that manipulate the political process, resulting in policies that benefit super polluters and make the rich - richer.

We met at the office of our colleagues at Public Citizen (thank you for hosting!), and it was exciting to see nearly two dozen new faces, including a whole family, come out and get creative by making protest signs. Being together in community with people who share the same values, and who want better for our city, state, and country was truly energizing.

Texans Have Had Enough

From conversations with community members, and by using tools like online surveys to talk to Texas across the state, one thing is clear: Texans are tired of our needs coming in second to corporations and political donors.

Everyone who holds an elected office works for the people - the folks working day in and day out to pay the bills, keep food on the table, and navigate the ever-worsening climate crisis. Extreme weather events are getting more dangerous and more deadly, and yet our leaders won’t do anything at the state or federal level to lessen pollution or even mitigate weather impacts.

Our energy bills are increasing exponentially to pay for shareholder bonuses at massive utility corporations - but our Governor-appointed state agencies won’t do anything to stop these corporations because they donate to Abbott’s political campaigns.

Enough is enough.

The massive turnout across the state for the No Kings rallies tells us that Texas is at a turning point. We, the people, have the power to hold decision-makers accountable, and to demand better for our families, our future, and our planet.

Getting Involved After No Kings

We’re eternally grateful to our local Sierra Club groups for organizing in almost every city to protest the blatant corruption at the Texas Capitol and in the White House. There are no kings in Texas. Now is the time to keep the momentum going. Here are a few ways you can stay engaged and involved post-rally:

Attend or host a community gathering

Have conversations with neighbors, friends, and family members about your experience

Join a local or Texas group or organization that focuses on a cause you care about. Not sure where to start? Sign up here to talk our staff about getting more involved

Donate to a nonprofit or community organization

Rest up for the next event

Attend a virtual community meeting (like Keep the Power On or Water for People and the Environment Committee monthly meetings)

A Future Texas Deserves

Despite the grip of single-party dominance in Texas, these rallies remind us that no leader, party, or institution can claim unchecked authority.

Power belongs to the people - to every neighbor, voter, and community member.

That power only grows when people are willing to speak out, show up, and make their voices heard again and again. The strength of our democracy isn’t measured by who holds office, but by how actively we participate in shaping the future.

Staying vigilant, staying united, and continuing to push back are the ways we ensure that, in Texas and beyond, the people always come first.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-10/image0-1.jpeg.webp?itok=3_4Gz5zi,N,,2025-10-30 23:22:23.605202

He resides in Austin County.

Texas voters have the opportunity this fall to make a major decision about the future of water supply, water quality, and flood management in the state. Among the 17 proposed amendments to the state constitution on the ballot in November is Proposition 4 (Prop 4), a dedication of state funding for water infrastructure over at least the next 20 years.

Prop 4 reads as follows: “The proposed constitutional amendment to dedicate a portion of the revenue derived from state sales and use taxes to the Texas Water Fund and to provide for the allocation and use of that revenue.” Specifics about that dedication and allocation are in Senate Bill 7, enacted by the Texas Legislature this past spring.

There has been a lot of hype but also some misunderstanding about Prop 4. Here are the basic facts:

Prop 4 earmarks up to $1 billion a year from state sales tax revenue over at least 20 years to the Texas Water Fund to provide state financial assistance (primarily loans) for a variety of water projects initiated at the local level.

Prop 4 does not impose any new taxes on Texans. This dedicated funding for water projects would come from the existing state sales tax and only when that revenue exceeds $46.5 billion in any given year.

Neither Prop 4 nor its “enabling” legislation (SB 7) earmark funding for specific water projects but do identify the types of projects for which the Fund may be used – including agricultural water conservation, flood management, new water supply, water loss reduction (such as replacing or repairing leaking water pipelines), rural water projects, and wastewater treatment, among others.

Prop 4 and SB 7 prohibit the use of the Texas Water Fund to finance the transport of “fresh” (in other words, non-brackish) groundwater from one area of the state to another – a major concern for rural groundwater well owners. Neither Prop 4 nor SB 7 limit private investors from attempting to move groundwater, but private investors are NOT eligible to apply for state financial assistance from the Texas Water Fund – the Fund is for local governments.

Prop 4 and SB 7 do NOT establish a state water “grid” for moving water around the state – an enormously expensive proposal promoted by one major legislative sponsor but considered unrealistic by other legislators.

Prop 4 and SB 7 alone will not provide the money to fix all of the state’s water problems and meet all future water needs, estimated to require literally hundreds of billions of dollars, but the dedicated water funding (combined with other funding previously approved) represents a critical step forward in addressing those challenges.

If Prop 4 is approved, Texans will have a continuing responsibility to make sure the money is well-spent. They will need to encourage local governments and regional water planning and flood planning groups to pursue projects that will provide efficient ways to supply water, responsible measures to manage floods and keep people safe from flooding, and effective wastewater treatment to keep water clean, while maintaining river flows and freshwater inflows into the state’s highly productive coastal bays and estuaries.

Early voting is underway now for Prop 4 and the other proposed state constitutional amendments and continues through Friday, October 31.

Davenport, C, C Singer, N Mehta, B Lee, and J Mackay (2024), AI, data centers and the coming US power demand surge, Goldman Sachs 26.","Quantifying the carbon footprint of AI is an increasingly urgent task. Policymakers are debating whether the surge in electricity demand linked to AI will jeopardise decarbonisation goals. Data centres – the core infrastructure supporting AI models – are projected to account for 8% of US electricity demand by 2030, up from 3% in 2022 (Davenport et al. 2024). Concerns have been voiced that this power surge may delay the retirement of coal-fired plants. On the other hand, AI and digital industries are often promoted as a ‘green’ technology that may increase efficiency and lower emissions.

Studies of past waves of digitalisation (e.g. Lange et al. 2020) showed that while ICT can reduce some forms of waste, the overall effect was often an increase in energy use. More recently, cryptomining has been linked to an increase in local electricity prices (Benetton 2023), and there is an ongoing debate whether data-centre expansion will force grids to rely longer on fossil fuels (Electric Power Research Institute 2024, Knittel et al. 2025).

In a recent study (Bonfiglioli et al. 2025), we contribute to this debate by providing systematic evidence on how the diffusion of AI has affected emissions in the US over the last two decades. Our findings suggest that the ‘green’ promise of AI will remain elusive as long as the electricity sector itself is not rapidly decarbonised.

A novel dataset linking AI, data centres, and power plants

To carry out the analysis, we assemble a novel dataset linking AI, emissions, and the location of data centres and power plants in 722 US commuting zones between 2002 and 2022. This period coincides with the rise of the digital economy, cloud computing, and early AI applications. To capture the carbon footprint of these phenomena, we define AI as algorithms applied to big data, and we measure its penetration using changes in employment in data-intensive occupations – software developers, data scientists, systems analysts, and related computer-science jobs – identified from the O*NET database (see Bonfiglioli, Crinò, Gancia, and Papadakis 2024, 2025).

We then map the geographical location of more than 2,000 data centres and link them to nearby power plants and their fuel mix. Finally, we measure emissions from the high-resolution Vulcan dataset (Gurney et al. 2009, 2025), which tracks CO2 from fossil-fuel combustion by sector and location, complemented by satellite-based data on other pollutants.

Figure 1 presents colour maps showing how employment in data-intensive occupations (panel a) and CO2 emissions (panel b) vary across US commuting zones, with darker colours representing higher levels of adoption or emissions over the sample period. Red triangles also indicate the location of data centres. The figure shows that areas with more workers in data-intensive occupations tend to have higher emissions and are more likely to host at least one data centre. Yet, this correlation cannot be interpreted as causal evidence, as both AI and emissions might be simultaneously driven by other shocks.

Figure 1 Data-intensive occupations, data centres, and CO2 emissions

Notes: Panel (a) displays the employment share of data-intensive occupations in each commuting zone in 2022. Panel (b) shows the total CO2 emissions in each commuting zone for the same year. Darker colours represent higher levels of adoption of data-intensive occupations or emissions over the sample period. Red triangles indicate the presence of a data centre site.

To address the fact that AI adoption could itself be influenced by local demand or productivity trends, we use a shift–share (Bartik) instrument. Specifically, we identify commuting zones exogenously more exposed to the arrival of AI as those zones historically specialised in industries that experienced faster growth in data-intensive occupations than the nation as a whole.

The effect of AI on emissions

Our analysis yields four key findings. First, AI slows down the green transition at the local level. Localities specialised in industries with faster growth of data-intensive employment saw a significantly slower fall in CO2 emissions (Figure 2). On average, emissions fell by 16% over the period 2002–2022. In contrast, in a hypothetical commuting zone that had experienced no AI penetration at all, CO2 emissions would have fallen 37% more than the average. While these figures should not be interpreted as counterfactual exercises, since nationwide effects are differenced out in our empirical strategy, they nonetheless suggest that local AI penetration increases emissions relative to less exposed areas.

Figure 2 AI penetration, CO2 emissions, and electricity generation

Notes: The figure presents estimated coefficients and 90% confidence intervals for the effects of AI penetration on various types of emissions and on the non-renewables share of net electricity generation. The estimation sample includes 722 commuting zones observed across four 5-year periods from 2002 to 2022.

Second, the growth in emissions is mostly due to a scale effect. Decomposing the drivers of emissions into scale, composition, and technique (à la Levinson 2009), we find that expansion of local economic activity is the main channel through which AI affects emissions. Areas specialised in industries with faster growth of data-intensive employment attracted more workers and firms, increasing total output and hence energy use (Figure 2). Shifts in industrial composition modestly reduced, rather than increased, emissions.

Third, electricity generation becomes more carbon intensive. Even after controlling for scale, per-capita emissions from power generation rose in areas with higher AI penetration (Figure 2). This happens because power plants located in more exposed areas switch electricity generation from renewable sources to non-renewable sources (Figure 2). It confirms concerns that the energy demand driven by AI applications and data centres is met primarily by fossil-fuel plants, which can guarantee the stable and continuous supply that high-performance computing requires.

Our fourth and final result is that the location of data centres matters. Since electricity cannot be stored at scale easily, the grid must balance supply and demand in real time. Given the high transmission-loss costs, power plants are influenced by nearby sources of demand, especially from data centres which require a stable, high-capacity electricity supply. Consistently, we find that proximity to data centres is associated with power plants generating higher CO2 emissions and relying more heavily on non-renewable energy sources (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Distance to data centres and power plant activities

Notes: The figure presents estimated coefficients and 90% confidence intervals for the effects of power plants’ average distance to data centres on different power plant activities. The estimation sample consists of 11,500 power plants observed four 5-year periods from 2002 to 2022.

Conclusions

These results put numbers on a concern often voiced by climate analysts: absent a faster transition of the power sector to low-carbon sources, the diffusion of AI can slow or even reverse recent gains in emissions reduction.

Notably, our study covers 2002–2022, a period that predates the explosion of generative AI. While the promised efficiency gains from these new technologies may eventually help decarbonise the economy, training and running today’s large language models is far more energy-intensive than the earlier AI applications captured in our data. Unless accompanied by massive investment in clean power, the next wave of AI may therefore have even larger short-run impacts on emissions.

Our research points to an uncomfortable truth: digital transformation and decarbonisation cannot be treated as separate agendas. The diffusion of AI epitomises a classic challenge of technological progress: innovations that promise long-term efficiency gains can, in the short run, raise environmental externalities by expanding demand for energy. The solution is not to slow AI, but to accelerate the clean-energy transition. This may require incentives for more energy-efficient hardware, locating data centres in regions with abundant clean-energy capacity, and strengthening transmission infrastructure. Without that alignment, the race for ever-more-powerful algorithms may inadvertently lock economies into a higher-emission path.

This vital document reflects efforts by standards developing organizations (SDOs) and other stakeholders to address the gaps identified in the Roadmap of Standards and Codes for Electric Vehicles at Scale, published in 2023 by the ANSI Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP). The progress report provides updates on standards, research, and conformity assessment activities against 31 previously identified gaps. It also captures suggested modifications to existing gaps, such as prioritization and scoping, and identifies 21 additional gaps to be considered for future roadmaps.

The June 2023 roadmap identified 37 standardization gaps and corresponding recommendations across the areas of vehicle systems, charging infrastructure, grid integration, and cybersecurity. Of the 37 gaps, 14 were identified as high priority, 20 as medium priority, and three as low priority. In 23 cases, additional pre-standardization research and development activities were identified as needed. Representatives from 130 public- and private-sector organizations supported the roadmap's development, including U.S. federal government agencies and national laboratories, SDOs, industry, academia, and others.

The gaps report is not a consensus document, but rather is intended to serve as a ""living document"" that will be maintained and periodically re-published as standards development work continues or until the EVSP undertakes a next version of its roadmap.

The ANSI EVSP is a cross-sector coordinating body whose objective is to foster coordination and collaboration on standardization matters among public- and private-sector stakeholders to enable the safe, mass deployment of EVs and associated infrastructure in the United States with international coordination, adaptability, and engagement. It does not itself develop standards.

Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.
DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project.

Whitmer met virtually with OpenAI’s boss, as well as representatives from Related Digital and DTE, in mid-March for a more formal conversation.","“Today, we won the largest economic project in Michigan history,” Whitmer said in a Thursday news release.

The announcement comes in the wake of some high-profile flameouts on major manufacturing projects, including a proposed microchip factory near Flint that previously could have been the largest economic project in Michigan history until backers pulled the plug earlier this year.

OpenAI's push comes amid a mad dash of spending on data centers that has accompanied the gold rush in AI.

Part of OpenAI’s $500 billion Stargate project in the U.S., the Saline Township data center is being developed by Dallas-based Related Digital and would be operated by Austin-based Oracle Corp., which would lease the computing power to OpenAI.

The data center, spanning 1.65 million square feet across three buildings, would come with 450 permanent “high-skill, high-paying” jobs on site as well as 1,500 permanent jobs throughout Washtenaw County to support the project. The state and developers did not immediately respond to Crain's inquiries on what those jobs would consist of.

Construction is expected to start early next year, creating 2,500 union trades jobs, according to the release.

Michigan is not providing cash subsidies to the project, according to Whitmer’s office, though data centers do have incentives to build in the state. Thursday’s announcement comes 10 months after the governor signed bills to exempt data centers from paying the state’s 6% sales and use tax on equipment if they spend at least $250 million to build or expand.

A sponsor of that legislation, Sen. Kevin Hertel, D-St. Clair Shores, said it ""served as the catalyst for us to secure the largest investment in Michigan's history. This is a monumental win for the hardworking families who call our state home.""

The companies would not disclose a dollar figure for the project cost, but the governor's office said it is higher than the largest corporate investment announced previously in Michigan, which was General Motors Co.’s $7 billion electrification expansion. Much of the investment in a data center is in the computing equipment that the center houses.

“This project will help ensure Michigan is a key part of building the AI infrastructure that will power the next generation of American innovation,” said Peter Hoeschele, OpenAI’s vice president of industrial compute, in a Related Digital news release. “By expanding Stargate to Michigan, we can strengthen domestic supply chains, create good jobs, and help more communities share in the economic opportunities AI is creating.”

Data centers have been cropping up across communities throughout the U.S. as Google, Meta, Amazon and others plunge massive amounts of capital into the AI arms race.

Not all communities have been welcoming.

In Washtenaw County alone, plans for a $1.2 billion University of Michigan-Los Alamos supercomputer in Ypsilanti Township sparked public backlash, a proposed data center in Augusta Township sought by New York City-based Thor Equities faces resident pushback and in Saline Township — where OpenAI announced Thursday it will plant its flag — board trustees tried unsuccessfully to block the development.

“We’re a bunch of farmers and want to keep it that way. I hate to say it, but we’re the last of them,” Tom Hammond, a Saline Township board trustee, told Crain’s in July. “We’ve always promoted staying rural. We love our farming community and everything. I guess that’s my stance on it.”

In September, Related Digital and three sets of local property owners sued the township after its board, with support from residents, blocked the developer’s request that the agricultural land be rezoned as industrial/research property. The lawsuit alleged “exclusionary zoning.”

The parties settled a month later, with the township agreeing to the rezoning and Related agreeing to pay $14 million, including $8 million to fire departments, $4 million to preserve farmland and $2 million for “community investment.”

Data centers have stoked concern among residents over environmental impact, water usage and increased energy costs for ratepayers. Developers and project proponents said there is no need to worry over the Saline Township project.

DTE Energy CEO Joi Harris earlier Thursday announced a deal to provide 1.4 gigawatts of load to a data center, which is the OpenAI project. She said the utility’s customers would not pay more due to the data center and would benefit because the company would not have to seek as high of a rate increase in the future.

""DTE Energy is supplying 100% of the power to the project using existing resources augmented by a new battery storage investment — financed entirely by the project — in a way that ensures there is no impact on DTE’s existing customers’ energy supply or rates,"" the release said.

Developers are also boasting that the project is a LEED-certified design, which uses a closed-loop system for cooling, limiting daily water use “to levels comparable to an office building.”

“We are proud to be developing this critical project exclusively for Oracle and contributing to keeping our nation competitive in the global AI race,” said Jeff Blau, CEO of Related Companies and Chairman of Related Digital, in the release.

Related Digital is a subsidiary of New York City-based Related Cos., which was founded by University of Michigan megadonor Stephen Ross in 1972. Ross has no formal role with Related Digital, a spokesperson said. He is the nonexecutive chairman of Related Cos but stepped away from operations last year to launch a new company, Related Ross, focused on development in West Palm Beach, Fla.

The project, when completed, may be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center amid a surge of demand for AI and cloud computing capacity. Jackson-based Consumers Energy, whose electric service territory includes much of the Lower Peninsula outside of metro Detroit and the Thumb, announced a hyperscale data center in July but has not released the center’s developer or its location pending a final agreement.

The Saline Township project, nicknamed “The Barn” in a nod to a historic red barn being preserved near the site entrance, is composed of three 550,000-square-foot buildings. It is being funded by a “consortium of leading private investors and financial institutions.”

Detroit-based Walbridge was selected as the general contractor for the project, which still must be approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Michigan has been hurting for a big economic development win, having seen a flurry of electric vehicle and cleantech projects go kaput in recent months, including the collapse of the Gotion factory near Big Rapids. A $60 billion Sandisk microchip factory near Flint fell from its grasp this summer.

Whitmer had her eyes on OpenAI for the past year and her office reached out to the company in the second half of 2024, spokesman Bobby Leddy said. Following OpenAI’s announcement in January that it would invest $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, Whitmer’s office contacted the company about landing a Stargate site in Michigan.

Whitmer met virtually with OpenAI’s boss, as well as representatives from Related Digital and DTE, in mid-March for a more formal conversation.

“I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries,” Whitmer said.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Related%20Digital%20Saline%20Project%20Rendering%208-1-25_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 22:58:37.636812

An associate professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, Steven Sprick Schuster, said the shake-up is a response to the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing new electric vehicles.
“So that incentive, I think, created a rush of manufacturers trying to utilize that — therefore building or promising to build in the United States.

(WKRN) — General Motors announced this week it would cut thousands of jobs in Tennessee, Michigan and Ohio, including more than 700 furloughed workers at Ultium Cells, an EV battery plant in Spring Hill.

An associate professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, Steven Sprick Schuster, said the shake-up is a response to the end of a $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing new electric vehicles. Those expired on Sept. 30.

“A few years prior, you had — through the Inflation Reduction Act — an expansion of those subsidies, specifically though for cars that were assembled in the United States,” Schuster told News 2. “So that incentive, I think, created a rush of manufacturers trying to utilize that — therefore building or promising to build in the United States. Then, with the Big Beautiful Bill removing those subsidies, you have them walking back those exact things that they had promised.”

Schuster explained the sudden switch-up in public policy from expanding EV tax credits to ending them has created whiplash across the electric vehicle industry. At the same time, he predicted long-term growth.

“I don’t think that they [automobile companies] think that the EV production is just going to go away,” Schuster added. “It’s just this one massive thing that was incentivizing it to do it exactly this way is gone.”

As auto companies respond to the changing EV landscape, the human toll of the temporary layoffs remains to be seen.

“What obligation do we have to the people whose jobs were destroyed, specifically through public policy?” Schuster said. “Not because of supply and demand, not because of the market… but because we created a policy that destroyed a job?”

A spokesperson for General Motors said furloughed employees at Ultium Cells may be eligible to continue receiving a “significant portion of their regular wages or salary, plus benefits.” Ultium Cells said they hope to resume normal operations at the plant by mid-2026.",https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/08/68b259680d1731.32519831.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-30 21:58:35.802896

“They were saying ‘Let’s embrace renewables,’ seeing the tax credits as the bridge for doing it, based on scale,” he added.","WASHINGTON — Despite the federal government remaining in limbo on Thursday, a group of House Democrats called on their colleagues to restore the Biden-era renewable energy tax incentives set aside last summer with the passage of the so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill.”

Introduced by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., the top Democratic on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy, the Energy Independence and Affordability Act (H.R. 5862) would restore the tax credits and related incentives that were the cornerstone of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“I have never had anyone in my community come up to me and say, ‘I wish Congress would do something to increase my energy bills,’” Thompson said during a press conference in a studio mere steps from a largely silent Capitol Visitors Center.

“Nor have I ever met a constituent who asked that we help accelerate climate change; nor have I heard anyone say, ‘Hey, what can you do to cede our global leadership to China?’ Never. Not once,” he continued.

“Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues did all three of those things when they passed their ‘big ugly bill’ and eliminated the renewable energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act,” he said. “Today, Democrats are taking an important step to reverse the terrible mistake that they made, and we’re going to restore the nation’s renewable energy leadership.”

Specifically, Thompson ‘s bill would:

Restore the full clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind, solar, and other zero-emission power sources.

Extend incentives for energy efficient homes and commercial buildings, helping families and businesses cut utility bills through modern, efficient technologies.

Reinstate clean-vehicle tax credits for consumers and businesses to accelerate America’s transition to electric and zero-emission vehicles, and

Extend the clean hydrogen production credit, advancing next-generation clean fuel production.

The cosponsors of the bill include Reps. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Terri Sewell, D-Ala., and Steven Horsford, D-Nev.

Neal said the Republicans’ decision to do away with the tax credits came at a time when people were just beginning to respond to the incentive regime.

“What’s interesting about it is even the fossil fuel companies, who were trying to transition away from dependence on fossil fuels, were for it.” he said.

“They were saying ‘Let’s embrace renewables,’ seeing the tax credits as the bridge for doing it, based on scale,” he added.

With the introduction of the Energy Independence and Affordability Act, Neal said, “the idea of using the tax system to incentivize behavior and good science is once again in front of us.”

Among the organizations and government entities that have endorsed the bill are the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy; Sonoma Clean Power Authority; Citizens Climate Lobby; Sierra Club; Natural Resources Defense Council; Ava Community Energy (for the local Bay Area); Napa Climate Now!, the City of Napa; City of St. Helena; City of Calistoga; and the League of Conservation Voters.

The Fair Air Enforcement Act.

Senator Lee describes the legislation as stopping:

…weaponization of the judicial system by outlawing citizen suits under the Clean Air Act, which has been used by political groups to hurt Americans and their businesses.

Almost every federal environmental statute includes a “citizen suit” provision which allows a citizen to enforce environmental laws directly by bringing federal judicial actions against facilities that are allegedly violating the federal environmental statutes or regulations. The various citizen suit provisions in the federal environmental statutes generally allow individuals or groups to file an action in federal court against any person or any governmental instrumentality or agency currently violating a federal environmental statute’s requirements.

The argument in favor of federal environmental citizen suits is that enforcement agencies lack the resources to address all facilities violating federal environmental laws or regulations. Such provisions allow plaintiffs to ask a federal court to impose civil penalties for a source’s violations. Further, they can request injunctive relief (i.e., request an order from the court requiring a facility to take specific actions to correct compliance problems and avoid future violations).

Note that a citizen or non-profit organization seeking to file such federal action must first serve the alleged violator, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and any relevant state agency with certain notices that identify the alleges violations. This provides a grace period in which the alleged violator can come into compliance, or the EPA or state agency can file its own action which may then preclude citizen enforcement.

The Fair Enforcement Act would:

Amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit lawsuits by private citizens alleging violations of its provisions.

Require such enforcement lawsuits to be brought by state governments and relevant agencies.

Washington (October 30, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security and a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today wrote to Michael D. Citren, Chairman, and Stephen D. Smith, President of ACECO LLC, the contractor handling the demolition of the East Wing of the White House, questioning whether ACECO followed federal health and safety standards during the demolition, or if it placed its own workers and the public at risk of exposure to asbestos and other hazardous materials.

In the letter, Senator Markey writes, “Damaged asbestos fibers are one of the most hazardous substances that can arise from construction demolition. Unless their presence is disclosed, individuals have no way of knowing that the air may contain tiny, tasteless and odorless fibers that cause no noticeable irritation but can be deadly. Construction workers on the East Wing site, nearby office workers and tourists, and passersby could now be at heightened risk of developing lung cancer, asbestosis, or mesothelioma from the inhalation of demolition dust.”

Senator Markey continues, “ACECO’s work falls squarely within a network of federal regulations governing demolition, hazardous-material handling, and worker protection. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA) asbestos standard requires that employers identify, monitor, and control asbestos exposure in demolition work. And the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) rules require inspection, advance notice, and approved abatement or containment procedures before demolition of a structure containing asbestos.”

Senator Markey requests answers to the following questions by November 12, 2025:

When and under what authority did ACECO begin demolition work at the East Wing? What was the scope of the work? Please provide any contracts or other agreements covering the work.

Was a full hazardous-materials survey, including asbestos and lead, conducted prior to demolition? If so, provide the surveyor’s name, date of inspection and sampling, testing reports, and findings. If not, why not?

If asbestos was found at the East Wing site, was an abatement or containment plan implemented, including worker protection and emission controls? If so, please provide the plan and any chain-of-custody records. If not, why not?

Did ACECO file the required NESHAP notifications with EPA Region III? If so, please provide the documentation? If not, why not?

How were workers on the East Wing demolition site trained and equipped to prevent asbestos exposure? Please include copies of any contracts, safety plans, and worker training records for your company or any subcontractors performing demolition, abatement, or disposal activities.

Was monitoring or air-sampling at the East Wing demolition site performed? If so, please identify specific sampling locations and sampling times, as well as any results. If not, why not?

What permits did ACECO obtain for this work, and from which authorities? Please provide any East Wing job-site permits.

Describe how demolition debris and any hazardous waste have been handled, transported, and disposed of, and identify the receiving facilities. Please include any manifests, transport records, and disposal certificates for asbestos-containing material, lead paint waste, or other hazardous debris.

Were measures taken to prevent dust or airborne contaminants from reaching surrounding areas of the White House complex? If so, please identify them. If not, why not?

Were any deviations or incidents reported during demolition, and if so, what corrective action was taken?

Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

President Trump on July 4 signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation package extended the 45Z credit through the end of 2029, altered the credit by limiting eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, and eliminated the “special rate” for SAF. The elimination of the “special rate” effectively caps the value of the SAF credit at $1 per gallon starting in 2026.

The Energy Independence and Affordability Act, introduced by Thompson on Oct. 28, aims to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF in line with the original version of the 45Z credit.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mike_Thompson2025_d0bfbe5ad0.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 19:59:41.965051

The most striking shift is where the growth has occurred and is projected to occur. It is in the states of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

This graphic, in partnership with Shale Crescent USA, shows how regional U.S. natural gas output evolves from 2000 to 2050, highlighting the East’s rise, using data from the EIA.

East Leads Natural Gas—and Stays on Top

According to the EIA, the East becomes and remains the largest-producing region starting in 2039. In fact, the Shale Crescent states—Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania—supply nearly all of the East’s gas (about 99%), and momentum continues.

Here is a table that shows regional U.S. natural gas production (Bcf/d) from 2000 to 2050.

The East first surpassed the Gulf of America in 2011, then topped the “Rest of the United States” in 2017. It is projected to overtake the combined “Gulf Coast + Southwest” in 2039 at 45 Bcf/d.

From 2000 to 2025, East output jumped nearly 1,200%—from 2.7 to 33.9 Bcf/d, demonstrating a paradigm shift in American energy production.

From 2025 to 2050, the East is expected to climb another 59% to 53.8 Bcf/d. By 2050, it will produce nearly as much as all other regions of the U.S. combined (53.8 vs. 60.4 Bcf/d).

A Manufacturing Edge in the Shale Crescent

As output concentrates in the East, midstream flows, storage, and basis prices adjust accordingly.

For planners and investors, regional growth influences industrial siting. Therefore, understanding where supply originates and is projected to be is critical to the success and stability of energy-intensive projects.

For manufacturers, the Shale Crescent USA pairs abundant, low-cost gas with dense customer demand and logistics. This means energy-intensive consumers have a world-class opportunity to source energy from under their feet, experience shorter supply chains, lower costs, and speed time-to-market.

Additionally, proximity to pipelines, storage, and interstates helps compress working capital and improve reliability. In turn, this translates into durable cost advantages and more resilient operations.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-10-30 22:36:37+00:00,News From The States,Iowa AG accuses some small refineries of 'manipulating' renewable fuel exemptions,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/iowa-ag-accuses-some-small-refineries-manipulating-renewable-fuel-exemptions,"Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sent a letter to federal regulators Thursday urging an investigation into refineries that receive exemptions for renewable fuel blending standards.
Fuel refiners and importers satisfy these standards by either blending renewable fuels, like ethanol or biodiesel, into their products or by purchasing credits to offset the gas they produce.
If the refinery shows it would experience “disproportionate economic hardship,” it can be exempted from complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard.
The small refineries can request extensions to their exemptions from the EPA with documents that demonstrate the refinery’s economic hardships.
For the renewable fuel industry, the exemptions mean fewer refineries are required to purchase renewable fuels, or their credits.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sent a letter to federal regulators Thursday urging an investigation into refineries that receive exemptions for renewable fuel blending standards.

Bird, who was joined by attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota in the letter, said some of the small refineries that are eligible for renewable fuel exemptions are “manipulating” the program and feigning they face “disproportionate economic harm” while publicly telling investors they are “financially thriving.”

“The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don’t need them hurts Iowa farmers,” Bird said in a statement. “They should be investigated by the federal government to ensure that all refiners are following the rules.”

Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the Renewable Fuel Standard which dictates a volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with, or must replace fossil fuels used for transportation, home heating and jet fuel.

Fuel refiners and importers satisfy these standards by either blending renewable fuels, like ethanol or biodiesel, into their products or by purchasing credits to offset the gas they produce.

Under the same program, EPA allows refineries that handle less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil input each day to apply for Small Refinery Exemptions. If the refinery shows it would experience “disproportionate economic hardship,” it can be exempted from complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard.

Bird wrote in the letter that some refineries are “intentionally lowering” their production rates to meet the 75,000 barrel per day minimum and remain eligible for the exemptions.

“In other words, certain refineries are producing less gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to enable them to ask for a government handout,” the attorneys general wrote in the letter. “That is not only contrary to the spirit of the (Renewable Fuel Standard) and (Small Refinery Exemption) programs, but it is also expressly against President Trump’s clear policy of unleashing American energy.”

Refineries also, in an action the attorneys general noted was “even more concerning,” have “misleading representations” about the disproportionate economic hardships in their businesses.

The small refineries can request extensions to their exemptions from the EPA with documents that demonstrate the refinery’s economic hardships.

In August, EPA acted on a “backlog” of SRE petitions and approved 140 full and partial exemptions, while denying 28 petitions.

A news release on the decision said EPA was “getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences.”

EPA also said it would provide updated information on how it plans for SREs in the future and said it would “seek to balance” the Renewable Fuel Standard goals to support renewable fuels, while “taking into account economic impacts.”

The attorneys general allege some of the refineries that were granted exemptions by EPA had “strong financial performance and competitive positioning” during the same time they were meant to be suffering “disproportionate economic hardship.”

“Both strong economic results and disproportionate economic hardship cannot coexist,” the letter said, following examples in public filings and quarterly reports where several refineries had positive reports.

The letter, which was addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins, asks for a “cross-government” confirmation of statements made by refineries seeking the exemptions.

For the renewable fuel industry, the exemptions mean fewer refineries are required to purchase renewable fuels, or their credits.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, applauded Bird for leading the letter and efforts to bring the “potentially illegal situation to light.”

“In a time when crop prices are low and increased biofuels usage is a key solution, it is deeply troubling to see what appears to be an attempt by some oil refiners to game the system and avoid their legal requirements under the RFS,” Shaw said in a statement.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/biofuelnozzle-1024x6731761862789.jpg?h=a3e47efc&itok=D2MFTi5h,N,,2025-10-30 19:00:54.310095

Cameco, Westinghouse and Brookfield noted that, in presenting forward-looking information, they “made material assumptions which may prove incorrect”.
Among other things this includes “the success of the Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology and Westinghouse’s ability to construct and commence commercial operations at new large-scale nuclear power plants”.
In 2022, Brookfield Renewable Partners (another subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management) and Cameco acquired Westinghouse Electric from Brookfield Business Partners.
Before this, the last reactor built by Westinghouse was the Watts Bar NPP.","The US Government (Department of Commerce) has entered into a binding term sheet with Canada-based Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management to accelerate the global deployment of Westinghouse Electric Company’s nuclear reactor technologies. The strategic partnership is expected to reinvigorate supply chains and the nuclear power industrial base in the US and abroad. This is in line with President Donald Trump’s May Executive Orders calling for the US to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years.

According to Cameco and Brookfield, which jointly own Westinghouse with 49% and 51% shares respectively, the launch of a NPP construction programme is expected to accelerate growth in Westinghouse’s energy systems segment during the construction phase, along with its fuel fabrication and reactor services business for the life of the reactors. A statement says: “Upon closing of the transaction and with financing facilitated by the US Government, Westinghouse plans to commence project execution and initiate orders for critical equipment with long lead times, which is expected to leverage the nuclear industry supply chains that were established during the construction of the AP1000 units at units 3&4 of the Vogtle NPP. No timeline is given for construction of the reactors.”

US Government is expected deploy its financial, regulatory, policy and diplomatic tools to support the objectives of the partnership. The US Government will be granted a participation interest, which, once vested, will entitle it to receive 20% of any cash distributions in excess of $17.5bn made by Westinghouse. A participation interest is a contractual or legal right to a share of a company’s profits, revenues, or other economic benefits. Vesting is the process by which a recipient earns full, unrestricted ownership of that interest over time or by meeting specific conditions.

For the participation interest to vest, the US Government must make a final investment decision and enter into definitive agreements to complete the construction of new Westinghouse nuclear reactors in the US with an aggregate value of at least $80bn. If, by January 2029, the participation interest has vested, and if the valuation in an initial public offering (IPO) of Westinghouse is expected to be $30bn or more, the US Government will be entitled to require an IPO. The participation interest will then directly or indirectly convert into a warrant, with a five-year term, to purchase equity securities equivalent to 20% of the public value of the IPO entity after deducting $17.5bn from the public value.

Connor Teskey, President of Brookfield Asset Management said the partnership “will help unlock the potential that Westinghouse and nuclear energy can play to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States, while meeting growing electricity demand and energy security needs at scale”. He added: “Brookfield has more than half a trillion dollars invested in the critical infrastructure that underpins the US economy, and we expect to double that investment in the next decade as we deliver on building the infrastructure backbone of artificial intelligence.”

Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel said the partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through collaboration with the US Government. “We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies,” he said, adding: “At the centre of this new partnership is value creation…we believe the US Government’s participation in the partnership creates the right incentives to deploy its full suite of tools behind the construction of Westinghouse reactors, including financial, regulatory, policy and diplomatic support.”

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright noted: “This historic partnership with America’s leading nuclear company will help unleash President Trump’s grand vision to fully energise America and win the global AI race. President Trump promised a renaissance of nuclear power, and now he is delivering.”

The transactions and other matters contemplated by the term sheet with the US Government are subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary conditions. Cameco, Westinghouse and Brookfield noted that, in presenting forward-looking information, they “made material assumptions which may prove incorrect”. Among other things this includes “the success of the Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology and Westinghouse’s ability to construct and commence commercial operations at new large-scale nuclear power plants”.

Although Westinghouse pioneered commercial nuclear power, delivering the world’s first commercial pressurised water reactor in 1957, in 2017 Westinghouse (then owned by Toshiba) declared bankruptcy, after years of rising costs and delays. In 2018 Toshiba completed the sale of Westinghouse’s holding company to Brookfield Business Partners (a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management). In 2022, Brookfield Renewable Partners (another subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management) and Cameco acquired Westinghouse Electric from Brookfield Business Partners. Brookfield and Cameco formally acquired Westinghouse in November 2023.

Westinghouse’s bankruptcy led to two AP1000 reactors under construction at the VC Summer NPP in South Carolina being cancelled. The two AP1000s under construction at the Vogtle 3&4 in Georgia were completed seven years late and $17bn over budget. These were the first new NPPs to be built in the US for 30 years. The only other operating AP1000s are four units in China at the Haiyang and Sanmen NPPs, which also faced delays and were completed with Chinese assistance. Before this, the last reactor built by Westinghouse was the Watts Bar NPP. Construction began in 1972 and was later suspended in 1985 before being resumed. The reactor entered commercial operation in 1996.",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/10/vogtle34-2.jpg.imgw_.1920.1920.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 19:00:17.781610

“I don't want Missouri ratepayers to be paying to foot the bill for data centers,” Hawley said Wednesday in an interview with St. Louis Public Radio.
“If data centers are going to come into the state, fine.
Large energy needs In its filings and calls with investors, Ameren has said it has signed construction agreements with five large data centers.
Ameren’s plan includes terms to try to isolate data center costs, like minimum years of service.","Missouri U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is skeptical about the economic benefit of data centers and is firmly opposed to people paying more on their electricity bills to subsidize them.

The GOP senator’s comments put him at odds with some Republican officials who have touted data centers as economic development opportunities. And it comes amid high-stakes Public Service Commission cases that could determine who pays for data center-driven use.

“I don't want Missouri ratepayers to be paying to foot the bill for data centers,” Hawley said Wednesday in an interview with St. Louis Public Radio. “If data centers are going to come into the state, fine. If they're going to create jobs? Hey, wonderful. But if they're going to suck up a bunch of electricity, they need to pay for that.”

Over the past year, data centers have become a major political flashpoint in the St. Louis area. A data center proposal in St. Charles was withdrawn after meeting widespread public opposition. And St. Louis residents are mobilizing against a center proposal for the Armory Building.

Data center critics have raised alarm about the amount of power and water they use.

Gov. Mike Kehoesaid the centers are “a piece of the economic puzzle that we would love to have in our portfolio here in the state.”

And on Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Jason Smith, R-Salem, wrote on Facebook that “while there should be oversight into any massive project that is funded by taxpayers, Ameren’s desire to invest in data centers in Missouri would be a win for the 8th District and the hardworking people that live here.”

“I’ve seen other communities around America where these centers have been transformative for the community, and I want Missouri to lead the way in attracting jobs and investment,” said Smith, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.

When asked to respond to Smith and Kehoe’s comments, Hawley said, “If it's going to mean jobs, I'm all for what brings jobs to the state.” But he said data centers don’t typically bring many long-term jobs – with the exception, perhaps, of people performing maintenance on the machines in the facility.

“And if the grid needs to be built out in order to accommodate them, they need to pay for that,” Hawley said. “What I don't want to see happen is your average working guy in St. Louis or Cape Girardeau or Springfield or Kansas City or anywhere kicked off his electricity because he can't afford the bills anymore, because he's being asked to subsidize some data center.”

Data centers have also provoked a split among Democrats.

In St. Louis, some of the most vocal critics have been progressives who are concerned about the centers' impact on the environment. That puts them at odds with some labor unions, such as the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, that could benefit from the short-term construction jobs and longer-term opportunities to maintain data centers.

Large energy needs

In its filings and calls with investors, Ameren has said it has signed construction agreements with five large data centers. It has also said it will need to build more power plants to meet that demand.

In recent applications to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant, Ameren staff members told state regulators the new energy was needed in part for data centers. Typically, electric utilities spread the costs for new power plants among existing customers.

The Missouri legislature passed a large utility law this year called SB4 that is supposed to protect other customers from paying for data centers’ energy needs. One section of the legislation requires utility companies to create special rates for the huge energy users. It says those rates should “prevent other customer classes' rates from reflecting any unjust or unreasonable costs arising from service to such customers.”

Both Ameren Missouri and Evergy are asking the state's Public Service Commission to approve their plans for data centers.

Ameren’s plan includes terms to try to isolate data center costs, like minimum years of service. But commission staff members called on the body to reject the plan, saying it could raise other customers’ rates by millions. The commission is expected to finalize the rates early next year.

The only thing holding us back is an outdated regulatory framework that does not easily allow participation of these resources in energy markets.
This will unlock significant value for the grid and will encourage more consumers to integrate these devices into their homes.
In the near future I will be able to connect all of my electric devices together and use them to support the grid.","The energy industry is at a critical inflection point. With the massive expansion of data centers driven by artificial intelligence, and the electrification of everything from vehicles to heating, we must find ways to support our growing energy needs. Huge potential lies in the power of distributed energy resources (local solar, storage, electric vehicles, and other home devices) to support our electrical grid and enable more deployment of renewable energy.

Tesla has already deployed over one million Powerwalls and eight million electric vehicles. This is untapped capacity that can reliably support the grid at strategic times and help use existing infrastructure more efficiently.

The only thing holding us back is an outdated regulatory framework that does not easily allow participation of these resources in energy markets. Regulators should focus on creating clear, simple, and long-term sustainable pathways for these consumer resources to offer services to the grid and receive fair market compensation. This will unlock significant value for the grid and will encourage more consumers to integrate these devices into their homes.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

I try to integrate sustainable choices into my family's life, from composting to minimizing meat consumption and plastic use. What I am most looking forward to in the next year, though, is fully electrifying my home. I am already a proud Powerwall, solar, heat pump, and EV owner, but I am excited about the latest generation of induction cooktops, water heaters, and other smart electrical devices.

In the near future I will be able to connect all of my electric devices together and use them to support the grid. It is exciting to think that I will be able to turn my home into a small intelligent power plant. I want to personally help minimize the need for new fossil fuel generation and help my entire community lower its energy costs.

Especially with my electric vehicle, I know I can make a real impact. I get home from work and plug in my car every day around 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., just when the sun is starting to go down, solar generation is declining, and the California grid is starting to need more energy. I cannot wait for the day when I can export energy from my vehicle back to the grid.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Every day at my office or visiting my customers and installers, I am privileged to interact with many smart, talented, mission-driven people who are dedicating their lives to work that will mitigate climate change. I feel inspired by the dedication and passion of the team around me, and confident in the extraordinary innovation that is happening every day. Climate change is a byproduct of human ingenuity, and I have great faith that human ingenuity will help us find our way out.

If I am ever feeling a moment of despair, I go for a walk in the redwoods with my kids. Taking a moment to feel connected to an ecosystem far bigger and older than me is a great reminder of the resilience of nature itself. I am passionate about instilling that sense of wonder in my family. Deciding to have children was for me the ultimate act of hope that we will find a way to make our world a better one for the next generation, and they are a great source of my determination to bring that future into reality.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

I would like to talk to world leaders about an exciting truth, which is that we already possess the technology and resources to get to a 100% sustainable future. We can repower the existing grid with renewables and transition all vehicles, heating, and other loads to electric. There are no physical barriers preventing us from solving this challenge. The key is dedicating significant investment into accelerating the manufacturing and deployments of these technologies. Mitigating climate change is more important than any single national agenda, and we need to work together and collectively focus our global resources to get there.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Titans-Colby-Hastings.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-31 01:18:18.765436

We’re moving too slowly because energy solutions are fragmented, with too many pursued in silos.
To accelerate change, we need to focus on business models that scale proven approaches and drive profitability through better outcomes.","What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

I believe there’s a combination to every lock, and the same applies to climate solutions. In the year ahead, we must focus on leveraging business models that make adoption frictionless and climate action profitable, enabling change at scale. Capitalism is our strongest tool; we need to focus on shaping innovative financial models capable of scaling what’s already proven, rather than just chasing new technologies. By unlocking new sources of capital through financial innovation, we can transform recurring energy costs into revenue-generating investments, thereby accelerating meaningful and widespread change.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Hope isn’t a strategy; opportunity is. Today’s market dynamics create enormous potential for accelerated change. Energy is scarce, and rising demand from EVs, AI, and electrification already exceeds supply. More energy will be needed to power the world, and economics will favor clean energy, efficiency gains, and nuclear as the top solutions. Fewer emissions are simply a better outcome and will prevail over time. The speed of change rewards those who move first. While these challenges are global, I’m confident they represent ample opportunity for those willing to lead.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

We’re moving too slowly because energy solutions are fragmented, with too many pursued in silos. To accelerate change, we need to focus on business models that scale proven approaches and drive profitability through better outcomes. Capitalism can be a powerful tool if harnessed effectively, while reliance on government funding often introduces delays and shifting priorities. The private market can move faster and use innovative approaches to drive mass adoption. There are already examples of this working—our task is to expand them and act with urgency for the planet.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Innovators-Al-Subbloie.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 22:17:52.529308

""AI is forcing an honest conversation about clean energy,"" explains Robert Little, gTech Sustainability Strategy Lead at Google.
Google's broader nuclear energy strategy The collaboration extends beyond Duane Arnold's restart.
""Nuclear is a big piece of the solution as we work toward powering Google's operations with clean energy every hour of every day,"" says Michael Terrell, Head of Advanced Energy at Google.
Regulatory pathway and timeline NextEra Energy is coordinating with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other governmental authorities to ensure compliance with safety standards.","Google and NextEra Energy have announced plans to restart Iowa's only nuclear facility, the Duane Arnold Energy Centre.

The 615-megawatt plant near Cedar Rapids, which shut down in 2020, is expected to return to operation by the first quarter of 2029 under a 25-year power purchase agreement.

The restart addresses a pressing challenge facing the technology sector: AI and cloud computing require constant, carbon-free power that renewable sources like wind and solar cannot provide around the clock.

""AI is forcing an honest conversation about clean energy,"" explains Robert Little, gTech Sustainability Strategy Lead at Google. ""AI and cloud infrastructure need massive, reliable, clean power. Not just when the sun shines or the wind blows, but 24/7.""

Financial structure and grid impact

Under the agreement, Google will purchase the majority of Duane Arnold's output whilst Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) will buy the remaining portion on identical terms.

NextEra Energy is acquiring CIPCO and Corn Belt Power Cooperative's combined 30% stake in the facility, bringing its ownership to 100%.

The power purchase agreement enables the investment required to restart operations and covers production costs, with Google bearing the financial responsibility for its portion.

Crucially, NextEra Energy has stated that Iowa electricity customers will not bear any costs associated with Google's power purchases from the facility.

""What if there was a fast path to unlock more carbon-free energy using infrastructure that's already built?"" says Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google. ""This is a powerful example of a circular economy in action.""

Economic projections for Iowa

An economic study projects the restart will generate more than US$9 billion in economic benefits to Iowa.

During construction, the project is expected to create more than 1,600 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the state.

Once operational, approximately 400 direct full-time positions will be established, primarily in Linn County where the facility is located.

The plant is projected to generate more than US$340m in annual economic output during operations state-wide.

Local tax revenue is expected to average US$3m annually to support schools, infrastructure and emergency services.

Google's broader nuclear energy strategy

The collaboration extends beyond Duane Arnold's restart. Google and NextEra have signed a separate agreement to explore deploying new nuclear generation facilities across the US.

""Nuclear is a big piece of the solution as we work toward powering Google's operations with clean energy every hour of every day,"" says Michael Terrell, Head of Advanced Energy at Google.

""We're aiming to both lower the costs of future advanced nuclear technologies like Kairos Power's small modular reactors and tap into existing nuclear infrastructure that can unleash huge amounts of clean power to meet growing energy needs even sooner, he adds.

The announcement represents NextEra Energy's third gigawatt of energy projects with Google nationwide.

Michael noted the strategy balances long-term innovation with immediate capacity needs by pursuing both existing infrastructure and next-generation reactor designs.

Regulatory pathway and timeline

NextEra Energy is coordinating with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other governmental authorities to ensure compliance with safety standards.

The company conducted engineering evaluations and community engagement before announcing the restart plans.

""Google and NextEra Energy are answering the call of America's golden age of power demand, creating thousands of jobs, strengthening Iowa’s economy, delivering long-term value to our shareholders and helping power America’s future through innovation and technology,"" says John Ketchum, Chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a7a729a61065803849cfbce784fed97a:2f05f641d1eb9dae0924b9c94fa9f742/duane-arnold-thumbnail-b-final-1-width-1000-format-webp.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 01:18:23.761655

The layoffs are a function of GM trimming electric vehicle production to match declining demand.

Factory Zero will be the hardest hit. The Hamtramck assembly plant dedicated to GM's large electric vehicles—GMC's Hummer EV and Sierra EV, Chevrolet's Silverado EV, and Cadillac's Escalade IQ—will see about 1,200 employees lose their jobs as the facility shrinks to a single shift. Additional cuts include 550 permanent layoffs and 850 temporary furloughs at the Ultium Cells battery plant in Ohio, 700 temporary layoffs at its Spring Hill, Tennessee battery site, along with smaller reductions at EV component plants in Michigan and New York.

The Wall Street Journal reports that about 1,700 workers will permanently lose their jobs, while another 1,500 will be temporarily laid off, with a potential return sometime next year.

The company’s decision follows a steep drop in electric vehicle sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in late September. According to the Detroit News, GM still has an estimated 39,000 EVs sitting on dealer lots, even after discounting models like the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq.

GM has already scaled back several EV programs, including canceling its BrightDrop electric delivery vans, reinstating plans to build a gas-powered Cadillac CT5, and reversing a decision to convert its Toledo transmission plant into an EV drive unit facility. The company recently booked a $1.6 billion charge related to EV investments that are no longer expected to turn a profit.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars,” United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “This week, they announce layoffs. So let’s be clear: GM is a profitable company, our members remain ready to work, and the UAW will continue to fight for more investment in both ICE and EV production at GM and beyond.”

National environmental standards – consistent with the recommendations of the Samuel Review, the Minister will be able to make national environmental standards for the EPBC Act.
National interest – again, not a new concept for the EPBC Act, but the definitions and its application are changed.
National interest proposals are directed at outcomes in Australia’s national interest, with national interest being in consideration of defence, security or strategic interests, or Australia’s international agreements.
Maximum penalties for breaches of the EPBC Act have been increased.","These definitions are relevant to decisions on controlled actions, decisions to accredit bilateral arrangements, strategic assessments and bioregional planning. Importantly, these decisions are subject to national interest considerations, which are designed to be used sparingly.

Unacceptable impacts – while not a new concept under the EPBC Act, “unacceptable impacts” would now be defined, and are applied to more decisions across the EPBC Act. Currently unacceptable impacts applies at the referral stage only.

The introductory speech indicates that unacceptable impacts are intended to apply only in very limited circumstances.

There is a bespoke definition for each protected matter, and the definition is complex and detailed. We anticipate it may take some time for application of the various definitions to be clearly and consistently applied, in particular because the Act needs to provide for significant impacts to be assessed and approved and the delta between significant and unacceptable impact requires consideration of various matters. Many definitions rely on a new concept where the impact would ‘seriously impair’ the environment, defined as a serious alteration for the worse having regard to various circumstances and context of the impact. For species and communities, concepts and definitions of viability, irreplaceability and critical habitat (see below) will arise.

Critical habitat is a new definition for listed threatened species and ecological communities, and is relevant to the interpretation of “unacceptable impacts”. Critical habitat is defined by reference to the function of habitat for activities such as foraging, breeding, roosting or dispersal; the long-term maintenance of the species or ecological community, genetic diversity and long-term evolutionary development and the reintroduction or recovery of populations.

Net gain test – associated with changes to environmental offsets is a new “net gain” test. What is a “net gain” is not yet defined, but this replaces the current “no net loss” setting.

National environmental standards – consistent with the recommendations of the Samuel Review, the Minister will be able to make national environmental standards for the EPBC Act. Generally decisions must not be inconsistent with these standards, so they are critical to the implementation of the amendments. Priority standards have been identified that will shortly be subject to consultation are for matters of national environmental significance and offsets. It has been indicated that these will be released prior to the passage of the legislation. Further standards that have been flagged are for First Nations engagement and Data and Information.

Standards can be amended, but are subject to a non-regression principle.

National interest – again, not a new concept for the EPBC Act, but the definitions and its application are changed. The national interest concept is intended to be used sparingly.

The proposed amendments provide for:

national interest exemptions, which allow actions to be taken without approval and are directed at national defence, security and emergencies

national interest proposals, which operate as exceptions for unacceptable impacts, the net gain test and consistency with national environmental standards. National interest proposals are directed at outcomes in Australia’s national interest, with national interest being in consideration of defence, security or strategic interests, or Australia’s international agreements.

Maximum penalties for breaches of the EPBC Act have been increased. Notably, penalties for certain civil penalty provisions have been significantly increased, including civil penalty provisions of Part 3 (Requirements for environmental approvals), new section 12A (Bioregional Plans) and subsection 142(1) (Compliance with conditions on approval). Bodies corporate may now be liable for a penalty of up to 10% of the annual turnover of the body corporate for the 12-month period ending at the end of the month of the contravention, or 2.5million penalty units, if 10% of annual turnover is more than 2.5 million penalty units. Alternatively, for these offences a new formula has also been introduced, which is calculated based on the benefit derived or detriment avoided because of the contravention.

New environment protection orders have been introduced to be used in urgent circumstances where it is reasonably believed that a contravention of the EPBC Act, is causing, or poses an imminent risk of, serious damage to a protected matter or the environment, and can require a person to discontinue or not commence specified activities, change the manner in which a person is carrying out a specified activity, restrict the manner in which the person is carrying out the specified activity, or to take a specified action.

The CEO NEPA also has the power to direct a person to undertake an environmental audit in specified circumstances, including where they reasonably suspect a contravention or likely contravention of an approval, environmental order or exemption, or that an action has, has had or is likely to have a significantly greater impact on a protected matter than was initially indicated. There are also serious penalties, namely a maximum of 6 months imprisonment, for an appointed auditor if they conceal or do not take into account information relevant to the audit. The CEO NEPA may also require compliance audits to be undertaken by authorised officers or registered auditors.",https://www.hsfkramer.com/dam/jcr:eb87c446-bc96-474f-ac78-1fc9425ec4f8/environment-AdobeStock_255174366.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 21:58:50.731399

Unifor National President Lana Payne sharply criticized both Stellantis and GM.","Auto workers represented by the Canadian labor union Unifor are calling for answers following the announcement of a series of job cuts at the GM CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ontario.

According to a report from CBC, workers held rallies this week at the GM CAMI Assembly plant, as well as Stellantis’ Brampton production plant amid growing uncertainty over the future of Canadian auto production.

As GM Authority covered previously, General Motors has announced that it will end production of its all-electric Chevy BrightDrop delivery vans at the CAMI facility following slower-than-expected demand, a shifting regulatory environment, and expiration of key U.S. EV tax credits. The move leaves roughly 1,200 employees in limbo without any product allocation for the CAMI plant. GM is also set to reduce production at its Oshawa plant from three shifts to two. Meanwhile, Stellantis recently confirmed that it plans to relocate production of the Jeep Compass from Brampton to the United States.

The CAMI facility was retooled for production of the BrightDrop delivery vans just four years ago, with GM leveraging $500 million in public funding to support production of the all-electric delivery vans.

Unifor National President Lana Payne sharply criticized both Stellantis and GM.

""By eliminating good paying auto jobs here in Canada automakers are betraying the very workers and communities that built their success,"" Payne said. ""We know there is a trade war, but the Canadian market is very important. We are in fact their number one export market and Canadians expect these companies to maintain production here and any attempt to dismantle operations at these plants will not be tolerated.""

Payne and other union leaders have branded the rallies as a ""Solidarity Action,"" vowing to launch further actions in the future if no progress is made towards securing the future of the auto facilities.

""Ultimately, I want to see a new product here. We have proven time and time again that our vehicles are second to none. We deserve a new vehicle,"" said one CAMI employee, per CBC.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CAMI-Assembly-Plant-Soldiarity-Action-Unifor-October-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 07:18:35.075782

In March 2025, four public interest groups sued NYSDEC for this failure, seeking a mandatory injunction compelling the agency to issue the regulations.

The 2019 Climate Act requires NYSDEC to adopt regulations to reduce statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Although NYSDEC has taken some steps to implement the law—such as identifying disadvantaged communities and issuing guidance on its application to permitting decisions—the agency failed to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2024, to issue the required regulations.

In March 2025, four public interest groups sued NYSDEC for this failure, seeking a mandatory injunction compelling the agency to issue the regulations. On October 24, 2025, the Albany County Supreme Court ruled in favor of petitioners and ordered NYSDEC to promulgate the regulations no later than February 6, 2026.

In its defense, NYSDEC submitted a letter arguing that meeting the Climate Act’s goals was “currently infeasible.” Pointing to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal to rescind the endangerment finding for GHG and other recent federal actions, NYSDEC warned that implementing the required regulations would “damage the public interest” by raising energy costs and causing significant economic impacts to New Yorkers. The court, however, rejected these arguments, holding that NYSDEC has no discretion to disregard a statutory mandate unless and until the State amends the Climate Act. In a written statement sent to New York news outlets, Governor Hochul publicly disagreed with the court’s decision, stating:

“My job is to ensure we have enough power to keep the lights on, keep rates affordable and attract major economic development projects. New York has been, and will continue to be, a leader in climate action, but the judge’s decision fails to factor in the realities of today that include a federal government hostile to clean energy projects, the continuing impacts of post-COVID high inflation and potential energy shortages expected downstate as soon as next year. We plan to review all our options, including working with the Legislature to modify the [Climate Act] and appeal, in order to protect New Yorkers from higher costs.”

My mom is a skilled seamstress, and when I was in kindergarten she made me a beautiful witch costume and let me put on makeup. “Trick or treating” was something I really looked forward to.

Back then, Halloween was about creativity and community. Nowadays, the real horror in Halloween is not in the costumes, horror movies or haunted houses, but in the escalating impacts of climate disasters compounded by cutting environmental protections and illegal cuts to disaster response at FEMA by the current administration. The rollback of core Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) safeguards — like the Endangerment Finding — turns our neighborhoods into scenes of genuine terror, with disproportionate harm aimed at Black, Latino, and Indigenous communities.

What’s Scary: Deregulation and Disaster

The scariest part about this October is the reality that the current administration has put profits for polluters before Americans’ health and safety with its move to repeal the EPA’s Endangerment Finding, the legal backbone for regulating climate pollution. The Endangerment Finding concludes that planet-warming greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. This vital protection against deadly pollution is under attack, and its repeal would be a devastating “trick” for frontline families already haunted by more intense extreme weather events and heightened pollution-related health issues. There is the real possibility that federal climate protections will disappear right when we need them most.

This comes on the heels of a proposed 54% cut to the EPA budget — gutting state and federal funding for clean air and water, eliminating nearly 90% of key grants for environmental health, and eradicating the EPA’s Environmental Justice office. In cities like Atlanta, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, and my hometown of Memphis, the cuts mean fewer air monitors, less lead testing, and weaker disaster response. The ongoing government shutdown has made a bad situation worse, giving polluters more leeway and putting our communities’ health and futures at risk as extreme weather, toxic air, and unsafe water push us further into danger.

RELATED: Don’t Let Your Climate Power Slip Away

Climate change is making extreme weather more frequent, more intense, more costly – and more deadly. Extreme weather events continue, and climate disasters grow more severe as the systems meant to protect us weaken.

In 2024 alone, the U.S. saw 27 separate billion-dollar disasters, with Black communities hit hardest and recovering least. In the first half of 2025, the U.S. experienced 14 separate extreme weather disasters totaling $101.4 billion in damages. This marks the costliest first six months for weather and climate disasters on record, with events ranging from unprecedented California wildfires in Los Angeles and the historic Altedena community, and severe storms and tornado outbreaks across the country.

In Altadena, Black households disproportionately experienced more damage or destruction from the Eaton Fire, with 61%, compared to 50% of non-Black households. Additionally, almost half (48%) of Black households were destroyed or had significant damage, compared to 37% for non-Black households.

Climate Change Costs Lives and Wealth

The aftermath of disasters is not just about physical loss. It’s a complex web of interconnected issues. Black survivors are more likely to face health problems such as heart disease, asthma, PTSD, and depression. The complexity is further underscored by the fact that power outages can lead to an increase in emergency room visits for Black women experiencing pregnancy complications. Additionally, communities near highways, factories, and refineries often experience poorer air quality, leading to more asthma attacks and fewer resources to recover from future climate disasters. Shortcomings in disaster response deepen wealth disparities and leave neighborhoods more vulnerable to future crises.

We lose wealth and opportunity, too — studies show Black and Latino families suffer tens of thousands in disaster losses. By 2050, almost 17% of Black-owned homes are projected to be at risk of storm damage amid worsening inequities. Black and Latino families face the brunt of property damage, higher insurance costs, and far steeper barriers to rebuilding.

Hope Depends on Action

Still, there’s hope. Hope lies in our actions. This year’s Young, Gifted & Green’s 40 Under 40 honorees, environmental organizations including Green the Church, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Environmental Development Fund, and local community members are at the forefront advocating for clean energy investments, fair disaster relief, stricter pollution regulations and urging local officials and lawmakers in Congress determined to erase our protections to restore them. When we refuse to stay silent and rally our communities, even the scariest threats lose their power.

Let’s redefine trick-or-treating not as a warning, but as a rally for climate justice. We demand fundamental protections, not regulatory tricks. Our communities — especially frontline leaders — hold the knowledge and the power to turn fear into action and policy.

Next Halloween, we want children and communities to celebrate not just creative costumes, like I did as a child, but to have the opportunity to breathe cleaner air, live healthier lives, and have equal protection from pollution.

The Detroit plant went down Oct. 27 and will resume production Nov. 24 on two shifts before moving to a single shift Jan. 5 after the holiday break, the person said.
GM said production at the Ultium Cells plants in Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, will stop from January until mid-2026.
“Ultium Cells will continue to evaluate and adapt production plans based on evolving market needs.” The production cutbacks were first reported Oct. 29 by The Detroit News.","General Motors is slashing production at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, affecting more than 3,000 jobs there and at two joint-venture battery plants, in response to a slowdown in EV demand.

GM is dropping one of two daily shifts at Factory Zero, which makes the GMC Hummer EV and electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra and Cadillac Escalade, a person with knowledge of GM’s production plans told Automotive News, a sister publication of Crain's Cleveland Business. That move will result in indefinite layoffs for about 1,200 workers at the Detroit assembly plant and 550 people at the Ultium Cells plant in Warren, Ohio, the person said.

About 1,560 Ultium Cells workers in Ohio and Tennessee will be temporarily laid off while battery production stops for about half of next year, the person said.

In the meantime, GM is shutting Factory Zero for nearly a month. The Detroit plant went down Oct. 27 and will resume production Nov. 24 on two shifts before moving to a single shift Jan. 5 after the holiday break, the person said.

GM is reassessing its EV capacity needs as the U.S. market reacts to regulatory changes, including the loss of a $7,500 federal tax credit toward purchases and leases of new EVs. The automaker in October took $1.6 billion in charges related to EV manufacturing changes and said it expected more in the fourth quarter.

In a statement, a spokesperson said GM “remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change.”

Affected employees will be eligible for compensation and benefits in line with the company’s contract with the UAW, the spokesperson said.

GM said production at the Ultium Cells plants in Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, will stop from January until mid-2026. The automaker runs the plants with partner LG Energy Solution.

The person with knowledge of GM’s plans said about 710 employees at the Tennessee plant will be temporarily laid off during the downtime, as will 850 employees at the Ohio plant.

In a second statement, a GM spokesperson said the temporary downtime “is adjusting production in response to recent changes in customer plant demand.”

“During the temporary pause Ultium Cells plans to make upgrades to both facilities to provide greater flexibility,” the statement said. “Ultium Cells will continue to evaluate and adapt production plans based on evolving market needs.”

The production cutbacks were first reported Oct. 29 by The Detroit News.

The news came days after GM said it was closing an information technology center in Georgia by year end, affecting 900 employees, and cutting about 200 salaried jobs, mostly at its Tech Center in suburban Detroit.

The analysis shows devastating consequences from lost health care coverage to families being pushed off food assistance and the State losing millions in federal funding.

According to the state’s analysis, H.R. 1:

Severely threatens Medicaid coverage for over 30,000 Rhode Islanders.

Cuts 2,300 households off SNAP and reduces benefits for hundreds more, leaving families to wonder how they’ll put food on the table.

Ends the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits that help keep health insurance affordable, driving up costs and forcing families to pay hundreds more each month for coverage, resulting in roughly 13,000 Rhode Islanders dropping their coverage altogether.

Terminates or freezes over $75 million in federal funding support for energy investments, scientific research, and critical infrastructure.

Ends the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean-energy tax credits, cutting clean-energy investment and freezing over $80 million in grants, while pausing vehicle-emissions standards, threatening Rhode Island’s ability to meet its climate goals.

Cuts the Medicaid provider tax by over $150 million, putting at risk our support to hospitals and critical providers.

“Trump’s fiscal policies are nothing more than a shell game that shifts staggering federal costs onto states that simply can’t absorb them,” said Governor Dan McKee. “My administration will use our limited state resources to try and protect the most vulnerable, but no state can backfill an entire federal program, and the President and Congressional Republicans now own the devastating consequences of these choices.”

The reports were developed by the McKee Administration’s Office of Management and Budget, Department of Revenue, Executive Office of Health and Human Services, Department of Human Services, and HealthSource RI. State agencies worked closely with partners and stakeholders across Rhode Island to assess the impacts of H.R.1. Like states nationwide, Rhode Island continues to evaluate these changes, await critical federal guidance, and determine its course of action.

Blue Energy will initially provide energy through gas-powered generation, which will subsequently be converted into nuclear energy by 2031.
According to Blue Energy, the campus was chosen for its location, existing infrastructure, and available energy resources to support a gigawatt-scale AI factory.
Unlike most other advanced nuclear firms, Blue Energy is not a reactor manufacturer.
Blue Energy was founded in 2023.","Blue Energy said it will deliver power to the planned 1,600-acre Crusoe campus as early as 2028. Blue Energy will initially provide energy through gas-powered generation, which will subsequently be converted into nuclear energy by 2031.

The company claims that, through its solution, it can slash the time to power to 36 months or less with a natural gas bridge.

According to Blue Energy, the campus was chosen for its location, existing infrastructure, and available energy resources to support a gigawatt-scale AI factory.

It is in proximity to existing and planned transmission lines and fiber-optic networks, and offers access to one of the US’s largest natural gas pipeline systems.

“Blue Energy’s gas-to-nuclear approach delivers exactly what we need: unrivaled speed to market using existing fuel sources, combined with a clear, rapid transition to the massive, carbon-free baseload power that only nuclear power can provide. This partnership demonstrates how we’re building the future of AI sustainably and at scale,” said Andrew Likens, Crusoe vice president of energy infrastructure & development.

Unlike most other advanced nuclear firms, Blue Energy is not a reactor manufacturer. Instead, the company focuses on the design of modular nuclear power plants, which are manufactured off-site at shipyards and then transported to the site.

The company claims to be reactor agnostic, instead designing the “plant architecture” around the reactor, enabling different reactor vendors to plug in. It said it will focus on deploying mature light-water reactors and submerging the reactors in a pool of water to improve their safety.

“This partnership with AI infrastructure leader Crusoe marks a key milestone for Blue Energy as we work to meet rising global energy demand and, for the first time in the nuclear industry's history, build a plant with cost and schedule certainty,” said Jake Jurewicz, Blue Energy co-founder and CEO. “We’re proud to be working with Port of Victoria leaders to establish our footprint in Texas and look forward to engaging with local and regional partners, including the City of Victoria and nearby Bloomington, as we take steps to build the world’s first project-financed nuclear power plant.”

Crusoe launched in 2019 as a cryptomining business that deployed containerized data centers to oil wells to harness natural gas that would otherwise be ""flared off"" and wasted. It has since pivoted to developing permanent data centers for itself and others, offering AI cloud services (including from leased sites), and has divested its crypto operations.

Crusoe is best known as the primary developer of the 1.2GW Abilene, Texas, campus for OpenAI and Oracle - the first of the Stargate data center projects. The first phase went live in September 2025.

Earlier this month, the company secured $1.4 billion in its latest funding round led by Mubadala Capital and Valor Equity Partners, and saw the company valued at $10bn.

In Colorado, we must support and mentor first time entrepreneurs from historically underrepresented communities to build a more inclusive economy.
My principle is that our economy is stronger—for business, workers, and consumers—when our markets are fair.
Strategic Enablers for Our Economic Growth Business and economic growth don’t happen in isolation.
Workforce: A strong, Colorado-based workforce will fuel our economic growth.","Colorado faces significant challenges—improving affordability, becoming a better place to build a business, and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation across our public, private, and non-profit sectors.

Over the last 30 years, Colorado enjoyed a level of dynamism and growth that made us the envy of the United States. After the COVID pandemic, and now in particular, that level of growth is stalling. From 2013-2020, Colorado grew by roughly 42,000 people a year; from 2020-23, Colorado grew by only 6,000 people per year.

We have faced challenges before— including in the 1980s when Governor Roy Romer and Mayor Federico Peña met the moment and helped to lead us through those challenges. They brought vision, and the best and brightest talent, to lead in government and partner with business, workers, and community leaders. The assets we have today—from Denver International Airport to Major League Baseball—coupled with our natural beauty and lifestyle were game changers. I am honored that Governor Romer and Mayor Peña have endorsed me to be our next governor as the right person to lead our state in this moment.

In Colorado, we root for each other to succeed. Businesses in Colorado—both emerging companies and established ones—ask first, “how can I support you?” That mindset of “give first” is a powerful asset that we can build on as we enable great companies in emerging technologies like personalized medicine in biotech, quantum, water management, clean tech, renewable energy, AI, blockchain, and aerospace to grow in Colorado. As governor, I will be a partner, rolling up my sleeves and asking, “how can I support you?”

We are ready and prepared to reinvigorate Colorado—as a vibrant economic hub with an environment statewide that makes it simple for businesses to start and grow, our business sectors to compete and thrive, workers to earn a good living, and talent to flourish. That includes providing critical support to small businesses for access to capital, mentorship, and technical assistance, particularly for those groups lacking in such resources because of their background. In Colorado, we must support and mentor first time entrepreneurs from historically underrepresented communities to build a more inclusive economy.

Charging Our Colorado Economy

As attorney general, I have led with a spirit of collaboration and innovation to solve problems. On addressing the opioid crisis, we listened, collaborated with others, and got results. We went to court and recovered almost $900 million for our state, which we managed in a nationally recognized, transparent, effective way, focused on solving the problem at hand with local leaders in charge, and metrics to show our impact. Today, those funds are going to help communities recover, and synthetic opioid deaths have decreased by 28.5 percent from October 2023 to October 2024.

I will bring an entrepreneurial mindset to leading Colorado. I honed this approach as a leader of Colorado’s startup community. I founded Silicon Flatirons, an entrepreneurial hub at CU Law School, Startup Colorado, which began in Boulder and is now statewide, and the Blackstone Entrepreneurs Network (now BENColorado). I also served as innovation and technology advisor to President Obama, spearheading the development of Startup America, a push for broadband deployment, and growth in the technology and innovation sectors.

I’ve listened, and heard, that Colorado businesses are concerned that they face headwinds when working with the state government. This includes unresponsive state agencies and outdated regulatory barriers not updated or evaluated in decades. Dealing with the state government takes longer than it should, costing valuable time and resources. And there is not enough “can do” problem solving, like we accomplished with our housing initiative for rural Colorado out of the Attorney General’s Office. The state must listen, learn, and work with Coloradans to meet the challenges we face, from meeting our workforce development skills gap to making housing more affordable to addressing drought and wildfires.

As attorney general, my work establishing a regulatory structure for Colorado’s new Privacy Act demonstrates how I will lead on regulatory issues that impact the private sector—with a commitment to effective, smart oversight, and meaningful input from those affected. Through this approach, we pursued regulations that were technically sound and developed through open dialogue with stakeholders, shaped by public comment, and documented with clear, accessible explanations.

Recharging Our Economic Engine with Conditions to Succeed

As governor, I will partner with business, labor, and community leaders to chart the course ahead for a thriving economy. To get there, here’s my 5-point plan:

Collaborate, championing an environment that supports business and our workforce. I will invite businesses and labor as partners to join teams to solve specific challenges and offer insights and strategies to foster a productive business environment to keep our state economy and workforce competitive;

Maximize our leverage, winning where we have strength. I will work with leaders to promote enhanced growth and innovation in key assets like technology and digital infrastructure, quantum computing, AI, outdoor recreation and tourism, agriculture and natural foods, health care and biomedical innovation, blockchain technologies, aerospace and defense, and energy;

Cultivate the next Colorado innovation renaissance. I will support the next startup and small business renaissance for those attracted by our collaborative culture, talent, innovative spirit, unique natural environment, and quality of life. I will work to expand access to resources and capital through small business grants and microloans, and streamline the process for those just getting started or working hard to grow, recognizing that companies founded by underrepresented groups often face a mentoring gap that can impede their ability to succeed. To help this effort, our new Chief Innovation Officer will make this initiative one of the top priorities, ensuring we bring cutting edge thinking into state government;

Focus on ensuring our urban centers win. A great state is only possible with great towns and cities. I will lead the state to provide new, creative incentives for economic development to grow urban economic hubs both in established job centers and in communities willing and able to support new growth. As governor, I will galvanize our leaders and coalitions to showcase various assets, such as talent pipelines, available offices, manufacturing and research space, community connectedness, and the ability to move quickly. The leaders who attracted and created the Elevate Quantum Tech Hub and the Grand Junction Business Incubator are great examples of how private-public partnerships can build a winning coalition; and

Simplify and remove unnecessary barriers with the goal of making doing business easier. I will direct the Cabinet and each state agency to undertake a comprehensive review of all regulations, based on costs and benefits, removing unnecessary or outdated burdens that serve no safety value.

And to help small business entrepreneurs, we will create a “Starting A Business Ecosystem Navigator”, an interactive, visual map of Colorado’s business ecosystem. The Navigator will highlight steps to start a business, and identify physical spaces, investors and banks, accelerators, and events to support new entrepreneurs as they start their ventures.

Supporting Workers and Fair Competition, and Protecting Consumers

As attorney general, I enforce the state’s consumer protection and antitrust laws. My principle is that our economy is stronger—for business, workers, and consumers—when our markets are fair. For those companies that violate our laws, take advantage of consumers, and don’t treat their workers with respect and according to our laws—they must be held accountable. Equally important, our markets are stronger and fairer for companies which conduct business the right way and follow our laws when we hold companies engaged in wrongdoing accountable.

As governor, I will make sure that the Department of Regulatory Agencies’ consumer protection mission ensures that businesses that play by the rules aren’t at a disadvantage to those that don’t. Similarly, the Department of Labor and Employment will hold accountable businesses that treat their employees unlawfully—such as engaging in wage theft, misclassifying employees, threatening illegal retaliation against immigrant workers, or violating our worker protection laws. As governor, I will not tolerate those that harm workers by violating state’s labor laws, and I will stand with those companies that play by the rules and treat their employees fairly.

As governor, I will ensure that labor always has a seat at the table alongside business in rooms where public policy and decisions are made—because our economic prosperity relies on a strong and sound partnership between employers and employees collaborating together. And labor unions must be respected and protected in their right to organize and bargain for fair treatment and wages for their workforce.

Strategic Enablers for Our Economic Growth

Business and economic growth don’t happen in isolation. As governor, I will support key enablers that are necessary for our state to grow and create jobs.

Infrastructure: We must improve infrastructure for transportation and public transit options, energy, and technology. To attract and keep business in Colorado, we need best-in-class digital and data systems within our energy grid and broadband infrastructure.

To reduce congestion for commuters to get to their workplaces, our major corridors, roads, and bridges must be maintained and upgraded. And, we need more expansive and reliable public transit options.

Workforce: A strong, Colorado-based workforce will fuel our economic growth. I will work collaboratively with the labor and business communities to facilitate talent development and skill building, for incumbent workers, adults upskilling and reskilling, and our youth who are our next generation.

Programs like ColoradoCorps and my Earn-and-Learn promise will invigorate our homegrown talent pipeline. A statewide effort to publish clear data showing how education programs lead to employment outcomes will help Coloradans discern which investments lead to careers. And, we will ensure we enable our workforce by supporting childcare access and affordability across Colorado.

Public Safety: I will champion bringing new resources, strategies, and training to: law enforcement to reenergize our officer talent and techniques; our communities to prevent crime; and victims to preserve justice.",https://philforcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/pwshare.png,N,,2025-10-30 21:06:39.905412

Sign up for Floodlight’s newsletter here. Sign up for Sentient’s newsletter here.

In the United States, climate change is polarizing, but one environmental challenge draws rare bipartisan agreement: food waste. Even as the Trump administration rolls back key climate and environmental protections, in July, senators from both parties reintroduced legislation to simplify food expiration labels — one longtime driver of unnecessary waste. In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched a national initiative to connect food donors with communities and keep edible food out of landfills. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. unveiled a national strategy to reduce food waste and expand recycling of organic waste.

Despite this rare consensus, progress has been slow. In 2023, the U.S. still squandered roughly a third of its food supply, according to the food waste nonprofit ReFED. Food waste is responsible for 8-10% of all global emissions — about five times the emissions from the entire aviation industry. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, after China and the U.S.

Experts tell Sentient that the problem persists because political follow-through is limited, climate action still focuses heavily on energy and transportation and ultimately, food waste itself is difficult to tackle. It occurs at every stage of the supply chain, from farms to fridges, making comprehensive action essential.

It’s also a missed opportunity, especially since wasting food is widely seen as wrong. “Nobody wakes up wanting to waste food,” said Dana Gunders, president of ReFED, during a summit at New York City Climate Week on Sept. 22.

Many people don’t realize that food waste reduction is a crucial and often overlooked climate strategy. Addressing food loss and waste has enormous climate potential, “but it’s still an underexplored area,” says Brian Lipinski, head researcher on food loss and waste at the environmental research nonprofit World Resources Institute.

The climate cost of wasted food

Most food waste happens in homes, restaurants and retailers, but nearly all of its climate impact is already baked in by the time the food is thrown away. Every piece of wasted food squanders all the emissions that went into producing and transporting that food. About 92% of food waste emissions happen during food production — when land is converted from forests or grassland to farmland, when resources are used to grow crops or raise livestock, during transport in which most vehicles run on diesel or gasoline and during cold storage. Once that food is tossed, those emissions are wasted. Only 8% of food waste emissions come from the disposal process.

When people are wasting food, “in many ways, we are throwing out a lot of water, a lot of land, a lot of fertilizer, natural habitat, a lot of things,” Paul West, a senior scientist at the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, tells Sentient.

Fruits and vegetables make up almost half — 44% — of all U.S. food waste, according to ReFED. Meat and seafood, though also quick to spoil, are wasted less often because they are more expensive.

But wasting even a small portion of a burger has far greater environmental impact than wasting the same amount of fruits, vegetables or chicken, says West. That’s because producing beef requires vast amounts of land, water and fertilizer, and cattle also release methane — a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas — with each cow burping about 220 pounds annually. “If we are going to eat beef and dairy, make sure not to waste it,” says West.

Why prevention matters most

Experts see reducing food loss and waste as one of the most impactful and practical ways to slow the warming of the planet. Project Drawdown calls it an “emergency brake” solution — a measure that can rapidly slash emissions using tools we already have, without waiting for new technologies or nature-based fixes. Other such measures include halting deforestation and shifting away from meat and dairy.

“Preventing food from becoming waste is really the most effective solution, not only from an emissions perspective,” says Minerva Ringland, senior manager of the climate and insights team at ReFED, “but it’s also saving the most money and keeping everyone fed as much as possible.”

In the United States, 35% of food waste comes from households, while 18% comes from manufacturing and 17% from food service, and 24% happens on farms. Household waste is high because people often buy more than what they need, especially in bulk, misinterpret date labels, prepare too much food and may not know how to store or repurpose ingredients. Limited access to composting programs also makes it harder for consumers to avoid landfills.

Experts suggest households can curb waste by planning meals, buying only what’s needed, using smaller portions and repurposing leftovers. Emily Broad Leib, director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, says the U.S. needs a national consumer awareness campaign, similar to the United Kingdom’s Love Food, Hate Waste campaign. She notes that the Biden administration set aside funding to develop such a campaign, but it has since stalled. Many people don’t realize how significant the issue of food waste is, she says — not just for the environment but for their own finances.

But reducing food waste at home is not just about telling people to be more careful or intentional about their purchases. After all, food waste is rarely intentional. Maybe you buy an ingredient for one recipe and never use the rest, or forget the leftovers in your fridge and they go bad. Lipinski says that retailers and food service providers can help consumers avoid waste by offering smaller portions, clearer guidance and smarter packaging.

Government agencies can lead by example in reducing food waste in their dining halls, federal buildings, schools and military bases by requiring vendors to donate surplus food, Broad Leib suggests.

These strategies are worth the effort because preventing food waste at its source offers climate benefits about 10 times higher than other strategies since it reduces the need for producing additional food.

Beyond prevention, the EPA identifies donation and upcycling — turning food into new products — as the most preferred approaches. However, 40% of donated food still goes to waste, and both strategies require energy for transport, storage and processing. According to the EPA, using wasted food as animal feed, leaving crops unharvested, composting and anaerobic digestion do much less to offset the environmental impacts of food production than preventing food waste in the first place.

Where Most Wasted Food Ends Up

Most of the country’s surplus food still ends up in landfills, compost facilities, incinerators or anaerobic digesters, according to ReFED. Only about 2% is donated. Food makes up about nearly a quarter of combusted municipal solid waste that ends up in landfills.

In landfills, food waste decays and releases methane, a gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a 20-year period. Landfills produce 17% of human-related methane emissions in the U.S., after oil and gas and livestock digestion. A majority of the methane released from landfills in the U.S. comes from food waste, according to the EPA. A separate analysis by ReFED estimates that surplus food generates nearly 3 million metric tons of methane each year.

Improving landfill management is one of Project Drawdown’s highly recommended climate solutions. To capture or reduce methane emissions, some landfills install systems that divert landfill gas so that it can be burned for energy and sold to industries or utilities, helping replace fossil fuels. Methane that cannot be used for energy is typically burned off using flares. Another approach uses biocovers — layers of organic material that foster bacteria that convert methane into carbon dioxide and water. Leak detection and repair programs can monitor methane leaks using drones, satellites or on-site sensors, which helps operators spot and fix leaks.

Encouraging composting instead of putting food scraps in landfills also helps. But West says that while composting and landfill management matter, “you’ll have many times more impact if you stop the waste in the first place.”

A change to these policies could help curb food waste

For something so uncontroversial, food waste has proven remarkably hard to fix.

In 2015, the U.S. set an ambitious goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030 — a target experts say is quickly becoming out of reach. No state is on track to meet the target, researchers from ReFED and University of California Davis found in an analysis published in January. They warned that food waste levels are unlikely to fall without stronger state and federal action focused on prevention measures such as standardized date labeling, food rescue and repurposing. Current policies, they noted, focus too narrowly on recycling methods like composting rather than addressing the problem across the entire food system.

Standardized date labeling is one of the most cost-effective fixes, ReFED argues. In the U.S., 6% of all food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Many U.S. consumers don’t know the specifics, but there is no national standard for date labels. Some products have “Sell by” dates, others have “Best before” dates, and still others have “Use by” dates — and they often mean different things in different states. The dates on packaging are “not designed for consumers to understand clearly,” Ringwald says.

As a result, many people toss food after the printed date, assuming it is unsafe to eat. This confusion leads Americans to discard about 3 billion pounds of perfectly fine food worth $7 billion each year. “Sell by,” “Best before,” and “Use by” dates usually indicate how long a product will stay at peak quality, not whether it is still safe to eat. According to the USDA, the “Best if used by” or “Best before” date shows when the product will taste or look its best. “Sell by” indicates how long a store should keep a product on the shelf, and is meant for communication between manufacturers and retailers, but is often mistaken by consumers for an expiration date.“Use by” is the last date the product is at its best quality.

If you have a can of beans in your cupboard with a “Sell by,” “Use by,” or “Best before” date, it does not necessarily mean you should throw it once that date passes. ReFED says that many foods such as canned goods, nuts and dry packaged goods can remain edible past the printed date.

To address this, ReFED advocates for a two-label system: “Best if used by” and “Use by.” “Best if used by” indicates product quality: it may not taste its best, but it is still safe to consume. This label is recommended for use for canned goods, bread, raw meats, frozen foods and pasteurized products. Meanwhile, “Use by” would apply to highly perishable items or those that pose a risk to safety over time like deli meats, unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses, and smoked seafood. These products should be eaten by the date on the package and tossed afterward. If passed, the bill reintroduced in the Senate would make that standard nationwide. Similar measures have been introduced in the past but have not advanced. ReFED estimates that standardizing labels could keep at least 425,000 tons of food — or 708 million meals — out of landfills each year.

“Even though the issue is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have cared about and worked on, there’s a lot of momentum that gets lost in between administrations,” Broad Leib says. The lack of sustained policies, she adds, has prevented the U.S. from making meaningful progress in reducing food waste.

‘Pockets of progress’

Still, there are signs of progress, especially at the state level. That’s probably where we’ll see more momentum under the Trump administration, says Lipinski.

In 2024, California signed the country’s first legislation to adopt a clear two-label system on food products. Starting July 1, 2026, the law will also ban the use of “Sell by” dates.

Another is the implementation of state-level mandates that prohibit sending commercial food waste to landfills. States including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Massachusetts have enacted such bans. However, a study published last year found these policies have largely fallen short — except in Massachusetts, which succeeded in reducing the amount of food waste sent to landfills by 13%. Researchers found that Massachusetts has the country’s most extensive food waste composting network, making it easy and low-cost for businesses and households to follow the ban. The state’s rules are straightforward, with no exemptions, and authorities conduct far more inspections and issue more fines for violations than in other states. These differences point the way toward better implementation in other states.

Experts say that stronger incentives for grocers and restaurants to donate food could also make a significant difference. Some states like California now require some commercial establishments to donate edible food that they would otherwise throw out.

“We’re seeing pockets of progress everywhere,” says Ringwald. Because food waste is a complex problem, she adds, “We’re going to need a lot of solutions.” The key is turning these scattered successes into coordinated and sustained action across the supply chain, which can save money, slash emissions and put food on tables.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240724982.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 17:05:24.714706

What's Next?,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/court-ordered-new-york-issue-major-climate-rules-whats-next,"Governor Kathy Hochul is digging in after a state court ruled Friday that New York is violating its flagship climate law and ordered the state to comply.
Instead, she plans to appeal the ruling and seek a deal with the legislature to amend the climate law.
Gerrard is skeptical that the Hochul administration can ultimately prevail in court as long as the climate law remains in its current form.
Some in the legislature appear open to pushing back climate law deadlines, as business groups have increasingly pressed the state to do.
McDonald said a “mild extension” to the climate law could well be warranted given the many obstacles in New York’s way.","Governor Kathy Hochul is digging in after a state court ruled Friday that New York is violating its flagship climate law and ordered the state to comply. Rebuffing the judge, she is gearing up for a rematch in the courts and a potential showdown over the state’s green energy transition during next year’s legislative session.

Ulster County Supreme Court Judge Julian Schreibman gave Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration until February 6 to issue regulations that would “ensure” the state meet emissions targets set out in the law. They include a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, which the state estimates it is at least six years behind on.

For years, Hochul’s plan to get New York on track was a pollution pricing program known as “cap and invest” — until she abruptly shelved it in January, prompting climate groups to sue.

Now, Hochul is slamming the court order as unrealistic in light of President Donald Trump’s war on renewable energy and the ongoing economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking to reporters Monday, she made clear that she has no intention of reviving the cap and invest program in the coming months. Instead, she plans to appeal the ruling and seek a deal with the legislature to amend the climate law.

“We have time to work it out,” she said. “We’ll work on appeal. We’ll sit down and talk to the legislature [about] what’s within the realm of possibility and reality here in light of all these changed circumstances.”

So where could things go from here?

The Courts

The appeals process could allow Hochul to extend the court deadline past February, and potentially even beyond her bid for reelection next November, legal experts told New York Focus. Her administration has 30 days to file a notice of appeal, a simple one-page form that sends the case to a higher court. This would automatically suspend Schreibman’s decision, unless the plaintiffs can persuade an appellate judge that the order should hold while the appeal is heard.

Then, the state has six months to file a complete appeal, meaning it could take until the end of April just for the appeals case to begin in earnest. From there, the appeals court may take anywhere from six months to a year to reach a decision, said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.

That could push the case into 2027 — after the gubernatorial election, and around the time that the Hochul administration has hinted it could reopen the discussion around cap and invest.

“I don’t see what incentive the state has to go fast on this,” Gerrard said, nodding to the electoral calendar. “Whichever decision [Hochul] makes is going to annoy a lot of people.”

Either party in the case could request an expedited schedule, he noted, but it would be up to the appellate judge to decide whether to grant it.

Gerrard is skeptical that the Hochul administration can ultimately prevail in court as long as the climate law remains in its current form. One of the main precedents cited in Friday’s decision was a case that forced New York City to move ahead with mandatory recycling in the early 1990s. (Gerrard represented the environmentalists who brought the case.) It went up to the state’s highest court, which ruled that an executive agency could not ignore a legal mandate just because of economic or other challenges. Schreibman’s order made the same argument.

“I don’t think there’s a strong case for an appeal,” Gerrard said. “The law is very clear.”

The Legislature

Even if an appeal doesn’t succeed in the long run, it could buy Hochul time to move the fight into an arena where she has more sway: state budget negotiations.

Hochul’s budget proposal in January will set the agenda for the first several months of Albany’s legislative session, putting in motion a marathon of negotiations that will decide spending and innumerable other state policies. The budget, which is due by April 1 but tends to run long past the deadline, often serves as a vehicle for politically thorny policies that might not pass the legislature on their own.

In 2023, Hochul tried to loosen New York’s climate law standards in a surprise budget maneuver, only to walk back the proposal within days after fierce backlash from climate groups. Since then, though, Donald Trump’s election, surging power demand from data centers, and rising concerns about the cost of living have roiled climate politics.

Few lawmakers have commented publicly on Friday’s ruling so far. State Senator Liz Krueger, a climate hawk and chair of the chamber’s budget committee, was the first, saying in a statement Monday that there was “no appetite” among her Democratic colleagues to amend the climate law. The Senate passed a resolution last year urging Hochul to press ahead with cap and invest, and Krueger said the program remains the best way to raise the funds needed for New York to shift to a cleaner, cheaper energy system.

But speaking with New York Focus on Tuesday, Krueger said she couldn’t rule anything out.

“I’m living in a world where new chaos ensues, primarily driven by the federal government, each and every day, so asking me what I think can happen three months from now is a bit of a challenge,” she said.

Some in the legislature appear open to pushing back climate law deadlines, as business groups have increasingly pressed the state to do.

“If there’s a discussion to be had about affordability and making life more affordable for New Yorkers, we should have that conversation,” said Assemblymember John McDonald, an Albany-area Democrat.

Hochul has cited potential energy cost hikes for consumers as her top reason for pausing cap and invest, though the state’s own modeling and outside studies have found that low- and moderate-income households would likely see a net savings from the policy. Higher earners would see a slight increase.

McDonald said a “mild extension” to the climate law could well be warranted given the many obstacles in New York’s way.

“If there’s a way that we can still work towards our goal, albeit a little bit slower, it’s better than not achieving the goal at all,” he said. McDonald is one of at least nine Assembly Democrats who have signed on to a letter asking the governor to delay by a year the implementation of a state law that would require most new buildings to run all-electric. Hochul has said she is considering the delay.

Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha of Ulster County, a democratic socialist and former climate organizer, said that the camps in the Assembly haven’t changed drastically since Trump took office. But in Trump’s second term, “everything is on fire,” she said. “So in terms of what legislators will pick as their top three fights to go all in on, that’s a real challenge.”

Assemblymember Michaelle Solages, chair of the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, And Asian Legislative Caucus, was circumspect.

“As we review the ruling, it’s clear that New York must maintain its leadership in addressing the climate crisis responsibly and effectively, especially as the federal government rolls back environmental protections and undermines progress on clean energy,” she wrote in a text message.

Spokespeople for Assembly and Senate leadership did not respond to requests for comment on Friday’s ruling.

A ‘Stark Choice’

As Albany gears up for the new legislative session in January, the climate law’s backers and opponents are both seizing on Friday’s court order.

“It was a resounding legal decision and victory for the environment, victory for the rule of law, which in this day and age we do not take for granted,” said Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY. She added that she was “disappointed to see the governor negotiating against herself in this matter” after Hochul’s agencies spent years laying the foundations for a successful cap and invest program.

Justin Wilcox, executive director of the business group Upstate United, said New York now faces a “stark choice” between pushing ahead with cap and invest and amending the climate law.

“Upstate United believes the choice is clear: New York’s leaders must act swiftly to amend the law,” he said in a statement Monday.

State Senator Jake Ashby, an Albany-area Republican, went further, calling for a full repeal of the law in a statement Wednesday.

Krueger, the Senate budget chair, said she was bracing herself for a rollercoaster of a legislative session.

“I don’t think anybody expects this to be a normal year in any way, shape, or form,” she said. “I think it would be a tragic mistake for the state of New York to roll back anything we’ve passed into law vis-à-vis climate. … That doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be people who push for that.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47661/UTVEgkdkrL5Cl0Kq5PM1uPBObwv1P-0L32gil5oE_9I/w%3A820/h%3A546/rt%3Afill/g%3Afp%3A0.5%3A0.5/q%3A90/el%3A1/ahr0chm6ly9zmy51cy1lyxn0ltiuyw1hem9uyxdzlmnvbs9uexnmb2n1cy9dtenqqs1ydwxpbmctcmvhec5wbmc1761844916.png?h=4bc2b340&itok=jn6jK96U,N,,2025-10-30 19:00:35.402564

During an appearance at the Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Summit, the initiative was revealed to the public – a plan set to distribute millions in the form of grants and low-interest loans to qualifying entities in the energy production industry, mainly focusing on natural gas and nuclear power.

Speaking to Ohio's position in the energy landscape, Governor DeWine underscored the essential nature of a robust energy policy that supports both current necessities and anticipates future demands, stating via the Ohio Governor Mike DeWine website, ""To continue Ohio’s growth and to create jobs, we must focus on energy."" The funding is anticipated to cover a span of five years, targeting various key sectors, including engineering, construction for natural gas infrastructure, as well as the setup and incentives related to Small Modular Reactor (SMR) generation. This multifaceted approach, DeWine believes, will ""help keep costs reasonable.""

The Energy Opportunity Initiative is not just a financial gesture but also a strategic move to position Ohio as a leader in the energy sector. Indeed, JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef sees the state as a driving force in what he described as the trillion-dollar ""Energy Super Sector."" He told attendees, ""This initiative strengthens that momentum, fueling new projects, jobs, and America’s growing energy needs."" Aligning with this vision, the Ohio Business Roundtable President and CEO Pat Tiberi highlighted the state's unique capacity for energy generation and development, from nuclear technology and solar manufacturing to its shale capacity.

Backing the burgeoning energy narrative in Ohio, Centrus Energy President and CEO Amir Vexler contributed to the dialogue regarding the state’s foresight and leadership in the energy domain.

It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.
Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year.
And starting next year MP also plans to begin processing the heavy rare earths China had restricted in the spring at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California.
But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.","China's promise to delay its newest restrictions on the export of the rare earths that are crucial to many high-tech products for one year as part of a trade agreement President Donald Trump secured creates an opportunity for the U.S. and its allies to bolster their own production and processing capabilities. But it will be hard to undercut China's stranglehold on the market.

The restrictions China imposed on rare earths this year have been a key issue in the trade talks between Beijing and Washington. Trump responded angrily to China's latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.

This week's deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.

These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles and robots to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

Temporary relief

Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China's new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn't change the broader strategic picture, and it's important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.

“This move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,” Mukherjee said. ""This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.”

The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies. The Pentagon agreed to invest $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials and promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.

The West is making progress

Ian Lange, who is an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines, said he thinks the U.S. and its allies can make significant progress in a year's time to lessen China's dominance of the rare earths market.

There are a number of promising efforts already underway. Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year. And starting next year MP also plans to begin processing the heavy rare earths China had restricted in the spring at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California.

And Lange said that other efforts to recycle rare earths and begin producing them as byproducts at existing steel and zirconium mines may also start to pay off. The United States' recent agreement with Australia will also help provide additional materials to counter China.

China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.

Investing in the industry is a priority

Industry executives have said this needs to be the “Manhattan Project moment” for rare earths if the United States is ever to break China’s grip over them.

“We’re moving into overtime with China and they currently have the ball on our 10-yard line. Our best defensive move is to tie together our global refining and supply partnerships with allies and swiftly invest in innovation in the United States,” said Wade Senti, president of the U.S. permanent magnet company AML.

Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn said the details of “how China implements this suspension will matter greatly, and with the deal limited to one year, it’s clear the U.S. must use this window to strengthen domestic capabilities and reduce long-term exposure to geopolitical risk.”

Lange said he is optimistic overall because the United States isn’t starting from zero, and if these efforts continue at their current pace, America should be much better off in a year even if some of the things the government is investing in will take several years to become a reality.

“Because in a year, we don’t really care what they do. We’ve got an independent supply chain. At least I don’t think we’re too far from that,” Lange said.

However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent surge in energy prices, and the energy crisis marked the beginning of the end for ESG and super-bargain valuations.
But is this Texas-based company a no-brainer buy for energy investors?""
Under his leadership, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A:NYSE) (BRK.B:NYSE) acquired a 27% stake in the oil company.
While Buffett emphasized Occidental's role in U.S. energy production, the company also has substantial operations abroad.","Four years ago, when oil and gas companies made bold pledges to reduce emissions and shift towards renewable energy, their industries were in turmoil, according to Rebecca F. Elliott writing for the New York Times in November 2024.

The pandemic caused a sharp decline in fuel demand, leading to plummeting prices. Major Western oil and gas companies were losing significant amounts of money, with losses exceeding US$100 billion, according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, Eliott wrote. At the time, renewable energy appeared to be not only cleaner but also a more promising business than oil and gas for many companies and investors.

""Investors were focused on what I would say was the prevailing narrative around, 'It's all moving to wind and solar,'"" said Darren Woods, chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil. ""I had a lot of pressure to get into the wind and solar business,"" he added.

Buoyed by the shift in U.S. energy policies under President Donald Trump, investors are pivoting and once again supporting major oil and gas companies as the fervor for ESG initiatives wanes, particularly in corporate America, reported Tsvetana Paraskova in an OilPrice.com piece published on Investing.com on October 1, 2025.

Despite the recent craze for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in the markets, ESG has inadvertently benefited value investors by driving down the valuations of oil and gas companies to attractive levels, alongside the oil price crash of 2020. These rock-bottom valuations have enticed bargain hunters and contrarian investors to continue betting on fossil fuels, even amid a significant market and ideological shift against them.

For instance, during much of 2020 and 2021, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM:NYSE), the largest U.S. oil company by valuation, saw its share price fall below the per-share value of all its assets, Paraskova reported. The price-to-tangible book value per share dropped to below 1, compared to about 3 over the previous two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and cited by Bloomberg Opinion columnist Javier Blas.

However, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent surge in energy prices, and the energy crisis marked the beginning of the end for ESG and super-bargain valuations. The prospect of US$100 per barrel oil in the event of supply shortages bolstered the narrative for U.S. supermajors. Exxon and Chevron maintained their stance that the world will continue to need oil and gas for the foreseeable future, and investments in solar and wind are not suitable for companies focused on high returns and shareholder payouts.

Europe's major oil companies, especially Shell Plc. (SHEL:NYSE; SHEL:LON; SHELL:AMS) and BP Plc (BP:NYSE; BP:LSE), had to revise strategies that in 2020 promised a reduction in oil output by the end of the decade, the article said.

By 2024 and 2025, they reset their focus on upstream operations and pledged to increase oil and gas production to meet the world's growing energy demands, Paraskova noted. BP and Shell also significantly scaled back their commitments to invest in renewable energy sources, abandoning projects for biofuels plants in the Netherlands and redirecting more funds to core oil and gas operations at the expense of renewables investments.

Is Energy Transition Only Way Forward?

This sentiment is now widespread: the industry is facing fundamental questions about the feasibility and implementation of the energy transition, Irina Slav wrote for OilPrice.com in another article published on Investing.com, this one on October 14.

""This uncertainty is not only political but is increasingly technical, driven by real-world grid challenges that are forcing a reckoning between ambitious climate targets and practical energy security,"" Slav wrote.

This spring, both Spain and Portugal experienced a severe blackout, and Spain's grid operator is warning that it could happen again due to wild voltage fluctuations, the article noted.

This warning comes shortly after the network of the bloc's grid operators released its report on the April blackout, identifying excessive voltage as the cause. Excessive voltage is not something caused by gas, nuclear, or coal power plants. Voltage swings are one of the lesser-known characteristics of wind and solar installations, and they necessitate curtailment during low-demand periods to prevent blackouts, Slav noted. Essentially, grid operators are indicating that there is a problem with uncontrolled wind and solar, and it could be a significant issue.

""Facts like this tend to undermine the reputation of the energy transition as the only way forward, with a net zero of acceptable alternatives,"" Slav wrote.

Clean energy solutions, including offshore wind and green hydrogen, have faced high interest rates and supply chain challenges in recent years, making projects more costly and less profitable, the article said. This was a deal-breaker for Big Oil firms, which are averse to financial losses when oil prices are low in the cyclical energy commodities business and do not want additional financial burdens from losses in their low-carbon energy divisions.

Investors Start to Think 'Energy,' Not 'Crude' or 'Gas'

There have been times in recent history when the oil industry has struggled, particularly during the peak existential fears of the past decade about its future as a global power source, Eric Rosenbaum wrote for ETF Edge on CNBC.com on August 28.

However, since that panic subsided, the industry has performed reasonably well. Over the past five years, whether looking at the market performance of Exxon Mobil or the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), returns have been strong after hitting a low point, Rosenbaum said.

Yet, this year, even though Exxon Mobil, Chevron (CVX:NYSE), and energy stocks as a whole have delivered positive returns, they haven't been the standout winners for investors focusing on the future of energy, according to Paul Baiocchi, head of fund sales and strategy at SS&C ALPS Advisors, Rosenbaum noted.

He said there have been year-to-date outflows of about US$7 billion from XLE, the largest and most liquid energy market ETF. Some of this may be due to concerns that the global economy could falter as a result of Trump's trade war, and with oil prices under pressure, oil and gas stocks may face greater challenges. However, it also indicates a broader shift in how investors are considering energy exposure.

""It speaks to the fact that advisors and investors are starting to think about energy more in terms of power than just crude oil and natural gas,"" Baiocchi said on CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week, according to Rosenbaum. ""The conversation about energy is evolving beyond simply, 'I have to own the large majors.'""

Baiocchi's firm has long offered a way to make a more focused bet within the broader energy sector, led by its 15-year-old Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), which concentrates on energy infrastructure like pipelines and has seen net inflows this year, Rosenbaum wrote.

Returning to the Core Business

The return to core business by European majors and the intensified focus on the Permian Basin and global exploration hotspots like Guyana for Exxon and Chevron have helped restore some of the market valuations lost in the 2020 downturn, Paraskova noted in the October 1 OilPrice.com piece.

Despite higher — but not excessively high — valuations, Big Oil still appears to be a bargain for investors, especially when compared to other S&P 500 sectors and Big Tech, she noted.

Investors who have remained with the oil industry through the past five turbulent years in markets, geopolitics, and the reversal of U.S. energy policies now anticipate that increased valuations will eventually lead to looser financial discipline, Bloomberg's Blas argues, according to Paraskova.

However, oil prices below US$70 per barrel and expectations of a surplus in the oil and LNG markets in the near term are keeping Big Oil committed to prudent investment strategies, with priorities focused on boosting production and returns for investors.

There are numerous oil stocks available, ranging from pure-play exploration and production companies (E&Ps) to midstream businesses, service providers, refiners, and integrated oil majors that cover a bit of everything. Investors have a wide array of choices, Lou Whiteman noted for The Motley Fool on October 16.

One of the world's largest energy companies, Enbridge, can cover the majors for your portfolio. Its market cap is US$102.7 billion, and according to The Motley Fool piece, it yields a 5.67% dividend.

Enbridge Inc. (ENB:NYSE; ENB:TSX), North America's leading energy infrastructure company, recently emphasized its dedication to shareholder returns by declaring a quarterly dividend of US$0.9425 per common share, according to a report by MarketMinute on FinancialContent.com on October 13.

Announced on July 29, 2025, this routine corporate action holds significant importance for investors. It strongly reaffirms the company's solid financial health and reliable cash flow generation, making it an appealing choice for income-focused portfolios, even before the market was aware of the specific amount, the piece noted.

""The consistent declaration of a dividend, especially by a company with Enbridge's storied history, signals management's confidence in its operational stability and future earnings potential,"" MarketMinute said. ""For investors, this translates into a reliable income stream, a crucial factor in an economic environment where dependable returns are highly prized. Enbridge's ability to maintain and grow its dividend showcases its resilience and strategic positioning within the essential energy sector.""

Enbridge serves 7.1 energy customers in Canada and the U.S. and has been in business for 175 years, it said on its website.

In September, the company announced that it had made a final investment decision on two promising gas transmission projects. Enbridge signed commercial agreements for the Algonquin Reliable Affordable Resilient Enhancement project (AGT Enhancement), which aims to boost deliveries on the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline to existing Local Distribution Company (LDC) customers in the U.S. Northeast. Additionally, through its Matterhorn joint venture, Enbridge has reached a final investment decision on the Eiger Express Pipeline (Eiger), a pipeline capable of transporting up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) from the Permian Basin to the Katy, Texas, area, serving the expanding U.S. Gulf Coast LNG market.

""We continue to deliver on the US$23 billion of gas transmission opportunities we outlined at our Investor Day in March,"" Executive Vice President, Gas Transmission Cynthia Hansen said. ""Today's project announcements highlight the benefits of Enbridge's scale and demonstrate our ability to support growing natural gas demand in the U.S. Northeast and LNG exports from the U.S. Gulf Coast. ""These investments add visibility to, and extend, our growth outlook through the end of the decade.""

Once completed, the AGT Enhancement will provide approximately 75 Mmcf/d of additional natural gas, under long-term contracts, to investment-grade counterparties in the U.S. Northeast, the company said.

Natural gas plays a crucial role in the region's energy mix. This project is designed to enhance reliable supply and improve affordability by reducing winter price volatility for customers. Enbridge said it plans to invest US$0.3 billion in system upgrades within, or adjacent to, existing rights-of-way. Subject to the timely receipt of necessary government and regulatory approvals, Enbridge anticipates completing the AGT Enhancement by 2029.

The Eiger project is designed to transport up to 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas through approximately 450 miles of 42-inch pipeline from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Katy area. Upon its expected completion in 2028, Enbridge expects to hold a significant equity interest in up to 10 Bcf/d of long-haul Permian Basin egress pipeline capacity, connected to key storage facilities and LNG export hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

This project complements the Whistler Parent JV assets and is supported by long-term contracts with predominantly investment-grade counterparties.

According to a piece by MarketBeat on October 24, Enbridge has received an average rating of ""Moderate Buy"" from the 12 research firms currently covering the company. Among these analysts, seven have given the stock a ""Hold"" rating, four have issued a ""Buy"" rating, and one has assigned a ""Strong Buy"" rating. The average 12-month target price from analysts who have updated their coverage on the stock over the past year is CA$67.80.

In an email update on October 29, MarketBeat Canada said the company's price target was raised by analysts at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. from CA$72.00 to CA$73.00, and the firm now has a ""Buy"" rating on the stock. This represents a 12.2% upside from the price at the time of writing of CA$65.07.

Less than 1% of the company is held by insiders and management, less than 1% by strategic corporate entities and holding companies, and 56% by institutions. The rest is retail.1

Top shareholders include The Vanguard Group Inc. with 4.33%, GQG Partners LLC with 3.47%, RBC Global Asset Management Inc. 2.51%, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC with 1.78%, and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. with 1.55%.

Its market cap is CA$143.17 billion with 2.18 billion shares outstanding. It trades in a 52-week range of CA$55.53 and CA$70.39.

Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY:NYSE) to be nearly a permanent holding, according to a piece by Keith Speights for The Motley Fool on October 29.

When it comes to the most crucial geographical hub for energy companies, Texas stands out. The Lone Star State hosts many of the world's largest oil and gas producers, pipeline operators, and more. If you narrow it down further, Houston, Texas, is a key area. Several leading energy companies are based in this metropolitan region, Speights wrote.

""No, Oxy doesn't boast the largest market cap among its peers. But is this Texas-based company a no-brainer buy for energy investors?"" he wrote.

Warren Buffett is arguably one of the best sources for reasons to consider investing in Occidental Petroleum, Speights noted. Under his leadership, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A:NYSE) (BRK.B:NYSE) acquired a 27% stake in the oil company. Berkshire also holds warrants that could increase this position. In a letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett mentioned that Occidental is one of the few stocks he expects the conglomerate to ""maintain indefinitely.""

The legendary investor noted, ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States.""

In fact, on October 2, OXY announced that it entered into a definitive agreement for Berkshire Hathaway to purchase its chemical division, OxyChem, in an all-cash deal valued at US$9.7 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. OxyChem is a global producer of essential commodity chemicals used in water treatment, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and both commercial and residential development.

""This transaction enhances our financial standing and catalyzes a significant resource opportunity we've been cultivating in our oil and gas business over the past decade,"" OXY President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said. ""I'm incredibly proud of the impressive work the team has done to create this strategic opportunity that will unlock 20+ years of low-cost resource runway and deliver meaningful near and long-term value.""

Occidental also derives significant value from its oil and gas assets. For example, the company's average six-month cumulative oil production in the Delaware Basin was 45% higher than the average operator, the Motley Fool piece said.

While Buffett emphasized Occidental's role in U.S. energy production, the company also has substantial operations abroad. In May, Oxy signed a 15-year contract extension with Oman, allowing it to boost production in the Middle Eastern country.

The company saw its price target raised by analysts at Bank of America from US$44.00 to US$47.00, according to a report released on Monday, as reported by Benzinga, MarketBeat wrote on October 6.

The brokerage currently maintains a ""Neutral"" rating on the oil and gas producer's stock. Bank of America's new price target suggests a potential upside of 4.78% from the company's current price at the time of the research note.

Other research analysts have also released reports on the company, according to MarketBeat. Some include Weiss Ratings reiterated a ""Hold (c-)"" rating on Occidental Petroleum shares in a research report on September 27, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed an ""Equal Weight"" rating and set a US$52.00 price objective for the shares in a research report on August 18, and Scotiabank increased its target price from US$40.00 to US$45.00 and gave the company a ""Sector perform"" rating in a research report on July 11.

According to MarketBeat.com, one equities research analyst has given the stock a ""Strong Buy"" rating, six have issued a ""Buy"" rating, 16 have assigned a ""Hold"" rating, and two have given a ""Sell"" rating. Occidental Petroleum currently has an average rating of ""Hold"" and an average price target of US$52.43, according to the website.

Less than 1% of the company is owned by insiders and management, about 27% is held by holding companies, and 50% by institutions. The rest is retail.1

Top shareholders include Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with 26.91%, The Vanguard Group Inc. with 8.96%, Dodge & Cox with 8.15%, State Street Investment Management with 3.97%, and BlackRock Institutional Trust Co. with 3.49%.

Its market cap is US$40.19 billion with 984.44 million shares outstanding. It trades in a 52-week range of US$34.79 and US$53.20.

Serica Energy Plc. (SQZZF:OTCMKTS; SQZ:AIM), which has reached an agreement to acquire BP's entire interest in two UK North Sea licenses, including a 32% non-operated stake in the Culzean gas-condensate field, the largest gas-producing field on the UK Continental Shelf, according to an article on the World Oil website on October 13.

As part of the deal, Serica will also assume BP's position in exploration license P2544, located next to the producing Culzean field in the UK Central North Sea. The transaction, valued at US$232 million, is anticipated to close by the end of 2025, pending the waiver of partner pre-emption rights.

Culzean, operated by TotalEnergies, produces approximately 25,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) net to BP at a 98% uptime and contains an estimated 33 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) of remaining 2P reserves.

Serica noted that the field's low emissions and US$10.7/boe production cost make it one of the most efficient assets in the North Sea.

Serica said it intends to finance the acquisition using a combination of cash flow from the Culzean stake and existing resources, including its US$525 million reserve-based lending facility, while considering a new acquisition facility to support future growth.

""Should this complete, it would represent a transformational acquisition for Serica,"" said Auctus Advisors Analyst Stephane Foucaud in an updated research note on October 13. ""Culzean's 1H25 net production to BP exceeds Serica's entire 1H25 output, offering immediate scale, diversification via a new hub, and a >25% uplift to 2P reserves (including Prax). There is also potential upside from infill drilling and exploration.""

The analyst said the firm's core NAV and ReNAV were unchanged at £2.80 per share and £3.05 per share, respectively.

""Should TotalEnergies or NEO NEXT not exercise their right to pre-emption, these figures will rise,"" Foucaud said. ""The acquisition is expected to be funded from Serica's current cash and undrawn amounts under the existing US$525 mm RBL.""

According to a report by MarketBeat on October 25, shares of the company have received a consensus rating of ""Buy"" from the six ratings firms currently covering the company. All analysts gave the stock a ""Buy"" rating. The average 12-month target price among analysts who have issued reports on the stock over the past year is £219.50.

Several equities research analysts have provided their insights on SQZ shares, the article said. Shore Capital set a £225 price target on October 8, JPMorgan Chase & Co. set a £215 target price on August 13, Canaccord Genuity Group raised its target price from £215 to £240 October 3, Jefferies Financial Group increased its price objective from £190 to £230 on October 20, and Peel Hunt issued a £207 price objective on October 8.

Detroit settles lawsuit over pedestrian death

The city of Detroit has agreed to pay nearly $6 million to settle a lawsuit over the death of a pedestrian who was struck by a bus. It was the second fatality involving the same driver since 2015.

A Wayne County judge signed off on the deal last week. Janice Bauer, 67, was hit by a city bus while walking in a downtown crosswalk in 2023. The driver, Geraldine Johnson, was sentenced to six months in jail a year ago after pleading no contest to a moving violation causing death.

DTE Energy net profit updates

DTE Energy is reporting net profits of $419 million in the third quarter of this year. The earnings, not including non-recurring costs, hit $2.25 per share. That beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations. The company says it has invested $3 billion this year to improve electric and natural gas infrastructure.

Short-term rental tax

A state House bill would let local governments ask voters to approve taxes on short-term rentals.

Republican Representative Mark Tisdel is one of the sponsors. He says communities are incurring costs that exceed existing tax revenue from rentals.

“If you’re renting that out to different short-term renters all summer long, that’s their week on the beach to howl. And it creates a problem for the houses on either side, which creates a problem for the police. Those expenses have to be covered.”

The Michigan Association of Realtors says it wants lawmakers to include limits on local regulations meant to shut out short term rentals.

residents could save up to £250 on application fees with wider proposals to help renters and leaseholders install chargers

more households could run their electric vehicles for as little as 2p per mile – saving families cash and helping more people to make the switch

Electric car owners will find it easier and cheaper to charge their vehicles at home under new plans unveiled Thursday 29 October 2025, designed to make it fairer for renters and those without a private driveway.

The plans would make it easier for renters and leaseholders to install electric vehicle (EV) chargers by mandating chargepoints in new covered car parks and consulting on removing planning permission currently needed for those without driveways to install discreet cross pavement charging gullies, as the government bolsters its drive to make it easier than ever to plug in wherever you live.

The reforms would give more people access to domestic electricity rates, enabling families to run their EVs for as little as 2p per mile – the equivalent of London to Birmingham for £2.50.

The government has confirmed it will consider cutting red tape for EV drivers without driveways to make it easier to install cross pavement charging solutions, speeding up applications and putting money back in drivers’ pockets by saving them up to £250 in application fees.

They will also work with Ofgem to ensure public costs are fair and strengthen protections against landowners overcharging tenants for home charging above the market rate.

On top of this, they and Ofgem will work to ensure operators offer high quality connections as well as smooth and rapid connections for public charging, to ensure the network is resilient and supports the ongoing rollout.

The government will shortly launch a consultation on the package, enabling industry to inform how the reforms can best be implemented.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander:

Wherever you park your car, we’re making it fairer, easier, and cheaper to make the switch to electric.

These reforms will improve infrastructure for the EVrevolution, increase chargepoints across the country and open up affordable home charging to thousands more households.

It’s good news for drivers and a big boost for the growing British EV industry – cutting costs and supporting jobs to deliver our Plan for Change.

The commitment builds on the launch of the £650 million Electric Car Grant (ECG) earlier this year, which is offering discounts of up to £3,750 off 39 car models. The grant has sparked increased demand in EVs and has helped more than 25,000 drivers to make the switch so far.

The move follows a £25 million scheme announced in July to support local authorities to provide discreet cross-pavement channel charging solutions for residents, so more people without a driveway can charge easily and cheaply at home. The government is also investing £381 million to roll out more than 100,000 local public chargers across England.

It is claimed that the UK is leading the EV transition after it ranked number 1 in Europe’s EV market in 2024 and sales are up nearly a third so far this year. The government is taking unprecedented action to support people with the move to electric, targeting historically higher upfront costs through the ECG and addressing charging anxiety – with 86,021 chargers available across the UK. This latest package will help give drivers the confidence to make the switch to electric and ensure the infrastructure is there to power their journeys when they do.

Trump responded angrily to China’s latest rules with a threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, but he has since dropped that demand as part of this agreement.

This week’s deal will delay the regulations that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies, but it doesn’t eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his tariffs.

These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems, electric vehicles and robots to consumer electronics including laptops and phones. China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

Temporary relief

Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the one-year delay in China’s new rare earth export controls that were announced earlier this month provides some short-term relief that will allow exports to return to a more normal level, but it doesn’t change the broader strategic picture, and it’s important for America and its allies to continue investing in the industry.

“This move appears more tactical than structural, a pause to stabilize trade relations with the U.S. rather than a policy reversal,” Mukherjee said. “This is a temporary window for the U.S. and allies to accelerate diversification before controls likely return.”

The White House has made it a priority to revive and expand the domestic critical minerals industry while also seeking supplies of these elements from allies. The Pentagon agreed to invest $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials and promised to ensure every magnet made at its massive new plant is bought and set a minimum price for its neodymium and praseodymium products for a decade.

The West is making progress

Ian Lange, who is an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines, said he thinks the U.S. and its allies can make significant progress in a year’s time to lessen China’s dominance of the rare earths market.

There are a number of promising efforts already underway. Noveon will continue to produce rare earth magnets at its plant in Texas, and MP Materials and USA Rare Earth are both scheduled to begin producing magnets at their plants over the next year. And starting next year MP also plans to begin processing the heavy rare earths China had restricted in the spring at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine in Mountain Pass, California.

And Lange said that other efforts to recycle rare earths and begin producing them as byproducts at existing steel and zirconium mines may also start to pay off. The United States’ recent agreement with Australia will also help provide additional materials to counter China.

China has shown little sign of being willing to allow rare earth exports to defense contractors, which is concerning given the national security implications. But military demand for rare earths is relatively small, so America might be able to supply its needs by prioritizing rare earths from other sources for use in fighter jets, guided missiles and nuclear submarines.

Investing in the industry is a priority

Industry executives have said this needs to be the “Manhattan Project moment” for rare earths if the United States is ever to break China’s grip over them.

“We’re moving into overtime with China and they currently have the ball on our 10-yard line. Our best defensive move is to tie together our global refining and supply partnerships with allies and swiftly invest in innovation in the United States,” said Wade Senti, president of the U.S. permanent magnet company AML.

Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn said the details of “how China implements this suspension will matter greatly, and with the deal limited to one year, it’s clear the U.S. must use this window to strengthen domestic capabilities and reduce long-term exposure to geopolitical risk.”

Lange said he is optimistic overall because the United States isn’t starting from zero, and if these efforts continue at their current pace, America should be much better off in a year even if some of the things the government is investing in will take several years to become a reality.

“Because in a year, we don’t really care what they do. We’ve got an independent supply chain. At least I don’t think we’re too far from that,” Lange said.

In September, Jetson debuted its Jetson Air heat pump, which it calls the industry’s first fully integrated smart home heat pump platform.
For me, it’s really about where I can make the biggest difference and right now, that’s in helping accelerate the adoption of electric heat pumps.
Heat pumps are moving along a similar path, reaching cost parity with furnaces and air conditioners while offering greater comfort, simplicity, and efficiency.
Heat pumps aren’t just cleaner; they offer better heating and cooling.","Our homes are a significant source of emissions due partly to fossil fuel-based furnaces. While heat pumps are a much cleaner alternative, their cost can be prohibitive. Stephen Lake’s Vancouver-based startup, Jetson Home, has managed to cut those costs roughly in half by eliminating unnecessary markups and simplifying the installation process. In September, Jetson debuted its Jetson Air heat pump, which it calls the industry’s first fully integrated smart home heat pump platform.

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

The biggest thing governments could do is stop spending billions on subsidies and incentives that prop up fossil fuels at a low cost, and instead start investing that money in clean energy initiatives, such as residential electric heating and cooling. Governments have the most powerful lever: economics. If the easiest and most affordable choice for a family or business is also the climate-smart one, people will naturally make that switch.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

For me, it’s really about where I can make the biggest difference and right now, that’s in helping accelerate the adoption of electric heat pumps. Heating and cooling are among the largest sources of residential emissions, and the majority of homes in North America still rely on gas furnaces. Cleaner alternatives often feel too complicated or too expensive, so my focus this year is on making that switch easier and more affordable for homeowners. Everything I can do personally pales in comparison to the potential impact this can have.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

Ultra-deep geothermal deserves additional attention. If technologies like Quaise Energy succeed, we could unlock zero-emissions baseload power almost anywhere on Earth, not just in the limited regions where conventional geothermal works today. It’s still early-stage, but the potential scale of impact is massive if the science and engineering can be solved.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

What gives me hope is that we’re reaching an inflection point where clean technologies aren’t just better for the planet, they’re better overall. Electric vehicles are already dominating sales in markets like China because they’re more efficient and cost-effective to run. Heat pumps are moving along a similar path, reaching cost parity with furnaces and air conditioners while offering greater comfort, simplicity, and efficiency. When a product wins on its own merits and not just because it’s the “right” thing to do, that’s when adoption takes off.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

Achieving net zero does not have to mean sacrifice or setback. We don’t need people to live with less; we need to replace outdated systems with ones that are smarter, cleaner, and better in every way. What’s great is that the solutions are already here. Electric vehicles aren’t just lower-emission; they’re better cars. Heat pumps aren’t just cleaner; they offer better heating and cooling. What we need now is bold policy that lines up incentives and helps these technologies scale faster. This is about building momentum with what already works, not waiting for a miracle.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Innovators-Stephen-Lake.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 17:18:38.934423

This consumer protection tool is important because new large customers can require a massive amount of electricity, sometimes equal to the size of a large city.
Regarding the rate impacts, the average Duke Energy Progress residential customer will see their bill go up $11.23 per month, a 7.8% increase.
Duke Energy Carolinas also has a pending rate increase for its customers before state regulators.","Columbia, S.C. – The Sierra Club, Duke Energy Progress, and other stakeholders reached a settlement agreement this week on the utility's proposed rate increase before state regulators. The Sierra Club only signed onto the large load settlement agreement with Duke related to new customers like data centers, and did not oppose other stakeholder settlements related to energy efficiency and revenue requirements.

The large load settlement the Sierra Club supports requires parties to file a joint petition with state utility regulators to open a generic docket to discuss the impacts of new large load customers, like power-hungry data centers. The docket will enable parties to file or present comments on strategies like large load tariffs that state regulators could adopt to protect families and businesses from the rate shock associated with building power plants and other infrastructure to serve new data center customers. When properly designed, large load tariffs can require new large customers to pay their fair share of new power plant costs through minimum bills and multiyear contracts to purchase power along with exit fees if they break that contract.

RMI provides design principles of large load tariffs. This consumer protection tool is important because new large customers can require a massive amount of electricity, sometimes equal to the size of a large city. It will ultimately be up to the South Carolina Public Service Commission to decide if it will require a large load tariff, and what the terms of that consumer protection rule will look like for customers.

Groups that signed the large load settlement include Duke Energy Progress, the Sierra Club, the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs, South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Upstate Forever, Vote Solar, and the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce.

Regarding the rate impacts, the average Duke Energy Progress residential customer will see their bill go up $11.23 per month, a 7.8% increase. The utility originally proposed a $21.66 per month increase. Duke also proposed an increase to the basic monthly service charge from $11.78 to $13.00, which was eliminated in a final settlement agreement, keeping the fixed monthly charge at $11.78.

Duke Energy Carolinas also has a pending rate increase for its customers before state regulators.

Statement from Paul Black, Sierra Club’s Senior Campaign Organizer in South Carolina:

“The undeniable truth around the country is that new power-hungry customers like data centers are increasing demand for electricity, and unless utility regulators enact consumer protections, average customers like families and small businesses will see our monthly bills go up even more to pay for new power plants. States like Kansas are protecting existing customers from rate shock due to data center demand for electricity, and we need South Carolina’s utility regulators to do the same.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-30 16:24:22.869946

With upcoming special elections and legislative leadership and committee seats that need filling, restructuring of the statehouse is inevitable. Of course, that may result in a domino effect at the local level as county leaders pursue state level positions.

Regardless of these political shifts, expanding renewable energy across Iowa must remain a steadfast priority. Long-term economic benefits of renewable energy projects propel our state forward and transcend party lines. As we enter the last quarter of the year, and look to the horizon of 2026, one thing is certain: Iowa needs to keep investing in homegrown clean energy.

Iowa needs more energy to curb rising costs as demand continues to surge. Amid the era of AI and reshoring manufacturing, we need affordable, reliable energy that can be added to the grid quickly to meet energy demands and ensure Iowa — and the nation — remains economically competitive. Renewable energy projects check these boxes while also providing a swell of tax revenue for communities and steady income for farmers.

The added funding supports K-12 schools, allows for repairs to local infrastructure, and bolsters public services.

It’s no secret that Iowa ranks first in the nation for the share of electricity produced by renewable energy, making our state a beacon for energy independence. Iowa has mastered making electricity a commodity that neighboring states can purchase: a massive win for Iowans as large energy users continue to pop up across the Midwest.

Iowans are proud to hold the title of innovators. We have been since the invention of sliced bread in Davenport, the computer in Ames, or the Pulver Rooter right here in Cherokee. It’s time we put our innovators to work and allow our workforce to grow with the investment in renewable and reliable energy. The clean power industry employs more than 14,500 workers right here in Iowa, with our workforce development programs and community colleges already training more Iowans for positions in wind and solar energy.

Many of the best eco-friendly NFT projects start with presales.
Standout Eco-Friendly NFT Projects in 2025 So which projects are actually doing what they say?
In the second quarter of 2025, eco-friendly NFTs on platforms like Tezos and Polygon saw their trading volume jump by 60%.
New platforms like Tezos, Polygon, and Solana are proving that digital innovation can actually be good for our planet.","Remember when NFTs took off a few years ago? Digital art, collectibles, and music were all being turned into unique tokens. The excitement was everywhere. But so were the concerns. As people started analyzing the data, they uncovered a startling fact. Creating just one NFT might use the same amount of energy that a home consumes in thirty days. The primary culprit was proof-of-work blockchain technology, like the early version of Ethereum. These systems required miners to solve difficult computational problems that guzzled electricity. Naturally, this raised serious concerns about the environmental footprint of NFTs.

But now it's 2025, and things have changed. NFTs are becoming more eco-friendly as artists, platforms, and investors are paying attention to being sustainable. We're seeing new NFT releases that offer creative work without the environmental concerns. This isn't just for show. It's a real change that's transforming how we view digital ownership.

The Shift to Greener Blockchains

The actual transformation occurred when technology reached a point where it could support this change. The Ethereum network transitioned to proof-of-stake operations during 2022, which resulted in a 99% reduction of its power consumption. The blockchain industry adopted two approaches after Ethereum made its switch. They either adopted sustainable design principles during development or followed Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake. The Tezos network operates with minimal energy consumption because it has always used this approach. The platform has gained popularity among artists who want to reduce their environmental footprint.

Platforms like fxhash and Objkt.com host generative art, experimental music, and interactive pieces, all with very little environmental cost. Polygon provides another good choice. It's fast, affordable, and environmentally conscious. It supports everything from gaming assets to brand partnerships without the heavy environmental burden. Solana, Flow, and Algorand complete the group, with each one focusing on efficiency and scalability. Major marketplaces like OpenSea have noticed this trend too. They've started special green collections to meet the growing demand from environmentally aware buyers.

Why Presales Matter in the Green NFT Space

If you're thinking about getting involved early, this is where things get exciting. Many of the best eco-friendly NFT projects start with presales. These are special periods where tokens, assets, or access are offered before they become available to everyone. These aren't just random releases. They're usually connected to sustainable crypto systems built on platforms like Polygon, Solana, or Cardano. Imagine projects that actually do something useful: tracking carbon credits, verifying renewable energy, or creating community-owned virtual land. These presales allow you to buy at lower prices, receive extra benefits, and truly support initiatives that care about our planet. This isn't just guessing about what might be valuable; it's supporting meaningful innovation that makes a difference.

Standout Eco-Friendly NFT Projects in 2025

So which projects are actually doing what they say? Here are a few that are making a real impact without hurting the environment:

fxhash (Tezos): This platform allows generative artists to upload code, and collectors can mint unique pieces. The energy consumption is minimal. A recent AI-themed release quickly sold out.

Lens Protocol Collectibles (Polygon): These social tokens help creators build communities in a sustainable way, with very low fees, are environmentally friendly, and get people involved.

The Sandbox LAND (Polygon): It offers virtual land in a growing metaverse. You own your property for good, and the energy impact is small.

Objkt.com Drops (Tezos): This marketplace on Tezos centers on art and teamwork. It's a space for mindful creators, featuring photography and 3D art.

The numbers tell a clear story. In the second quarter of 2025, eco-friendly NFTs on platforms like Tezos and Polygon saw their trading volume jump by 60%. This isn't just a random spike. It shows that collectors are actively selecting art that aligns with their personal values.

Investing with a Conscience

Thinking about green crypto? It pays to research before you invest. Just because something is green doesn't mean it's risk-free, but it's a solid foundation. Search for projects with transparent roadmaps, working development teams, and practical uses. Joining during presales can be smart, particularly for sustainable infrastructure ventures. You'll often find bonuses like carbon offset initiatives or renewable energy partnerships. Markets will fluctuate, but the long-term outlook is positive. With regulations tightening and demand for transparency growing, these projects have a strong chance of success.

Conclusion

NFTs are definitely here to stay, but they're changing in some really positive ways. Remember when people worried about how much energy they used? Well, that's changing fast. New platforms like Tezos, Polygon, and Solana are proving that digital innovation can actually be good for our planet.

Artists are building successful careers in this space. Collectors are getting excited about what's happening. And if you're thinking about getting involved early, especially through presales, you could be in a great position for what's coming next.

If you care about both creativity and our environment, now is the perfect time to pay attention. The future of NFTs isn't just exciting, but it's definitely sustainable.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/9e3b5223-d214-4a08-8303-d673c534dca2.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-10-30 16:00:29.183897

ANIKA JANE BEAMER: Dr. Lal, we’re sitting amidst a landscape that’s been pretty dramatically transformed by intensive food production.","DES MOINES, Iowa—The World Food Prize Foundation gathered hundreds of scientists, farmers and innovators in the agrifood industry last week to address a pressing question: How can we better feed the world’s hungry?

Rattan Lal, a former World Food Prize laureate and one of the world’s most renowned soil scientists, offered an unexpected answer: Do it with less.

Intensive food production systems have used too much land, too much water, too much fertilizer and too much soil carbon, he said. To reverse that trend, he added, the goals of agriculture must shift from maximizing yields to restoring damaged ecosystems and preserving nature.

Lal is a distinguished university professor of soil science at the Ohio State University, where he directs the eponymous Rattan Lal Center for Carbon Management and Sequestration in the College of Food, Agriculture, and Environmental Sciences. He’s spent about 20 years stationed in Africa and Australia and another 40 in Ohio researching “soil-centric” and regenerative approaches to farming.

In 2004, Lal authored the first scientific paper arguing that restoring organic matter to soil improves its ability to reabsorb excess carbon dioxide emissions, nearly a quarter of which come from global agriculture.

Lal advocates for regenerative agriculture, a set of practices including “no-till” farming, cover crops and complex crop rotations that aim to minimize the harmful environmental impacts of food production. His work in food security and climate change mitigation has earned him recognition including the 2019 Japan Prize, the 2020 World Food Prize, and the 2024 Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity.

Before a panel appearance at the World Food Prize’s Borlaug Dialogue last week, Inside Climate News spoke with Lal about agriculture’s profound footprint and what it would take to feed the world with less. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

ANIKA JANE BEAMER: Dr. Lal, we’re sitting amidst a landscape that’s been pretty dramatically transformed by intensive food production. How do you define “intensive” agriculture?

RATTAN LAL: Well, I grew up on a small farm, a few acres, in [Punjab/Haryana]. Each year, we grew four crops, at least three. Every acre of land there is irrigated, so you could grow two crops in the dry season and two crops in the wet season. So, if you want to talk about intensive, that is intensive. What’s different in this part of the world is the size of farms, especially in Iowa, Ohio and Indiana. Here, there is a large-scale, mechanical approach to farming. The average farm size in the Midwest is 200 acres. I know some farmers with as many [as] 4,000 acres. In other countries where I’ve worked [in South Asia and Africa], 12 acres is a big farm.

BEAMER: Is that footprint necessary?

LAL: Well, the central United States has some of the best soils of the world. It’s a very dark soil, with a high organic [matter] content. This region is very fertile and very flat. But, worldwide, we should be incentivizing farmers to take land out of use. I like to say, “Use the best and save the rest.” Globally, there is no reason to cut the Amazon forest. There is no reason to cut savanna and prairies. We have plenty of land.

BEAMER: What about meeting population growth? Is it possible to feed the world while also scaling back agriculture?

BEAMER: How do we incentivize that change?

LAL: It is my hope that, soon after 2050, governments will have a policy to pay farmers by returning land back to nature. Not by subsidies, but by paying farmers for ecosystem services. If you save water, if you conserve carbon, if you prevent biodiversity loss, the government should pay you, even if you get lower yield.

The payment would not be charity, it’s not a handout, it’s not a donation. It is a service the farmer provided. And the government takes responsibility. I recommend a payment of $50 per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent [sequestered].

BEAMER: I’d like to ask more about fertilizers, as over-fertilization is a huge issue for water quality here in Iowa.

“In the U.S., 60 percent of fertilizer is wasted. And by wasted, I mean leaked into the groundwater or volatilized into the atmosphere.”

LAL: It’s a terrible problem.

BEAMER: How can we reduce our reliance, or our perceived reliance, on fertilizers?

LAL: Well, the problem is that fertilizer use efficiency, especially nitrogen, is 40 percent for the United States. In other places, such as in China and India, it is 25 percent.

So, in the U.S., 60 percent of fertilizer is wasted. And by wasted, I mean leaked into the groundwater or volatilized into the atmosphere.

It’s the efficiency that’s the problem. I think fertilizers are needed, definitely needed. Aspirin is needed, you know? I take aspirin. But one aspirin cures your headache. One hundred aspirin … you know what that does? We should not use fertilizer as a poison. We should use fertilizer as a medicine. And the difference between the poison and medicine is the dose.

BEAMER: But if extra fertilizer means a slightly bigger yield, why wouldn’t a farmer use the larger dose?

LAL: This is where the payment for ecosystem services comes in, right? You tell farmers, “You will not use more [fertilizer] than this. If you get a yield loss, it’s our problem.”

Farmers should be paid for producing with less and better quality. More protein content, more micronutrients, iron, zinc, molybdenum, iron. And that higher quality stems from healthier soil.

BEAMER: Are there other links between soil health and environmental health that you think are due for further examination?

LAL: Well, 600 gigatons of carbon equivalent have come from land since the beginning of agriculture, since we started cutting the forest and since we started draining the wetlands. From 1750 to today, the total emissions from fossil fuels is still only about 500 gigatons.

But what we have taken from land, you can put back. We can sequester more carbon with better agricultural practices, with regenerative agriculture. That means producing an acceptable yield while restoring the environment, not further damaging the environment.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2139548705-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 19:59:53.512413

The base metals sector, particularly those metals vital for green technology, stands at an inflection point.","As the global economy rapidly pivots towards a sustainable future, green technology and electrification are emerging as unprecedented demand drivers for base metals, fundamentally reshaping financial markets. As of October 30, 2025, the accelerating transition to electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy infrastructure, and modernized power grids has ignited a robust surge in demand for critical commodities such as copper, aluminum, and silver. This paradigm shift is not merely a fleeting trend but a structural transformation, positioning base metals at the heart of the decarbonization agenda and creating a long-term bullish outlook for these essential industrial materials.

The immediate implications of this green surge are already reverberating across global markets, manifesting in heightened price volatility, escalating supply chain pressures, and a renewed focus on resource security. With projections indicating sustained demand growth and potential supply deficits extending well into the next decade, investors and industries alike are grappling with the profound impact of this transition. The race to secure these vital raw materials is intensifying, underscoring their pivotal role in building the infrastructure of a cleaner, electrified world.

The Green Catalyst: A Deep Dive into Base Metal Demand

The global push for decarbonization and electrification is creating an unprecedented surge in demand for base metals, fundamentally reshaping commodity markets. This surge is most acutely felt in the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) sector, the expansive growth of renewable energy infrastructure, and critical grid modernization initiatives. As of October 30, 2025, the market is witnessing a dramatic re-evaluation of these industrial commodities.

Electric vehicles stand at the forefront of this demand revolution. Each EV requires significantly more base metals than its internal combustion engine counterpart, with an average electric car consuming up to four times more copper—approximately 53.2 kg. A fully electric bus, for instance, demands a staggering 369 kg of copper. Beyond copper, EV batteries are driving exponential demand for lithium, projected to quadruple from 2023 to 2030, and nickel, expected to more than triple in the same period, reaching 1.4 million metric tons by 2030. Cobalt demand for EV batteries has soared, accounting for 60% of total cobalt battery demand in 2024, a monumental leap from just 2% in 2015. The global fleet of passenger EVs is forecast to expand from 44 million in 2023 to an astounding 359 million by 2030, fueling a fivefold increase in annual battery demand to over 4,300 GWh.

Renewable energy projects are equally metal-intensive. A single wind turbine requires around 5.5 tons of copper, while offshore wind installations are even more demanding at 15 tons per megawatt. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems consume 5-10 kg of copper per installed kilowatt. Aluminum, the second most consumed metal in renewables, finds extensive use in wind turbine blades and solar panel framing, with its demand projected to grow 5% annually for the next decade. Silver, often considered a precious metal, has transformed into a critical industrial commodity, with the solar industry alone accounting for 91% of its supply growth between 2020 and 2023. Concurrently, massive investments in grid modernization are underway globally, with China earmarking an additional $80-100 billion for 2025 alone, requiring vast quantities of copper for cables, transformers, and wiring. The global energy transition, including grid upgrades and the burgeoning AI data center sector, is expected to account for 61% of global copper demand by 2040.

The market's initial reaction has been a pronounced bullish trend. Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) have surged past $10,000, nearing record highs, with analysts at UBS projecting $11,000 per metric ton by September 2026. Aluminum has reached three-year highs, while zinc prices have soared past 12-month highs amidst critically low LME inventory levels, representing less than 24 hours of global industrial consumption. Lithium carbonate saw an 84.9% increase in price in January 2025. This robust demand, coupled with persistent supply constraints from production disruptions in key mining regions like Chile, Peru, and Indonesia, has driven significant investment and consolidation. Notably, the approved merger between Anglo American PLC (LSE: AAL) and Teck Resources Limited (TSX: TECK.A) is poised to create one of the top five global copper producers, signaling a strategic recalibration among major mining players. Geopolitical tensions and resource nationalism are also intensifying, as evidenced by the US imposing a 50% tariff on certain imported copper products in July 2025, highlighting concerns over supply chain security.

Navigating the Green Tide: Winners and Losers in the Base Metal Boom

The escalating demand for base metals driven by green technology and electrification is creating a clear delineation between potential winners and those facing significant headwinds in the financial markets. Companies with substantial reserves and efficient production of critical minerals are poised for robust growth, while others grapple with supply chain vulnerabilities and escalating costs.

At the forefront of the beneficiaries are major mining companies with significant exposure to copper, nickel, lithium, and cobalt. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX), a global copper giant, stands to gain immensely from the surge in demand for electrical wiring in EVs, charging infrastructure, and renewable energy systems. Similarly, Glencore PLC (LSE: GLEN), a diversified commodities powerhouse and a leading producer of copper, cobalt, and nickel, is strategically positioned to capitalize on the battery metals boom. BHP Group (NYSE: BHP; ASX: BHP) is actively diversifying into nickel, particularly battery-grade nickel from its Nickel West operation, aligning itself with the EV battery supply chain. Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO; ASX: RIO), while known for iron ore, is expanding its copper footprint and exploring lithium ventures, securing its place in the green transition. Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE), a global leader in nickel production, is investing in sustainable mining and battery-grade nickel sulfate, essential for EV batteries.

The lithium sector sees clear winners in Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), one of the world's largest lithium producers, benefiting directly from skyrocketing demand for lithium-ion batteries. Lithium Americas Corporation (NYSE: LAC; TSX: LAC) is another significant player, with its Thacker Pass project poised to supply North America's critical minerals supply chain, backed by a substantial loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. In the rare earth elements space, MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP) owns North America's only integrated rare earth mining and processing site, Mountain Pass, making it crucial for the domestic supply of permanent magnets in EVs and wind turbines.

Beyond raw material suppliers, certain green technology manufacturers are also strategically positioned. BYD Company Limited (SZSE: 002594; HKEX: 1211), a vertically integrated Chinese multinational, benefits from its in-house battery production (FinDreams), offering a degree of insulation from external metal price volatility. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), while a massive consumer of these metals, actively pursues direct supply agreements and invests in battery technology research to optimize material usage, positioning it for continued growth despite potential cost pressures. In renewable energy, Siemens Energy AG (XTRA: ENER), through its acquisition of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, is a major producer of wind turbines, which are highly copper and rare earth-intensive, thus benefiting from the global build-out of wind energy infrastructure.

Conversely, companies that have not secured long-term supply agreements for critical battery metals and rely heavily on volatile spot markets, particularly within the EV manufacturing sector, face significant challenges. Unpredictable production costs can squeeze profitability and hinder stable vehicle pricing. Similarly, mining companies with high-cost operations or limited diversification might struggle to compete, especially if a single commodity faces temporary oversupply, as seen with lithium in early 2025 before its recent rally. Renewable energy component producers without robust supply chain management could also see eroding profit margins if they cannot secure stable and cost-effective supplies of copper and aluminum, impacting their ability to deliver competitively priced products in a rapidly expanding market.

A New Geopolitical Chessboard: The Wider Significance of the Base Metal Boom

The escalating demand for base metals, fueled by the green technology revolution and global electrification, transcends mere economic shifts; it represents a profound geopolitical and industrial transformation. As of October 30, 2025, this ""Metals Boom"" is not merely another commodity supercycle but a structural change with far-reaching implications, uniquely influenced by decarbonization efforts and the burgeoning demands of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

This phenomenon fits squarely into the broader trend of a global energy transition, necessitating vast quantities of ""green metals"" for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and grid upgrades. Demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements, and copper is experiencing unprecedented growth, with lithium consumption projected to increase approximately 40-fold between 2020 and 2040, and copper demand rising by 40% by 2030, further augmented by AI data centers. China's forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-2030), unveiled this month, underscores this pivot, signaling a decisive shift from construction-driven growth to one powered by green technology and innovation, intensifying demand for ""green metals"" while tempering traditional materials.

The ripple effects are evident across industries. The concentration of mineral production and refining in specific countries, particularly China, creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. China's dominance in processing many critical minerals, including rare earth elements, and its control over lithium chemical processing and battery cell production, has already demonstrated its leverage, as seen in a temporary export squeeze in spring 2025 that impacted non-Chinese automakers. This has spurred intensified competition and strategic partnerships, with nations like the United States actively pursuing alliances with resource-rich countries to counterbalance China's influence. Mining companies strategically aligned with these efforts, particularly in Australia and Canada, are attracting substantial investment, while the industry as a whole grapples with the long lead times for new mines, declining ore grades, and rising capital costs.

Regulatory and policy implications are equally profound. Governments worldwide are increasingly viewing critical minerals as matters of national security and economic resilience. This has led to a surge in resource nationalism, with over 72 nations adopting protectionist policies, including export controls and nationalization of mining operations. Brazil is safeguarding its strategic minerals, and Indonesia has restricted exports to promote domestic value-added processing. Legislative efforts like the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), enacted in 2024, aim to secure supply chains by setting targets for domestic extraction, processing, and recycling, and capping dependence on single third countries. China's 15th Five-Year Plan prioritizes domestic mineral exploration and recycling, while the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers tax credits for clean energy, further shaping mineral demand. Environmental regulations and the push for ""green mining"" technologies are also influencing development, alongside trade policies such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and new US tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

Historically, this ""Metals Boom"" draws parallels to past commodity supercycles, often triggered by supply-demand imbalances and global economic restructuring. The early 2000s boom, driven by China's industrialization, saw similar gains in base metals. Technology-driven commodity booms, like the 1910 ""Rubber boom"" fueled by the automobile, offer a precedent for how new technologies can dramatically shift demand. The current scramble for critical minerals, where control over these materials determines future global power, echoes past contests for vital resources like oil, particularly during the Cold War. The inherent inelasticity of supply, due to long mine development times and dependence on byproduct mining, further exacerbates price volatility and contributes to persistent deficits, a recurring theme in commodity history.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the Future of Base Metals

The trajectory for base metals, propelled by the relentless march of green technology and electrification, promises a future defined by unprecedented demand, strategic industry pivots, and both significant opportunities and challenges. From late 2025 onwards, the market is poised for a dynamic period of transformation.

In the short term (2025-2026), the market will likely experience continued volatility, albeit with strong underlying structural support for ""green metals."" While factors such as China's economic slowdown or a resurgent US dollar could introduce corrections, the foundational demand from electrification initiatives and geopolitical tensions will sustain a bullish outlook. Copper, having surpassed $10,000 on the LME, and aluminum, reaching three-year highs, are indicative of this trend. However, supply disruptions, including accidents at major mines in Chile and Peru, along with geopolitical events, will continue to add pressure and logistical complexities. A bifurcated market is emerging, where ""green metals"" see robust demand, while traditional metals tied to sectors like China's property market may face weaker prospects.

Looking further ahead to the long term (2027 onwards), the energy transition will dominate, leading to projected structural deficits across key base metals. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warns that copper supply could fall 30% short of demand by 2035, even with aggressive investment. Similar deficits are anticipated for nickel and lithium. Meeting this colossal demand will require an estimated US$4.7 trillion in investment by 2035, with the copper industry alone needing $2.1 trillion over the next 25 years. Recycling is emerging as a vital strategy to bridge these gaps, with significant investments in circular economy infrastructure crucial to making recycling a genuine alternative to new mining by 2040. However, declining ore grades and slower new discoveries will exacerbate supply challenges, increasing production costs.

Industries across the value chain must adapt swiftly. Mining companies will need to significantly increase investment in new exploration and projects, particularly in resource-rich regions like Africa and Latin America, while adopting advanced automation and sustainable practices to counter declining ore grades and address environmental concerns. A looming talent shortage, with 350,000 new professionals needed globally by 2035, also demands urgent attention. Manufacturing sectors, including EV and renewable energy producers, must prioritize supply chain resilience through diversified sourcing, material substitution research (e.g., using aluminum to substitute copper), and vertical integration or strategic partnerships with mining companies. Increasing the use of recycled content will also be paramount. Governments, in turn, must implement supportive policies, foster international cooperation, invest in domestic processing and recycling infrastructure, and skillfully navigate the rising tide of resource nationalism.

Emerging market opportunities are significant, with India and Southeast Asia poised to become major engines of demand and supply growth. India, for instance, is projected to surpass the US as the world's third-largest copper consumer by 2050. Africa and Latin America, rich in copper and other critical minerals, could become key players with targeted investment. However, challenges persist, including China's continued dominance and its strategic pivot, which, while supporting green metals, could impact overall demand due to slowdowns in traditional sectors. Geopolitical risks, resource nationalism (as seen in Indonesia, Zambia, and Gabon), and environmental and social concerns associated with new mining projects will continue to shape the landscape. Potential scenarios range from a ""Green Supercycle"" with elevated prices and persistent deficits, to a ""Protracted China Slowdown"" tempering overall demand, or ""Accelerated Innovation & Recycling"" mitigating supply crunch risks. The crucial outcome will be whether the costs of critical minerals rise so significantly as to potentially delay the global green transition itself.

The Metal Age of Decarbonization: A Market Minute Wrap-Up

As of October 30, 2025, the base metals market stands at a pivotal juncture, fundamentally reshaped by the accelerating global shift towards green technology and electrification. The key takeaway is the structural transformation of demand drivers, with copper, aluminum, nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements now indispensable to the decarbonization agenda. This has created a bifurcated market, where ""future-facing"" metals enjoy robust demand and higher prices, while traditional commodities face headwinds. Persistent supply-side constraints, stemming from underinvestment, declining ore grades, and geopolitical disruptions, further tighten the market, leading to projected deficits for critical metals like copper in the coming years. China's evolving role, particularly its 15th Five-Year Plan, underscores a strategic pivot towards green technology and self-reliance, guaranteeing sustained demand for these vital materials.

Moving forward into 2026, the market will likely see continued strength for ""green"" commodities, with copper remaining the bellwether of the energy transition. Aluminum's strong performance will persist, driven by lightweighting in transportation and renewable energy. Lithium prices are anticipated to recover, propelled by robust EV sales and energy storage solutions. Geopolitical tensions and the push for supply chain diversification will intensify, as nations seek to reduce reliance on concentrated production centers. This signifies a fundamental and enduring shift in the global economy, marking a permanent transition to a material-intensive energy system that will ensure sustained, long-term demand for critical minerals for decades to come. This era also exposes deep-seated vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly for critical and rare earth minerals where production and processing are highly concentrated. Securing these resources is now a matter of national economic resilience and strategic importance, as shortages can impede climate targets, digital development, and even defense technologies.

For investors, the coming months demand a keen focus on several key areas.

Monitor China's 15th Five-Year Plan Implementation: While the broad outlines are known, the specific details and stimulus measures expected in early 2026 will provide critical signals for demand trends, particularly for copper, aluminum, and nickel.

Focus on ""Future-Facing"" Metals: Maintain exposure to companies heavily invested in copper, lithium, and nickel. These metals are central to the electrification and renewable energy narratives. Companies with robust exploration pipelines and diversified, high-quality assets in these segments are well-positioned.

Assess Supply Chain Resilience: Prioritize companies actively working to secure and diversify their supply chains, invest in domestic production, or develop advanced recycling capabilities. Geopolitical risks associated with concentrated supply will continue to influence market dynamics.

Watch for Technological Advancements: Keep an eye on innovations in mining (e.g., direct lithium extraction, in-situ copper leaching), refining, and recycling processes, as these can alter supply dynamics and cost structures. Developments in alternative materials (e.g., sodium-ion batteries) could also impact specific metal demands long-term.

Factor in Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Headwinds: While green demand is strong, broader economic slowdowns, interest rate movements (e.g., potential Fed rate cuts in 2025-2026), and ongoing geopolitical tensions will continue to introduce volatility. Hedging strategies and diversified portfolios remain crucial.

ESG Performance: Companies demonstrating strong environmental and social governance, including responsible sourcing and lower carbon footprint production, may gain a competitive edge and attract increasing investor capital.

The base metals sector, particularly those metals vital for green technology, stands at an inflection point. The convergence of insatiable demand from the energy transition and persistent supply challenges promises a period of sustained significance and potential for investors who are attuned to these structural shifts and emerging risks.

Additionally, the batteries in electric buses can be used to store energy and help stabilize the grid by using bidirectional chargers.
Electric buses are much more expensive up front, with costs in the $300,000 to $400,000 range.
The switch to electric buses isn’t likely to reverse that, but it does remove one source of pollution from the equation.
Some committee members questioned the validity of claims that school bus riding was impactful to children’s health.","(The Center Square) – Since 2022, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has administered the Clean School Bus Program, an initiative that provides schools rebates and grants toward replacing diesel engine buses with electric ones.

With uncertainty about the future of that program under the current administration, some Pennsylvania lawmakers would like to see the state take up the mantle of providing funding for the change.

Despite enthusiastic endorsements from schools that have added electric buses to their fleets, it is not a plan that has garnered widespread support in the House. Legislators are divided between those prepared to pursue every possible measure to address the dual climate and energy crises and those who see green spending projects as government handouts for an unproven industry.

“I am always interested in creative solutions to energy problems, and electric school buses can solve a lot at once, helping schools cut costs and making our air cleaner at the same time,” said state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia, majority chairwoman of the House Energy committee. ""This grant program could be transformative for schools.”

The benefits of electric buses? The cleaner, quieter rides are better for children’s health. They do not produce environmentally damaging carbon emissions. They have fewer moving parts requiring less maintenance. Running electric vehicles is much cheaper than spending on fuel. Additionally, the batteries in electric buses can be used to store energy and help stabilize the grid by using bidirectional chargers.

The downsides? Electric buses are much more expensive up front, with costs in the $300,000 to $400,000 range. In addition to the cost of the bus, infrastructure updates must be made to provide charging stations. Critics also worry that charging the buses will create additional strain on the state’s energy grid, which is poised to take on massive new burdens with the build-up of new data centers.

The bill would set up a fund within the state to provide school districts with grants for taking on these expenses. The bill aims to prioritize low-income districts which may not otherwise afford to make the switch and areas where environmental quality already takes a toll on student health. Advocates say there are particular benefits to rural communities.

Rep. Dave Madsen, D-Steelton, has seen the impact of electric buses first hand. He represents Steelton-Highspire School District, which has adopted the buses for most day-to-day transportation.

""Investing in electric school buses is an investment in our students’ health,” said Madsen. “The grant program proposed in HB1539 helps districts replace aging fleets and lowers long-term operating costs. It also supports job growth by expanding charging infrastructure and strengthens transportation equity across Pennsylvania.""

Steelton is an urban district just south of Harrisburg with a long history of manufacturing. The district’s superintendent, Willie Slade, noted that its home to a higher than average rate of asthma among students. The switch to electric buses isn’t likely to reverse that, but it does remove one source of pollution from the equation.

Some committee members questioned the validity of claims that school bus riding was impactful to children’s health.

“If children on the bus are being affected by diesel fumes, then I think we need to check the bus and make sure that its exhaust system is properly installed,” said Rep. Martin Causer, R-Bradford.

A 2002 report from the National Institute of Health demonstrated the intensity of diesel exhaust exposure on a school bus, particularly for children riding near the back and with windows closed. It found that, in addition to one to two hours of bus riding per day over 10 years increased the likelihood of children developing lung cancer in adulthood.

Another point of contention was the buses’ vehicle to grid capabilities, which allow the vehicles to provide power back into the grid in the event of a blackout or power shortage. Rep. Mandy Steele, D-Cheswick, described her own electric vehicle’s capacity to power her home for a few days in the event of one of the Pittsburgh area’s frequent weather-related blackouts.

“I have nothing against electric, but I know when the power goes out in my home, Rep. Steele, my natural gas whole home generator goes on, and I've got power that I can watch TV,” said Rep. Mike Arminini, R-Dubois. “Life does not change for me when there's a blackout.”

Electric supporters were quick to point out that battery storage was not a total solution to the energy crisis but a potential source of revenue for vehicles putting electricity back into the grid.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/ef/6ef75174-ab37-4ea5-8800-523ce923bacb/68d5a32c681d2.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-10-30 17:19:03.709893

Drivers

Government Subsidies and Tax Incentives Accelerating EV Adoption

Government support through subsidies, tax breaks, and purchase incentives is playing a major role in driving the zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) market. These policies make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers and encourage automakers to increase production. Many countries are also setting deadlines to phase out internal combustion engines, further boosting demand for ZEVs.

Another key factor is the rapid expansion of charging infrastructure in urban areas. Cities worldwide are investing in fast-charging networks to reduce range anxiety and make EV ownership more convenient. This development is attracting both private buyers and fleet operators.

Corporate fleet electrification is also gaining momentum, as businesses aim to reduce carbon emissions and meet sustainability goals. Logistics, ride-hailing, and delivery companies are replacing fuel-based fleets with electric ones to cut operational costs and improve their green image.

Furthermore, advancements in battery technology—particularly improvements in energy density and efficiency—are extending vehicle range and reducing charging time. These innovations are making EVs more practical and appealing to a wider audience, driving strong market growth globally.

Restraints

High Initial Purchase Cost Compared to Conventional Vehicles

One of the main restraints for the zero-emission vehicles market is the high upfront cost compared to traditional vehicles. Despite long-term savings on fuel and maintenance, the initial price remains a major concern for consumers, especially in developing countries. Battery packs are the most expensive component, and their cost directly impacts the affordability of electric cars.

While governments offer incentives, these are often limited or temporary, making it difficult for the market to maintain growth without continued support. This cost barrier is slowing down mass adoption among middle-income buyers who prioritize budget-friendly options.

Another key challenge is the issue of battery disposal and recycling. As EV adoption grows, the number of used or degraded batteries is also increasing. Managing this waste responsibly is crucial to achieving sustainability targets.

Recycling technologies for lithium-ion batteries are still evolving, and improper disposal can harm the environment. The lack of standardized recycling infrastructure and high processing costs make this a pressing issue for the industry.

Growth Factors

Expansion of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Segment for Long-Range Transport

The zero-emission vehicles market presents several promising growth opportunities, particularly in hydrogen fuel cell technology. Hydrogen-powered vehicles offer long driving ranges and fast refueling, making them ideal for heavy-duty and long-distance transportation. Governments and energy companies are investing in hydrogen infrastructure to support this expansion.

Integration of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology is another major opportunity. This system allows EVs to send stored energy back to the grid during peak demand, creating a two-way energy flow. It enhances grid stability and offers consumers financial benefits, transforming EVs into mobile energy assets.

The development of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber and aluminum is also driving innovation. Lighter vehicles require less energy, improving battery performance and range efficiency. This trend is pushing manufacturers to explore advanced materials for future vehicle designs.

Strategic collaborations between automakers and battery producers are further enhancing research and development. These partnerships aim to lower production costs, improve battery life, and speed up technological advancements in the ZEV market.

Wabash Valley Resources, LLC, plans to use the funds to repurpose a coal gasification plant that has been idle since 2016. Coal from a nearby mine and petcoke, a byproduct of oil refining, will be used as feedstocks to produce 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia per year, the department of energy said in a news release.

“For too long, America has been dependent on foreign sources of fertilizer,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are changing that by putting America first, relying on American coal, American workers, and American innovation to power our farms and feed our families,” Wright said.

The loan delivers on the Trump administration’s promise to responsibly steward taxpayer dollars and unleash American energy dominance, the department said. In recent years, farmers in Indiana and other parts of the Corn Belt have imported anhydrous ammonia from Canada, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Russia.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has blamed renewable energy for increasing electricity costs because it can’t run at all hours and requires fossil fuel backup.
Rooftop solar policies accounted for roughly one-quarter of the increase in retail electricity prices in Maine and California since 2019, the Lawrence Berkeley study concluded.
That left the Northeast vulnerable when gas prices skyrocketed in 2022, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
While it will take time for the full impact of those restrictions to be felt, experts say, they are expected to put upward pressure on electricity prices later this decade.","Millions of Americans have watched with dismay as their electricity bills have spiraled upward over the past few years. The rising price of power is squeezing households and businesses, and voter fury over higher costs is jolting elections in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia.

President Donald Trump, who as a candidate promised to cut electric bills in half within 18 months, has blamed wind and solar power for soaring costs. Democrats say the problem is Trump’s throttling of renewable energy, while others point to the rapid spread of energy-hungry data centers.

But the factors driving electricity rates are often more complicated and depend on where you live, according to a comprehensive new study by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Not all states are suffering equally. Over the past six years, the average retail price of electricity has risen faster than inflation in 26 states. But rates have stayed flat or even declined in the rest of the country in real terms (that is, they’ve grown more slowly than overall inflation).

Many states that have seen a major expansion of wind and solar power, like Nevada or North Dakota, have seen prices stay flat or decline, although there are some important exceptions to this rule. California is a leader in renewable energy but has seen some of the largest electricity rate increases in the country, in part because devastating wildfires have imposed steep costs on utilities, which often get passed onto households. In the Northeast, states have struggled with high natural gas prices.

“There are so many different factors that can drive up electricity prices, depending on where you live,” said Ryan Hledik, a principal at the Brattle Group, a research firm based in Boston that contributed to the study. “It’s a more nuanced story than what you often see in the headlines.”

Inflation Is Part of the Story

The simplest factor behind surging power prices is inflation. Since 2021, as a result of post-pandemic disruptions, virtually everything has gotten significantly more expensive: food, cars, lumber, equipment, labor. For the most part, the increase in electricity rates nationwide has been in line with overall inflation, although there has been a noticeable acceleration this year.

National averages can obscure a lot, though, and many states have seen electricity rates rise even faster than inflation, suggesting that there is more to the story.

In California, average retail prices have risen by a staggering 34% since 2019 — even after adjusting for inflation. In New Jersey, prices jumped 11% in the past year. In states like Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, prices are rising significantly faster than inflation.

‘It’s Really Poles and Wires’

The two biggest factors that influence power prices are the cost of generating electricity at a power plant and then delivering those electrons to homes and business through large regional power lines (known as transmission) and the smaller wires snaking through cities (known as distribution).

“When you look at what’s driving electricity bills, it’s really poles and wires,” said Charles Hua, the founder of PowerLines, a nonprofit organization focused on modernizing utility regulations to cut power bills.

Since 2005, the cost of generating power has declined significantly, partly because the fracking boom has made it much cheaper to extract and burn natural gas, the nation’s largest source of electricity.

But over that same period, utilities have nearly tripled the amount they spend annually on the network of poles, wires, substations and transformers that deliver power to customers. Large portions of the electric grid are nearing the end of their 50-year life spans and need replacing. Utilities are also hardening lines and equipment to deal with storms, fires and heat waves, particularly as climate change fuels bigger weather disasters.

Various types of grid equipment — such as transformers — have been in short supply globally and have gotten more expensive. Some critics have accused utilities of overspending on power lines, since they can recoup the costs from customers and earn a guaranteed return, although this can be difficult to quantify.

Renewables Aren’t a Big Factor (Mostly)

In recent years, the United States has seen swift growth in wind and solar power, which together produce 17% of the nation’s electricity. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has blamed renewable energy for increasing electricity costs because it can’t run at all hours and requires fossil fuel backup.

Yet the Lawrence Berkeley study found a more nuanced story. In regions that have great wind and solar resources — such as the gusty Great Plains or sunny Southwest — renewable energy has boomed, and retail electricity prices have either flattened or fallen, after adjusting for inflation. Many of these states, like Iowa or South Dakota, don’t require anyone to use more renewable power; companies build it because it is often the cheapest option to put additional electrons onto the grid.

But there are exceptions: Several states that aren’t especially windy and sunny have required utilities to buy more electricity from large-scale wind or solar farms, such as Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. These requirements, which are often adopted to lower greenhouse gas emissions, can add a noticeable surcharge to bills.

Many states — including California, Maine and Massachusetts — have also offered incentives for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels. These policies can raise prices for other customers, because solar households pay less to the utility but still rely on it for backup power. That shifts the cost of maintaining the grid to other households, utilities say. (Solar proponents disagree, saying that this argument ignores many benefits of rooftop panels, such as avoided transmission costs.)

Rooftop solar policies accounted for roughly one-quarter of the increase in retail electricity prices in Maine and California since 2019, the Lawrence Berkeley study concluded. More recently, California and some other states have begun paring back their home solar incentives.

Gas Spikes and Data Centers Also Matter

Other states have their own stories.

Electricity is expensive in the Northeast because those states rely heavily on imported natural gas and there are a limited number of pipelines into the region, making the fuel costly. (In recent years, New York has blocked new pipelines and closed a nuclear power plant, which deepened the state’s reliance on gas.)

That left the Northeast vulnerable when gas prices skyrocketed in 2022, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In Maine and Massachusetts, retail prices shot up by more than one-third as a result of these spikes, which have only lately subsided.

In recent months, many communities have become alarmed by the expansion of massive data centers for artificial intelligence, with some critics warning that these power-hungry facilities will increase electricity costs.

And yet in Virginia, home to one of the world’s largest concentrations of data centers, electricity prices have mostly stayed flat over the past six years, adjusting for inflation. If anything, those data centers may have helped suppress prices by allowing utilities to spread the fixed costs of maintaining the grid among a larger set of customers, the Lawrence Berkeley study found.

But the effects of a rapid data center expansion won’t always be benign, experts cautioned. A lot depends on whether power companies can keep up with the enormous energy needs of new data centers, and whether tech companies or households bear the cost of any needed grid upgrades.

More ominously, wholesale electric capacity prices have been skyrocketing this year in PJM Interconnection, the large regional grid that supplies Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Virginia. Some analyses have blamed those spikes on new data center demand, which are coming as older coal and nuclear plants are retiring and the grid operator has been slow to connect new renewable and gas plants to replace them.

“Part of the problem is that you can often build new data centers faster than you can build new power plants to supply them,” said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit group that conducts research for the nation’s electric utilities. “And that bottleneck can really drive up costs in the short term.”

Will Prices Keep Rising?

The average price of electricity has been rising faster than inflation this year, and government forecasters expect that will continue next year, especially since natural gas prices are starting to climb upward. Politicians are often struggling for answers.

Trump administration officials say the solution is to drill more natural gas and build more pipelines to get that gas where it’s needed.

Yet the administration is also trying to make it more difficult and expensive to build new wind and solar projects, while canceling federal grants for grid upgrades aimed at lowering costs. While it will take time for the full impact of those restrictions to be felt, experts say, they are expected to put upward pressure on electricity prices later this decade.

Some states are exploring ways to blunt price shocks by requiring tech companies to absorb more of the cost of adding new data centers or encouraging those data centers to operate more flexibly so that they limit the strain on the grid. Others are considering technological options that could cut costs, such as deploying more batteries.

The problem is pressing. More than 24% of households were unable to pay their energy bills in full in 2024, according to Census Bureau data, up from 20% in 2021.

“It’s a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

The new development will help Aberdeen South Harbour become a leading hub in delivery of offshore renewable projects, as well as encouraging inward investment and growing the renewables supply chain.

This investment is part of the UK Government’s drive to clean energy, which will create skilled jobs and bring down energy bills. The announcement comes after the money was committed by the previous administration but, like many unfunded announcements, not delivered.

Douglas Alexander said:

The UK Government’s £17.3 million investment in Aberdeen’s Energy Transition Zone will create jobs and bring down bills. This investment will accelerate a renewables hub which will help to deliver a thriving renewables sector in and around Aberdeen.

Maggie McGinlay, Chief Executive of ETZ Ltd, said:

To ensure North East Scotland remains a thriving hub of energy excellence, we must have government and industry working in partnership to support our world-class supply chain who will lead the delivery of the vast pipeline of energy transition projects, particularly offshore wind, on our doorstep.

The visit of the Secretary of State to Aberdeen, and the hugely welcome confirmation of funding, exemplifies that collaborative approach and will be instrumental in our ability to take forward an accelerated programme of activity that means the Energy Transition Zone, and region more broadly, positions itself as the most attractive location in Europe for investment in low carbon technologies.

ETZ Ltd is a not-for-profit, private sector-led company spearheading North East Scotland’s energy transition. Its aim is for the region to remain a global leader in energy excellence, with a world-class supply chain, pioneering low carbon projects and a thriving economy.

The UK Government has already invested £9.7 million in the ETZ. That includes £5 million for the Innovation Campus (a facility for developing new green energy technologies and scaling up their manufacture and a new Energy Transition Skills Hub (boasting a state-of-the-art welding academy, advanced manufacturing zone and future technology digital training).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Denver, CO – OCT 30, 2025 – Attorney General and candidate for Colorado governor Phil Weiser today laid out his vision for building a stronger, more inclusive economy rooted in real opportunity for all Coloradans.

His six-part Opportunity agenda focuses on workforce development, rural investment, youth mental health, education, and the creation of a new ColoradoCorps service program to help young people build careers while serving their communities.

“Opportunity should never depend on your zip code, your income, or who you know,” said Weiser. “From our farms and small towns to our classrooms and city centers, we need bold action to ensure every Coloradan can build a good life. That’s what this agenda is about—good paying jobs, strong schools, healthier communities, and a future our kids can believe in.”

REINVIGORATING COLORADO’S ECONOMY Weiser will work to spark innovation, grow clean energy jobs, and boost small business growth in every corner of the state. He’s committed to making Colorado the best place to start and grow a business—with affordable housing, strong infrastructure, and a workforce ready to meet the challenges of the future.

GOOD JOBS FOR ALL COLORADANS To close the skills gap and open doors to high-quality employment, Weiser will invest in community colleges, apprenticeships, and career training programs that meet local needs. His plan includes streamlining job training across agencies and expanding access to career pathways for veterans, young adults, and rural workers.

SUPPORTING OUR AGRICULTURAL, FARMING, AND RANCHING COMMUNITIES Weiser’s rural development strategy will support family farmers and ranchers, improve rural infrastructure, and strengthen local economies. He’ll champion broadband expansion, water security, and farm-to-market programs that help agricultural communities thrive in a changing economy.

BUILDING THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR KIDS’ FUTURE Weiser believes a world-class public education system is the foundation of opportunity. He’ll fight for better teacher pay, safer schools, and expanded access to early childhood education—especially in underserved communities.

SUPPORTING OUR YOUTH AND TACKLING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS As youth mental health reaches crisis levels, Weiser will lead a statewide response focused on developing early intervention, building a robust mentoring program, providing school-based support systems, and expanding access to care. He’ll invest in growing Colorado’s behavioral health workforce and ensuring young people can get help immediately.

BUILDING COLORADO’S NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS Weiser’s proposal for ColoradoCorps—a statewide service and career-building program—will give young people the chance to earn a paycheck, gain experience, and give back to their communities in sectors like education, conservation, and public health.

“Colorado’s future depends on bold leadership that connects innovation with inclusion,” said Zaneta Kelsey, co-founder & CEO of Access Mode, which is a nonprofit entrepreneurial support organization that hosts a flagship accelerator program that supports tech‑enabled startups founded by overlooked and underserved entrepreneurs. “Phil Weiser’s candidacy does exactly that — empowering entrepreneurs and the organizations that support them, expanding opportunities, and making sure every Coloradan can take part in the state’s growth.”

“Long before he ran for office, Phil was already doing the work to strengthen Colorado’s economy by investing in entrepreneurs and small businesses,” said Greg Greenwood, former head of Blackstone Entrepreneurs Network, which was founded with the help of AG Weiser to support entrepreneurship and economic development in targeted regions by connecting high-growth entrepreneurs with experienced mentors, advisors, and resources. “Phil’s opportunity platform reflects that same deep belief: that innovation, inclusion, and long-term growth go hand in hand.”

“We are working to build a future in Colorado where everyone gets a shot—not just to survive, but to thrive,” Weiser said. “We’re going to grow the middle class, support our kids, and invest in every community, from Sterling to Alamosa to Aurora. That’s the future I’m fighting for and have long championed, including by co-chairing Governor Ritter’s Innovation Council and co-founding Startup Colorado.”

Earlier this month, Weiser released a summary of his comprehensive vision for Colorado’s future in The Colorado Blueprint, available at the campaign’s website at philforcolorado.com/the-colorado-blueprint. These chapters are among several the campaign is releasing over the coming weeks to provide a detailed vision for Colorado’s future, providing an opportunity for feedback and engagement as we work to build a better future.

Weiser launched his campaign in January 2025. Since then, he has earned endorsements from over 160 Colorado current and former elected officials, including Colorado trailblazers former Denver Mayor Federico Peña and former Governor Roy Romer, and from national elected leaders like Governor Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Governor Maura Healey (D-MA), Governor Josh Stein (D-NC), and Governor Bob Ferguson (D-WA).

Bottle and can deposit redemption rates fell to just 70.4% in 2024, down 18.3% since 2019.
Hit-or-miss nature on what cans, bottles are redeemable a frustration Michigan's 10-cent deposit on bottles and cans applies only to carbonated beverages, fizzy and bubbly drinks.
""That’s a growing pool of households with the option of recycling deposit beverage containers from home,"" he said.
""And the dime deposit in 1976, when Michigan adopted the Bottle Bill, would be equivalent to only two cents today.""","Once boasting redemption rates above 95%, Michigan's redemption rate on its 10-cent deposit on some beverage bottles and cans has dropped significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic.

A new University of Michigan report suggests stakeholders would like to see more unclaimed bottle and can deposit money get reinvested in modernizing the container recycling.

In Shea Carney's house, those beverage bottles and cans eligible for a 10-cent deposit return have become more of a nuisance than a useful income boost.

""I used to take them in myself but now I commonly do delivery instead of in-store shopping because of the time efficiency,"" the Milford Township resident said.

Carney has put the containers in her curbside recycling in the past, and now donates them to people or fund-raising organizations who can use the cash.

""I usually let a few bags accumulate, and my husband stores them in an extra trash can − but at some point says, 'These need to go,'"" she said with a laugh. ""Especially glass bottles are more cumbersome because of their fragility.

""I think most people these days have easy access to recycling and with in-store shopping find it an extra chore to haul all those bottles and cans in.""

The numbers bear out Carney's observation. Michigan's so-called ""Bottle Bill,"" enacted by voter referendum in November 1976, once boasted redemption rates above 95%, its 10 cents per-can or bottle return the best in the country. But a dime doesn't go as far as it did in the 1970s and '80s. Redemption returns began to lag, then plummeted beginning in 2020 when Michigan became the only U.S. state to completely shut down bottle and can deposit returns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The numbers haven't bounced back post-pandemic. Bottle and can deposit redemption rates fell to just 70.4% in 2024, down 18.3% since 2019.

Researchers with the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability, in a report released Thursday, Oct. 30, asked stakeholders all around the beverage container recycling process why they think the program is lagging and what should be done about it. While the answers varied, virtually all agree the 50-year-old, relatively unchanged program needs some modernization and improvement.

""Before the pandemic we did see bottle returns eroding a bit, so there's certainly some assumptions that the dime just isn't worth what a dime was in the '70s,"" said Shelie Miller, professor of sustainable systems at U-M and a co-author of the report.

""So as more people have access to curbside recycling programs, and it became less valuable to people to get their dime back, there was an erosion in some of these returns.""

The COVID-19 pandemic and the state's shutdown on bottle and can redemptions broke people out of their previously ingrained habits of returning to the store with bottles and cans that had the deposit on them, Miller said. ""Once the facilities reopened, we just didn't see the rebound that we would have expected it to be. And so return rates have remained consistently lower.""

Fewer redemptions means more bottle and can cash accumulating

By state law, those 10-cent bottle and can deposits that aren't redeemed, money known as escheat, is sent to the state Department of Treasury, with 25% of the money returned to retailers collecting the containers and 75% given to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy's Cleanup and Redevelopment Fund for environmental remediation and pollution prevention. Some $1 million is also earmarked for a Bottle Bill Enforcement Fund to enforce against scams such as bringing in bottles and cans in bulk from other states and redeeming them for Michigan's dime − a gambit made famous in an episode of the sitcom ""Seinfeld.""

""It's only in the last three years that about 3% of those escheats have been going to recycling initiatives. But before that, none of it was really earmarked for recycling specifically, and none of it to-date has been earmarked for the bottle deposit program specifically,"" said Tamanna Sengupta, a graduate student in the U-M School for Environment and Sustainability and a co-author of the report.

And with fewer deposit-payers getting their dimes back, the unclaimed redemption money is spiking. The amount of escheat was as low as $33.8 million as recently as 2017. It was $116.4 million last year.

Miller noted there is a ""perverse incentive"" on supermarkets and party stores taking back bottles and cans. Since their funding return from the state is based upon uncollected redemptions, if improvements cause 100% returns, the system provides them with no subsidies for their efforts.

""One of the biggest findings we found was a frustration about the lack of investment in recycling in a directed way,"" Miller said. ""One of the things that I think is universally agreed on is that some of this money that is from unclaimed deposits should go back to recycling efforts in some way.""

Hit-or-miss nature on what cans, bottles are redeemable a frustration

Michigan's 10-cent deposit on bottles and cans applies only to carbonated beverages, fizzy and bubbly drinks. But the number of beverages available to consumers has skyrocketed since the Bottle Bill was enacted in 1976. It was the following year, 1977, when Perrier launched a successful U.S. advertising campaign and spurred a widespread popularity for bottled water. Today bottled water is the second-most popular commercial beverage in the U.S., trailing only soda pops. But bottled water, flavored water and other similar drinks do not qualify for the 10-cent deposits under the law.

It can cause confusion for consumers, Miller said, especially when a company has both carbonated and non-carbonated versions of very similar beverages.

""So you can see someone trying to put these in a reverse vending machine, and the can looks essentially identical, and they can get deposits back from one but not another from the same company − because non-carbonated ones don't have the deposit on them in the first place,"" she said.

It can lead consumers to just give up entirely and put their bottles and cans in curbside recycling. But Miller noted curbside recyclers, while facing increased work with additional items, currently can't access any of that redemption money.

EGLE spokesman Jeff Johnston noted curbside recycling continues to expand in Michigan communities, with more than 333,000 new curbside recycling carts rolled out in 34 communities statewide since 2019, serving more than 1.2 million Michigan residents. More than 60% of Michigan households now have access to curbside recycling.

""That’s a growing pool of households with the option of recycling deposit beverage containers from home,"" he said. ""And the dime deposit in 1976, when Michigan adopted the Bottle Bill, would be equivalent to only two cents today.""

Michigan’s overall recycling rate is up, from 14.25% before 2019 to more than 25% now, Johnston said, with deposit containers almost certainly making up a portion of that increase. EGLE surveys suggest that materials recovery facilities − recycling centers − process an estimated 280 million deposit containers a year.

""From EGLE’s perspective, the most important outcome is that these containers enter the recycling stream instead of ending up in landfills,"" Johnston said. ""Unclaimed deposits are split between a state fund that cleans up environmental contamination (75%), and retailers (25%), so unclaimed deposits still benefit the environment.""

Universal store-brand redemptions - and what to do about bottled water

A lack of universal redemption is another consumer impediment. If a shopper buys a store-brand pop from Kroger, Meijer or Walmart, those bottles or cans can only be redeemed at those respective stores − even though in many instances, the same company is picking up the bottles and cans from all three stores and taking them to the same recycling centers.

Miller noted that universal redemptions would be allowable under Michigan's existing law; it would just require the stores to agree to it.

""Could there be voluntary agreements for (consumers) being able to take back any bottle or can regardless of retailer, regardless of store brand?"" she said. ""There is a lot of nuance there as far as what that can and should look like, but ultimately that was seen as something that would certainly be preferable to customers.""

Several U.S. states have in recent years updated their bottle and can redemption policies, including California, Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, and Vermont. The updates primarily involve adding new types of beverage containers, increasing the deposit amount, and refining the collection systems

Expanding into the popular bottled water market for the deposit program may seem like a natural for Michigan, but there are reservations.

""There is a major sensitivity in the state as far as disproportionately affecting lower-income residents, particularly in places like Flint, where many folks are still purchasing bottled water,"" Miller said. ""That higher upfront cost could be seen as a barrier to some folks.""

Retailers already feel the impositions of bottle and can returns, requiring space for the returned containers and staff to move them and keep areas clean.

""I can say my members, mostly on-premises such as bars and restaurants, cannot have an expansion of items,"" said Scott Ellis, executive director of the Michigan Licensed Beverage Association.

""We barely have enough room now to store these things ... So any expansion to what is already a very archaic, cumbersome system will be very hard on small business owners in Michigan.""

Smith and Sengupta said that is a common refrain among retailers and will require ""really thinking through how to actually help people in the system deal with those changes"" such as increased beverages with deposits, Smith said.

One idea floated was to create independent redemption centers outside of the store setting where bottles and cans could be returned. Other ideas include machines that can redeem bottles and cans in bulk by the bag, rather than the tedious process of feeding them into a machine one at a time.

But should Michigan look at increasing the amount of deposits above a dime? Oregon increased its bottle and can deposit from 5 cents to 10 cents in 2017 and returns soared. The state overtook Michigan and reached 87% bottle and can deposit redemptions in 2023, making it the highest in the nation.

""It doesn't seem like 10 cents is that bad of an incentive,"" Sengupta said. ""Worldwide there is general agreement that 10 cents is the best benchmark, the best amount to start with. So maybe Michigan should be looking at other opportunities we have to modernize the Bottle Bill before we start looking at the dime.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/presto/2020/06/15/PDTF/500116d5-d2f5-4df7-8945-21edbb5dc28f-Halls_bottle_can_return.jpg?crop=3823,2151,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-30 15:06:54.764020

According to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the city ""reduced fossil fuel usage by 67% over the past 13 years, accounting for a reduction of nearly 20 million gallons of fossil fuel per year.""

A large portion of the reduction came from the city's efforts to streamline and upgrade its sanitation, public transportation, and park vehicles. The significant progress is crucial in demonstrating that reaching sustainable energy thresholds is not only plausible but possible.

Key examples that led to such a positive outcome include city fleet vehicles going fully electric and the Staten Island Ferry entirely transitioning to renewable diesel.

""We have built New York State's largest electric vehicle, biofuel, telematics, and electric charging programs,"" DCAS Deputy Commissioner Keith Kerman said. ""Our next goal is 80% [greenhouse gas emissions] reduction by 2035 which will be led through further electrification and efficiency.""

Those living in New York are sure to continue to see upgrades and improvements around the city that keep their air cleaner, better their transport, and make their environment safer. Public health inevitably improves with lessened pollution.

As the fossil fuel industry remains one of the biggest contributors to the warming and destruction of the planet, such strides show other cities and states that it is worth making changes to the energy sources they use.

While the process of extracting and producing fossil fuel is costly, both monetarily and environmentally, cleaner alternatives to petroleum diesel, including renewable diesel, biofuel, and electric batteries, noticeably decrease the strain.

It is crucial to continue to push for more cities to take the initiative, and New York is a prime example of why. There is evidence in its achievements, and replicating the commitment to clean energy in other areas will make even more productive waves for citizens.

NYC Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez said it best: ""When we all work together to green our transportation system, we can achieve our climate goals faster, showing the rest of the country how it can and should be done.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wy9Uhaamy3hH0.Do3cr9IA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/3173e14e65878d32648871645c94b0e0,N,,2025-10-30 19:00:44.792592

In 2024, the state's 10 operating biodiesel plants produced an estimated 350 million gallons, making Iowa the top biodiesel-producing state in the nation.

""U.S. biomass-based diesel adds value to every acre of soybeans grown, accounting for roughly ten percent of each bushel's worth — a contribution that is especially vital this year as America's soybean farmers face record yields amid unpredictable global markets,"" said Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board.

The IBB's comments emphasize the critical situation facing Iowa's independent biodiesel producers in particular, who lack the financial reserves of larger competitors to weather extended periods of regulatory uncertainty.

""The loss of Iowa's independent biodiesel producers would represent a significant setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating production capacity that took years to develop and depriving Iowa farmers of vital local markets for their crops at a time when they can least afford it,"" Kimberley stated in the comments.

The organization is calling on EPA to:

Reallocate 100% of small refinery exemptions for 2023, 2024, and projected 2025, 2026, and 2027

Finalize Renewable Volume Obligations before the new compliance year begins

Maintain strong volume targets to ensure market certainty for farmers and producers

IBB thanked EPA for recognizing the expanded capacity and feedstock investments fueling the growth of U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, while stressing the urgency of timely rulemaking to enable planned investments.

""Until that happens, the biomass-based diesel industry is left uncertain and unable to fully plan or adapt to the proposed rule changes,"" Kimberley noted, adding that Iowa farmers are already making planting decisions for the next growing season.

Another 850 workers at the Ultium Cells plant in Ohio will be temporarily laid off, as will 700 more at a second Ultium Cells factory in Tennessee.
“During the temporary pause, Ultium Cells plans to make upgrades to both facilities to provide greater flexibility,” GM said in a statement to the Detroit News.
And the automaker has also laid off IT workers in Georgia and staff from its Warren Technical Center in Michigan.","Just a few weeks ago, automakers were celebrating a healthy third quarter for electric vehicle sales. General Motors was looking particularly flush, with EV sales up 104 percent for the year to date compared to the first nine months of 2024. But the strong EV sales in Q3 were seemingly due to the imminent end of the federal tax credit that expired at the end of September, with many consumers buying a car sooner than planned to take advantage of the $7,500 incentive.

The Trump administration has been altering the regulatory environment in other ways to discourage clean technologies, canceling infrastructure initiatives and turning a blind eye to pollution. On top of that, the impact of the president’s chaotic trade war has driven up prices and is cooling demand. Two weeks ago, GM told investors that things are looking so bad that it will take a $1.6 billion hit to its bank accounts as it realigns manufacturing capacity going forward.

Now we can see some of the impact of that realignment. According to The Detroit News, 1,200 workers are being laid off at GM’s EV-building Hamtramck Assembly Center near Detroit, which will move from two shifts a day to just one in early January.

Another 550 workers are being laid off at the Ultium Cells battery plant in Ohio; this is a joint venture with LG Chem and the plant will also stop production on January 5 until at least May.

The new project, Beaver Lake Watershed Flood Assessment, Smart Growth Implementation and Technical Assistance for Source Water Protection, will build on recommendations from the Beaver Lake watershed protection strategy to reduce nonpoint source sediment and nutrient pollution, according to a news release.
According to the alliance, Beaver Lake provides drinking water to more than 600,000 residents in Northwest Arkansas, but population growth and rapid development are “placing increasing pressure on the watershed.
“Flooding is becoming more frequent, and we need better tools to understand where and why it’s happening,” said Becky Roark, executive director of the Beaver Watershed Alliance.
The Beaver Lake watershed, which largely comprises forest and agricultural land, “is at a critical juncture as development accelerates,” according to the alliance.","The Beaver Watershed Alliance announced Thursday (Oct. 30) that it has been awarded a $618,235 grant to continue its work to protect the water and to implement smart growth strategies in the Beaver Lake watershed.

The three-year grant includes $349,529 in federal money from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Division and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The alliance also received $268,706 in matching support from community partners.

The new project, Beaver Lake Watershed Flood Assessment, Smart Growth Implementation and Technical Assistance for Source Water Protection, will build on recommendations from the Beaver Lake watershed protection strategy to reduce nonpoint source sediment and nutrient pollution, according to a news release. The initiative will develop a watershed-scale model to identify flooding and stormwater “hot spots,” implement three nature-based smart growth projects, and provide technical assistance to area communities for riparian and streamside restoration.

According to the alliance, Beaver Lake provides drinking water to more than 600,000 residents in Northwest Arkansas, but population growth and rapid development are “placing increasing pressure on the watershed. As impervious surfaces — such as roads, rooftops and parking lots — expand, stormwater runoff increases, carrying sediment and pollutants into streams and rivers. This runoff contributes to erosion, flooding and declining water quality.”

According to the Arkansas Economic Development Institute, the population of Northwest Arkansas is expected to nearly double by 2045.

“Flooding is becoming more frequent, and we need better tools to understand where and why it’s happening,” said Becky Roark, executive director of the Beaver Watershed Alliance. “Watershed systems — like riparian areas, floodplains and wetlands — are critical infrastructure. This grant allows us to invest in data, restoration and planning that protect our drinking water and natural resources.”

When impervious cover exceeds 10% in a watershed, water quality degradation becomes measurable, research shows. The Beaver Lake watershed, which largely comprises forest and agricultural land, “is at a critical juncture as development accelerates,” according to the alliance. “The new flood and stormwater model will fill critical data gaps and guide local governments, developers and landowners in making informed decisions that balance growth with watershed protection.”

Healthy riparian zones, comprising vegetated areas along streams and rivers, help to filter pollution, slow runoff, prevent erosion and support aquatic life. Through this project, the alliance is expected to help communities restore and enhance these areas to protect stream health and strengthen flood resilience.

“We’re grateful to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Division and the U.S. EPA for their continued investment in our region,” Roark said. “Together with local partners, we’re building the tools and partnerships needed to ensure Beaver Lake remains a clean, reliable water source for generations to come.”

The alliance is a nonprofit that works to maintain high-quality drinking water in Beaver Lake and improve the water quality throughout its watershed. It brings together agricultural, conservation, recreation, business and community stakeholders to promote ways to improve the watershed’s health.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beaverwatershed.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 17:05:38.261213

This project marks SAMSUNG E&A’s first major U.S. contract since its initial market entry in 2011, symbolizing a renewed phase of growth and innovation for the company.","SAMSUNG E&A, a leading global total solutions provider in the energy sector, has announced that its U.S. subsidiary, SAMSUNG E&A America, has secured an Engineering, Procurement, and Fabrication (EPF) contract for the “USA Wabash Low-Carbon Ammonia Project” from Wabash Valley Resources. Valued at approximately USD 475 million, this milestone contract signifies SAMSUNG E&A’s official and full-scale re-entry into the U.S. energy market. The project, which will span 30 months, represents the company’s first low-carbon ammonia plant contract in the country.

The plant will be constructed in West Terre Haute, Indiana, marking a major step toward advancing clean energy production in the U.S. It will produce around 500,000 tonnes of eco-friendly ammonia annually while capturing up to 1.67 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. The produced ammonia will serve as a sustainable fertilizer for agricultural use across the Midwest, supporting both environmental and food security goals. Notably, this facility is among the few in the U.S. granted federal authorization for permanent carbon dioxide storage, underlining its strategic importance for decarbonization efforts.

To deliver the project successfully, SAMSUNG E&A will integrate its long-standing expertise in ammonia production with cutting-edge digital and automation technologies. The company plans to apply advanced systems such as Digital Twin, AI, and Digital Transformation tools to enhance project efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability.

A key partner in this project is Honeywell, whose renowned carbon capture solutions will be deployed at the Wabash Valley Resources facility. This collaboration aims to optimize production while significantly minimizing emissions, demonstrating SAMSUNG E&A’s commitment to advancing decarbonization technologies. The two companies have previously worked together on several carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives worldwide, focusing on challenging industrial sectors with hard-to-abate emissions.

This project marks SAMSUNG E&A’s first major U.S. contract since its initial market entry in 2011, symbolizing a renewed phase of growth and innovation for the company.

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

What made you decide to call on Congress on Monday to immediately end the government shutdown?

Well, it actually started [last] Thursday, when I woke up, turned on my television, and the first thing I see is federal employees standing in food lines. You know, it just has been long enough. This issue should be resolved.

Yeah, here in Washington, D.C., we are seeing reports that federal workers are lining up at food banks. What are you hearing from your members about how they are struggling and what they are doing to get by?

Well, several things are happening. First of all, they are very distressed. They are very upset. They are angry. Many of them are taking on additional jobs to try to make ends meet. Some are borrowing money from family, friends, lending institutions, you name it. They’re doing whatever it takes to survive. And in the world that we live in, nobody should have to work two jobs or three jobs in order to survive.

Prior to this announcement, did you talk to any Democratic lawmakers to let them know about your plans or to feel them out?

I spoke to, probably, I’m not going to say all of them, but I spoke to plenty of Democratic lawmakers about my position.

Did you talk to them to let them know that you were about to make this statement?

I did.

And what was their response?

Well, of course, they didn’t agree. But, you know, I’m here to represent federal employees, and they understood that.

Your statement didn’t appear to have an immediate impact on the debate, though it’s possible things may be shifting. Were you disappointed by the reaction to your statement in the short term?

Well, I certainly hope that it’s a long-term fix. I do think that there is some movement, because prior to me making a statement, nobody was even talking to each other, but I do think that there is some discussion going on right now.

You’re talking about bipartisan talks?

Yes.

And you think that your statement has helped facilitate that?

Absolutely.

In a post on X following the AFGE’s announcement, Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) wrote, “Even a union that backed Kamala Harris admits it: Democrats caused this shutdown. Pass the clean CR. Reopen the government!” I’m interested in your response to this statement, because in one sense, this is a misrepresentation of your statement—

Absolutely. I’m not here trying to point fingers at any party. Because I represent Democrats, and I represent Republicans. I represent independents. I’m here trying to make sure that federal employees are not used as political parties.

It is a misrepresentation of your statement, but it is also putting pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, which is your goal. So I wanted to get your reaction to Banks’ statement.

Well, certainly, I want the government reopened. I’ve made that point clear from the very beginning. When they were talking about shutting it down, I told everyone that I could talk to that I disagree. And I don’t care who’s in control of the presidency, of the House, of the Senate. I’ve always opposed a government shutdown. I will always oppose a government shutdown because federal employees should never be used as pawns in this political game.

Your statement in favor of the clean CR to reopen the government was widely interpreted as a break with Democrats. Was that your intent?

No, no, no, no. My intent was simply to raise awareness to the fact that federal employees are suffering, and you all do whatever is necessary to get the government opened.

Were you conscious when you were preparing your statement that it could be interpreted as a break with Democrats?

To be honest, I didn’t even think about that. I was just trying to get the point made that it’s time to end the shutdown. Too many federal employees are suffering as a result of it.

The AFGE is a longtime ally of the Democratic Party, and Democrats have been far more supportive of union priorities than Republicans in recent years. Do you feel you owe anything to the Democratic Party during a difficult political battle like this? Do you owe them your support?

I don’t feel like I owe anybody. You know, I think that whoever’s standing for federal employees and their rights; that’s who I support. And in this instance, federal employees are suffering. I’m not trying to support any entity over the other. I’m simply trying to represent the federal employee.

Do you feel like Democrats in Congress have been responsive to the needs of your members during the shutdown?

I think that in some cases, yeah.

In what case, for example?

Well, I think that many Democrats have shown interest in what’s happening with federal employees. Some have even gone overboard to say, “You know what, we’re going to make sure that there are resources for them to tap into, if they need loans, if they need various things.” So I think so.

Do you think the Democratic strategy with regard to the shutdown has been effective?

I certainly think that the point has been made, as I said before.

Do you think it was worth it for congressional Democrats to fight for ACA subsidies?

Listen, I am not trying to say that ACA is not important. I think it’s vitally important, okay? I just don’t think that it should be done holding federal employees hostage. And I do need to back up and say that I brought, I’ve had some Democratic representatives, senators, congressmen visit the airports to carry food to the employees and show that appreciation.

During the shutdown?

Yeah, during the shutdown. When you asked the question earlier, it just didn’t cross my mind. But when I think about it, I’ve had that, and I appreciate that. You know, they showed their appreciation, and I want to show mine. But at the same time, I want to make sure that these employees — some of them are single mothers that have children to feed — I want to make sure that they can feed those children without any additional stress. It’s stressful enough what they have gone through over these last few months.

You’ve been battling the administration’s efforts to mass-fire federal employees and dismantle federal agencies. In terms of your calculus in making this statement, was there any hope that by pushing for an end to the shutdown now, you might be able to reduce the animosity with the Trump administration and potentially make federal workers less of a target for layoffs by the Trump administration?

Well, that wasn’t in my calculation. But I’m always eager to try to make life better for federal employees. And if there are entities out there that don’t understand why federal employees exist, what it is that you do every day, then I’m open to having conversations so that I can try to get them to that point.

Are you concerned that by pushing Democrats to end the shutdown without obtaining the concessions that they’re seeking, you may be emboldening the Trump administration that’s already been so extraordinarily hostile to your members?

Well, I certainly hope that that’s not the case. Like I said before, I’ve already seen some movement as far as the two sides talking to each other. Prior to me issuing that statement, that was no conversation between the two sides, but now I understand that they are talking.

Based on prior shutdowns, how quickly does back pay arrive once things return to normal?

Well, that varies. I don’t know the exact answer to that. But just think about it, 35 days, and if it was another week that was 42 days. And the employees that I represent are just like the rest of America. You know, 65 percent of them live from paycheck to paycheck, so they were already hurting 15 days into this process.

Trump signed an executive order in March aimed at stripping most federal workers of their rights to collectively bargain. Going forward, what recourse do you have?

That’s one thing we will always do. We will continue to fight any administration when they are attacking federal employees or they are violating their rights. Just yesterday, we won another preliminary injunction against this administration for illegally trying to fire employees while they are being furloughed. And we will continue to do that, because it doesn’t matter whose administration, who’s in charge, if you are violating the rights of federal employees, we’re going to stand up for federal employees.

In the case that you are referring to, a federal judge on Tuesday effectively put a stop to any shutdown-related RIFs. If the government reopens, how concerned are you that layoffs will proceed as they were prior to the shutdown without this judicial shield?

Well, if they are violating federal employees’ rights, we’re going to be standing and we’re going to be ready to file lawsuits or whatever we need to do to protect their rights. I think that the government, if they follow rules and regulations, there are certain things they can do. We’re not saying anything about that. It’s when they are doing things that are illegal.

How did the Trump administration’s hostility to unions factor into your decision to call on Congress to end the shutdown?

Again, my main concern was the employees that I represent. I didn’t give thought to the hostility, because it’s not about that with me. This is not about partisan politics. That’s the thing I’m trying to escape from.

Last question. What would you say to people who don’t think federal employees should be able to join a union in the first place?",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F85%2F16%2Fcea8a7694a979dc27fc7dd5aa8bf%2F20230215-afge-2-francis-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:08:45.618432

Roger Marshall: China's Investment in U.S. Sorghum Could Pressure Mexico to Buy More,"Marion Kirkpatrick, RFD-TV News Staff, www.rfdtv.com, marion-kirkpatrick, rfd-tv-news-staff",,,,,https://www.rfdtv.com/sen-roger-marshall-chinas-investment-in-u-s-sorghum-could-pressure-mexico-to-buy-more,"Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) joined us on Thursday’s Market Day Report to share his perspective on the development and its potential impact on American producers.
In his interview with RFD-TV News, Sen. Marshall emphasized the significance of President Trump’s leadership in reaching this latest understanding.
Noting that China’s purchase may also pressure Mexico to buy more sorghum as prices rise.
One last point: I think now that China is starting to buy, especially the sorghum, you’re going to see Mexico move as well.
That’s going to impact 42 million Americans—blue states and red states as well.” Sen. Marshall said.","WASHINGTON, D.C. (RFD-TV) — The agriculture sector is reacting with cautious optimism following renewed trade talks between the United States and China. While the newly announced one-year agreement has sparked hope for stronger exports and eased barriers, many in the industry are waiting on full details before celebrating.

U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) joined us on Thursday’s Market Day Report to share his perspective on the development and its potential impact on American producers. In his interview with RFD-TV News, Sen. Marshall emphasized the significance of President Trump’s leadership in reaching this latest understanding.

“I think this is one of the most successful trips a United States president has ever made from an economic standpoint — this could mean about $15 billion a year in sales to American soybean farmers, probably $2 billion of sales in the sorghum industry as well,” Sen. Marshall said. “He’s got sharp people around him. [Trade] Ambassador Greer is just an ultra-sharp guy, and Scott Bessent is one of the sharpest people I’ve ever met as well. So, I think that we’ve got our thumb on them right now, and it’s just so, so important who’s in the White House to enforce these trade agreements.”

He said this is good news for soybean farmers, but also a huge sigh of relief for the sorghum sector. Noting that China’s purchase may also pressure Mexico to buy more sorghum as prices rise.

“Your listeners, I’m sure they understand this, is that China buys about 40-50% of our soybeans, annually on a typical year, and then, along with sorghum, they’re probably buying 80-90% of it, so this is huge news. And we’ll rely on President Trump to enforce this trade agreement. That’s what’s so important. For the last four years, we didn’t have anyone in the White House enforcing the trade agreements. One last point: I think now that China is starting to buy, especially the sorghum, you’re going to see Mexico move as well. You’re going to see the prices start to come up, and that’s going to force Mexico to buy some more sorghum.”

Sen. Marshall noted that caution remains warranted given China’s record of failing to follow through on trade commitments.

“They typically never have, right? They typically never have unless Donald Trump is the President,” Marshall said. “I think that he is the main card here, that he has shown exactly what he’s willing to do. That he went in there and bargained from a position of strength. Y’all remember the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)? The whole idea is that we would pick up all the pieces around China, all their other trade partners. Well, basically, Trump did it. He’s going to stop their trans-shipment to send t-shirts to Vietnam, and then Vietnam sells them here to get a lower tariff – so Trump gets this.”

Marshall discussed China’s pledge to purchase more U.S. soybeans and highlighted other key aspects of the deal important to U.S. agriculture, including restored commodity flows and commitments related to rare-earth minerals vital to the nation’s energy, technology, and defense sectors. Marshall hopes increases in domestic production will lead to lower input costs for farmers and ranchers.

“I do hope input costs come down. That’s probably the big one I’m thinking there. Soybean prices are what, over $10 a bushel? That used to be a pretty good price, but with input costs today, it’s not. I’m hoping as these tariffs stabilize, the input costs for my farmers will come down. And interest rates — remember interest rates, that’s so important — average farmer in Kansas, a million-dollar operation loan, so we’re seeing interest rates were cut again yesterday. So that’ll have a big impact on our input costs. You’ve got to look at all this — you can’t look at anything in silos.”

He also addressed China’s new tariff reductions on fentanyl-related exports — down from 20 percent to 10 percent — and what that could signal for broader tariff relief across industries.

“Of course, it’s somewhat complicated,” he said. “These tariffs have led to more American manufacturing. That we’re going to start making our own aluminum, our own steel. We’re going to be making more of our pharmaceutical ingredients. We’re trying to move—we are moving more rare-earth minerals here as well. I think that is what the tariffs have done — is given, most importantly, a chance for American industry to start up once again and not let China come in and undercut us.”

Additionally, he commented on potential benefits for U.S. oil and gas producers, citing his recent X post about China’s plans to begin purchasing American energy.

“So many of my farmers are in the oil energy field as well, right? So the cost of a barrel of oil, even though it may not be good at the gas station, is good for a lot of my farmers and ranchers as well,” Marshall explained. “So, look, China has to purchase natural gas from somebody — that’s really what we’re talking about — and oil. So rather than Russia, hopefully they’ll be buying it from Alaska. That trip from Alaska to China is not nearly as far as it is from a Kansas oil well. And overall, that will bring the price of oil up a little bit and stabilize it. The good news, again -- a promise made, a promise kept – the price of gasoline back home, $2.50 a gallon, diesel coming down as well for my farmers and ranchers.”

Beyond trade, Marshall weighed in on the ongoing government shutdown and its ripple effects across agriculture and Americans as a whole.

“I think this is a big inflection point this weekend as we see the SNAP program end. That’s going to impact 42 million Americans—blue states and red states as well.” Sen. Marshall said. “I think that TSA and Air Traffic Controllers [are] missing their second paycheck; Head Start [is] shutting down; WIC [is] running out of money— I think this is coming to a head. Hopefully, my friends across the aisle will open government again. They’ve had 13 chances so far to vote to do that — and then I’m very happy to address any issues they want to address. So, maybe an inflection point this weekend.”",https://rfdtv.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/57c8099/2147483647/strip/true/crop/720x404+0+1/resize/730x410!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jwplayer.com%2Fv2%2Fmedia%2FM7JY52tP%2Fthumbnails%2FGsB8ZdJ0.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:09:43.091101

First, we must reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and focus on the full, timely implementation of the Paris Agreement.
Deepening this pact is critical to advancing global climate action and ensuring that no one is left behind.","What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

One important action governments need to take in the next year is to press on with efforts to address climate change, both on the mitigation and adaptation fronts.

Achieving global climate goals requires governments to not only make commitments, but also to deliver on them through concrete action. Singapore was one of 13 countries to have submitted our 2035 climate pledge by the February 2025 deadline. We encourage all parties of the Paris Agreement to implement their commitments and submit their 2035 climate pledges by COP30.

Climate mitigation and adaptation go hand in hand. To prepare for the effects of climate change, Singapore is currently developing our inaugural National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which is a long-term strategy that outlines actions that we will take with Singaporeans to strengthen our climate resilience. To collectively advance our shared climate goals, I strongly urge more countries to accelerate the development of their NAPs if they have not already done so.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Tackling climate change has become more challenging amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts, economic headwinds and pushbacks against climate action.

Despite these setbacks, new developments and breakthroughs continue to emerge, giving us hope for the future of the planet. The cost of renewable energy like solar, hydro and wind energy has fallen significantly, making it increasingly affordable. Technological innovations in engineering and sustainable materials are also helping us address climate challenges like rising sea levels and heat, while new solutions are strengthening food and water resilience to safeguard lives and livelihoods. It is also heartening that businesses around the world are raising their climate ambitions. Youths worldwide are also passionate and continue to drive climate activism, pushing for policy changes.

While the challenges are significant, I remain optimistic that the momentum and collective will to protect our planet will continue to grow.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

As we mark the tenth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, I would like to share three key messages with world leaders.

First, we must reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and focus on the full, timely implementation of the Paris Agreement. This includes delivering on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and honoring past commitments.

Second, international cooperation remains key for meaningful and concrete progress. We need to strengthen partnerships, such as those that facilitate trade and cross-border flows in renewable energy, promote low-carbon solutions that are needed to accelerate our energy transition, and scale up collaborations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

Third, there is a need to strengthen trust and solidarity between developed and developing countries.

Included was a settlement with a group of the utility’s largest industrial customers — and an agreement with coal producers to study third-party operation of the retired coal units.

“For generations, our Cayuga power plant in Vermillion County has served the state, and today’s decision ensures it will continue to be a major source of our state’s power generation for decades to come,” a Duke Energy Indiana statement reads, in part.

After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.

Ratepayer protection agency recommends against Duke’s coal-to-gas push

After the replacement, the two combined-cycle natural gas units would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s current 1005-megawatt capacity.

The undertaking was approved as a “clean energy” project with financial incentives, including the authority to charge ratepayers for financing while the units are under construction.

Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.

The rate impact will hit in six-month increments, helping “reduce any rate shock that could be otherwise associated with implementing a construction project in base rates through a single step,” the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday order reads.

The state agency tasked with protecting utility customers previously asked regulators to reject the plan, calling it “ill-advised” in May. Office of Utility Consumer Counselor witnesses cited the sheer cost, rapidly changing regulations and technological advancements in their testimony.

Duke has estimated that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the OUCC predicting a total impact of $19.37 monthly.

The agency didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the approval.

Duke Energy Indiana’s regulatory win comes with a settlement with Reliable Energy, a trade association representing major Indiana coal producers, for a study that could result in third-party operation of the coal units at Cayuga. The group previously opposed the coal-to-gas plan.

Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement “represents a significant step toward Governor (Mike) Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply.”

“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online,” she continued. “Enabling third parties to help advance that effort demonstrates the innovative, entrepreneurial approach that defines Indiana’s energy strategy.”

The proceeds from any sale would flow to the utility’s ratepayers.

Duke Energy Indiana also invoked Braun’s name, saying the settlement “aligns” with recent executive orders “encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies and making sure there’s careful evaluation before retiring coal units.”

The utility will look at the technical feasibility of simultaneously operating the coal and natural gas units, including the potential for “full(y) decoupling” the units.

The study was set to begin as soon as regulators approved the coal-to-gas replacement and has to be done in eight months, at most, according to the settlement agreement.

The filing lays out a detailed list of what must be studied, plus a timeline for Duke Energy Indiana to follow on stakeholder engagement, a request for proposals and bidding process, a due diligence and a negotiations period.

The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030. The utility agreed not to shut them down before 2029 — and to pause demolition during the request for proposals process, until regulators say demolition can continue.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cayugacropped_mid.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 13:06:45.871680

Tensions in the US-China bilateral trade relationship have been a significant driver of investment in the clean energy sector in third countries, reshaping clean energy supply chains linked to both Chinese and US firms.

Third countries have positioned themselves to seize opportunities related to US-China strategic competition around clean energy and critical minerals, but this strategy carries risks that have grown more pronounced with recent shifts in US trade policy.

US policymakers seeking to build alternatives to China-exclusive supply chains could encourage the White House to clarify the meaning of recent official statements relating to transshipment and duty evasion, and establish country-specific tariff-rate quotas on clean energy exports from jurisdictions with significant levels of Chinese investment.

The global clean energy economy today looks starkly different than it did even 10 years ago. Not only have production and deployment of clean energy technologies expanded significantly, the geographic distribution of clean energy manufacturers, resellers, and end-users has shifted dramatically. In 2015, clean energy supply chains were somewhat diversified.[i] Today, China is by far the largest producer of most of the intermediary and finished goods that feed into global solar, wind, battery, and electric vehicle (EV) supply chains—in many cases accounting for a majority of global production.[ii] (See Figure 1).

These tectonic shifts in a sector poised to become one of the principal engines of global economic growth have occurred against deteriorating US-China relations and are causing growing concern among US leaders about the US-China bilateral trade deficit. Minimizing the flow of Chinese or Chinese-affiliated clean energy products into US markets has become a bipartisan project, with major implications for both global energy supply chains and the clean energy transition for the United States and China.

But the impact of US trade hawkishness is not limited to the bilateral relationship. Third countries that serve as nodes along clean energy supply chains have been significantly affected by US-China trade tensions. In some cases, these third countries have benefited economically from a diversification of Chinese and US investment and supply chains. Yet growing US concerns about tariff circumvention and the Trump administration’s mercurial approach to tariffs have injected uncertainty into the durability of those investment and supply chain relationships, and left countries with ties to both Chinese and US markets feeling squeezed.

This commentary examines how instability in US-China trade ties is shaping investment and trade in clean energy goods around the world and assesses the implications of China’s growing energy engagement in third countries for US policymakers.

Benefits to Third Countries

Expanded Chinese-Global South Trade

Since the Obama administration, the United States has steadily increased market barriers on a range of Chinese clean energy goods, substantially decreasing the short-term cost competitiveness of those goods and, in some cases, reducing import volumes to a trickle. In response, Chinese manufacturers have recalibrated their commercial strategies to focus on more receptive markets, increasing supply, lowering prices, and accelerating clean energy adoption.

Between 2021 and 2024, emerging markets accounted for 70% of the growth in China’s export of solar, wind, and EV products. In 2024, nearly half of these exports went to the Global South, matching exports to developed countries.[iii] This influx has helped lower clean energy prices and transform energy systems in many developing economies, especially those without significant domestic clean energy industries.[iv] For example, Pakistan, one of the largest Asian importers of Chinese solar panels, imported enough in 2024 to expand its power capacity by one-third. In Africa, too, cheap solar panels are helping countries lessen their reliance on hydropower following the worst mid-season drought in more than a century.[v]

Trade and Investment Partnerships

China has reinforced its shift to non-US markets through trade agreements and policy initiatives. Participation in frameworks like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has reduced barriers to trade in clean energy technologies and energy-efficient appliances to Southeast Asia.[vi] Since 2021, renewable energy investment has also become a new policy focus of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).[vii] In the first half of 2025, BRI green energy engagement reached US$9.7 billion across wind, solar, and waste-to-energy projects—an increase of US$4.2 billion from 2024—adding an estimated 11.9 gigawatts (GW) of green energy.[viii]

Amid ongoing US-China trade tensions, both advanced and emerging economies are positioning themselves as reliable partners for Chinese clean-tech investment. European OECD members now constitute the largest destination for China’s exports and overseas manufacturing investments by value (not without consequences to European producers, as discussed below).[ix] Meanwhile, a number of resource-rich countries in the Global South are angling to be strategic players in the global clean energy transition by pursuing policies that not only attract upstream (raw goods) but also midstream (processing and refining) investment that build local manufacturing capacity as a means to break out of extractive economic relationships.

Indonesia, for example, has leveraged its vast nickel reserves, a key input into EV batteries, by banning raw ore exports and requiring local processing, drawing major Chinese investment into smelting and battery precursor production.[x] Officials in other mineral-rich countries are likely to seek to replicate Indonesia’s success in shifting Chinese investment strategy away from raw mineral exports to local minerals processing. For example, South Africa, which produces about 70% of global platinum-group metals and has vast manganese, vanadium, and chromium reserves, is prioritizing local value-add through its 2025 Critical Mineral Strategy, with China as a likely partner.[xi]

Alongside this surge in Chinese exports and investment, US-backed financing is expanding as Washington seeks to counterbalance Beijing’s influence and mitigate Beijing’s chokehold on critical materials. Through the International Development Finance Corporation, the US has provided a US$150 million loan for Mozambique’s Balama graphite mine[xii] and helped broker an agreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to develop an EV battery supply chain tapping their cobalt and nickel reserves.[xiii] More recently, the Trump administration announced a multi-billion dollar partnership with Australia to reduce US dependence on Chinese exports of rare earth materials following Beijing’s imposition of stringent export controls on them in response to US tariffs in October.[xiv]

Supplying the US Market

While the Biden administration steadily increased market barriers on Chinese imports and expanded US-backed financing, it also created (now largely obsolete) incentives for the adoption of clean energy technologies alongside new supply chain relationships to meet growing American demand for these products. Such initiatives included the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investment and production tax credits, and rebates on EVs.

Pairing trade barriers on China with subsidies for clean energy generation and low-carbon technologies created lucrative market opportunities for clean energy firms in some third countries, particularly in the solar sector. Exporters based in Southeast Asia currently account for more than 90 percent of imports of solar products into the United States,[xv] despite being dwarfed by Chinese solar manufacturing and exports at a global level.

With respect to lithium batteries, Korea and Japan have become the second and third largest suppliers to the United States, although China continues to dominate.[xvi] Finally, although foreign-made EVs remain a small share of total sales in the United States, prohibitive tariffs on Chinese EVs mean that non-Chinese producers will not have to compete with low-cost Chinese brands.

Deepening Risks

The benefits described above come with associated risks and liabilities that have grown more pronounced since the start of the second Trump administration.

Price Competition

An influx of low-cost Chinese solar panels, batteries, and EVs—widely attributed to overproduction and associated surplus capacity in China’s domestic market—threatens to undercut domestic manufacturing capabilities in many importing countries, undermining their long-term industrial development and contributing to premature deindustrialization.[xvii]

Countries that aim to build local clean-tech industries have struggled to compete with China’s scale-driven cost advantages. As of 2024, Chinese automakers accounted for one in four EVs sold in Europe, with prices roughly 20% below European models.[xviii] In Thailand, Chinese brands now hold over 70% of the EV market.[xix] Governments from Bangkok to Brussels are responding with tariffs, anti-subsidy investigations, and incentives to protect domestic industry.[xx]

Chinese Foreign Ownership

Another risk is growing dependence on Chinese clean energy equipment and financing, which creates structural and strategic vulnerabilities beyond trade relations. Between 2023 and 2024, China announced US$58 billion in overseas clean energy manufacturing projects, along with US$24 billion in overseas power generation and storage deals, largely in South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa.[xxi] The sheer scale of these investments and export volumes has increased the risk of supply chain disruptions for importing countries and raised concerns about exposure to Chinese retaliatory measures and economic coercion.

Consider the challenge now facing Indonesia. Jakarta’s efforts to promote investment into value-added activities in its nickel sector have come with a cost: Chinese companies now dominate the sector, controlling an estimated 75% of domestic nickel operations.[xxii] During the Biden administration, Indonesia sought to diversify its partnerships and was considering limits on future Chinese project ownership to comply with US trade rules. These efforts to rebalance its supply chain partnerships are now facing major headwinds with the partial repeal of the IRA.[xxiii]

Dwindling US Opportunities

Similarly, the opportunities many third countries identified in the US market are beginning to look illusory. The recent omnibus reconciliation bill repealed or significantly curtailed many of the most important tax credits under the IRA and substantially expanded the scope of the “foreign entities of concern” restrictions on subsidy eligibility.[xxiv] These changes will inevitably suppress demand for imported clean energy products and undercut the commercial logic of additional investment into US renewable power generation and EV supply chains.

Compounding these challenges, the Trump administration’s assertive use of tariffs has cast a pall around US-focused export strategies in third countries. Steep tariffs on countries angling to compete with China as global manufacturing powerhouses have led multinational firms to pause and reconsider their plans to shift production out of China.[xxv] To add to the uncertainty, multiple US courts have found that the legal basis the White House has invoked for most of these tariffs, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), is invalid.[xxvi] The tariffs remain in force for the time being, with final resolution likely to come with a decision from the US Supreme Court, expected in early November.

Perhaps the biggest whipsaw has been for countries that benefited from Chinese investment into their domestic manufacturing sectors that, in turn, supplied US firms. In July 2025, the White House issued an executive order adjusting previous tariffs imposed under IEEPA, which included a declaration that “goods transshipped to evade applicable duties [i.e., tariffs]” would be subject to a 40% tariff.[xxvii] Neither “transshipment” nor “duty evasion” are terms with clear legal meaning under IEEPA or other trade and customs authorities, and could conceivably encompass a broad range of practices.[xxviii] US political trade “deals” with Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam announced in October all reference cooperation on “duty evasion” but do not clarify how such evasion should be assessed or what rules of origin would apply to goods shipped from those four countries.[xxix]

Southeast Asian countries that import Chinese components and re-export will be particularly exposed to this new transshipment policy, but the impacts will likely be felt more broadly. The Malaysian solar industry, which drew billions in Chinese investment during the first Trump administration only to crater in the wake of Biden administration tariffs, offers a worrying precedent for regional actors in this regard.[xxx]

Policy Implications

For US policymakers seeking a high degree of decoupling from Chinese-linked clean energy supply chains—or to limit deployment of clean energy technologies in general—the current state of affairs may be desirable. Chinese and third country exporters of clean energy supply chains are likely to pull back from supplying the US market in the face of uncertainty over tariffs and subsidies, leading to slower deployment of clean energy infrastructure in the United States and higher prices for clean energy goods. But dwindling points of entry for Chinese firms into US-bound supply chains are likely to accelerate Chinese investment and trade partnerships outside North America, potentially undercutting US efforts to blunt China’s influence in the Global South.[xxxi]

If policymakers’ goal is to replace Chinese and Chinese-linked clean energy supply chains with alternatives from third countries, current US policy is counterproductive. As of this writing, many third countries face actual or prospective economywide tariffs similar to and even higher than those on Chinese goods, making it difficult for them to compete on price.[xxxii] Rather than seeking partnerships with aspiring clean energy manufacturing hubs like India and Brazil, for example, the administration has imposed a baseline tariff of 50% on both countries’ exports under IEEPA, relative to China’s 30% (current as of October 29, 2025).[xxxiii] To exacerbate matters, the administration has justified its IEEPA tariffs on non-Chinese imports with shifting rationales, making it difficult for exporters to feel confident in the stability of current tariff rates and leaving trading partners uncertain about what measures, if any, they could adopt to receive more favorable treatment.

US policymakers interested in building alternatives to Chinese-exclusive clean energy supply chains could encourage the White House to clearly define the scope of the transshipment-related tariff policy authorized in President Trump’s executive order. They could also go a step further and propose linking actual or threatened imposition of those tariffs to tightened rules of origin on implicated goods, which third country governments could leverage to demand Chinese investment lead to more value-added activity, upskilling, and technology transfer, similar to what Indonesia achieved in its nickel sector.

A second, complementary approach would be to agree to tariff-rate quotas on specific clean energy goods on a country-by-country basis, similar to what was achieved with textiles under the (now defunct) Multi-Fibre Agreement.[xxxiv] Under this scheme, third countries would have reliable low-tariff access to the United States only up to a mutually agreed upon quantity of goods, allowing the US to control the geographic distribution of clean energy imports and discouraging Chinese investors from cycling from one country to another to avoid US anti-circumvention and anti-transshipment measures.

Rather than antagonizing longstanding trade partners with high tariffs, Washington’s strategic interests may be better served by coordinating with select third countries on addressing the extreme concentration of global clean energy supply chains. The goal of such coordination would be twofold: building resilience to future disruptions and shocks by diversifying sources of key clean energy goods and ensuring future clean energy investment does not flow disproportionately to Chinese firms at the expense of other market players.

Sign up to get it in your inbox.

Amid all of Donald Trump’s haphazard policymaking and chaos-mongering, one part of his agenda has remained remarkably consistent throughout both terms: the quest for something he calls “energy dominance.” While Trump probably thinks he coined the concept, only the name is new; it’s really merely a macho rebranding of what was traditionally known as “energy independence,” the desire to produce the nation’s energy domestically rather than import it from potential adversaries. The yearning for energy independence became a focus back during the Nixon era, when geopolitical tensions sparked overlapping energy crises. Ever since, it’s been pursued by every administration, both Democratic and Republican.

So, yes, even cardigan-wearing, thermostat-adjusting Jimmy Carter was an energy dominance guy, maybe even the most successful one. Same goes for Presidents Obama and Biden. What distinguishes Trump — despite all of his regulatory rollbacks, his “Drill, Baby, Drill” and “Mine, Baby, Mine” and “Beautiful Clean Coal” rhetoric and various “emergency” orders — is that his push for dominance has not only been ineffective, it has actually served to weaken the domestic energy industry and has even diminished its ability to produce the power needed to keep modern society running.

If Trump really cared about energy dominance, independence or abundance, he would use all of the tools at his disposal to “win” this war. Even an energy warrior who didn’t give a hoot about pollution or the climate would insist on keeping the fastest-growing energy sources — wind and solar with battery backup — in the nation’s arsenal, along with nuclear, geothermal, hydropower and natural gas, simply for practical reasons, relying on what previous administrations have called an “all-of-the-above” approach.

Instead, Trump has essentially discarded the most promising and effective energy technologies by eliminating federal tax credits for wind power and both rooftop and utility-scale solar, shuttering new wind projects on federal land and in federal waters, subjecting proposed utility-scale solar on federal land to additional scrutiny and red tape, and canceling the Solar for All program that aimed to bring clean energy and energy self-reliance to lower-income families. More recently, the administration clawed back over $7 billion in Biden-era funding for clean energy and grid-reliability projects, many of which were in Western states and all of which came from states that favored Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 election.

Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is trying to prop up the decrepit and rusty weapons of old, i.e. fossil fuels, and putting them on the front lines in the apparent hope that they don’t crumble away before his term ends.

The administration plans to fork out about $625 million in subsidies in hopes of revitalizing the flagging coal industry and has rolled back myriad regulations (also a form of subsidy) on coal-fired power plants. It has also opened 13 million acres of public land across the West to new coal leasing and overturned Biden-era bans on new leasing in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. At the same time, it has inexplicably canceled funding for carbon capture projects aimed at prolonging nearby coal plants’ lives.

Trump is clearly not looking to achieve energy dominance, but rather to exercise his countless grievances and realize some historical fantasy — while, of course, helping fossil fuel executives rake in a few more bucks while they still can. It’s a sort of qualified bid for coal and oil dominance, so long as it benefits red-leaning states.

But so far, even that’s not going too well.

Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management held its first coal lease sale in over a decade on public land in the Powder River Basin. There was only one would-be buyer, the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which bid just $186,000 for a tract containing about 167 million tons of coal — meaning about one-tenth of one cent per ton. That’s in contrast to sales in 2012 that brought in over $1 per ton. The feds rejected the bid on the grounds that it didn’t comply with the Mineral Leasing Act since it didn’t fetch fair market value. The Interior Department promptly canceled another sale in the Powder River Basin for 441 million tons of coal just days before it was scheduled to take place. And a third sale, this one on public lands in southwestern Utah, attracted only one low bid as well; and it, too, was rejected.

And just days after the administration announced its plans to pour taxpayers’ cash into the coal industry, PacifiCorp, the largest grid operator in the Western U.S., doubled down on its plans to convert its Naughton coal plant in Wyoming to run on natural gas. Idaho Power actually proposed a rate decrease for its customers after it cut costs by shutting down a unit at a Nevada coal plant. Meanwhile, no utility anywhere has seriously proposed building any new coal plants, mainly because it is simply an obsolete, expensive and dirty technology.

The president’s continual desire to “Drill, Baby, Drill” is experiencing a failure to launch, as well. The BLM has handed out drilling permits like Shriners throwing candy to the crowd at a parade, continuing to do so at an alarming rate despite the government shutdown. During the first six months of Trump’s term, the administration issued 2,660 permits to drill on public lands — about 524 per month. That eclipses Biden’s biggest year of 2023, when he issued 317 per month and garnered the disdain of climate activists.

And yet, drill rig counts, the most accurate indicator of the industry’s enthusiasm and a good barometer of future crude oil and natural gas production levels, have remained stagnant during Trump’s term. In fact, they’re significantly lower than they were a year ago, shortly before Trump was elected. That’s due in part to low oil prices, which is something Trump has pushed for (and maybe prodded Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to encourage by increasing their own oilfield pumping), but also because Trump’s disorderly trade wars are sowing confusion, while his tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising costs for drillers.

“Society will not treat us kindly unless we do our part to clean up after we are gone.”

The most recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas survey of oil and gas executives revealed how poorly Trump’s policies are playing out in the oilfields. Most of the executives surveyed said that Trump’s regulatory rollbacks and federal royalty reductions would bring down their “break-even” costs only slightly, and that they would not appreciably increase production.

Generally speaking, optimism is in short supply in the oilpatch these days.

“It’s going to be a bleak three-plus years for the oilpatch,” one executive said, in a survey that was designed to be anonymous to encourage a candid response. Another noted: “After Liberation Day, we cut our drilling budget in half from 10 wells to five wells.”

And yet another declared, “We have begun the twilight of shale. Several multibillion-dollar firms that have previously been U.S.-onshore-only are making investments in foreign countries and riskier (waterborne) geologies.” They went on to question what will happen to the hundreds of thousands of abandoned and orphaned wells when the drilling boom ends, noting, “Society will not treat us kindly unless we do our part to clean up after we are gone.”

Last week, the Trump administration moved to reopen 1.56 million acres on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s coastal plain to oil and gas leasing, just as he did in 2017 at the outset of his first term. The first lease sale in the refuge was held in 2021, just days before Biden was inaugurated, but it attracted only low bids — none from major oil companies — with most of the leases going to an Alaska state agency. Another auction in January 2025 drew no bids at all. The industry simply isn’t all that interested.

Just as Biden’s heightened regulations on oil and gas drilling didn’t slow drilling or production, Trump’s determined deregulation is unlikely to speed it up. Nor will his hostility toward solar and wind kill their momentum: Firms are bringing utility-scale projects online at a rapid rate and financing new proposals despite the lack of federal incentives. Federal policies can serve to mitigate energy development’s impacts or perhaps bolster the companies’ profits somewhat, but they are only one of many factors that influence how much and at what rate development occurs. All the political rhetoric in the world won’t help; so-called energy dominance simply cannot be willed — or forced — into existence.

In the first week of October, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) began construction of the San Antonio Solar Plant in the district of La Uruca, in the central canton of San José. It will be built on the site of the former thermal backup plant of the same name, which ceased operations in 2019.

The initial work involves temporary installations, dismantling existing structures, and subsequent earthmoving. With 21,300 panels, this park will contribute 10.3 megawatts of clean energy capacity to the country. The investment will total $11.5 million, and commercial operation is scheduled to begin in August 2026.

San Antonio is the first of the solar projects developed by ICE as part of its updated 2024-2040 Electricity Generation Expansion Plan . It will be the second of the company's own facilities to utilize photovoltaic energy (along with the Miravalles Solar Plant), which will be joined in the coming years by Abangares (Guanacaste) and Las Delicias (Puntarenas).

The design and construction were awarded to Ventus Colombia SAS, on an 11-hectare site.

“We will not allow our country to become numb or debilitated by those who are standing in the way of progress,” she said on a press call early on Thursday.

McCarthy co-chairs America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned states and cities in the US. The group will send more than 100 US subnational leaders – including governors, senior state officials, nearly 40 mayors and dozens of city officials – to the climate talks known as Cop30 and the UN Local Leaders Forum planned for the days before.

Expanded climate action from cities and states, paired with federal re-engagement after 2028, could by 2035 slash US planet-heating pollution by up to 56%, putting the United States below 2005 levels, according to a new study from America Is All In and the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability.

“There are especially large opportunities for states and cities to go further and faster in the power and transport sectors, as well as in reducing methane,” said Nate Hultman, former senior adviser for climate ambition at the state department and founding director of the Center for Global Sustainability.

Trump is cracking down on state and local climate action, trying to block policies in court and working to eliminate incentives for clean energy. But Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island senator, said climate leaders should resist those attacks, and sue the administration over potentially illegal obstruction.

“I think if you allow yourself to be intimidated by this administration, they will seize all the ground that you’ve seen them and then come back for more,” Whitehouse told reporters.

Global climate leaders must adopt the same aggressive attitude, said Whitehouse, though the US will not make it easy. This month, he noted, the nation derailed the enactment of a global carbon fee on shipping at an international maritime meeting, when Washington threatened to impose sanctions and visa restrictions on nations that supported the deal.

“There was kind of a like shock-and-awe thuggery approach that was effective there,” he said “But if you’re prepared for that kind of approach, then I think that’s where the line needs to be drawn.”

Whitehouse said leaders must be willing to stand up to the fossil fuel industry, who are the “villains” in the story of the climate crisis. The sector created a “whole armada of fake front groups” to protect its interests and spread doubt about the climate crisis – despite early knowledge that their products warm the planet, he said.

“To refuse to talk about that ignores both a very important and probably the most interesting part of the story,” said Whitehouse.

Without this influence, the world may have acted on the climate much earlier, said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director of the science and climate advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists, to reporters.

“Fossil fuel companies have been lying and obstructing progress on climate action. That’s why we’re here,” she said.

Climate experts have long condemned the influence of the fossil fuel sector in UN climate negotiations; oil and gas companies have even admitted to influencing climate treaties in ways that protect their interests. Record numbers of fossil fuel lobbyists have attended UN climate talks since the passage of the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Amid mounting pressure from climate campaigners to take on corporate influence at climate negotiations, the United Nations climate change body last month introduced new guidelines around transparency, asking COP30 attenders to disclose who is funding their participation in the talks. But disclosure remains voluntary.

Whitehouse, who has long pushed the UN climate body to strengthen transparency requirements, called the new guidance “a bit of a disappointment”.

“It’s a good first step, but it’s not where it needs to be,” he said. “There should be real transparency about who’s showing up and what evil they’ve been doing.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb390846574eec4333f0d4e7fa26a53b7563c61/371_0_3721_2976/master/3721.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2bfc1078e0d030e4480467a8599e11e",N,,2025-10-30 14:08:49.666797

Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) Basin Ranch will build the plant, which is expected to begin generating power for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power region in 2029.

“The Texas Energy Fund secured the largest capacity project to date, with 1,350 MW of new, reliable power generation coming online that will further fortify our state grid and support our growing economy for decades,” said Abbott. “As one of the largest sources of dispatchable power generation for the grid, this investment is just the latest example of why Texas is the energy capital of the world. We will take every step necessary to ensure affordability and electric reliability for Texas homes and businesses across our great state.”

“The Texas Energy Fund has now financed the addition of over 3,100 MW of new, reliable power for the State of Texas,” said Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Chairman Thomas Gleeson. “There is important work still ahead, but this newest commitment to invest in Texas is a clear demonstration of the value and reliability benefits the TxEF is bringing to bear.”

At 1,350 MW, the facility has the largest capacity of any project financed by the TxEF to date. Once connected, the CPV project will become one of the largest sources of dispatchable generation capacity for the ERCOT grid.

The loan agreement between the PUC and CPV is the fifth under the TxEF’s In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans for projects that add new, dispatchable power to the ERCOT region.

Under the loan agreement, total project costs are estimated to be $1.88 billion. The PUC is providing a 20-year TxEF loan of $1.12 billion, or 60% of the total project cost, at a 3% interest rate. The loan term runs from Oct. 28, 2025, through Oct. 28, 2045.

The natural gas generation facility will be built at CPV’s Basin Ranch Energy Center in Ward County. The project will interconnect in the ERCOT West Load Zone.

Under the loan agreement, the facility must meet minimum performance standards, as outlined in the In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program rules.

The Kerrville Public Utility Board, a Texas public power utility, made history with the first project to execute a loan agreement under the Texas Energy Fund, following a ceremonial signing held June 25 with leadership from the Public Utility Commission of Texas in Austin, Texas. Alongside the TEF loan agreement, KPUB finalized the issuance of tax-exempt revenue bonds, completing the utility’s full financing strategy for its generation project.

Scientists searching for cleaner and more sustainable technologies are turning their attention to two-dimensional materials that could transform renewable energy systems. Their work may make it possible to create essential compounds like ammonia, a key ingredient in fertilizers, through cleaner and more efficient methods.

Among the most promising of these materials are MXenes, an emerging class of low-dimensional compounds. MXenes can act as catalysts that convert elements from the air into ammonia, a process that could improve energy efficiency in both agricultural and transportation applications.

One of the remarkable features of MXenes is their highly adaptable chemical makeup. Their compositions can be finely adjusted, allowing scientists to precisely control their structural and functional properties for different uses.

This research, featured in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, was conducted by chemical engineering professors Drs. Abdoulaye Djire and Perla Balbuena, along with Ph.D. candidate Ray Yoo.

Djire’s team is questioning a long-held belief in materials science: that the performance of transition metal-based materials depends only on the specific metal used. Instead, they aim to uncover a deeper understanding of how various structural factors influence catalytic performance.

Understanding Catalytic Functionality

“We aim to expand our understanding of how materials function as catalysts under electrocatalytic conditions,” Djire said. “Ultimately, this knowledge may help us identify the key components needed to produce chemicals and fuels from earth-abundant resources.”

The structure of MXenes plays a key role in how they behave. By adjusting the lattice nitrogen reactivity, specifically by replacing a carbon atom with a nitrogen atom, researchers can modify the material’s vibrational properties. These properties describe how molecules move and vibrate based on the energy within them.

According to Yoo, this ability to fine-tune MXenes makes them highly adaptable for targeted uses in renewable energy. Their customizable nature positions them as strong contenders to replace current electrocatalyst materials that are often expensive and less efficient.

“MXenes are the ideal candidates as transition metal-based alternative materials. They have promising potential due to their many desirable qualities,” Yoo said. “Nitride MXenes play an important role in electrocatalysis, as shown through their improvement in performance compared to the widely studied carbide counterparts.”

Computational and Experimental Insights

The work was complemented by first-principles computational analyses performed by Ph.D. student Hao-En Lai in Dr. Balbuena’s group. The group evaluated changes in the surface vibrational modes caused by energy-relevant solvents in contact with MXenes. With these additional findings, the authors quantified the interactions of molecules, especially in the context of ammonia synthesis.

Throughout this research, Djire, Yoo, and the team have investigated the vibrational properties of titanium nitride using Raman spectroscopy, a non-destructive chemical analysis technique that provides detailed information about chemical structure.

“I feel that one of the most important parts of this research is the ability of Raman spectroscopy to reveal the lattice nitrogen reactivity,” Yoo said. “This reshapes the understanding of the electrocatalytic system involving MXenes.

Studies involving Raman spectroscopical characterization with nitride MXenes and polar solvents could lead to major breakthroughs, Yoo said.

“We demonstrate that electrochemical ammonia synthesis can be achieved through the protonation and replenishment of lattice nitrogen,” Djire said. “The ultimate goal of this project is to gain an atomistic-level understanding of the role played by the atoms that constitute a material’s structure.”

Like reasonable people can disagree about all kinds of things. But if you’re trying to make climate policy, obviously you’re going to propose ideas that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, right? Bueller? Anyone?

In other news, on October 15, Hilary Howard and Grace Ashford wrote a story for the New York Times headlined “N.Y. Democrats Urge Hochul to Reject Pipeline Over Climate Concerns.”

The article is about the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, a proposed pipeline from New Jersey into the Rockaways that would increase the amount of natural gas that can be shipped from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania to the northeastern United States.

Specifically, it’s about a letter signed by New York City House Democrats — including Hakeem Jeffries, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Dan Goldman, Nydia Velázquez, and Ritchie Torres — opposing the pipeline.

Those representatives, in short, span the factional divides that captivate the internet — they include pro-Israel Democrats and critics of the U.S.-Israel alliance, those who identify with the abundance movement and those who identify as populists. Yet this disparate group of Democrats is united in opposing the project on climate grounds.

A curious and alert New York Times reader might want to know what exactly these concerns are. How much will the pipeline increase emissions? Are we talking about an increase in localized carbon emissions in New York State or an increase in global emissions? We know that climate change is not considered a priority by most voters and that all factions of Democrats are (supposedly) focused on affordability and the cost of living.

But still, perhaps you care a lot about climate change and think it’s worth asking voters to pay a price for reduced emissions. You might want to know what price and how much emissions reduction we’re talking about.

The article doesn’t say because the letter doesn’t say.

Which is a remarkable fact that, were it my article, I would have made note of. Those critics know that they’re against the pipeline. They know that the reason they’re against the pipeline is climate concerns. But again, what are the concerns?

In defense of the letter writers, the reason they don’t have even back-of-the-envelope modeling of how much the pipeline will increase emissions is that this is actually an incredibly challenging modeling exercise. On the other hand, suppose you’re the governor of New York State and a proposal for a project lands on your desk. The project will create jobs and stimulate other economic activity. It will reduce energy costs for your constituents.

But people are asking you to say no to it due to climate concerns. And those people can’t tell you — not even a vague estimate — what the climate impact will be. I would not act on these objections. And in particular, I would not act on objections of that nature when the emissions impact of the project could very likely be negative.

Note, for example, that American emissions have been going down since the domestic natural gas boom began, around 2007, because replacing coal with gas reduces emissions.

The northeastern United States no longer has coal plants, so delivering additional natural gas there will not reduce emissions through that particular mechanism. But both the global and regional energy situations are complex, and I think there’s still a reasonable case that this pipeline will reduce emissions.

The climate case for a pipeline

The letter writers claim that a pipeline is economically pointless because “gas consumption in New York is projected to remain flat or decline due to increased renewable generation and improved efficiency.”

The reality is that, due to pipeline constraints, the northeastern United States currently imports a good amount of liquified natural gas. The point of liquifying gas is that you can put it on boats. This boat-borne gas trades on a global market at a higher price than domestic natural gas, the price of which is depressed by limited export infrastructure and a shortage of pipelines connecting to northeastern markets. Building more pipelines would provide the Northeast with access to cheaper piped gas. This will decrease northeastern gas prices relative to a “no pipeline” counterfactual. It will also somewhat raise national gas prices, and (by a smaller amount) reduce global gas prices.

The most important potential climate impact of the pipeline is that gas-burning furnaces emit 40 percent less greenhouse gases than oil-burning furnaces, so making it cheaper to switch has large environmental benefits. More abundant gas could also reduce the region’s reliance on dirtier oil- and coal-burning peaker plants during periods of very high electricity demand.

Speaking of electricity, everyone seems to agree that we should be encouraging the use of electric cars and electric heat pumps rather than fossil-fuel-burning options for transportation and home heat. How attractive those options are, from a consumer standpoint, is in part a function of electricity prices. The lowest emissions option, of course, is for heat pumps and electric cars to be powered by 100 percent zero-emissions electricity. But a large gas-fired power plant is more efficient than a home gas furnace, and gas is clean compared to fuel oil or gasoline. So a program of burning natural gas to generate electricity to displace internal combustion engines and home furnaces is a program to bring emissions down.

I will be the first to admit that this is an imperfect and imprecise model. But I believe that more pipelines to bring Marcellus Shale gas to the northeastern United States will make emissions lower, not higher, relative to a counterfactual in which we refuse to build pipelines.

Paying an economic price in order to reduce emissions may be dicey politics, but it’s not a crazy idea. But paying a price in order to make emissions higher is absurd. Pipeline opponents have simply not bothered to try to explain why this is wrong or what climate concerns exactly they have.

Taking northeastern energy seriously

I think most people probably just assume that if a bunch of environmentalists are saying a pipeline is bad for climate, the pipeline is bad for climate.

But consider Indian Point.

When Andrew Cuomo, R.F.K. Jr., and the Natural Resources Defense Council teamed up to close this New York nuclear plant, many warned that eliminating a major source of zero-emissions electricity would make emissions higher.

That is in fact exactly what happened, which seems really obvious. The counterargument at the time was that this would be fine because renewable power was growing rapidly. Well, they were wrong, and it didn’t grow quickly enough. But in some ways that’s just a cheap rhetorical point. Even if renewables had grown fast enough to replace the Indian Point energy, it’s still the case that turning the nuclear plant off would lead to higher emissions relative to a counterfactual in which it wasn’t turned off.

New York State is simply not in danger of having an overabundance of zero-emissions electricity. New York is burning lots of fossil fuels to generate electricity and to heat homes and power vehicles. The state’s electricity prices are 50 percent higher than the national average. New Yorkers can use all the supply they can get.

I bring up the Indian Point saga to illustrate that, however incredulous it might sound that Joe Newsletter Writer is correct about the emissions impact of the pipeline and the professional environmental advocates are wrong, these people have a terrible forecasting track record that is grounded in a fundamentally bad analytic framework.

A few years ago, they didn’t want nuclear because we could build renewables instead. Now, they don’t want gas because we can build renewables instead. But two questions:

Why “instead”? What’s the tradeoff?

What’s the 100 percent renewable vision for the Northeast anyway?

Onshore wind generates a lot of electricity in places where it’s quite windy, which is why a lot of Great Plains states combine high renewables share with cheap electricity. But it’s not that windy in the Northeast. It’s also the least sunny part of the country, with the exception of Washington State, which happens to have a quarter of America’s hydroelectric power.

This is not to say that there is no renewable energy in the Northeast or no prospect for building more. But the northeastern United States is not a place where building renewable energy is particularly economical.

A state willing to pay a price to meet its climate goals can, of course, choose to subsidize a renewables buildout, but there’s a real fiscal tradeoff with things like schools and Medicaid. You could say “instead of paying teachers high salaries, we should build renewables instead.” Or “instead of giving generous health benefits to poor people, we should build renewables instead.” But a gas pipeline does not reduce the state’s capacity to subsidize renewable energy. There is no tradeoff. If anything, by bringing the price of energy down, it makes it easier to subsidize renewables.

There’s also the question of what you’re actually building.

In my experience, residents of the Northeast are more invested in the climate issue than residents of Texas or Iowa, and also more skeptical of cutting down huge swathes of forest to build utility-scale wind and solar plants. People in states with agriculture-intensive economies are more comfortable with this sort of project. That’s why northeastern states gravitated toward offshore wind projects, which were suffering from exploding construction costs even before the Trump administration started canceling them.

There’s no realistic counterfactual analysis in which blocking the gas pipeline leads to a surge of renewables construction. If you want to build more renewables, by all means, identify the policy obstacles and do that. But the question to ask about the pipeline is whether building it will make emissions go up relative to not building it — and there’s just not a compelling reason to think the answer is yes.

The perils of backwards reasoning

So what’s going on here?

Back in the stone age of 2009, the prevailing thought on addressing climate change was that there would be a binding international treaty aimed at limiting emissions such that total climate change would be limited to two degrees Celsius. That treaty would, among other things, commit various countries to legally binding emissions targets. In the United States (and presumably elsewhere), that would involve a statutory cap on greenhouse gas emissions, with emitters needing to obtain emissions permits either through direct government allocation or by purchasing them on a market. That was “cap and trade.”

The legally binding cap would, of course, constrain emissions in any given year.

But it would also inform investment decisions. With the cap falling over time, everyone would know that, in the future, aggregate fossil fuel use would have to be lower rather than higher. So you wouldn’t build a new pipeline in 2020 that would take decades to pay off if you knew the infrastructure had to be retired in 2030. The country would plow ahead into a future where the energy mix was cleaner than in the no-cap scenario, but also where energy is just generally scarcer and somewhat more expensive. Daily life in the United States would look more like it does in Europe, where energy is more expensive and there is a lot more emphasis on efficiency.

Whatever one makes of this vision, the fact is it didn’t happen. There was no globally binding treating, there was no cap and trade bill, and the world is not going to limit warming to two degrees Celsius.

Unfortunately, a lot of people who genuinely care about this issue are stuck reasoning backwards from these phantom targets. It is probably true that building new natural gas pipelines is not consistent with the United States becoming a net zero economy by 2050. In that scenario, the Northeast would electrify transportation and home heat regardless of electricity prices, and electricity prices would simply go as high as they need to go in order to make offshore wind and other renewables pencil out.

But this is a thought experiment or science fiction.

Democrats need to forget about the hypothetical scenario in which pipeline approvals are being made in the context of a national cap and trade system that operates in the context of a legally binding international treaty.

Instead, they need to think about the actual question at hand: Will emissions be higher or lower if we build the pipeline? If they are very, very sure that emissions will be higher, that’s the beginning of an argument against the pipeline.

You do have to actually ask the question, though.

And even though it sounds hard to believe that anyone would fail to ask that question, I truly believe that they are failing to. That’s why Indian Point was closed, that’s why there’s no environmental groups engaging in the fight over New York’s housing charter amendments, and it’s why calls to block pipelines come with no analysis on the merits of the actual impact.

“Given the growth projections, customers can have multiple gateways to optimize their supply chains and mitigate risks,” he said.

Beyond supporting the food and beverage industry, Brott said a direct ocean service to northern Europe offers reliable transit times and a cost-effective alternative to airfreight for select medical and life sciences segments. Wilmington has seen increased use across these industries.

When it comes to cold storage, he said, “Thanks to strategic investments made over the past decade, both within and beyond our gates, the Port of Wilmington is well-equipped to support the continued growth of refrigerated imports and exports.”

North Carolina provides the location, industries, and logistics to support the cold storage growth cited in the Hickey Global report.

For his part, Cooper is choosing to dig for a different kind of energy: geothermal, the renewable heat beneath our feet.
Geothermal energy from the shallow earth can be tapped to superefficiently heat and cool individual buildings or even entire neighborhoods.
​“He wanted to be part of the solution for the employment of these individuals.” Going into geothermal energy ​“felt so right,” Anna said.
They’re building a future with geothermal energy, regardless of the federal push for coal.","When Matt Cooper found out in 2020 that the northwest Colorado coal mine where he works would close by the end of the decade, he was pissed.

Questions raced through his mind: Why didn’t the mine’s leaders fight harder to keep it open? And why was the coal industry being singled out? ​“Is it political?” he wondered.

But coal has been declining in the U.S. for over 20 years, outcompeted by cheap fossil gas and, more recently, even cheaper renewables. Cooper eventually accepted there was nothing he could do — except plan for what’s next.

Now the coal-fired Craig Station is set to shutter in 2028, and the Colowyo mine that feeds it is halting production by the end of the year. For his part, Cooper is choosing to dig for a different kind of energy: geothermal, the renewable heat beneath our feet.

“It works wonderfully well,” said Cooper, a longtime Hamilton, Colorado, resident with a snowy-white goatee and a strong Western accent. Geothermal energy from the shallow earth can be tapped to superefficiently heat and cool individual buildings or even entire neighborhoods. Leveraging his ample experience operating heavy equipment at the mine, Cooper has started a new business, High Altitude Geothermal, to drill for the resource. With the startup’s first projects underway, he’s working alongside his wife, daughter, and two sons, both of whom are also coal miners.

Others in the fossil-fuel industry could follow, finding a foothold in geothermal as clean energy takes off. Colorado plans to decarbonize its economy by 2050, and its remaining six coal plants are shutting down by the end of the decade. The Centennial State’s six active coal mines, which employed roughly 900 workers as of July, will likely shut down along with them.

The northwest corner of the state is the epicenter of the transition. And affected communities stand to lose not only jobs, but big chunks of their tax base. Moffat County, where Cooper lives, will be the hardest hit; Craig Station made up a third of its property taxes in 2022.

In 2019, Colorado created the Office of Just Transition, the first state-level office in the nation dedicated to providing personalized support to coal workers and their families, as well as funding to their communities.

“Small towns have this tendency to be dependent on one or two large employers,” said Wade Buchanan, director at the just-transition office, which helped the Coopers connect to state agencies as they worked on their business concept. ​“You want to help communities find a way to be more diversified, so that their fortunes are not subject to the fortunes of any single employer.”

Buchanan said he’s thrilled by the Coopers’ venture into geothermal, a tech that the state and federal government are backing with incentives. ​“They’re trailblazers showing the way for a lot of other people that opportunities exist.”

Coal’s demise and geothermal’s appeal

Cooper still isn’t happy that Colorado’s coal industry is sunsetting. ​“We produce some of the cleanest coal in the nation,” even if it is a fossil fuel, said Cooper, who plans to keep doing shift work at the coal mine until it closes. President Donald Trump also dubs coal clean, and Cooper reports feeling more aligned with Republicans than Democrats.

He’s clear-eyed that change is inevitable, though, like it or not. ​“I can’t save the coal industry,” Cooper said.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has undertaken the Sisyphean task of resuscitating coal in the U.S. by, among other tactics, forcing uneconomic coal plants to keep running past their planned closure dates.

Cooper, who worked at a heat- and power-generating plant when he was in the military, isn’t a fan of most forms of renewable energy. ​“Windmills are ugly things to me,” he said — a view shared by the U.S. president. He finds batteries unpalatable. And solar panels send jobs overseas, he said.

“When you’re buying solar panels from China, I don’t think that’s the right way to go. If you’re going to buy the things, they ought to be built here,” Cooper said. (Though perhaps not a well-publicized statistic, domestic solar manufacturing employed about 34,000 workers in 2024.)

Geothermal is an up-and-coming energy source Cooper can get behind. Hooked up to heat pumps, it’s the most efficient way to warm and cool buildings.

In a geothermal system, loops of flexible pipe are installed ten to hundreds of feet deep into the ground. At these depths, the earth is a fairly stable 45 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit, funneling a ready source of heat in cold weather to a building’s electrically powered geothermal heat pump. In the summer, the appliances provide air conditioning by dumping a building’s extra warmth underground.

Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient. They can deliver the same amount of heating as a fossil-fueled or electric-resistance system using just a fourth or even a sixth of the energy.

“In northwest Colorado, you can pay $700 a month for propane to heat your house, or $400 for natural gas,” said Cooper. ​“That’s a chunk of change, because our winter up here lasts about five to six months — about half a year where you’re going to be heating your home.” And the cold cuts like a knife: Cooper recalls winters in the area with lows in the minus 50s and 60s Fahrenheit.

Plus, a geothermal heat pump actually ​“helps the grid out,” Cooper said. The appliances are not only superefficient but also provide warmth steadily, rather than in bursts. That reduces peaks in power demand, keeping electricity more affordable for everyone.

An economic opportunity

Geothermal systems aren’t yet widespread. Most people don’t know the tech exists, and the up-front cost to install them is typically two to three times the price tag of an air-source heat pump or gas furnace plus a central air conditioner.

But the higher costs in northwest Colorado are partly due to far-flung geothermal drillers having to haul their equipment across the Rocky Mountains, said Cooper, who’s been spinning up the startup in his off-time. ​“I think I can keep my costs of mobilization down, and so that makes the product more affordable.”

His geothermal drilling business will be the first in Moffat County and neighboring Routt and Rio Blanco counties — a region home to more than three-quarters of the roughly 1,700 workers that make up Colorado’s coal industry and its supply chain. The state is backing High Altitude Geothermal, providing four years of tax relief and a $40,000 grant for operations through the economic development program Rural Jump-Start.

For now, the startup consists of Cooper and his family members. His wife, Kristine, is helping with administrative work. His daughter, Anna, handles operations. His sons, Matthew and Nathan, are drilling alongside him. Anna is also certified to do that work, so she can step in when the need arises. But as business picks up, Cooper aims to expand to a second crew and hire more people — especially other miners in the area.

“Hiring displaced coal workers was part of Matt’s ​‘why’ for starting this business,” Kristine said. ​“He wanted to be part of the solution for the employment of these individuals.”

Going into geothermal energy ​“felt so right,” Anna said. ​“It’s a wonderful resource that everyone has access to. It’s there all the time.” And it’s a boost to the local economy. ​“It’s really exciting … when you have something that’s so powerful.”

High Altitude Geothermal has already secured its first contracts: retrofits of two homes in Moffat County. The Coopers are also bidding on two large-scale commercial projects in the municipalities of Steamboat Springs and Gunnison. They’re building a future with geothermal energy, regardless of the federal push for coal.

“There’s some people that are holding out that somehow Trump will be able to make coal viable again and make the power plants stay open,” Cooper said. ​“Maybe they’ll be right. … I have no idea. But my intuition is that this ball is rolling, and I don’t see it stopping.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Cooper-family-photo_2025-10-29-212139_srqe.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=dbda03b00db153f25875c43f2717e32e,N,,2025-10-30 14:08:26.495527

CLEVELAND, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ABEO), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for serious diseases, today announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has established a permanent Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) J-code for ZEVASKYN (prademagene zamikeracel) gene-modified cellular sheets, the Company’s autologous gene therapy for the treatment of wounds in adult and pediatric patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The new J-code for ZEVASKYN, J3389 (Topical administration, prademagene zamikeracel, per treatment) becomes effective on January 1, 2026.

""The assignment of a unique, product-specific J-code by CMS is a major step forward in ZEVASKYN’s launch,"" said Dr. Madhav Vasanthavada, Chief Commercial Officer of Abeona. ""This code will simplify claims and reimbursement processing between our qualified treatment centers and payers across public and private sectors, and further support hospital adoption and patient access for ZEVASKYN.""

J-codes are unique identifiers designed to identify non-orally administered medications in healthcare settings. A J-code plays a vital role in streamlining the medical billing and reimbursement processes related to drug administration.

About ZEVASKYN ® (prademagene zamikeracel) gene-modified cellular sheets

ZEVASKYN is the first and only autologous cell sheet-based gene therapy for the treatment of wounds in adult and pediatric patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is a severe skin disease caused by a defect in both copies of the COL7A1 gene, resulting in the inability to produce functional type VII collagen. Without functional type VII collagen and anchoring fibrils, the skin is fragile and blisters easily, leading to wounds that continually open and close, or fail to heal altogether. Patients often have large open wounds that can lead to serious life-threatening complications. ZEVASKYN gene modified cellular sheets are made by inserting the correct COL7A1 gene into a patient’s own skin cells ex vivo using a replication-incompetent retroviral vector, resulting in functional type VII collagen expression in treated wounds. ZEVASKYN has demonstrated clinically meaningful wound healing and pain reduction with a single surgical application. For more information, visit www.ZEVASKYN.com .

Indication

ZEVASKYN ® (prademagene zamikeracel) is an autologous cell sheet-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of wounds in adult and pediatric patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).

Important Safety Information

Serious allergic reactions to ZEVASKYN can occur. Patients should get medical help right away if they experience symptoms like itching, swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, runny nose, watery eyes, or nausea. In rare cases, a severe reaction called anaphylaxis may happen.

There is a potential risk that treatment with ZEVASKYN may contribute to the development of cancer because of how the therapy works. Patients should be monitored for the rest of their lives to check for any signs of cancer.

ZEVASKYN is made using human and animal materials. Although these materials are tested before use, the risk of passing on infections cannot be eliminated.

The Cummins case began with an EPA investigation into a software defeat device found in the engines of Dodge Ram trucks.
With the defeat devices installed, the trucks were emitting nitrogen oxides, or NOx, at levels far beyond EPA limits.
He’s rooting hard for the attorneys that remain but knows it’s not easy for them.
“So it is really important to me.” This story was updated Oct. 30 to correct the emissions case pursued during the first Trump administration.","When Department of Justice attorney Nick McDaniel was tapped to lead a major enforcement action with the Environmental Protection Agency over vehicle emission control violations, he was under no illusions that his “soft sciences” background would be enough to get a win.

A Harvard Law grad with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology from Eastern Kentucky, McDaniel approached the highly technical case with a seemingly obvious but crucially self-aware thought: “You can’t pretend you’re an engineer.”

“You do have to really get in the weeds sometimes and understand it,” he continued. “Because you’re not going to be able to do your job as an attorney, which is negotiating a settlement document or explaining to a judge why your position is correct, or explaining to the public why a settlement is protective of public health. You can’t do those things unless you’re able to … look under the hood a little bit.”

Shepherding the DOJ’s case against Cummins Inc., McDaniel teamed with EPA engineers, scientists and outside consultants on the work, securing a record $1.675 billion Clean Air Act penalty in January 2024 against the Indiana-based engine manufacturer.

McDaniel, who took a deferred resignation offer from Justice in June after 11 years with the agency, will be recognized for those efforts Sunday with a Flemming prize, one of 12 public servants honored by the country’s oldest awards for government service.

“It means a lot,” McDaniel said of the honor. “I get to go up on stage and get the award. But lots and lots of other people worked on this project, and I was happy to be a piece of it.”

The stage was set for the Cummins settlement years before when regulators discovered “defeat devices” in diesel engines. Those devices, which could be software or mechanical, enabled engines to pass EPA emissions testing — but then out in the real world, the device didn’t activate the required emissions controls. Violations by Volkswagen generated plenty of headlines.

The Cummins case began with an EPA investigation into a software defeat device found in the engines of Dodge Ram trucks. Once the enforcement action was initiated, McDaniel and his colleagues in the DOJ’s Environment and Natural Resources Division had to figure out how many trucks were affected and how a fix could be made.

With the defeat devices installed, the trucks were emitting nitrogen oxides, or NOx, at levels far beyond EPA limits. McDaniel worked with engineers and scientists who “actually understand how these trucks work” and were able to tell the attorneys “how they need to be fixed” and “how long it’s going to take to fix them.”

From there, it was on McDaniel and his team to figure out how to “mitigate the harm that was caused” by the excess emissions and decide what sort of penalty would be appropriate for Cummins to pay. They reached that record-setting Clean Air Act figure after taking into account the scope of the manufacturer’s work: 630,000 model year 2013-2019 vehicles equipped with illegal software defeat devices and another 330,000 model year 2019-2023 autos with auxiliary emission control devices that Cummins did not disclose.

“We view that as an important factor in deterrence,” McDaniel said, “for future potential defeat device cases or engine manufacturers who have to be aware of the regulatory requirements and make sure they’re staying within the balance of what compliance requires.”

The Cummins case wasn’t McDaniel’s last with the DOJ, though it did encompass many of the things he loved most about public service: working with other “amazing” attorneys and EPA experts on “a really big undertaking” that resulted in undeniable environmental change for the better.

When asked if he thought the current administration would take on similar enforcement actions, McDaniel pointed out that an emissions cheating case against Daimler AG was brought during President Donald Trump’s first term, and cases like Cummins have been pursued by DOJ “under every administration.” Laws that protect clean air and water remain on the books, and the job of federal attorneys who do environmental compliance work “doesn’t change when the administration changes.”

Still, McDaniel left the DOJ during an especially “topsy-turvy time” in the federal government for a new role as a litigator with Babst Calland’s environmental, energy and natural resources groups. He’s rooting hard for the attorneys that remain but knows it’s not easy for them.

“My former colleagues in the environmental enforcement section have fewer resources,” he said. “Staffing levels are lower from retirements and other folks who have left the department. … That absolutely impacts their ability to do all the great work that they can do and want to do.”

Being part of a broader federal team isn’t an experience McDaniel can really replicate these days, but he’s embracing the change and grateful for his time in public service.

“Protecting the public interest and enforcing the law and defending the law … that’s an amazing, amazing thing to have as part of your profession,” he said. “So it is really important to me.”

To arrange interviews with Bob in Brazil or back in the United States, please contact Daniel Baker at dbaker@e2.org.","WASHINGTON (Oct. 30, 2025) – TIME named Bob Keefe, executive director for the national nonpartisan business group E2, to the 2025 TIME100 Climate list, recognizing the 100 most innovative leaders driving business climate action. For the third year in a row, TIME editors vetted people who delivered measurable progress with respect to the business of climate change, emphasizing tangible results over commitments.

In choosing Keefe, the magazine recognized his leadership of an organization that has uniquely worked across the political aisle for more than 25 years, to advance some of the nation’s most important clean energy and climate policies — at both the federal and state level.

At E2, Keefe helped launch groundbreaking original research and reports detailing the growth of clean energy jobs in America, the economic costs of climate change, and the economy-wide impacts of recent rollbacks to U.S. federal clean energy policies.

“At a time when climate policy can feel like the third rail of American politics, E2 continues to show that there’s nothing political about creating jobs, spurring innovation, or advocating for a clean energy economy,” Keefe said after hearing the news.

Naming Keefe underscored the importance of his and E2’s ongoing nonpartisan efforts to make the business case for climate action, especially in these polarized times. Amid the Trump administration’s attempts to derail America’s — and the global — shift to a cleaner economy and increase its dependence on fossil fuels, an organization respected by leaders from both parties is more vital than ever.

Other nominees include political leaders and entrepreneurs who have made an indelible impact building a stronger economy and more resilient climate. See the full list: time.com/collections/time-100-climate-2025/. The full TIME100 Climate list will be featured in the November 10, 2025, issue, available on newsstands on Friday, October 31.

Under Keefe’s leadership, E2 has grown to more than 11,000 business leaders who work or do business in just about every state and across just about every sector of the economy. E2 members and supporters are committed to helping advance smart climate and clean energy policies at both the federal and state levels.

“Bob has established a truly inclusive approach to advocacy, bringing together people from all different sectors of the economy and all corners of the country, to deliver climate policies with both economic and national security benefits,” said Nicole Lederer, E2 Chair and Co-Founder. “E2 is pushing the envelope under Bob’s leadership.

$72 billion capital expenditure plan

Up 33% from AEP’s previous five-year capex plan, partly driven by 765-kV transmission projects in Texas and the PJM Interconnection region.

65 GW peak load in 2030

Up 76% from AEP’s summer peak, driven by 28 GW in data center and other large load agreements.

$2.6 billion year-to-date operating earnings

Up 13% from a year ago, partly driven by 765-kV transmission projects in Texas and the PJM Interconnection region.

7% to 9% earnings per share annual growth rate

Up from 6% to 8% previously. AEP’s stock price jumped 6% Wednesday to $122.11/share.

3.5%

Annual residential rate hikes AEP expects its customers will face over the next five years.

Surging loads

In the last 12 months, AEP’s utilities sold 6% more electricity compared to the previous year, with residential sales up 2.3% and commercial sales up 7.9%, and those sales are expected to continue growing, according to the company. About 2 GW of data centers came online in the third quarter, Trevor Mihalik, AEP vice president and CFO, said Wednesday during an earnings conference call.

AEP expects its peak load will hit 65 GW by 2030, up from 37 GW, with demand surging in Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, according to William Fehrman, AEP chairman, president and CEO. The growth estimate includes 28 GW of customers with electric service agreements or letters of agreement, he said.

About half of that 28 GW is in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market, 40% in the PJM Interconnection and 10% in the Southwest Power Pool, according to Fehrman. About 80% of that pending demand is from hyperscalers such as Google, AWS and Meta, Mihalik said. The remaining demand growth is from industrial customers with projects such as a Nucor steel mill in West Virginia and Cheniere Energy’s liquefied natural gas facilities in Texas, he said.

“We are in, I would say, the cat bird seat with regards to connecting data center load,” Fehrman said. “The 765-kV transmission network that we have provides us with an extreme competitive advantage for where these folks are trying to site.”

AEP owns about 2,100 miles of 765-kV transmission lines in six states, making up 90% of all 765-kV infrastructure in the U.S., according to the company.

Renewables part of the plan

“Electricity demand growth is putting pressure on reliability, and this new demand is driving the need for generation diversity, including significant generation additions or retirement delays,” Fehrman said.

AEP’s utilities’ integrated resource plans call for adding about 27.2 GW of generation through 2035, including 12.8 GW of gas-fired generation, according to the company.

Gas makes up 56% of AEP’s generation plans

The utility company expects to spend $7 billion on solar, wind and storage.

AEP has secured 8.7 GW of gas turbine capacity and has a high-voltage equipment agreement in place with a key industry supplier, according to Fehrman.

While some states where AEP utilities operate want to add gas-fired generation, some utility customers remain “heavily interested in renewables,” Fehrman said. AEP’s capital spending plan includes more than $7 billion for renewables, he said.

Will AEP keep rates affordable?

Despite its growing capital spending plan — and expectations for average 9% annual operating earnings growth through 2030 — AEP expects it will be able to keep average annual residential rate increases at 3.5%.

“It is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid,” Fehrman said, noting its utilities have approved data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, with pending tariff filings in Michigan, Texas and Virginia.

“As we ramp up our investments in this electric infrastructure super cycle, more of the incremental costs are assigned to commercial and industrial customers who are driving the increased investment,” Fehrman said.

AEP utilities are moderating residential rates through affordability “levers,” such as incremental load growth, rate design, a focus on operations and maintenance costs and financing mechanisms like securitization, Fehrman said.

AEP expects the combined return on equity at its utilities will increase to 9.5% in 2030 from 9.1% in the last 12 months, partly driven by “legislative and regulatory advancements.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6_iy4m5gw8EanA9CLdlRmZL6eJgSqhykssPRhZBIe-I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMDU1MzQ1MTk5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-30 12:08:43.026701

Part 609 to implement the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) provisions enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The IFR takes effect immediately and invites public comment through late December 2025.

The rule aligns DOE's loan guarantee regulations with recent statutory amendments to Section 1706 that the authority originally established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and subsequently expanded under OBBB. Collectively, these changes mark one of the most significant evolutions of the Title XVII program since its creation in 2005.

Key Changes to DOE's Loan Guarantee Program

Expanded Scope of Eligible Projects

DOE introduces the term ""energy dominance financing project"" and broadens the definition of ""energy infrastructure"" to include activities across the energy and critical minerals value chain – from identification and leasing to production, processing, transportation, refining and generation.

In practical terms, this expansion could now cover projects such as:

upgrades or capacity expansions at operating natural gas or coal plants to enhance reliability or extend usable life

critical minerals extraction, refining or midstream processing facilities that strengthen U.S. supply chains

grid-scale storage and generation projects that ensure forecastable power delivery during peak or reliability-critical intervals

This represents a major shift from prior language that limited eligibility largely to power generation, transmission and fossil fuel infrastructure.

Revised Eligibility Criteria Under Section 1706

An EDF project may now qualify if it:

retools, repowers, repurposes or replaces energy infrastructure that has ceased operations

enables operating infrastructure to increase capacity or output

supports or enables provision of known or forecastable electric supply at intervals needed to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs

This shift formally replaces the prior requirement that projects ""avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester"" greenhouse gas emissions – codifying OBBB's move from emissions-driven criteria toward reliability, capacity and energy security objectives.

Streamlined Application Requirements

The IFR eliminates the requirement that applicants submit an analysis of how their projects will ""engage with and affect associated communities."" For electric utilities, however, DOE retains the requirement to provide an assurance that the financial benefit of any loan guarantee will be passed on to customers or associated communities.

Treatment of Applicants in Process

DOE confirms that provisions of loan guarantee regulations not amended by OBBB remain in full force and effect. This allows the DOE to continue processing existing applications already in the pipeline under prior Section 1706 guidance and expand eligibility for new applicants under the updated framework.

Policy Context and Practical Implications

The IFR effectively synchronizes the post-OBBB statutory changes with DOE's existing loan guarantee framework. The cumulative effect is a material expansion in the types of projects that may qualify for financing – particularly those tied to domestic resource development, critical minerals and grid reliability.

Broader Project Mix. The rule explicitly opens the door to upstream and midstream energy projects, including those that enable critical mineral production or enhance system adequacy.

Reliability Focus. DOE's addition of ""forecastable electric supply"" reflects the Trump Administration's emphasis on firm, dispatchable capacity and grid reliability.

Immediate Effect. As an interim final rule, the changes take effect while DOE solicits public comment – allowing current applicants to move forward under the updated framework.

Unchanged Credit Standards. While the range of eligible projects has expanded, DOE emphasizes that its requirement for a ""reasonable prospect of repayment"" remains unchanged.

Program Capacity. The IFR confirms that Section 1706 authorizes up to $250 billion in total loan guarantees through Sept. 30, 2028 – a cap originally established under the IRA and maintained under the OBBB. OBBB provides $1 billion in new appropriations to cover credit subsidy and administrative costs, which is estimated to support roughly $200 billion in additional project financing. Actual lending capacity will ultimately rely on the Trump Administration's continued support for LPO operations and maintenance of a full complement of underwriting and technical staff.

Recommended Next Steps for Applicants

Reassess Project Eligibility. Review ongoing and planned applications under the expanded Section 1706 criteria, particularly capacity expansions, reliability-focused generation and critical minerals infrastructure.

Prepare Documentation Updates. Align Part I and Part II materials to reflect the new EDF terminology and eligibility framework.

Consider Commenting. Stakeholders may wish to address definitional clarity around ""forecastable supply,"" treatment of partial facility uprates or examples of qualifying minerals projects.

“EPA continues to work to fulfill our statutory obligations, emergency response efforts, and Administration priorities,” the spokesperson added.
“Despite the Democrat shutdown, EPA maintains essential operations because we are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans.
Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.” The spokesperson added that the agency is operating according to its shutdown plan, under which 89 percent of the agency’s staff was slated for furlough.
The shutdown plan states that issuance of “permits, guidance, regulations, and policies” will cease unless they are “necessary for exempted or excepted activities.”","The government shutdown isn’t stopping the Trump administration from advancing its policy priorities, especially when it comes to fossil fuels.

When it announced its contingency plans for the shutdown, the Bureau of Land Management said staff members in charge of processing leases and permits for oil and gas, leases for coal or “other energy and mineral resources necessary for energy production” would still have to work.

Since that time, it has continued to approve drilling permits. Between Oct. 1 and Wednesday, the bureau approved 474 permits to drill on public lands.

That figure is fairly in line with previous months when the government was open, with 494 permits approved in August and 505 in September.

Interior Secretary Burgum said during a recent event that the administration is scrounging up funding wherever it can to pay people for activities such as approving permits.

“Whether it’s a an entrance fee at a park, I’ve got nobody out there to collect that, whether it’s getting permits done, we’re grabbing any cash that was laying in any drawer to try to pay those essential people, including the people that can do the permitting, so that we can keep going,” Burgum said last week during an event at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

“We’re on a track way ahead of last year in terms of permitting, and whether it’s permitting, timber, grazing, oil and gas, infrastructure, easements … if it crosses federal land, we’re trying to do everything we can to not be handicapped,” he added.

Interior Department spokesperson Kristen Peters said in an email that drilling permits were being processed “using associated filing fees.”

She added that the Bureau of Land Management “collects a non-refundable processing fee when an oil and gas operator submits” a permit application.

At the same time, Burgum mused that the government may also consider further layoffs as a result of the funding lapse. The Trump administration has broadly sought to lay off workers and shrink the size of the government, though mid-shutdown reductions in force have been halted by the courts.

“What all of us are doing in the Cabinet is taking a hard look at, ‘Wow, maybe we actually don’t need all of these resources,’” Burgum said while criticizing Democrats amid the ongoing shutdown.

“So maybe they’re actually helping us get to the point where we can say, ‘We don’t need as many people; we don’t need as much cost.’”

Interior in particular has sought to keep the Trump administration’s fossil fuel agenda moving forward, even as the shutdown hampers other government services.

The contingency plan from the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under Interior, says it is keeping some staffers on in order to “address the National Energy Emergency.”

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s plan, meanwhile, states that it will have employees available “to work on priority conventional energy projects.” The term “conventional energy” typically refers to fossil fuels.

These priority projects include preparing the administration’s plan for offshore drilling for the years ahead, as well as “preparation for the anticipated calendar year 2026 offshore critical mineral lease sales and oil and gas development plans.”

While offshore minerals mining has never been done at a large scale, the White House has directed Interior to set up a program for mining the ocean floor. The plan indicates that the administration plans to auction off those mining rights next year.

When the shutdown plans were announced, Interior said on social media that it would “ensure permitting and other efforts related to American Energy Dominance are continued.”

Critics argue the government should not be continuing to fund fossil fuel approvals while cutting back essential services.

“They can’t find money for SNAP benefits, but they can find money to keep permitting oil and gas drilling. That’s the priorities for this administration right now,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, which has published its own tracker of the administration’s approved permits.

President Trump has expressed a fondness for fossil fuels and antipathy toward renewables, particularly repeating his intention to “drill, baby drill.”

Meanwhile, Interior may not be alone.

The New York Times has reported that at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), staffers are working on a plan that would loosen restrictions on coal plants’ mercury releases.

According to Bloomberg Law, a key EPA official said last week that staffers with jobs related to chemicals are still working during the shutdown.

“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations & Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” an EPA spokesperson said in an email.

“EPA continues to work to fulfill our statutory obligations, emergency response efforts, and Administration priorities,” the spokesperson added. “Despite the Democrat shutdown, EPA maintains essential operations because we are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans. Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.”

The spokesperson added that the agency is operating according to its shutdown plan, under which 89 percent of the agency’s staff was slated for furlough.

America’s industrial map is shifting. As major players push outward from urban cores in search of land, labor and logistics advantages, EV plants, data centers and more are landing in counties originally built for farming and small manufacturing, creating thousands of jobs overnight. These markets weren’t designed for this scale of growth, which is why vacancy swings, rent spikes and infrastructure gaps are already showing up. In the following nine markets – from Lafayette, Indiana to Columbus, Georgia – the story is the same: there’s a pressing need for multifamily housing, retail, healthcare, education and recreation infrastructure. The window for early entrants is closing fast and for investors, developers and local leaders, the time to act is now.

Lafayette, Indiana

Lafayette is a prime example of a market where housing demand has far outstripped supply. Driven by its proximity to Purdue University and a growing manufacturing sector, the city has demonstrated some of the strongest multifamily fundamentals in the nation.

Housing Shortage: In 2025, the market posted a multifamily occupancy rate of 98%, one of the highest in the U.S. This signals an extremely tight rental environment for new and existing residents, especially students.

Established Employers: Major industrial and manufacturing employers include Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Caterpillar, Wabash and Arconic.

The Opportunity: With a 276% year-over-year jump in average price per unit, Lafayette shows clear unmet demand. Developers have a rare chance to deliver much-needed rental housing, while adding retail and service providers to support the growing workforce and student population.

“Based on my experience as a Purdue student from 2018 to 2022, housing shortage was and still is a major problem in West Lafayette and Lafayette. Purdue continues to accept more students than the year before, causing overcrowding and forcing more students to live off campus. With limited student housing, there have been major changes in the area over the past couple of years. Many retail buildings have been torn down to make room for new multifamily developments in West Lafayette. For example, construction began a few months ago on The Standard at West Lafayette, a 678-bed development adjacent to the Purdue campus. I think we’ll continue to see much needed investments in the multifamily market across West Lafayette and Lafayette to keep up with Purdue enrollment.”

Liberty Gaughan, Senior Communications Specialist

Reno, Nevada

The ""Biggest Little City in the World"" has transformed into a major technology and manufacturing hub, largely thanks to one anchor tenant. This rapid industrialization has created a severe housing deficit that the market is still struggling to correct.

Housing Shortage: Since Tesla announced its Gigafactory, Reno has faced a surge of incoming workers that pushed vacancy to historic lows. Even as new supply hit in 2024 – briefly pushing overall vacancy into the low double-digits – stabilized communities quickly absorbed demand and tightened back toward 3%.

Established Employers: The market is anchored by the Tesla Gigafactory and includes major operations for Panasonic, Apple and Switch Data Centers, among others.

The Opportunity: Reno's growth has spurred demand for not just housing but also for advanced manufacturing suppliers and logistics services. The city has been underserved due to its previous reliance on tourism and gaming. Now, there is a clear need for sustained development of multifamily, build-to-rent communities and supporting commercial real estate.

Fayette County, Ohio

Once a quiet agricultural community, Fayette County is at the epicenter of Ohio's industrial boom. Massive investments are set to bring thousands of jobs, but the local infrastructure is unprepared for the coming population surge.

Housing Shortage: A 2023 housing study revealed a need for nearly 1,400 new housing units by 2033 to support the incoming workforce, with a significant gap in rental options. While some new projects are underway, most of the current housing stock is older, with limited availability.

Established Employers: The county will be home to a new LG Energy Solution EV Battery Plant and an Amazon Web Services data center campus, alongside existing distribution centers for Walmart, Lowe’s and McKesson.

The Opportunity: Situated along the I-71 corridor between Columbus and Cincinnati, the county is a strategic logistics hub. The immediate and projected need for workforce housing, single-family homes, retail, restaurants and expanded medical facilities presents a ground-floor opportunity for developers and investors.

“As a resident of Fayette County, it’s exciting to see how much opportunity these new industrial tenants are bringing to the local community. While our housing options and commercial infrastructure can’t yet accommodate an influx of new residents, local developers and investors, along with city and county leaders, are committed to revitalizing downtown areas, supporting new housing developments, and enhancing community amenities, making this a great place to live and work.”

Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina

This South Carolina region, known as ""The Upstate,"" has become a powerhouse in advanced manufacturing, particularly in the automotive and aerospace sectors. Its strategic location and business-friendly climate have attracted global companies, creating thousands of jobs.

Housing Shortage: In 2024, new deliveries totaling more than 1,300 units caused a slight dip in occupancy, but many submarkets continue to see mid-90% occupancy even as broader vacancy rests in the 5% to 6% range. Demand still outpaces supply in key corridors.

Established Employers: The market is dominated by BMW's largest global manufacturing plant, Michelin North America's headquarters, GE Power and a vast network of automotive suppliers.

The Opportunity: Located halfway between Atlanta and Charlotte, the region is a critical logistics node. Past development has not kept pace with its economic expansion. Investors and developers can capitalize on the need for all classes of multifamily housing, industrial spec buildings for suppliers and neighborhood retail centers.

“Working deals across the Upstate for the past decade, I’ve never seen industrial momentum translate this fast into everyday demand. BMW’s ongoing expansion and a steady stream of suppliers are continuing to fuel population growth, but apartments and housing in the strongest corridors are effectively full and new deliveries haven’t relieved pressure evenly. Retail and restaurant options lag new rooftops, and traffic congestion is outpacing road improvements along key commuter routes. Greenville has an opportunity to address these challenges by meeting workers where they are – with affordable rents, build-to-rent options, retailers that serve shift workers and improved infrastructure. We need to better align development plans with hiring timelines to stay ahead of the local need.”

Eric Liebich, Managing Director of Investment Sales

Sioux Falls, South Dakota

With a robust economy centered on financial services, healthcare and agribusiness, Sioux Falls is a regional economic engine. Its steady growth has created a quiet but persistent housing crunch that presents a clear opportunity.

Housing Shortage: The city's vacancy rate for apartments has historically stayed below the 5% mark that’s considered healthy, often dipping lower. Following a flood of new construction delivered in early 2025, vacancy spiked to nearly 10%, but six months later, the market had absorbed enough to drop the vacancy rate back to 5.4%. Local housing studies have repeatedly called for thousands of new units across all income levels to meet demand.

Established Employers: Major employers include Sanford Health, Avera Health, Wells Fargo and Smithfield Foods. The city is also a growing hub for data centers and bioprocessing.

The Opportunity: Sioux Falls has been underserved because it is not on the radar of most national developers. However, its stable employment base and strong population growth create a low-risk environment for multifamily and commercial development. The need for new housing, particularly for healthcare and finance professionals, is severe.

Boise, Idaho

Boise has evolved from a quiet state capital into a burgeoning tech and healthcare hub. Its high quality of life and business-friendly environment have attracted a wave of new residents and corporate investments, straining its housing market.

Housing Shortage: Boise faces one of the nation’s most severe housing shortfalls, needing about 2,000 new units annually. Currently, completions trail that pace, and vacancy sits near 4.5%. Home prices and rents have escalated rapidly over the past five years, and competition for available apartments remains intense.

Established Employers: Key employers driving growth include semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology, St. Luke's Health System and multiple Amazon fulfillment and delivery centers.

The Opportunity: Historically viewed as a tertiary market, Boise's infrastructure is now playing catch-up. The demand for tech talent and healthcare professionals fuels a continuous need for modern apartments, medical office buildings and lifestyle-oriented retail. This creates a durable, long-term investment horizon.

“Boise’s growth as a tech, healthcare and advanced manufacturing hub has reshaped demand for retail real estate across the metro. Population growth has outpaced both housing and retail development, making well-located shopping centers with essential and service-oriented tenants increasingly important to the community. Vacancy remains tight and new supply limited, supporting rents and investor confidence. While construction costs and zoning constraints pose challenges, the Treasure Valley’s continued expansion creates strong long-term opportunities for retail development and reinvestment.”

Michael Federico, Senior Associate of Investment Sales

Florence, Alabama

Located in a region known as ""The Shoals,"" Florence is part of an emerging corridor for advanced manufacturing and automotive suppliers. The area's affordability and growing job base are attracting new residents, but the housing market hasn't kept up.

Housing Shortage: The residential vacancy rate in Florence has compressed steadily in recent years, falling from 12.4% in 2021 to 8% in 2023. Currently, the Shoals area has a limited inventory of modern rental housing, with most existing stock being older. As new manufacturing plants, like North American Lighting, expand, the demand for apartments and single-family homes continues to rise sharply.

Established Employers: Key industrial employers in the region include North American Lighting, Constellium and freight logistics companies serving the automotive sector.

The Opportunity: The Shoals region has been historically underserved due to its rural location. However, its strategic position within the Southern automotive manufacturing belt makes it increasingly vital. Developers have the chance to be first-movers in providing new multifamily, retail and hospitality options to support the area's industrial renaissance.

Pueblo County, Colorado

Long known as a steel town, Pueblo is reinventing itself as a hub for renewable energy and advanced manufacturing. As it attracts new industries and residents seeking a more affordable alternative to Denver and Colorado Springs, its housing and service infrastructure is being tested.

Housing Shortage: Pueblo’s vacancy rate spiked to nearly 10% in 2023 before easing back to 5.6% by mid-2024. Despite the recent correction, supply remains thin relative to demand as new manufacturing and renewable energy jobs continue to arrive.

Established Employers: CS Wind, the world's largest wind tower manufacturer, and Trane Technologies are major industrial anchors. The city is also a key rail hub for BNSF and Union Pacific.

The Opportunity: Pueblo benefits from significant state and federal incentives for renewable energy manufacturing. It was historically an industrial town that faced economic decline, but this new wave of investment is creating a second life. The opportunity lies in building modern workforce housing, revitalizing downtown commercial spaces and developing retail to support a new generation of workers.

“As a Denver resident who tracks growth along the Front Range, Pueblo feels like the next domino. You can see the momentum from new manufacturing and clean energy projects, but housing and neighborhood services are still playing catch-up. If we align infrastructure and fast-track workforce housing now, Pueblo can absorb the spillover without pricing out locals.”

Amy Ward, Senior Vice President & Director of Investment Sales Business Transformation

Columbus, Georgia

Anchored by a major military installation and a growing manufacturing base, Columbus is a market where demand is steadily rising against a backdrop of limited new supply. This dynamic creates a compelling case for new development.

Housing Shortage: Multifamily pricing has climbed sharply, with recent comps showing an 86% year-over-year jump in average price per unit. That spike reflects how limited new supply has left investors bidding aggressively to enter the market.

Established Employers: The city is home to Fort Benning, Aflac's global headquarters, Pratt & Whitney and numerous financial services companies.

The Opportunity: Columbus's growth is driven by the stable economic impact of the military and the expansion of its financial and aerospace sectors. For years, it was overlooked by institutional investors, but its strong fundamentals now signal a market ripe for new multifamily projects and retail to serve military families and corporate employees.

Treat Growth Like a Supply Chain

These markets are not just industrial success stories – they are communities on the brink of transformation. Investors winning in these markets are underwriting them like supply chains – not headlines.

Start with anchors and employee draw area: Map the top employers, their 30–60-minute commute sheds, and where first shift vs. third shift labor will live.

Underwrite movement, not averages: Include commute maps, permitting timelines, school capacity and utility lead times in your pro forma. Model to the first 1,000 hires.

Control the chokepoints: Tie up land near logistics spines (interstates, intermodal, last-mile corridors) and health campuses where daily trips are heaviest.

Stack formats for resiliency: Pair garden and mid-rise multifamily with build-to-rent and small-format retail that serves shift workers, childcare, quick-serve and basic services.

Coordinate directly with major employers: Ask them to help fill units, connect you to new hires and support shuttle or transit links. Where it makes sense, sign a block of units to the employer for key roles or shift workers.

Explore incentives and cost-sharing early: Work with city, county and local economic development leads to understand infrastructure cost participation options (roads, utilities, turn lanes), entitlement fast-tracks and impact fee reductions or offsets tied to workforce housing.

Stage the work to move faster: Begin vertical construction as infrastructure work continues. Deliver apartments before the next big round of hiring, not after prices reset.

For developers, investors and local leaders, the mandate is clear: invest now to build the infrastructure that will support tomorrow’s workforce and families. Lock in sites, align public-private partnerships and deliver housing and services on the same timeline as employer ramp-ups. Those who treat these cities like supply chains will capture absorption, stabilize faster and own the market before pricing resets.",https://www.northmarq.com/themes/custom/northmarq/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-30 12:07:39.584148

Full transcript - Enbridge Inc (ENB) Q2 2025:

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Good morning and welcome to the Enbridge Inc. Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Rebecca Morley and I’m the Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance. Joining me this morning are Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the heads of each of our business units: Colin Gruending, Liquids Pipelines; Cynthia Hansen, Gas Transmission; Michele Harradence, Gas Distribution and Storage; and Matthew Akman, Renewable Power. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session for the investment community. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press Star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, you press the pound key. Please note this conference is being recorded as per usual.

This call is being webcast and I encourage those listening on the phone to follow along with the supporting slides. We’ll try to keep the call to roughly one hour and in order to answer as many questions as possible, we will be limiting questions to one plus a single follow-up if necessary. We’ll be prioritizing questions from the investment community, so if you are a member of the media, please direct your inquiries to our communications team who will be happy to respond. As always, our investor relations team will be available following the call for any follow-up questions. On to slide two where I will remind you that we will be referring to forward-looking information on today’s presentation and Q&A.

By its nature, this information contains forecast assumptions and expectations about future outcomes which are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined here and discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings. We’ll also be referring to non-GAAP measures summarized below and with that I’ll turn it over to Greg Ebel.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you very much, Rebecca, and good morning. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. I’m excited to share another strong quarter and highlight the progress we’ve made across all segments of our business. Last quarter I spoke about the importance of continued dialogue with policymakers and regulators to ensure North American energy independence and security. I’m optimistic about our ongoing conversations and the alignment we’re seeing today on both sides of the border to advance projects and legislation that serve growing energy demand, and Enbridge Inc. continues to be in a great position to serve this growing demand with its large incumbent footprint across all four business units. We’re going to start today with a mid-year check-in on financial performance, execution, and an update on our growth projects. I’ll walk through how Enbridge Inc. is effectively navigating trade conflict, legislative change, and geopolitical volatility.

I’ll then touch on how Enbridge Inc. is capitalizing on rising power demand in North America before providing an update on each of our four core franchises. Pat will then review our financial results and reiterate our capital allocation priorities. Lastly, I’ll close the presentation with a few comments on our First Choice value proposition before we open the call for your questions. We’ve made significant progress on the commitments we laid out for you at the start of the year, and I’m proud of the work the team has done to execute our financial, operational, and growth priorities. We set another record for second quarter EBITDA, driven primarily by contributions from the acquired U.S. gas utilities and successful rate settlements in our Gas Transmission and Midstream business.

Our strong first half of 2025 gives us confidence that we’ll finish the year in the upper end of our EBITDA guidance range, and we are well on track to meet our DCF per share midpoint. The balance sheet is also in great shape. As of June 30, we’re at 4.7 times debt-to-EBITDA, primarily due to realizing another full quarter of earnings from the U.S. gas utility acquisitions that closed throughout 2024. Our assets remained highly utilized during the quarter, and the Mainline transported 3 million barrels per day. That system has now been in apportionment for six of the first eight months of the year, including July and August. We closed an investment on our West Coast System by a consortium of 38 Indigenous groups, backed by a loan guarantee provided by the Canadian government.

This partnership provides sustained economic benefits to First Nations and is aligned with Enbridge’s continuous goal of recycling capital at attractive valuations for shareholders. We also closed the previously announced acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline in the Permian and upsized the Traverse Pipeline project from 1.75 bcf per day to 2.5 bcf per day, driven by strong customer demand. As a reminder, the Traverse Pipeline is part of the Whistler JV and is designed to transport natural gas between Agua Dulce and the Katy area in Texas. Work on our planned Liquids Mainline optimizations is ongoing, and we’re pleased to announce that our recent 100,000 barrel per day open season on Flanagan South pipeline was oversubscribed. We expect to reach FID on the first phase of the Mainline optimization later this year.

On the growth front, we sanctioned the $900 million Clear Fork Solar project in Texas, located just outside San Antonio. The project is fully contracted under a long-term operation offtake agreement with Meta Platforms and will support its data center operations. Meta Platforms represents a new addition to our growing list of AI-related and data center customers in Gas Transmission. We sanctioned expansions of Texas Eastern and Aiken Creek gas storage to serve growing industrial, power, and LNG demand across North America. Together, these renewable and gas projects highlight the competitive advantage of our all-of-the-above approach and our ability to serve increasing natural gas and power demand through multiple business units, services, and geographies. Now let’s touch on the stability Enbridge continues to offer investors despite the ongoing volatility we are seeing today.

The markets have been turbulent thus far in 2025, but the volatility has really showcased Enbridge’s stable business model and the value of our low-risk commercial frameworks. Our size, diversity, and disciplined capital allocation put us in a great position to deliver predictable returns to shareholders in these conditions. Our exposure to tariffs is negligible across our operations, and importantly, Canadian oil and gas delivered to the U.S. via our systems has not attracted tariffs. Roughly 80% of our EBITDA is generated by assets with revenue inflators or regulatory mechanisms for recovering rising costs, which helps to backstop our ratable and growing dividend and earnings. On the tax policy front, the extension of bonus depreciation provides benefits to Enbridge’s near-term growth, and our sanctioned or late-stage renewable projects are not expected to be impacted negatively by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The second quarter saw continued price volatility across commodity markets driven by geopolitical instability. Enbridge’s low-risk business model protected us from those dynamics with virtually no exposure to commodity prices and over 98% of EBITDA generated by assets with regulated returns or long-term take-or-pay contracts. Lastly, our footprint puts us in an ideal position to capitalize on growing energy demand in North America and beyond. We are connected to 100% of Gulf Coast operating LNG export capacity, and our natural gas systems are located within 50 miles of 29 new data centers, 78 coal plants, and 45% of all North American natural gas power generation. Our gas distribution franchise is the largest natural gas utility business in North America, and we deliver reliable natural gas to over 7 million customers every day in geographies with growing gas demand in a crude market.

Our incumbency positions us as the leading operator to provide new and expanded egress options for customers, something both producers and policymakers are in fact seeking. Our renewable power business is opportunistically providing power to some of the largest AI and data center players in the world. As the demand for energy across North America continues to grow, let’s take a couple of minutes to spotlight some of the investments we’re making related to growing power demand. As you can see from this slide, Enbridge has already won and will continue to win power demand-related opportunities by deploying our all-of-the-above approach to energy in order to serve blue-chip customers across various sectors. During our Investor Day in March, we shared $4 billion to $5 billion of near-term power generation opportunities across our gas and renewable businesses that we expected to begin announcing within six months.

I’m pleased to say that we’re ahead of schedule with over $1 billion of recently sanctioned projects between Clear Fork Solar in Texas and the Line 3 expansion in Mississippi. In addition, we can now confirm that Texas Eastern will be interconnected to the Homer City Redevelopment Generating Facility in Pennsylvania. We are working to commercialize opportunities to support data centers and hyperscalers in the U.S. Further adding to our growth backlog, we’ve recently completed milestone projects for solar power backed by PPAs with Amazon and AT&T and continue to advance over $5 billion of power demand projects serving a combined 6 gigawatts of new generation. With that being said, we can’t forget about the progress we’re making across various exciting opportunities in our liquids business, which I’ll get into now.

Mainline volumes were strong again this quarter, delivering 3 million barrels per day on average for the quarter and 3.1 million barrels per day for the first half of 2025. At Investor Day, we announced up to $2 billion of investment in the Mainline through 2028 to support continued high utilization of the system while also extending asset life and reliability. That investment is now underway and we will earn attractive returns within the MTS agreement collar of 11% to 14.5%. We also continue to advance Mainline optimization phase one. Our full path FSP open season was oversubscribed and the team is now working towards finding the 150,000 barrel per day Mainline expansion later this year.

Additionally, we launched an open season for the Southern Illinois Connector, which will leverage our existing footprint and our interest in the ETCOP pipeline to provide full path optionality for our customers serving additional U.S. Gulf Coast demand. Mainline investments of this nature are permit light, provide attractive economics, and will be sanctioned to meet our customers’ increasing egress requirements. Lastly, down on the Gulf Coast, our 120,000 barrel per day Grey Oak expansion has partially entered service with full COD expected in mid-2026. Now let’s turn to Gas Transmission. We’ve got a number of exciting announcements this quarter spread out across our footprint in Mississippi. We sanctioned the Line 31 expansion of Texas Eastern to serve rising industrial and power demand, all secured under 20-year take or pay agreements with a well-known investment grade customer.

This project was among the opportunities highlighted at Investor Day to serve growing gas demand on the Gulf Coast. We’ve progressed optimization projects including a $50 million expansion of SESH to serve the growing power generation needs of a major electric utility that’s there serving data centers as well as an upgrade to the Trace Palac’s storage facility in Texas. This storage upgrade is being done to increase injection and withdrawal rates and is part of a larger expansion opportunity we expect to realize later in the decade in Canadian gas transmission. I’m pleased to announce a 40 BCF expansion of the Aiken Creek storage facility that will support the growing Canadian LNG market. That project will also optimize our other expansion underway on the West Coast System, providing customers with critical flexibility in a rapidly developing region, particularly on the LNG front.

Lastly, we are updating our capital investment for Woodfibre. As a reminder, Enbridge Inc. has a contract structure that provides us the ability to earn a low double digit return and we will now set that rate closer to the in service date. We remain excited about the growing LNG market in Western Canada as all of these projects are expected to enter service in the 2027-2029 time period, extending and adding visibility to our long term growth outlook. Now let’s move on to our Gas Distribution and Storage business. We remain excited about the long term growth outlook for our utility business and the foundational growth that helps to support the dividend. In Ontario the phase two rebasing process was completed setting rates through 2028 and in Ohio we received a decision on the rate case filed in 2023.

While we didn’t get all that we asked for, I’m encouraged by the almost 10% ROE and increased equity thickness which remains among the strongest returns within our utility franchise. Of note, existing capital riders are a great and continuing feature ensuring quick cycle capital returns which was part of what attracted us to the investment back in 2023. Lastly, we filed for new rates in North Carolina and Utah this quarter and expect we’ll have new rates in those jurisdictions by next year. Now I’ll turn to the Renewable Power sector. Enbridge Inc. continues to advance its world class renewable portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach and construction expertise under a low risk commercial model that delivers competitive returns. In July we announced the Clear Fork Solar project near San Antonio, Texas, a 600 megawatt facility that will support data center needs.

All generation is sold under a long-term offtake agreement with Meta Platforms, and importantly, the project is expected to meet all the requirements to fully qualify for renewable tax credits under new U.S. legislation. Also in Texas, we are progressing the 815 megawatt Sequoia solar development. The project is on track to partially enter service in 2025, with full production coming online in 2026. Also of importance, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is not expected to impact any of our sanctioned projects. We will continue to monitor future developments. In this fast-moving policy environment, it’s our view that the recent U.S. legislative changes make our backlog of late-stage development projects even more valuable. Now I’ll pass it off to Pat to go over our financial performance.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks Greg and welcome everyone. Strong utilization across our asset base has led to another solid quarter. We’re posting record second quarter EBITDA despite continued trade uncertainty and geopolitical events. Compared to the second quarter of 2024, adjusted EBITDA is up 7%. Earnings per share up 12% while DCF per share is comparable. In our Liquids segment, we saw strong volumes with the Mainline transporting 3 million barrels per day, although weaker results at Flanagan South and Spearhead resulted in a slight decrease compared to 2024. In Gas Transmission, strong operational performance across our pipes and storage assets in addition to revised rates on U.S. Gas Transmission assets added to the segment year over year. Our Whistler JV and DBR system acquisitions, in addition to Venice Extension entering service at the end of 2024, provided additional contributions.

Gas Distribution is up relative to last year with the acquisitions of the U.S. gas utilities being the main driver. Higher rates, customers, and storage revenues at Enbridge Gas Ontario in addition to the colder weather also contribute to the strong results within the segment. In Renewables, we saw lower contributions at our European offshore assets which were partially offset by stronger wind resources in North America. For DCF per share and EPS, higher financing costs, current taxes, and maintenance capital primarily driven by the U.S. gas utilities acquisition partially offset the higher EBITDA contributions. The per share metrics are of course impacted by the at-the-market issuances that were completed in the second quarter of 2024 to pre-fund the U.S. utility. I’m pleased to reaffirm our 2025 guidance and growth outlook across all metrics.

With our strong performance through the first half of 2025, we’re in a great position to finish the year in the upper end of our guidance range for EBITDA. The resilience of our business model is really on display as we continue to deliver predictable returns through market volatility. The acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express, strong Mainline volumes, and the strength of the U.S.-CAD exchange rate are all tailwinds to our full year guidance but are partially offset by higher than expected U.S. interest rates. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our near term and medium term growth outlooks. Now let’s touch base on our capital allocation priorities. As you would expect, we continue to be focused on disciplined capital allocation.

Our balance sheet provides us with financial strength and flexibility, and our debt-to-EBITDA has decreased to below the midpoint of our target range over the past few quarters, as expected. Following the close of the U.S. Gas utility acquisitions, we also extended our track record of recycling capital at attractive valuations. The investment by our First Nation partners in a 12.5% stake in the West Coast System, which closed in July, generated cash proceeds of $0.7 billion and demonstrated our ongoing commitment to economic reconciliation and partnership with Indigenous communities. One of the keys to our value proposition is to sustainably return capital to shareholders, and we prioritize being in the 60% to 70% range of DCF payout. Our dividend is underpinned by high-quality, low-risk cash flow growth and continues to support our dividend aristocrat status.

As a reminder, we’ve increased our dividend to shareholders for 30 consecutive years, and we expect to return approximately $40 to $45 billion over the next five years. In terms of further growth, we will continue to make disciplined investment decisions and prioritize low-multiple brownfield and utility-like projects with our $9 to $10 billion of annual investment capacity. What I especially like about this quarter is that we’ve announced or made significant progress on opportunities in each of our four business units, and those opportunities are spread throughout the end of the decade, adding even more clarity to our growth plans. With that, I’ll pass it back to Greg for some closing remarks.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you very much, Ted. As you’ve just heard, it’s been another strong showing from all the teams this quarter. Enbridge is ideally positioned to deliver predictable results through virtually all economic conditions and cycles. Our low-risk business continues to prove its value to shareholders, as evidenced by the consistency of our cash flows and earnings growth. This year marks our 30th consecutive annual dividend increase, supported by our business model. We’ve also secured high-quality and sustainable growth via our now $32 billion secured capital program, adding visibility to our expected 5% growth through the end of the decade. We will continue to evaluate accretive tuck-ins and tax-efficient investment opportunities that fit within our wheelhouse to diligently ensure lasting returns to shareholders. I would like to thank you all for listening. Operator, please open the line for questions.

Speaker 2: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press Star one again. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Hi, good morning.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Morning Jeremy.

Speaker 2: Just wondered if you might be able to frame a little bit more, I guess, opportunities you’re seeing across your footprint as it relates to natural gas expansion to serve incremental power demand and, you know, possibly data center demand growth as well. We’ve seen news coming out, you know, Pennsylvania Energy Innovation Summit, a lot going on in Ohio as well. I think the slides reference other opportunities across your footprint such as in the West. I was just wondering if you could frame a bit more the opportunity set where you see it most across the portfolio and, I guess, you know, timeline to new projects materializing. Do you see this kind of near term or just kind of steady cadence over time?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Jeremy, maybe I’ll start and then Cynthia can chime in too and maybe even, I know, not on the gas side but maybe Matthew too. It’s really all of the above. We in the Gas Distribution and Storage business and the Gas Transmission and Midstream business and our Renewable Power business. I was at that technology and economic summit you were talking about in Pennsylvania, and obviously out of that came a press release of a big player using the Texas Eastern system to support Homer City in North Carolina and Mississippi and Georgia we talked about on this call, Utah, all of those. We’re really starting to see things come in. I guess the point I would make there is two elements here. There’s one utility element, which I would say is most of where we’re picking up the opportunities.

You heard us talk about Line 3 just a few minutes ago as well as SESH, very much utility based. There’s a nice smattering of behind the meter type stuff, which is what Homer City would look like. Let’s not forget about the renewable side. I know you’re asking about gas, so it’s right across the system. Haven’t seen that much in Canada yet, but I think that’s actually an opportunity that’ll come too. Cynthia, do you want to add more from what we had laid out back at the investor day?

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I’ll just build on what you said, Greg. If we look at what we said at Investor Day, we have just on the Gas Transmission side, 35 plus opportunities to 11 Bcf of gas, about, you know, $4 billion, $1 to $2 billion of that in that late stage development. Right now we have 10 plus specific data center opportunities in that late stage. Of course, we’re located, you know, next to the natural gas generation. 45% of all natural gas power generation is within 50 miles of our system, and within that area too, that 50 miles, there’s 29 new data centers. Of course, we still have the opportunities for coal to gas conversions. There are 78 coal plants in that area. That’s about 80 GW of current power generation. What I would say is we’re seeing opportunities across the system in the U.S.

in particular, and that’s not to discount the opportunities we have on the natural gas side along the U.S. Gulf Coast to serve LNG. We still see lots of opportunities there. In Canada, we’ve done lots of expansions, and as was noted with the storage at Aiken Creek, that’s going to serve more LNG opportunities. Last quarter we had announced our Birch Grove expansion too. We continue to see a lot of opportunities. Jeremy.

Speaker 2: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you for that. I just want to pivot to wood fiber if you could, if we could provide a little bit more detail on some of the drivers in the higher cost expectations there, as well as maybe just if any more detail to share. It seems like you still have the ability to earn a low double digit return, but any color incremental on those two points would be helpful. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, for sure, Jeremy. You know, we are never that pleased when we see more capital than we originally planned. However, with wood fiber, as you mentioned, our contract structure does allow us to earn that double-digit return on capital as we agree to invest in a project. Fortunately, and through the agreements with departments, we’re now going to set that toll on the higher capital amount nearer to the project’s in-service. Our partner, which owns 70% of the project, as you probably recall, does take capital cost risk, but they get the benefit of selling the LNG commodity. I think it’s a really good balance of interest there.

My point being, while we’re always really focused on the capital being deployed to the couple of dozen projects we’ve got in execution right across the portfolio, we’re equally focused on the contractual and regulatory structures around that capital to ensure, to the extent possible, that we can make sure we get the return protected should capital costs change, particularly on multi-year projects. I really think that combined focus is serving us well on this project. Now, with respect to capital cost increases, it’s not really one thing. We’ve had some changes in building codes, permitting delays, not a new issue for most jurisdictions. We’re adding additional Flotella, so that’s where we house our employees. That’ll create room for another 900 approximately folks as we get into the heavy builds, and then some site conditions. All those have really added up to this site.

Again, the key is, as you pointed out, our ability to continue to earn that low double-digit return.

Speaker 2: Got it. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks Jeremy.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from a line of Robert Catellier from CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Hi, good morning everyone. I was hoping Greg, you could discuss how you’re seeing energy policy evolving in Canada and if you could compare the prospects of a new pipeline to Tidewater compared to some of the various incremental expansion opportunities that are available in the industry on the Liquids Pipelines side.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I think as you saw us announce today and you’ve really seen us going hard at this since January and last fall, our customers at this point in time really want to go south. That’s the premium market which we’re able to deliver to both PADD 2 and PADD 3, think the Gulf Coast. Colin and his team have really put forward a number of really great incremental projects. You can see those in the presentation. That’s the first move. It’s the most valuable market. It’s the smartest way to do this. When that’s done and as our customer production grows, that’s when an opportunity could be created to go to the West Coast. There’s lots of discussion with governments on that. As you know, Robert, we have been a proponent of such a project in the past and in fact invested several hundred million dollars to get there.

The issue is not one of there being a proponent. The issue is one of government policy setting the conditions for that investment to occur. To be honest, the government has not done that yet and it’s not clear they intend to, at least from our perspective. In particular, still an emissions cap in place for our customers, which really stifles their ability to grow oil production. Secondly, the West Coast tanker ban remains in place. That, frankly, as long as that’s there, would make building a pipeline to the West Coast being a pipeline to nowhere. Nothing’s been deemed in the national interest yet either. Lots for us to watch from an industry perspective. We’re very active on that front, but we’re continuing to find ways to serve our customers’ needs by adding that incremental egress that they really want, which really means the Gulf Coast.

TBD, meanwhile, as you’re seeing south of the border, a lot of changes, accelerated permitting. We even start to see it in changes to the Army Corps of Engineers and a desire to actually build energy sovereignty and project power. Hopefully that’ll translate up here as the government gets its footing. In the meantime, we’ll continue to provide counsel and advice to folks like the Premier of Alberta, who, you know, she continues to work to advance not only the province’s interest, but I actually think Canada’s energy interests and sovereignty via new energy infrastructure.

Speaker 2: That’s a very helpful response. Thank you. I was just curious how the Ohio rate case order impacts your strategy on rate cases in general and the U.S. Franchises and obviously Ohio in particular.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, Michele’s here. I’ll let her go at that. Obviously, regulatory expertise is something we’re very focused on.

Michele Harradence, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. Obviously we were disappointed in the Ohio rate case, but really it’s turning on a couple of, I’d call it, legal and regulatory issues, as Greg mentioned in his opening remarks. At the end of the day, the fact is we still have really strong ROE, amongst the best that you can have. We saw an increase in our equity thickness. We didn’t have any material denials into what we submitted as appropriate O&M. All of the capital that we’ve invested has gone into rate base. We continue to have the strong capital riders that we really liked in Ohio. It’s still a very strong and productive jurisdiction. We do have a couple specific issues that we think there were errors made by the PUC in Ohio, and we filed a rehearing about a week ago, a week ago today on that.

We’re confident in the Ohio utility and we’re certainly confident in its growth. As Louis was mentioning in an earlier question, lots of data centers, lots of generation there, so it’s a good utility. We are in rate cases in all four of our major utilities. As we mentioned, we’re coming to the tail end in Ontario. We would expect to see our results in Utah and North Carolina coming through in the fall. I think the big difference for Utah and North Carolina is their rate cases are a matter of routine. We go every two or three years. It’s really just a question of updating things, having a discussion about what’s the most appropriate levels of return without the 15-year lag that we had in Ohio. That really created a lot of complexity in the Ohio rate case. We’re very confident with North Carolina and Utah.

Good relationships there, transparent work. Things are good.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. If you think back to the acquisition, which we haven’t even had all these clear closed for a year yet, that’ll come up in September. Very consistent results and expectations. As you know, Rob, we’re quite conservative in the way we look at things, and I would say we’ve probably been underestimated. The growth opportunity there right across all the utilities and the regulatory filings and rate cases. That’s standard what we do across all our businesses. Sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don’t. The business continues to drive forward.

Speaker 2: Excellent. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Hey, good morning all. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but can you speak to the Cowboy Solar and Seven Stars projects? I guess I’m just trying to get a sense of if your customers are encouraging you to get these types of projects across the line, given the changing tax credit landscape, and as it relates to other solar projects in your mid-stage development bucket, are there any practical limitations that we should be thinking about in terms of your ability to get more across the line? I guess finally, just given the urgency, do you have the room in your annual investment capacity to get more projects like this done?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I’ll let Matthew kind of jump in here in a second. One thing I would point out is our customer need is driven not just on the renewable side, historically maybe more focused from an ESG perspective. Today the issue is the need for power, all types of power. You definitely see that in the Metas and the AT&Ts and Amazons. Sure, everybody wants to kind of move forward on the sustainability front, but it’s really that need for power. The late stage stuff that we have, we continue to see, if anything, an increase. Matthew, maybe you can speak to that in request for that power.

I think your question, Aaron, if I’m hearing it correctly, really post the projects we have and that are in late stage, all of which can be done within the new legislative changes in the U.S., it’s really after that, the next stage called later in the decade or the end of the decade and beyond without the tax incentives. Will they be attractive? I think that’s a TBD, but it doesn’t prevent the projects that we have in the backlog from moving forward, that’s for sure. If tax incentives aren’t an element of projects on a go forward basis, they’re going to have to compete just like everything else with capital and we’ll see what happens. Macro wise, you could make an argument what you’ll see is power prices go up, which still allows you to make your returns. We’ll see what happens at that time.

Do you want to speak specifically to those two projects, Matthew? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Just to add to what Greg said, we do have some projects in addition to the ones we’ve announced that are late stage and with a very high probability will continue to qualify for the credits. We do see very, very strong customer demand from these blue chip type customers like Meta and we’re very pleased to add them to our roster. These are the types of customers that want to work with Enbridge, not just in our renewable business, but frankly across our gas businesses. As Greg talked about, it’s really a multi platform strategy to satisfy demand for electricity that’s rising rapidly. I think we have visibility to some more of these projects. You mentioned a couple that should qualify, but the key is to be very disciplined in this environment.

It’s very fluid, there’s still some moving parts. The bill was relatively favorable on the tax credit front, but there are still some administrative actions that could occur. We’ll be conservative and opportunistic, but we’ll stick to our very strong capital discipline in Renewable Power, as Greg said. One thing to note on the seven stars that you mentioned, that is actually a Canadian project. The policy in Canada is much more stable and predictable. Right now that’s a wind project in Saskatchewan on Cowboy, we’ll see. It’s a late-stage project, solar project in Wyoming, and again on that one it’ll have to hit our low-risk commercial model and that’s still evolving, frankly. We’ll keep developing those projects, but we’ll be disciplined and low risk in our approach to FID. Aaron, I think your last point was on the capital capacity.

The projects that Matthew has spoken about and the opportunities that we talked about for renewables at Investor Day are very much taken into account in our financial plans. Even with those projects coming forward, remember we always have a couple of billion dollars of incremental capacity we could invest. It’s really not capacity, it’s more investment quality and return relative to what is a plethora of opportunities across the entire business.

Speaker 2: Thanks, that’s a lot of great detail. Maybe just as my follow-up, one point of clarification, you’ve mentioned Homer City a couple times today. Looks like this project’s pretty far along. Can you just give us a sense of timeline to FID, potential capital requirements, returns, in-service date, and any potential gating items?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, Cynthia can chime in here, but to be blunt, no, like I think it is, it’s kind of far along from an announcement perspective. There’s a lot of work here, right? That’s a 4 gigawatt plus project towards the end of the decade. They’re working through getting their gas supply agreements. In principle, there’s a lot of pieces in there. It could be everything from a straight lateral to an expansion of Texas Eastern. Until the customer actually has determined exactly how it wants to deal with that, all I can tell you is we will get our fair share.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, thanks for that, Greg. I would just add that we are in those discussions. These discussions started months ago. It’ll take a little while until we get through that final design and the commitments. As Greg said, we will definitely have opportunity to participate. I would note that Texas Eastern has about 10 BCF per day of underutilized receipt potential in that Marcellus Supply region. We can do some very economical pipeline expansions to serve Pennsylvania and Ohio along our existing right of ways. It’s great, and we have lots of ongoing conversations with developers, power generators, hyperscalers around that area of Pennsylvania and Ohio. More to come and we’ll keep you posted.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. You know, Aaron, I think about this as winning by a lot of singles and maybe the odd double. I think as you would well understand, say a gigawatt plant takes, say, 150 a day gigawatt gas plant, you know, that’s not a massive pipeline, right? You can see that with Line 3. You can see that with the SESH development. It’s a lot of incremental pieces built very economically that add up to a really nice investment. Sometimes I think people are looking for the big splash billion dollar pipeline projects. I think those are going to be few and far between for individual data centers. You got to keep watching these incremental pieces and frankly as investors I think you should.

I’ll do ten $100 million expansions that happen quickly, relatively permanently, probably not cross state even though it may involve interstate pipe all day long versus a big, say, greenfield new billion dollar pipe.

Speaker 2: That’s helpful. Thanks, everyone. I’ll turn it back.

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from a line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I’ll just piggyback off of that question. You’ve talked about obviously a lot of power generation opportunity and things, but so far the announcements on the gas pipeline side, the pace of announcements has been a bit slower compared to peers. You talked about having excess capacity. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why your projects are maybe smaller in size than some of the larger builds that are CapEx projects that we’re seeing. Maybe you could just kind of walk us through the differences here on Texas Eastern versus some of your other competitors. Is it because you have excess capacity? Are you waiting for the right returns? Are there dependencies tied to associated utilities? Just trying to get some more color there.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I think it’s a bit of both. I’m not sure I’d agree with your view that people have actually made more announcements on the other side. I think people talk about stuff. Let’s go down the list. You got a gigawatt and a half, billion dollar projects for TVA that were proceeded with, that’s going ahead in North Carolina. In GDS, there’s 1.4 gigawatts, $600 million plus for a Duke facility in Utah, a couple hundred megawatts plus in Ontario. We’re still pursuing some of those opportunities and then the stuff that we just announced today. I’m not sure I’d be on the same page there. I think some people, that’s maybe all they have. As you know, we’ve got opportunities across multiple businesses on that front.

I don’t know, perhaps you have that, but I’m not aware of anybody else having signed up Amazon, having signed up Meta Platforms, having signed up AT&T on the renewable side. I think it’s an all of the above opportunity for us. I’m a big believer that much of this is actually going to be done with utilities, on the power utilities. You will note that in neither the case in Mississippi or the Sesh project did we announce which utilities. Those are two, and that’s because they’re not really keen on actually indicating exactly what we’re doing on the data center side. I think if you crawl through it, and maybe we can do a better job of communicating that to you, there’s lots of pieces that we’re knocking off.

I think we’re actually ahead of what we said in terms of announcements from the investor day when we talked about the 18 month look forward, of which we’re now, what, four months since that timeframe, and more to come?

Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I mean, just to kind of clarify, I think you’re definitely getting a lot of traction, certainly on the renewable side and on the utility side. I’m not saying there is an exposure to the theme, but it was more just on the gas pipeline side because you have a premier footprint there and you’re kind of in the heart of this, especially with Homer City building. Would have thought there would be more, but like you mentioned, maybe it’s TBD and we’ll definitely stay tuned. Maybe just switching gears for my other question. I mean, you mentioned OBBA and the bonus DDNA provisions there that could benefit near term growth. I guess just from a tax perspective, does that lower your cash tax burden in the near term? When do you now expect to be a meaningful cash taxpayer?

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. I think generally it’s a very positive outcome from the various tax changes, as you said, extension of bonus depreciation, which affects a big portion of our overall business. I think the way to think about it is this further adds help to the fact that we’ll now be able to grow per share kind of in line with our EBITDA guidance. The last few years there’s been a bit of a differential because of a growing cash tax, but this will help to offset that and give us more and more confidence and clarity into that growth into the back part of the decade. We’re excited about it and we think it can help to grow our cash flows for our shareholders.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Your line is open. Good morning everyone. On the data center theme, can you maybe add a little bit of commentary on how you’re thinking about the contractual frameworks and contractual protections regarding who the counterparty is and how you would potentially alter it, if at all, if it’s a utility customer or a behind the fence customer.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, obviously from a credit perspective, other than, and you see this on a renewable side, the Googles and Metas and AT&T, they’re obviously super credits and that’s why we’re actually on balance in 75% of the opportunities with utilities who are existing customers today. They’re amazing credits too. They like to sign up for long-term, 10, 15, 20 year contracts, take or pay. If it is with a small data center hyperscaler player, we look at that really carefully and, you know, some of those folks would have to probably provide LC’s, etc. That’s why, as I said, I think as this continues to move forward rapidly, I’m a strong believer you’re going to continue to see those utility players there because this isn’t as easy as what people think.

The commitment to sign up for a 10 or 15 or 20 year pipeline contract or renewable contract says the big players will be there. From an analytical perspective, with all the data center opportunities out there, the winners here, just like on the pipeline side, will be the big players with scale and that’s the customers that we’ll largely serve. When I think about it, where the smaller players may have a better opportunity is frankly from our gas utilities where, you know, there’s a much larger scope of customers we have a requirement to serve. Even in some of those cases, depending what happens, they’d have to provide aids to construct, which, as you know, is an element. I think we’ve got it covered from the big players and on the utility, relatively small behind-the-meter stuff.

You’d see that as a typical cost of service structure inside a utility. Super safe for the investor and very fair for the customer.

Speaker 2: I appreciate that. Yeah, exactly. Switching gears here, just regarding the $9 to $10 billion of investment capacity per year, it is looking like you’re getting towards that range for 2026 and 2027 based off of the recent wins. How are you thinking about the cadence of when new or the cadence of project announcements and layering further capital in the next couple of years? Is now the focus turning towards the kind of, call it, beyond 2027 time frame?

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I can take that, Rob. I think it’s fair to say that in 2025 and 2026 we’ve been filling up the opportunity set pretty well over the last six to twelve months. I think that should give people more and more clarity into that kind of 2027, 2028 growth rate. I think it’s also fair to say that you look at the projects that we announced today with in-service dates around 2028, 2029, that we’re now starting to fill in that back piece. We still probably have a little bit of capacity to take some of the smaller bite-sized things, quick turn capital as we go here.

I think your comment is probably right in that I think we’ve added a lot of great projects that add that clarity, call it to the middle of the next half of the decade, and our job is to continue to provide high return projects into the back part. From a capacity perspective, as I think I said in my remarks, I like the way it’s spread out across our businesses, but also spread out across the rest of the decade here. Feeling very good as we get more transparency into that.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I’d say our business development team is very much focused on the back half of the decade and have been. Right. That’s about extending the growth which, you know, we’ve got a lot of confidence in that post 2026 period. As Pat says, most of what we talked about today will be very little capital in the next 12 months. The stuff that does have capital, like on the Gas Distribution and Storage side of things, in some cases you’ll start to earn on it before it even goes into service. Otherwise, it’ll actually generate EBITDA within, say, the 12 months, which of course then creates capacity. Right.

Speaker 2: Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning. Just want to go to your backlog and returns, and as I look at some of these projects you sanctioned the last couple years, you mentioned Woodfibre, low double digit returns, T-North, TSO 10% returns. When I look at that and I look at the new project you’re announcing today, much better returns, is it a trend then for Enbridge capital allocation increasingly shifting more to these higher return projects that, you know, you talk about the singles, high returns, that as we look up the next 12 months that average return is going to start moving higher in a secured backlog.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. I think you put a finger on the great tension inside the company. Lots of opportunities, but only those projects and those jurisdictions that provide better returns, that is, lower build multiples, are going to get serviced. Right. I would tell you right now that’s a challenge to do more in a place like British Columbia or even Ontario relative to Ohio or, say, Texas. We want to keep our builds in that six to eight times. Colin has tons of stuff that is even on the bottom end, if not below that six to eight times, so very competitive. Of course, Michele has higher multiples but quicker cycle.

It is a, you should see, and this is very much our focus, a steady, and it’s a big boat to move or a big denominator to move, increase in return on capital employed as we move up the chain in value added investments. You hit it right on. It’s actually a really nice environment as capital allocators to be able to pick and choose the best returns so we can keep those safe, steady, and stable and growing earnings that you all expect from us.

Speaker 2: Okay, got it. Maybe switching to the storage side, the Aiken Creek expansion. Can you confirm, is there more white space beyond the 40 BCF a day? What’s the strategy on the U.S. storage assets? Is it more recontract or is there opportunity to expand as well?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Cynthia, you want to speak to that?

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. This 40 BCF at Aiken Creek is the most accessible. There would be other opportunities, but it would not be as accessible as this 40 BCF. This was part of what we knew in the acquisition, that it would be an easier stage step to get through. As it comes to other opportunities on the Gulf Coast, we continue to look at that. We had some open seasons for storage expansions that we launched in May, and we’ve gotten some really good interest. We’re looking at developing our salt caverns there along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Of course, we expanded Trace Cavern 4 that just got into service at the beginning of the year. We also, as Greg noted, are continuing to optimize the structure there.

We’re looking at whether, with the open season interest, we’ll be expanding more at Trace, Eagan, and Moss. There are obviously a lot of opportunities in that area, and the continued expansions and LNG growth just provide some really good opportunities that we’re excited about right now.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, sometimes I think it’s underestimated. You know, we’ve got 600 Bcf out of storage across North America. Forget, you know, Cynthia’s got great elements here and the contracting has moved out a little longer and higher. You know, all that stuff. Sort of more three to five year type contracts, but at higher rates than what we’d seen for, say, the last five years. That’s kind of changed in the last 18 months. Don’t forget at Gas Distribution and Storage we have 100 or so Bcf storage that is unregulated. As all the needs that come in on the power projects, we’re talking about LNG, not so much on data center, but LNG, et cetera, that makes that storage all the more valuable. Right.

It’s a good time for storage on the Gulf Coast and the Great Lakes regions and obviously in Western Canada where Aiken Creek really is the only player in BC as LNG comes off.

Speaker 2: Okay, thanks for the update.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from a line of Sam Burwell from Jefferies. Your line is open. Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. This has been hit on a little bit from some other angles, but just wanted to ask, what’s your appetite for greenfield gas pipeline in Canada? There’s a pending LNG project that needs a pipe and likely someone to develop it. Would that be of any interest to you if you got assurances similar to what you said you would need to underwrite a larger pipe on the crude side?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I’ll let Cynthia speak to it. I think there’s no doubt it seems like gas pipelines in Western Canada or across Canada seem to have a, not easy, but an easier road than, say, liquids lines. As you know, I think we’ve set ourselves up to do that. The West Coast System is fabulous. Indigenous participation in the West Coast System is a fabulous setup. There’s no guarantee that that gets you consent, but it’s very helpful in aligning interest. Cynthia.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, we still have the Pacific Trails pipeline project. Our P2P project would serve, you know, onto the West Coast, so there’s future opportunities there. We’ll continue to maintain that it’s fully certified. Of course, you know, that would require a new large scale LNG facility in the region to proceed. We are obviously very supportive and continue to look at opportunities. It would, as Greg noted, have to hunt in our overall capital allocation. It is something, of course with our West Coast System and that knowledge and experience and now with our recent move to improve our Indigenous relationships in BC, I think we’re well positioned to support.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I think the situation is it’s going to, any greenfield pipe in Canada is going to have to have better returns than the West Coast System because, you know, the West Coast System is great and been there. It’s a cost of service type structure, but you’re not taking on the risk you would with a greenfield project. That would be the determining factor. As we’ve talked about throughout the call, we’re not exactly opportunity poor.

Speaker 2: Okay, understood. Thanks very much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Guys, thanks.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from a line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Your line is open. Good morning guys. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I think it’s not appreciated enough, but you probably indicated that you’re coming in towards the top end of the guidance. Given your track record, we actually think you might beat it. We keep our estimates within that range. My question to you is a little bit on the Southern Illinois Connector. Open season looks like a very exciting project. Can you talk a little bit more about this project and what the path forward for this project is?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I think the guy that runs the Liquids Pipelines business here, he usually gets the first question. I’m glad he gets probably the last one.

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, good morning, Manav. We’re excited about building out the plumbing in North America here to serve some long-term pretty sticky demand. Maybe unlike ML01, Southern Illinois Connector is more of a recontracting place. It’s not new egress over the Canadian-U.S. border, but think of it as long hauling existing barrels on the system even further to serve some Louisiana refineries, adding to that 75% of refineries served on the continent. It just adds another market to the network in an efficient way, using existing pipes and, in this case, partnering with an existing JV partner. The process on that one is the open season will go into August and we’ll look to roll some contracts on the Spearhead pipeline and add further long-term sticky paths to the Mainline.

That’s exciting and we’re looking for more of those type of projects here to complement the low multiple build out egress adds for customers.

Speaker 2: Perfect. It’s on top of the. I’ll turn it over. Thank you so much.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from a line of Keith Stanley from Wolf Research. Your line is open. Hi, good morning. Curious what the remaining gating items are on the Mainline expansion from this point. Are you expecting based on discussions that returns on this are going to be carved out separately from the CTs?

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’re looking at and tracking for an FID later this year. The primary gating item has been achieved, which is the open season on the southern part of the path, Flanagan South, and that was oversubscribed. There is lots of interest in long-term demand to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The other gating item is working with the traditional counterparties within CAP, if you like, or industry, on basically kind of rolling in the Mainline capital into the rate base. There are many precedents for that historically. We’ve expanded the Mainline countless times over the years, and we’re confident we’ll come to agreement with industry on that. It would fit within CTS EARN rate base or MTS EARN rate base.

When we roll the subsequent tranche of Mainline agreement beyond its expiry in 2028, that capital would be duly considered in the rate base of the Mainline going forward. We’d earn of and on the capital in the Mainline as well. There are two parts to that project: the Mainline and then Flanagan South and Seaway to the Gulf. We’ve got many precedents for doing this historically. There is a little bit of gating there, but a well-treaded path historically to do such.

Speaker 2: Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. Second question. There’s a few different project proposals now to bring Permian gas to other markets away from the Gulf Coast. I’m curious what you see as the next steps for your JV with Whitewater. Can you extend the value chain into Louisiana? Do you look more at storage? What other opportunities do you see in that JV with Whitewater the next few years?

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, thanks Keith. We’re really pleased with how our investment in and our joint venture with Whitewater has gone. There has been obviously some upside since the original one. We continue to have expansion projects. With Traverse, we just upsized that. We still see a lot of gas that would flow or want to flow to serve the LNG markets. We think that there’s further expansion opportunities there. I know Whitewater just announced with a similar project yesterday that they’ve upsized Pelicans. We’re still seeing a lot of interest in that area. The Traverse Pipeline, as was noted, provides more interconnectivity to allow that bi-directional flow between Agua Dulce and Katy Hub. That does create that tie. What we loved about those assets is it does tie to our existing footprint, that header system that we have with Techco and of course Trace Blosh’s storage.

Yes, we would look at all opportunities to expand to move those volumes and we continue to see a lot of opportunities on a go forward basis.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: We could do something on our own too.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: We could.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: It is not just Whitewater, it is obviously, you know, be customer driven and you know, do we think we have a better mousetrap than maybe the JV. Although as Cynthia says, we have been really pleased with that, the way that has operated together. Yeah, anything is on the table there. As you know, as GORs go up in the region, the demand for that gas continues to rise. As Cynthia just said, I think you witness that and going from being three quarters to two and a quarter on the Traverse Pipeline. The opportunity is there and we will either use the JV or we will figure out something on our own.

Speaker 2: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning everyone. I’ll just stick with one question, but it’s more of a wholesome question about relationships of customers rather than delivering individual assets. As you continue to hear more record spending on AI, how broad of a corporation discussion did you have with Meta in terms of supporting their needs beyond Clear Fork Solar and maybe even AT&T and Amazon since you touched on them earlier, recognizing that Enbridge certainly has the assets, expertise, and relationships across all energy forms.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Maybe I’ll start and Matthew can chime in here. That’s actually a really great question because, you know, I would say early days, you’re almost dealing with supply chain people where they see it as a source of something they need, that is power or, in the case of gas, to run their operation. I think as time goes on, we’re moving up the chain in who we’re dealing with at these corporations because of the real strategic nature of energy, which we all know. That’s not something maybe the tech world or data centers were kind of thinking through in the same way that we have. Making sure we understand their long-term interests, what they’re trying to do, the scalability has caused it to move up as opposed to just be a supply chain issue. Yeah, I totally agree, Maurice. Thanks for the question.

That’s exactly how we think of it. We’re in the early innings of a major trend in energy that we can capitalize on across several of our business units. Renewable can be a little bit of a nexus for that initially. If you saw the quote from Meta Platforms in our Clear Fork Solar announcement, it was that they were thrilled to be working with Enbridge Inc. and we’re very pleased to be working with them. It just goes to show that they’re signaling they want to definitely do more. There are lots of conversations with these types of customers that are ongoing and we see those being more the types of customers we can do business with across all of our platforms.

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Size matters, right. The old Russian axiom that quantity has a quality all of its own. People want to work with big players. Meta doesn’t want to work with a small cap energy provider. They want to work with a major player and someone who’s in 40+ states and multiple countries and all the provinces, if you will, if you think in a North American context. That is really mattering in a big way. I think as you see further projects FID in Matthew Akman’s world and both on Gas Distribution and Storage and Gas Transmission and Midstream, you’ll see these players come to the fore either through a utility, but they want to know how are they ultimately getting that infrastructure served and can they rely on the energy. That’s what we provide.

Speaker 2: That’s very good. Thank you very much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you.

Speaker 2: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is open. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just had a follow up on the Ohio utility related to the impairment of this asset. Can you talk about what led to this, considering that it was only recently acquired, and when we take this into account, as well as the rate case decision that’s currently being appealed longer term, does this change your view on the trajectory of growth or on the margin change the amount of CapEx you would allocate between the utilities?

Michele Harradence, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: I’ll get things started, and Pat can add if he wants to. Teresa, the impairment, the primary impairment associated with the Ohio utility, was to do with the treatment of the pension asset, which was quite a significant asset that was in there. They were determined, those pension assets were determined to be excluded from the calculation of rate base. The position we had actually put forward was to have them excluded from rate base, so that’s not inconsistent with what we were looking for. We’re just asking for a rehearing with regard to how they treated the accumulated deferred income tax on that payment, where they put that in for the purposes of calculating revenue reduction. It was something we expected was going to happen. That’s the majority of the write-off of the regulatory asset that we recorded. There’s a smaller amount associated with the annual incentive plan.

In that case, again, we’re applying for a rehearing on that point, primarily with regard to what we believe is retroactive rate making, where they’ve gone and disallowed it from anything that was put in attributable to that piece previously. Pat, I don’t know if there’s anything else you’d like to add.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: I think you covered the kind of the genesis of the write-off. I think your second question on does this change our capital allocation? No, I mean, I think Greg hit it quite clearly that there’s still a very good return, almost 10%. We actually got a higher equity thickness coming through, that we have the maintenance of the capital rise riders, which are important in this asset. I think it’s still a very positive framework to work with from a regulatory perspective. I think you could see us go back for hearings a little more often than they would have done historically. As you know, there was this first hearing in like 15 years. I think you’ll see some of that from a rate strategy perspective. At the end of the day, not at all unexpected as a result of the rate case.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, I don’t think it has anything to do with the fundamentals of the business. Your comment about a write-off so soon after the acquisition, frankly, we think they’ve erred in law. In fact, they may be where they’re going violates actually some federal pension laws. We’ll take that up with them, and if we’re right, you’re going to see this reverse down the road. That’s the way we kind of think about it.

Michele Harradence, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I hasten is a lot of those pension assets actually went with Dominion. Remember this is a rate case that was filed by Dominion in 2023. Dominion continues to carry the obligation with regard to the pensions for all the retired employees. Because it had been 15 years, that had really grown to quite a large piece. That’s with Dominion. We’ve just got the current employees going forward. All of that needs to be updated with the regulator. Our plan is to file for another rate case here, likely by the end of this year, just to bring all those numbers. These numbers date back to 2023. They date back to pre-acquisition. There’s a lot that needs to.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Be updated with the regulator too.

Speaker 2: Thank you for the detailed answer, and we look forward to the next chapters of this development.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 2: Your final question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Your line is open. Thank you. Good morning. Just back on the preference here of customers, you know, continuing to push more and more barrels to the Gulf Coast. Just wondering if we can get a quick update on Ingleside, how throughput has been trending on a year over year basis, and where things are at with respect to, you know, potentially sanctioning some of the optimization and dock expansion opportunities.

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: Hey Pat, it’s Colin. Up and to the right I think is the summation to your answer. We steadily are growing volumes through the terminal as we’ve talked to you about. It’s advantaged. We’ve got some more storage coming online. I would also point you to some longer term kind of bigger upsides and adding docks and stuff. We’ve done all the dredging, as you know, historically and continue to add barrels to it. We’re adding a fungible service, which is incremental to the historic business model, which has been just, you know, dedicated term storage. That’s incremental as well. I think the whole menu of services and a variety of smaller optimizations and tweaks, and then later on as the Permian Basin grows, we can add docks.

I can confirm that we have connected the adjacent Flint dock over and are able to load there too and optimize windows to get the smaller vessels there and the bigger vessels, VLCCs, at the Legacy dock. Plan is on track and more to come.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: It’s interesting that we often focus on domestic demand and things like that, but global oil demand is really, really strong, and obviously that’s a great setup for Ingleside on a go forward basis as well, regardless if you see some Permian weakness later in the year.

Speaker 2: Maybe as a quick follow-up there on your point, Greg, I know you’ve been previously looking at NGL export opportunities as well at Ingleside. I guess in light of Asian buyers perhaps looking to diversify their petrochemical supply, I’m curious if you might be looking to pivot opportunistically at other sites across North America, including Canada’s West Coast here, especially as LNG exports continue to ramp up over time.

Colin Gruending, Head of Liquids Pipelines, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, you know, I’d say that the strategy still is to kind of copy paste all the advantages from crude export at that terminal to other commodities at that terminal. Still NGL and potentially, you know, clean ammonia over time as well here. That remains the playbook. We got lots of land.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, you better move, you know, as opposed to doing it in Canada. If we copy past pays to a different location, be probably somewhere else along the Gulf Coast. You’ve heard us ruminate about that from time to time, and yeah, that’ll come to fruition over time. A little further out though.

Speaker 2: Okay, that’s great. I appreciate it. Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for some final closing remarks.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Great. Thank you. We appreciate your ongoing interest in Enbridge. As always, our investor relations team is available following the call for any additional questions that you may have. Once again, thanks and have a great day.

Speaker 2: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

We need to be clarifying what “green skills” means before people start entering the job market.
Working in renewable energy, for example, doesn’t have to mean being a turbine engineer or solar panel installer.","Government research suggests that 13,700 people who were out of work in 2024 possess many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades like building and construction. This could have a significant impact on communities across the UK, especially those that have been directly impacted by the decline in fossil fuel generation.

“Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call […] Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.” – Ed Miliband, Energy Secretary

As a business operating within the renewable energy space, we are aware of the huge increase in skills needed to deliver the clean energy system of the future and wholeheartedly agree that the focus needs to be on both the current and future workforce. In fact, a 2024 survey by LinkedIn found that “by 2050, there will be twice as many jobs requiring green skills as people qualified to fill them if today’s trends continue.”

At Thrive, as well as advocating for the transfer of skills from the oil and gas sector, we actively encourage students to consider the benefits of choosing a green career. In the past, this has included engagement days with social enterprises like Babassa, which helps young adults to realise their employment, enterprise and academic ambitions, irrespective of where they live, their nationality, ethnicity, gender, race, sexuality or faith. We also offer a summer internship to university undergraduates looking to understand more about the clean energy sector, supporting their exploration in areas such as IT, finance and investment.

With progress being made towards a more supportive policy framework, we sat down with several Thrive team members to find out what they love about working in sustainability and how we, as an industry, can support more workers to find their place within the evolving green economy.

Who are you and what’s your role at Thrive?

Monika Paplaczyk, Chief Investment Officer – I lead the investment team in the originating, development, acquisition and construction of Thrive’s projects, as well as manage the commercial aspects of the portfolio.

What made you choose renewable energy?

After finishing my Masters degree (focused on sustainability), I joined a boutique consultancy in Edinburgh, Euro Access, specialising in accessing grant funding for infrastructure projects. I attended All-Energy in 2006 (which has since become one of the UK’s biggest renewable trade shows) and realised that joining the energy industry would be an excellent opportunity to apply my business and practical skills, as well as my interest in impact. The development of renewable projects like wind and solar also help to address inequalities in disadvantaged and rural communities, improving the economic outlook through the creation of new jobs.

What needs to be done to support more people in entering a green career?

I am particularly passionate about supporting more women to enter STEM subjects and jobs. For me, this starts with creating and encouraging more girls to join STEM programmes from a young age, as well as having better representation of successful women in STEM fields in the media. There was a great episode of the Big Green Money Show where it followed a young woman who left behind a six-year career in hairdressing for a new life working on an offshore wind project. As an industry, there’s more we should be doing to ensure the next generation see examples that they can relate and aspire to – it can be as easy as using social media to champion female colleagues, engaging with a mentoring scheme or challenging gender biases in hiring and leadership.

Who are you and what’s your role at Thrive?

David Matheson, Senior Sustainability Analyst – I lead on measuring, monitoring, and enhancing Thrive’s environmental and social impact, overseeing our net zero and biodiversity strategies, and manage Thrive’s B Corp commitment.

What made you choose renewable energy?

I am driven by a desire to address real-world sustainability challenges. With a background in Conservation Biology and Ecology, I began my career in ecological consultancy before joining Thrive to focus on sustainability in a renewables context. Transitioning into the renewables sector broadened my expertise whilst allowing me to continue applying my ecological knowledge, particularly when working on the biodiversity strategies for our project sites. It’s incredibly rewarding to be a part of a sector that not only reduces our reliance on fossil fuels, but also provides opportunities to engage communities and contribute towards nature recovery too.

What needs to be done to support more people in entering a green career?

When I was choosing my A Levels, I was fortunate to be able to take Environmental Science as a subject. I really loved how it connected science with real world sustainability challenges, and it inspired me to pursue a career that would play a role in addressing these global issues. It deepened my understanding of the pressures facing the natural world and was quite a pivotal moment in my career journey. I believe educating people on these issues in an applied, problem-solving context like this can inspire them to get started on their path towards a green career. But by itself it isn’t enough – to really give people the chance to align their careers with the green transition, we need to offer them better career guidance, mentorship and hands on experience. This includes young people but importantly, it also needs to consider those who are looking to switch from existing careers into green jobs as the energy transition progresses.

Who are you and what’s your role at Thrive?

Alex Lomax, Communications Manager – I am responsible for driving awareness of who Thrive is and what we do, ensuring that all activity aligns with our brand and mission of empowering people to come together and take action against the climate emergency.

What made you choose renewable energy?

I had been working in PR and communications for several years and had got to a point where I wanted the stories that I was telling to reflect more of my own values. I’d been working on a global clean energy podcast in a previous role and really enjoyed it. From then, I knew that I wanted to use my skills to help accelerate the transition here in the UK.

What needs to be done to support more people in entering a green career?

We need to be clarifying what “green skills” means before people start entering the job market. Working in renewable energy, for example, doesn’t have to mean being a turbine engineer or solar panel installer. You might be an excellent collaborator, able to communicate well, or think critically – all these skills are needed and can be applied to a wide variety of roles, from project manager through to web developer. I think it’s important that career guidance supports students to be aware of and understand the breadth of roles that are available to them under the ‘green jobs’ umbrella – something I didn’t have when leaving college or university.",https://cms-admin.thriverenewables.co.ukhttps://cms-admin.thriverenewables.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/favicon-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-30 15:06:26.527364

He could approve the Amber Energy bid or select the Dalinar Energy bid instead — either action would likely generate further objections from various parties and associated legal ripples.
As we noted in Changes, Amber Energy and Dalinar Energy have much different visions for how they would manage the CITGO assets.
The winner of the auction will get three impressive U.S. refineries (dark-blue refinery icons in Figure 1 below), in addition to a number of lubricant plants, terminals and pipelines.
It’s possible that whoever ends up as the final owner could opt to divest one (or all) of the refineries.","The eight-year legal clash over the coveted CITGO refinery assets just took another unexpected turn, leaving the potential sale up in the air. The winner of the auction for CITGO’s three large U.S. refineries, related pipelines and terminal assets remains uncertain as the auction faces additional legal hurdles. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll dive into the latest in the court case and what it could mean for the three refineries involved, which have a combined capacity of more than 800 Mb/d.

Let’s start with some background. As we detailed in I’ll Be Around, there’s been a primarily below-the-radar battle playing out in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware since 2017 about how best to help satisfy the claims of a dozen-plus creditors who collectively lost more than $20 billion when the government of Venezuela — the de facto owner of CITGO Petroleum and its parent company, PDV Holding (PDVH) — defaulted on its bonds. (In 2019, control of CITGO was transferred away from the ruling Maduro regime in Venezuela to the opposition “shadow” government, then led by Juan Guaidó.) In May 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard P. Stark appointed Robert B. Pincus as a special master tasked with devising a plan to sell PDVH/CITGO to satisfy at least some portion of the outstanding claims. After a two-round bidding process that concluded in June 2024, Pincus recommended in September 2024 that the district court approve Amber Energy, an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management, and its $7.3 billion bid for CITGO and its three refineries (Lake Charles, LA; Lemont, IL; and Corpus Christi, TX). However, instead of ending the drama, the court restarted the bidding from scratch in December 2024, citing issues with the auction process.

As a result of the new bidding round, the court in July recommended a $7.4 billion bid from Dalinar Energy, the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian miner Gold Reserve. But by August 30, that deal was overtaken by what the court described as a “superior” proposal from Amber Energy — even though its bid included less cash. (Amber’s offer included $5.86 billion in cash and $2.86 billion in strategic debt settlements; together with $105 million of break fees paid to writ holders, it equates to a total value of $8.821 billion.) Pincus approved Amber’s bid, saying that Dalinar’s proposal did not match or exceed it despite a last-minute attempt to improve the terms. (Dalinar later raised its bid to $7.9 billion.)

Now, several parties are pushing to scrap the auction and start from scratch (again). Judge Stark heard testimony on October 21-22 from CITGO, PDVH and the Venezuelan government, which argued that Amber Energy’s bid is far too low. Attorney Nathan Eimer, representing Venezuela, called Amber’s bid “so low … that it shocks the conscience of this court.” They also said the sale process discouraged competition and that Amber’s separate bondholder payment does not help Delaware creditors.

Gold Reserve and the Venezuelan government have asked Judge Stark to disqualify Pincus and his advisers, claiming conflicts of interest. They argue that the firms Pincus hired to advise the court — Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Evercore — received $170 million in fees from Elliott and affiliated bondholders, creating a conflict of interest and loyalty to Amber Energy, the bidder Pincus selected. They said the conflict of interest wasn’t properly disclosed. Pincus and his legal team deny any bias.

Judge Stark will have several options. Motions on the case were due to him by October 28 and he’s expected to rule on them in November. He could approve the Amber Energy bid or select the Dalinar Energy bid instead — either action would likely generate further objections from various parties and associated legal ripples. It’s also possible he could order a new round of the auction. But if Judge Stark agrees there were conflicts of interest, disclosure failures, or problems with the auction process, he could even start it over from scratch.

As we noted in Changes, Amber Energy and Dalinar Energy have much different visions for how they would manage the CITGO assets. Amber plans a major restructuring focused on cost-cutting, efficiency and tighter financial discipline. It said it would bring in new leadership led by refining veterans Greg Goff and Jeff Stevens, replace the current board, and streamline operations to prepare CITGO for a potential sale.

Dalinar Energy has said it intends to keep CITGO’s current management and structure in place. Although Dalinar is a new entity with no current downstream assets, its board includes several experienced professionals, including Tony Sementelli and Todd Craig, both decades-long industry veterans, most recently as senior managers at Flint Hills Resources, and James Rhame, who has been in various senior management roles at Motiva, Shell, Flint Hills and Vertex Energy.

The winner of the auction will get three impressive U.S. refineries (dark-blue refinery icons in Figure 1 below), in addition to a number of lubricant plants, terminals and pipelines. It’s possible that whoever ends up as the final owner could opt to divest one (or all) of the refineries. We should also note that while we forecast some refining capacity to shut down in the U.S. in the coming years, we expect all three CITGO refineries to survive over the next two decades due to their relative competitiveness. Let’s look a little more closely at the three refineries next, all of which are discussed in much more detail in our Future of Fuels Report.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-10/Fig1_CITGO%27s%20Refineries%2C%20Lubricant%20Plants%2C%20Terminals%20and%20Pipelines.png?itok=B8rOcIYV,N,,2025-10-30 15:08:03.247220

Download the North American Automotive Logistics Market Report 2026-2036 today to gain insight into the region's automotive logistics market and the leading companies operating within the space.

An MEDC announcement on October 28, 2025 confirmed that AAM has received approval for a five-year, 100% State Essential Services Assessment (SESA) exemption – an estimated value of up to $978,960.

The SESA is a special assessment in the state of Michigan, which applies to eligible manufacturing personal property that is already exempt from local personal property tax. To qualify for an SESA exemption, projects must involve an investment of $25m or more in eligible manufacturing personal property.

“These investments are necessary to ensure our plant infrastructure and advanced manufacturing processes remain competitive while supporting our highly skilled workforce to meet the strict requirements of our OEM customers,” said Tolga Oal, president – driveline at AAM.

Oal added: “We appreciate knowing that when we’re making multi-year investments in physical and human capital, we’re doing so in a location where we can count on partnerships that are necessary to sustain and grow our Three Rivers Manufacturing Facility to compete successfully in this dynamic, ever-changing industry.”

Local reports claim the investment will go towards new machinery and upgrades to the site’s roof, HVAC system and wastewater treatment system, as well as interior and exterior renovations.

“The $132.9 million investment American Axle & Manufacturing is making in its Three Rivers facility is an incredible win for Southwest Michigan,” said Jonas Peterson, CEO of Southwest Michigan First. “This commitment will position the plant and community for long-term success. By designating Three Rivers as its Center of Excellence, AAM is not only elevating the facility’s capabilities but also shining a spotlight on the extraordinary talent and craftsmanship of our regional workforce.”

In 2021, the Michigan site was prioritised over AAM’s facility in Mexico for upgrades. This earlier investment of $38.6m involved the installation a new production line, creating 100 new jobs, over half of which being filled by “low- to moderate-income persons”. This investment, much like the 2025 one, was deemed eligible for an SESA exemption, valued at up to $468,888.

In a Q2 2025 earnings call in August, David Dauk, chairman and CEO of AAM, addressed the topic of reshoring and the impact of US tariffs on this trend. “We are receiving several inquiries from many of the global OEMs that are looking to localise production capability or component capability to the US to address the tariff issues that are out there,” he stated. “That’s positive for us in regard especially for our metal forming business unit.”

The automotive industry is reeling from the US’ hugely disruptive reset of the world economic order, and this will have profound ramifications for logistics providers around the world.

With AAM’s Oal identifying the importance of meeting the requirements of the company’s OEM customers, demand from OEMs for suppliers to localise components to the US is a strong driver to take such action.

This follows a trend of tier suppliers investing in localised production in the US, further fuelled by recent tariff pressure. For example, in 2024, ZF Friedrichshafen invested $200m to launch US production of powerline commercial vehicle transmissions “to supply three major US commercial vehicle manufacturers”.

Other examples of this trend include BorgWarner’s $42m investment into the expansion of its battery pack production facility in Seneca, South Carolina in 2023 and Bosch’s $260m electric motor production investment in Charleston, South Carolina – announced in 2022 – as well as Bosch’s proposal to build its largest silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor factory in Roseville, California, which was announced at the end of 2024.",https://image.automotivelogistics.media/1640941.jpg?imageId=1640941&x=0&y=20.67&cropw=100&croph=72.07&panox=0&panoy=20.67&panow=100&panoh=72.07&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-30 15:07:39.855602

Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) Basin Ranch will build the plant, which is expected to begin generating power for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) power region in 2029.

“The Texas Energy Fund secured the largest capacity project to date, with 1,350 MW of new, reliable power generation coming online that will further fortify our state grid and support our growing economy for decades,” Abbott said in a news release. “As one of the largest sources of dispatchable power generation for the grid, this investment is just the latest example of why Texas is the energy capital of the world. We will take every step necessary to ensure affordability and electric reliability for Texas homes and businesses across our great state.”

“The Texas Energy Fund has now financed the addition of over 3,100 MW of new, reliable power for the State of Texas,” said Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Chairman Thomas Gleeson. “There is important work still ahead, but this newest commitment to invest in Texas is a clear demonstration of the value and reliability benefits the TxEF is bringing to bear.”

“We thank Governor Greg Abbott, his administration, the Texas Legislature, the PUC, and Ward County for their continued support of the CPV Basin Ranch Energy Center that will provide critical baseload power to the citizens of Texas,” said Competitive Power Ventures CEO Sherman Knight. “Through incentives and available natural resources, Texas is paving the way for new investments and development across the state; CPV looks forward to playing a role in that future.”

At 1,350 MW, the facility has the largest capacity of any project financed by the TxEF to date. Once connected, the CPV project will become one of the largest sources of dispatchable generation capacity for the ERCOT grid.

The loan agreement between the PUC and CPV is the fifth under the TxEF’s In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans for projects that add new, dispatchable power to the ERCOT region. Under the loan agreement, total project costs are estimated to be $1.88 billion. The PUC is providing a 20-year TxEF loan of $1.12 billion, or 60% of the total project cost, at a 3% interest rate. The loan term runs from Oct. 28, 2025, through Oct. 28, 2045.

The natural gas generation facility will be built at CPV’s Basin Ranch Energy Center in Ward County. The project will interconnect in the ERCOT West Load Zone.

Under the loan agreement, the facility must meet minimum performance standards, as outlined in the In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program rules.

The TxEF is administered by the PUC through a competitive application process and rigorous financial review of proposed projects.

There are 12 TxEF In-ERCOT Generation Loan Program applications moving through a due diligence review process.

Emissions at LNG terminals are only one portion of the climate-altering pollution created as natural gas is produced, transported, and burned for fuel.","During the past five years, all seven of the fully operational LNG export terminals in the U.S. violated the Clean Air Act, America’s cornerstone law on air pollution, a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) finds.

The report comes as the Trump administration has moved to accelerate the approval of new export terminals to sell more U.S. LNG around the world, particularly to Asia and Europe.

Several major terminals rarely, if ever, managed to spend a full quarter in compliance with environmental laws over the past three years, the report found.

Among the seven terminals that were fully operational by the end of 2024, publicly traded companies appeared among the most consistent violators, with the Cheniere (NYSE:LNG) Sabine Pass terminal and Venture Global (NYSE: VG) Calcasieu Pass Terminal violating the Clean Air Act every single quarter from October 2022 to July 2025, EIP found. A third, the Cameron LNG terminal, faced “high priority” violations 11 out of the past 12 quarters.

The companies that exhibited patterns of violations were also the largest emitters of climate-altering greenhouse gases.

Cheniere’s Sabine Pass, the largest polluter, reported releasing 6.9 million tons of greenhouse gases during 2023, EIP found, and the company’s Corpus Christi LNG terminal ranked second, with emissions of 3.3 million tons. Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass terminal was third, with 3.1 million tons, and Cameron LNG ranked fourth, producing 2.9 million tons that year. All told, the seven terminals pumped out about 18.2 million tons of greenhouse gases — about as much as adding 3.9 million new cars to the roads.

“These trends are especially concerning because all but one of the LNG terminals examined in this report are planning major expansions,” the EIP report noted, citing five projects announced this year, in addition to those already under construction or planned before Trump took office. “If all 33 projects are built, U.S. LNG exports could triple over the next decade.”

Five of the seven operating LNG terminals also violated the Clean Water Act at least once during that time period, the report found, racking up nearly 70 permit violations for discharging pollutants like oil and grease, metals, and “suspended solids.”

Environmental regulators have hit LNG terminal operators with over $1 million in penalties for violating air pollution laws during that time, EIP found. But in some cases, state regulators in Texas and Louisiana responded by relaxing their standards, allowing three major terminals to modify or amend their permits to allow more pollution.

“One example is the Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal in Cameron, Louisiana,” EIP wrote. “After reporting hundreds of permit deviations during its first year of operation, the LDEQ approved a major permit modification that increased emissions limits collectively by approximately 17 percent,” referring to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality.

Texas regulators with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) declined to comment. LEDQ officials did not respond to a request for comment.

“The government is not working for the people, they are working with the industry hand-in-hand,” James Hiatt, a former refinery operator and executive director of For a Better Bayou, a Southwest Louisiana environmental group, said at a press conference. “At what point is enough enough?”

‘Routinely’ Violating the Law

The report describes a widespread pattern of permit violations by LNG terminals, ranging from minor to serious.

“While violations ranged in severity — from failed performance tests to significant emission events — a review of EPA and state enforcement records reveals that LNG terminals routinely violate environmental laws designed to protect the public against dangerous air pollution,” EIP wrote.

Freeport LNG, for example, suffered a massive explosion on June 8, 2022, and has so far drawn $493,804 in penalties associated with that catastrophe.

“That represents around half of formal enforcement actions taken and two-thirds of penalties assessed against all LNG export facilities in the U.S. over that time period,” EIP wrote. “An examination of state records shows that the Freeport LNG terminal had a poor track record with environmental compliance long before it exploded, and that the company continues to struggle with consistent compliance.”

Environmental enforcers rely heavily on the LNG industry to self-report permit violations, Hiatt noted. EIP’s report also described incidents where companies breached their permits but failed to notify state regulators.

“In some cases, LNG companies failed to properly notify regulators when their plants malfunctioned or released excess emissions in violation of their permits,” the report said, citing incidents involving Venture Global, Cameron LNG, and others.

Venture Global, Cheniere, and Cameron LNG did not respond to a request for comment on the report.

The federal Environmental Protection Agency’s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database failed to reflect the full number of violations the seven terminals had racked up, the report shows — meaning researchers had to turn to state records to reveal the full extent of violations.

The industry’s plans to expand come as the Trump administration has significantly reduced or eliminated enforcement of environmental laws, the report notes. “Environmental enforcement has plummeted during the first six months of the Trump Administration, with far fewer civil judicial cases filed and concluded against polluters compared to the same period under the Biden Administration,” EIP wrote.

Last week, the Department of Energy issued a key approval for Venture Global’s CP2 project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the latest in a rapid series of approvals for LNG projects issued by the Trump administration, which has cited an “energy emergency” as it greenlights expanded fossil fuel exports.

A total of 33 LNG projects are currently planned or in expansion in the U.S., the report notes, meaning the country’s LNG exports could triple over the next 10 years.

“There is no ‘energy emergency,’” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement accompanying the new report. “And fast-tracking approvals for LNG terminals puts the health of local communities, ecosystems, and the climate at risk.”

Risky Business

Despite the administration’s support, the LNG business can be a risky one. Venture Global has suffered a series of setbacks, including a loss in a major arbitration case with BP, one of its customers, earlier this month. Venture Global has seen its stock price decline over 60 percent since it first went public earlier this year.

“As the U.S. doubles down on fossil fuels, pushing allies to buy its LNG, China is seizing the low-carbon mantle through EV and solar dominance, plus aggressive renewables deployment,” energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie’s Vice President Prakash Sharma said today, as WoodMac released its Energy Transition Outlook 2025-2026, which predicts the world is now on track to see 2.6°C of global warming.

Emissions at LNG terminals are only one portion of the climate-altering pollution created as natural gas is produced, transported, and burned for fuel. An October 22 report from the UN Environment Program (UNEP) found that natural gas companies and governments are failing to respond when alerted that satellites have detected major pollution incidents at a startling rate.

“Responses to alerts issued by UNEP on major emissions detected via satellites have increased twelve-fold in just one year,” the UN’s Eye on Methane report found. “This is real progress, yet it also underscores the gap that remains: Almost 90 per cent of satellite-detected emission events flagged by UNEP still go unaddressed by governments and companies.”

The impacts of failing to act on climate change are increasingly apparent. Heat-related deaths have surged 23 percent since the 1990s, reaching 546,0000 per year, the Lancet’s Countdown on Health and Climate Change report, also released today, concludes.

“Climate change is already causing massive death and economic suffering from heat exposure, drought, natural disasters, and flooding,” Paul Reed, a professor at Australia’s Charles Sturt University and director of the Future Emergency Resilience Network, said in a statement accompanying the Lancet report. “The health impacts, I would argue, are the proper outcome metrics of human flourishing, but the economic costs are already far surpassing earlier estimates and now represent US$1 trillion and 1% of global domestic product.”

“The world’s poor, young, and elderly are the most impacted,” Reed concluded, “whereas the wealthier countries and the richest within those countries are least affected, whilst most to blame.”

By October 2025, operating storage capacity in the United States reached 37.4 GW, Deloitte estimates, up 32% year to date.
In addition, distributed storage has grown fivefold since 2020 to 4.8 GW in 2024, with Deloitte expecting another 4 GW by 2026.
Asset-level deals slowed sharply, down 89% in volume in the first eight months of 2025 compared with 2024, Deloitte states.
An example given is a leading solar manufacturer that is targeting 14 GW of U.S. module capacity by 2026.","2025 has been a challenging year for renewables with passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that rolled back many clean energy tax credits and imposed new restrictions, pressuring early-stage wind and solar pipelines.

According to Deloitte’s 2026 Renewable Energy Industry Outlook, wind and solar investments in the first half of 2025 fell 18%, to nearly $35 billion (prior to the enactment of OBBBA), compared to the same period in 2024.

Deloitte outlines in its report five key trends that could help shape the year ahead:

Policy shifts: Adapting to a changing energy landscape

Storage integration: Delivering clean, firm power on demand

Capital and operational efficiency: Implementing leaner, smarter strategies

Strategic M&A: Attracting capital through platform and mature assets

Supply chain agility: Prioritizing alternative sourcing and reshoring

Policy shifts

Policy changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) may worsen compressed timelines and raise costs, which the report states will reshape renewable economics. Not only did the bill shorten qualification windows for wind and solar credits, but new guidance from the Internal Revenue Service also requires continuous construction.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions increase supply chain pressures, making developers weigh credit value against compliance costs. Deloitte analysis projects that annual solar, wind and storage additions between 2026 and 2030 could fall to a range of 30 GW to 66 GW, down from a range of 54 GW to 85 GW under pre-OBBBA trajectories.

While much focus has been on federal policy, state policy plays a significant role. According to Deloitte, in 2024, 28 states with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) drove 37% of renewable additions.

Yet the momentum across states is uneven and the report cites Ohio and North Carolina as examples. Ohio is sunsetting its RPS after 2026, while North Carolina rolled back its 2030 carbon reduction target, both citing affordability concerns. More states could revisit commitments under economic pressure, the report advises. Permitting and long-term targets remain critical levers, Deloitte says, but local opposition and interconnection queues still pose barriers.

Storage integration

The United States hosts 90% of hyperscalers’ global carbon-free energy contracts, with renewables supplying 78% and nuclear providing the rest, according to the report. Other options such as nuclear, hydro, enhanced geothermal and natural gas with carbon capture take years to develop, therefore clean energy with battery storage is the fastest solution, the report states.

By October 2025, operating storage capacity in the United States reached 37.4 GW, Deloitte estimates, up 32% year to date. Another 19 GW is under construction through 2026, with a 187 GW pipeline by 2030. The report notes that over half of the utility-scale storage coming online by 2026 is paired with solar, concentrated in three southwestern states.

Deloitte notes that technology innovation and distributed growth are significant factors driving the role of storage. On the technology side, lithium iron phosphate batteries are displacing nickel manganese cobalt lithium-ion batteries for cost and safety reasons, the report states, pointing to long-duration pilots that include 48-hour hydrogen-lithium hybrids and 100-hour iron-air batteries.

In addition, distributed storage has grown fivefold since 2020 to 4.8 GW in 2024, with Deloitte expecting another 4 GW by 2026. An example given in the report is virtual power plant (VPP) enrollment, which is aggregated distributed energy resources (DERs) like batteries, solar and electric vehicles acting as a single resource. The report estimates that VPPs reached 30 GW in 2024. Deloitte also notes that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order 2222 is expected to accelerate aggregated DER participation in wholesale markets.

Capital and operational efficiency

Due to policy shifts and macroeconomic pressures, developers are much more cost conscious across equipment, design, engineering and labor aspects of projects while also accelerating project timelines, Deloitte finds.

At the same time, investors are expecting strategies that balance cost with growth and compressed credit timelines are driving more selective capital deployment, with emphasis on mature assets and financing structures that maximize returns, the report notes.

Developers and asset owners are pursuing three strategies:

Reprioritizing portfolios:Mature development and operating assets come first, especially those backed by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), followed by repowering and relicensing. Deloitte finds these priorities are funded by recycling capital through asset sales and divestitures, while large players and investors target operating assets and near-term pipelines for secure returns.

Accelerating near-term projects:Developers are tapping into flexible financing to bridge construction costs and fast-track projects before credit expiration, the report indicates. Third-party ownership models are helping to sustain growth in residential solar.

Capturing tax credit value:Developers are combining tax-equity partnerships with transferability benefits. Deloitte sees that phaseouts may simplify financing by reducing complexity and accelerating capital flows.

Deloitte finds that to enhance operational efficiency, developers are standardizing design, optimizing procurement and streamlining operations and maintenance, often using AI-driven tools to support these goals.

With 76% of U.S. power and renewable executives planning to increase AI spending in 2025, the study finds companies are recognizing that efficiency gains require talent, governance, collaboration and technology.

Strategic M&A

Well-capitalized investors and operators are seeking stable returns and pursuing differentiated strategies, according to Deloitte. For example, strategic energy firms, private equity firms, and infrastructure funds are prioritizing established platforms; developers that combine operating projects with late-stage pipelines, teams, and scale, and de-risked portfolios. On the other hand, developers and independent power producers recycle capital by selling mature, PPA-backed assets to fund near-term pipelines, the report states.

In the first nine months of 2025, the report estimates that $6 billion across 58 renewable deals were announced; a 41% fall in value and a 45% drop in volume from the prior year. Platform acquisitions surged 4.6x in value, however, as financial buyers pivoted to company-level purchases to secure scale and talent. Deloitte points to multi-billion-dollar transactions as examples, such as TPG’s $2.2 billion acquisition of Altus Power and the $1.7 billion sale of National Grid Renewables to Brookfield Asset Management.

Asset-level deals slowed sharply, down 89% in volume in the first eight months of 2025 compared with 2024, Deloitte states. Of the 58.4 GW pipeline capacity transacted, the report estimates that 38% is positioned to meet the safe-harbor deadlines, with 15% already under construction. The report notes that investor focus on hybrid capacity and PPA-backed stability is evidenced by the sale of solar-plus-storage portfolios such as Repsol’s 777 MW portfolio across New Mexico and Texas and Samsung C&T’s 111 MW portfolio in Colorado.

Supply chain agility

Prioritizing alternative sourcing and reshoring is necessary for supply chain agility, according to Deloitte, as FEOC restrictions, changes to the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit, and expanding tariffs raise costs. In addition, trade enforcement actions are intensifying exposure, the report notes. Antidumping and countervailing duties impose tariffs of up to 3,404% on solar imports from four Southeast Asian countries, while Section 232 tariffs add costs to metals.

Deloitte estimates that solar production has expanded sevenfold to 56.5 GW since 2022, outpacing the 2024 demand of 35.3 GW. Yet, cells, wafers, ingots, and polysilicon must still be imported. On the storage side, China supplied 70% of the lithium-ion batteries to the United States in 2024, the report states, with over 83% of the planned 219 GW of grid storage could lose credits under FEOC rules starting in 2026.

“Companies adapting fast can gain an edge,” the report states. An example is firms that are securing non-FEOC inputs for key components. Deloitte estimates that from 2023 to the start of the antidumping and countervailing duties probe by the International Trade Commission in May 2024, developers stockpiled 35 GW of solar modules. At the same time, digital tools and flexible contracting improve visibility, Deloitte said, while executives stress-test strategies via scenario planning.

In the longer term, reshoring and scaling will be important, according to the report. An example given is a leading solar manufacturer that is targeting 14 GW of U.S. module capacity by 2026.

Overall, the report concludes that compressed timelines and intensifying competition will define 2026, with the imperative being to accelerate near-term deployment to capture credits while positioning for continuity through 2030 under safe-harbor and construction-start provisions. Deloitte expects renewable developers to emphasize near-term agility, which includes diversifying inputs, stockpiling, and digitizing visibility, while investing in long-term resilience through reshoring, recycling and partnerships.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/american-public-power-association-XGAZzyLzn18-unsplash-1200x799.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 13:06:42.902320

Bottom lines up front

Mexico, the United States, and Canada have each shifted their energy agendas to emphasize national interests over multilateral coordination.

Beneath surface-level tensions, however, their respective strategic priorities are in alignment, presenting an opportunity to enhance collaboration on energy market integration.

Within this trilateral relationship, Mexico’s role in particular could lean into its domestic priorities to expand energy infrastructure, strengthen its electric vehicle and semiconductor sectors, and develop its mineral wealth.

North America stands at a pivotal juncture as the United States, Canada, and Mexico navigate shifting policy priorities around economic and industrial sovereignty in the energy sector. At the same time, North America boasts an abundance of energy resources in both production and manufacturing capacity. With a solid trilateral trade foundation already in place, Mexico can play a unique role in bolstering regional security resilience through deeper coordination on cross-border supply chains, manufacturing, and energy trade.

Strategic integration of regional energy resources will be critical to realizing North America’s full potential as an energy powerhouse. With its expanding natural gas sector, growing LNG export capacity, and increasing integration and leadership into advanced manufacturing sectors such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, Mexico can strengthen North America’s energy resilience and competitiveness. Enhanced cross-border cooperation on energy infrastructure, supply chains, and technology transfer would drive local energy stability while lowering regional costs and stabilizing the grid.

As global energy value chains become more concentrated and China continues to dominate them, North American energy security takes on a renewed importance. The upcoming United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review offers an opportunity to advance policy coordination, align industrial strategy, and build out more integrated energy markets, securing North America’s collective position as a global energy powerhouse.

The Resolution Copper project, which Rio Tinto co-owns, is specifically cited as a pillar in this framework, positioned to meet a substantial portion of future U.S. copper demand.","Washington has drawn a new line in the global battle for critical minerals. The U.S. Export-Import Bank has issued a $200 million Letter of Interest to REAlloys Inc., a rare-earth company developing what could become North America’s first fully integrated mine-to-magnet supply chain.

The commitment marks one of the clearest signals yet that the United States intends to rebuild the rare-earth infrastructure that China has dominated for a generation.

REAlloys, now completing its merger with Blackboxstocks (NASDAQ: BLBX), plans to link every phase of the rare-earth process under one continental framework: mining at Hoidas Lake in Saskatchewan, processing at the Saskatchewan Research Council’s new separation facility, and magnet manufacturing in Euclid, Ohio.

The Strategic Gap

For more than twenty years, China has occupied every high-value stage of the rare-earth industry. Its producers supply about 70% of mined material but refine nearly 90% of global output and manufacture close to 92% of the world’s permanent magnets, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

That dominance gives Beijing leverage not only over prices, but over downstream industries ranging from electric vehicles to missile guidance and satellite systems.

The advantage stems from a deliberate state policy.

Since the 1990s, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has consolidated hundreds of rare-earth operators under state-backed conglomerates, tied export quotas to processing capacity, and built out low-cost refining hubs in Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi. Western economies, meanwhile, allowed their own refining and metallization capacity to erode. Today, mined concentrates from the United States are still shipped to China for separation before being sold back as finished magnets.

Beginning with restrictions on gallium and germanium and later extending to rare-earth processing technology, Beijing’s tightening export regime in 2025 was a frightening reminder of how much strategic weight that dominance carries. Those moves effectively turned materials that underpin global electrification into instruments of policy.

Washington’s own auditors have reached similar conclusions. The U.S. Government Accountability Office notes that rare-earth magnets underpin not only radar, propulsion, and guidance systems but also core civilian technologies—from electric-vehicle motors and wind-turbine generators to medical imaging equipment and advanced robotics. The United States remains almost entirely dependent on imports for these components, most of them originating in or processed through China. As the GAO warns, without domestic refining and magnet manufacturing, even American-mined rare earths contribute little to supply security or industrial resilience.

Building a Continental Chain

REAlloys’ development blueprint mirrors the anatomy of a modern supply chain rather than a conventional mining venture.

Upstream, its Hoidas Lake project in northern Saskatchewan, one of Canada’s largest undeveloped rare-earth deposits, holds more than two million tonnes of total rare-earth oxides. That resource anchors the raw-material base for an industry Washington once controlled but ceded decades ago.

A few hundred miles south, the Saskatchewan Research Council’s Rare Earth Processing Facility provides the missing link supporting: the mid-stream stage where mined concentrates are refined into high-purity oxides and metals. This is the point at which most Western projects still depend on Chinese processing. REAlloys’ partnership with the SRC gives the company a domestic route for separation and metallization, turning ore into a functional industrial feedstock.

Downstream, the company’s Euclid, Ohio operation, which was expanded through its acquisition of PMT Critical Metals, closes the loop. That facility produces samarium-cobalt and neodymium-iron-boron magnets used in defense, energy, and advanced-manufacturing markets. Locating production inside the U.S. automotive and aerospace corridor is intentional: it shortens logistics, aligns with federal procurement rules, and situates REAlloys within the manufacturing geography that will absorb the product.

The integration of mine, refinery, and magnet plant paints a clear picture of the architecture of Washington’s new industrial policy. Since 2020, the Department of Defense has committed more than $439 million to building a domestic mine-to-magnet capability.

The $200-million financing signal from EXIM extends that strategy into the credit domain, embedding REAlloys within the federal Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative and the broader effort to rebuild critical-materials manufacturing inside allied borders.

Allied Technology Meets North American Resources

October capped a pivotal month for REAlloys.

Just weeks after securing the $200-million financing signal from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the company signed a strategic memorandum of understanding with the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), the state-backed agency overseen by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

The accord outlines cooperation on technology transfer for magnet production, potential co-investment, and structured offtake arrangements for Japanese manufacturers.

Japan’s participation carries both industrial and geopolitical weight.

Its corporations lead the world in precision magnet design and processing efficiency. Embedding that expertise in North America’s production base could accelerate REAlloys’ path from pilot scale to commercial output while aligning with Japan’s own diversification policy. The International Energy Agency identifies closer U.S.–Japan coordination as a cornerstone of allied efforts to reduce exposure to Chinese refining.

For JOGMEC, the agreement extends a long-standing strategy of financing and de-risking non-Chinese rare-earth projects. The agency’s earlier support for Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. in Australia (one of the few large-scale producers operating entirely outside China) became the model for public-private cooperation in critical minerals.

Its partnership with REAlloys marks the first formal alliance with an American rare-earth company and signals a broader convergence of U.S. and Japanese industrial policy around secure magnet supply.

Magnets: The Core Bottleneck

Permanent magnets are the beating heart of the energy transition.

An electric-vehicle motor contains roughly one to two kilograms of neodymium-iron-boron magnets, while a single offshore wind turbine can use several tonnes, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Neodymium Magnets Supply Chain Report, further supported by data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Demand is projected to rise fourfold by 2040 as electrification accelerates, according to the DOE’s 2023 Critical Materials Assessment. There are few practical alternatives. Motors that replace rare-earth magnets with ferrite or induction designs lose efficiency and performance, which are trade-offs most automakers are unwilling to make.

This imbalance is starkly reflected in price volatility. A case in point: Rare-earth oxide benchmarks spiked after China’s April 2025 export controls, a pattern tracked in the IEA’s market snapshot.

Execution, Risk, and Geography

Re-establishing magnet capacity outside China remains technically demanding. High-purity solvent extraction, metallization, and sintering require precision engineering that took China decades to perfect. That’s why the GAO continues to warn that magnets underpin U.S. weapon-system reliability and that diversification progress is uneven.

The U.S. policy framework is meant to close that gap. The DoD’s multi-year mine-to-magnet program and EXIM’s critical-minerals credit guarantees are designed to bridge early-stage financing and shield projects from predatory pricing. The current suite of letters of interest–including $2.2 billion across allied mineral projects–represents Washington’s most assertive industrial intervention in decades.

REAlloys’ geographic footprint adds insulation. Saskatchewan offers low-cost power and regulatory stability. Ohio provides skilled labor and proximity to automotive, aerospace, and defense clients. Both facilities operate within the long-standing U.S.-Canada defense-trade framework, which permits joint sourcing and procurement for sensitive programs.

From Policy to Proof

It’s been a decisive stretch for REAlloys. The company’s leadership bench deepened in October when GM Defense President Stephen duMont took the role of non-executive chairman, tying REAlloys directly into the defense-industrial ecosystem and giving it access to a network that understands procurement cycles and federal contracting.

The next test is execution.

The $200-million Letter of Interest from EXIM now moves toward definitive financing.

Construction and commissioning of the Saskatchewan Research Council’s processing line will determine how quickly feedstock can reach the company’s magnet plant in Ohio. At the same time, structured offtake agreements with U.S. defense buyers and Japanese manufacturers are expected to anchor early demand.

Beyond being simple milestones, these are indicators of whether Washington’s critical-minerals policy can produce an end-to-end system that actually works. The International Energy Agency calls the emerging U.S.-Japan-Canada-Australia network a “diversification imperative,” not an attempt to match China ton for ton.

REAlloys fits squarely inside that framework: upstream resources, midstream refining, and downstream manufacturing contained within allied borders.

If the company hits its targets, it would deliver something the West hasn’t had in decades: a complete, transparent rare-earth supply chain from mine to magnet. In this way, REAlloys has become the text case for whether Washington’s new playbook can work.

Other companies to keep an eye on in the critical resources race

MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP) stands as the sole operator of a large-scale integrated rare earth mining and processing facility in North America: Mountain Pass in California. The company primarily produces rare earth materials like neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), which are vital for the powerful permanent magnets found in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, and defense systems.

The company's strategic vision has been underscored by a flurry of high-profile announcements this year, signaling a major push toward full vertical integration. In a landmark development, the United States Department of Defense announced a significant investment that will make it the largest shareholder, a clear demonstration of Washington's commitment to accelerating domestic rare earth magnet independence.

Despite a backdrop of volatile global commodity prices, which have impacted its quarterly revenue, the company's stock has shown resilience, often surging on news of domestic supply chain security efforts. Investors are focused less on near-term profitability fluctuations and more on the long-term, strategic value derived from government partnerships and the ambitious plan to start full-scale NdPr magnet manufacturing in Texas.

While traditionally known as a leading domestic uranium producer, Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU) has rapidly diversified its business to become a prominent player in the critical minerals space, especially rare earth elements. The company utilizes its White Mesa Mill in Utah—the only conventional uranium mill in operation in the United States—to process monazite, a rare earth-bearing mineral, into an intermediate rare earth carbonate product.

In recent months, the company's financial announcements have led to some market choppiness. Specifically, its plan to raise significant capital through the private placement of convertible senior notes was met with a stock price dip, as investors reacted to the potential for future equity dilution.

As global momentum shifts toward both clean energy and domestic sourcing of strategic materials, Energy Fuels continues to push forward, securing new feedstock agreements to solidify its position as a multi-commodity critical minerals supplier, demonstrating a long-term commitment to capitalizing on the geopolitical emphasis on supply chain resilience.

Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE: LAC) has cemented its position as a critical element in the North American electric vehicle (EV) supply chain, primarily through its development of the Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This site hosts one of the largest known lithium deposits in North America, and its successful development is seen as foundational to reducing the continent's reliance on foreign lithium sources for battery production.

The sheer national importance of Thacker Pass has generated significant non-traditional investment and political support. In a landmark move, the company successfully closed on a $2.23 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Furthermore, this month saw the U.S. government announce a direct equity stake in the company, a dramatic shift that underscores the urgency of securing domestic lithium supply.

This level of governmental and corporate backing—including a major multi-year offtake agreement with General Motors (GM)—has made Lithium Americas a highly responsive stock to political and project news. Despite the typical volatility associated with development-stage mining projects, the stock's recent performance has been driven by these strategic, nation-building partnerships.

As one of the world's preeminent lithium producers, Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB) is a behemoth in the chemicals and critical materials industry, with significant operations in lithium, bromine, and catalysts. The company’s lithium division is the key driver of its critical minerals profile, supplying the fundamental raw material for the battery cathodes that power the global fleet of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

The last year has been defined by the dramatic volatility of global lithium prices, which plummeted after a period of extreme highs. This pricing pressure has severely impacted Albemarle’s stock performance and near-term profitability outlook, despite consistent growth in sales volumes. Recent news, however, suggests the market may be reaching a cyclical bottom, sparking renewed investor optimism.

While long-term expansion plans in Australia and Chile continue, management is strategically balancing the necessity of capital expenditure for future demand with the current need to maintain a strong balance sheet. For the stock, continued improvement in the lithium spot price is the critical catalyst, positioning the company as a key beneficiary of an eventual market rebound.

Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE: SQM) is a Chilean chemical and mining company with global operations, standing as one of the world's largest producers of lithium, as well as being a significant player in specialized plant nutrition, iodine, and industrial chemicals. Its operations in the Atacama Desert give it access to some of the highest-grade lithium brine deposits globally, making it a pivotal supplier for the electric vehicle and high-tech manufacturing sectors. The firm’s diversified portfolio, however, offers a crucial buffer against commodity price swings.

The recent period has been marked by a mixed financial performance, showcasing the value of its diversified business model. While SQM's lithium segment saw profitability challenges due to a sharp drop in lithium prices, its iodine segment unexpectedly emerged as a standout performer, cushioning the overall earnings. This resilience highlights the strategic importance of its non-lithium commodities.

Despite the recent price volatility in the lithium market, the company is aggressively pursuing a massive expansion plan, budgeting heavily for both lithium and its other segments. This includes boosting its lithium carbonate and hydroxide capacities in Chile and Australia, underscoring management's confidence in the long-term, secular growth of the EV market.

Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX) is a leading international mining company with a primary focus on copper, a mineral deemed critical for global electrification, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. The company is one of the world's largest publicly traded copper producers, with significant assets in North America, South America, and Indonesia, including the massive Grasberg complex. It also holds substantial reserves of molybdenum and gold, which often serve as valuable co-products.

Recent financial results showed the company effectively navigating operational challenges, with earnings and sales beating analyst estimates largely due to higher realized copper prices. While production volumes saw a temporary dip due to an isolated operational incident at one of its key sites, the strong market price for copper and gold helped buoy the quarter.

Looking ahead, the company is focused on increasing copper production and lowering its unit net cash costs to capitalize on the robust long-term demand forecast for the metal. Its stock often acts as a proxy for the broader health of the copper market, reacting strongly to news of global economic growth, infrastructure spending, and, most importantly, the pace of the clean energy transition.

Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO), a majority-owned subsidiary of Grupo México, is one of the world's largest copper producers, with extensive mining, exploration, and smelting operations primarily in Peru and Mexico. Copper is its core product, a material essential to modern infrastructure and, critically, to electric vehicle and renewable energy technologies. The company also produces significant by-products, including molybdenum, zinc, and silver.

The firm has recently seen a strong positive reaction from the market following the news of a major regulatory breakthrough for its long-stalled Tía María copper project in Peru. After years of political and social hurdles, the company received a key government approval, setting the stage for expanded production capacity in the future.

SCCO's strategy is centered on significant capital investments aimed at expanding its mine capacity across its Latin American assets. In addition to the Tía María news, the company is benefiting from the full ramp-up of its Buenavista zinc concentrator, which will boost its overall zinc production—another critical mineral. The company's stock price, while volatile, is closely correlated with global copper prices, and its recent project progress suggests an ability to finally unlock its vast, high-quality resource potential.

Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), the world's largest gold producer, has significantly expanded its profile as a critical minerals company through the large-scale copper assets it holds and its recent corporate maneuvering. While gold remains the anchor of its business, the company is strategically positioned with substantial copper reserves, which are becoming increasingly important for future growth and diversification.

The company has been making headlines recently regarding potential consolidation in the mining sector. Following a leadership change, analysts have speculated on the potential for a deeper strategic alliance or even a merger with Barrick Gold, its partner in the giant Nevada Gold Mines complex. Such a combination, if realized, would not only create a gold super-major but would also consolidate significant copper and other critical mineral assets, reshaping the global mining landscape.

While the market's focus remains primarily on the gold price, Newmont's growing exposure to copper ensures it remains relevant in the broader discussion about critical materials essential for the energy transition.

BHP Group (NYSE: BHP) is a multinational mining giant and one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization, with a diverse portfolio spanning iron ore, copper, coal, and nickel. Its designation as a critical mineral player comes from its massive scale in copper and nickel production—both fundamental materials for electric batteries, grid infrastructure, and sustainable technologies.

Recent news has focused on the company's involvement in major initiatives, including the US-Australia Critical Minerals Framework, which aims to accelerate allied-nation supply chains and may unlock financing for key projects.

Despite global price volatility in some of its key metals, the company's long-term commitment to critical minerals positions it as an essential, foundational supplier for the next generation of industrial technology.

Rio Tinto Group (NYSE: RIO) is a diversified global mining leader, best known for its aluminum and iron ore assets, but it holds a crucial and growing role in the critical minerals space, particularly copper and lithium. The company is making substantial investments to expand its copper portfolio, notably with the massive Resolution Copper joint venture in the U.S. and its large-scale Mongolian copper operations. It is also advancing a significant lithium project in Serbia.

The Resolution Copper project, which Rio Tinto co-owns, is specifically cited as a pillar in this framework, positioned to meet a substantial portion of future U.S. copper demand. This governmental attention provides a layer of strategic importance that transcends typical market dynamics.

The stock's stability is often a reflection of its vast, profitable iron ore business, but its growth narrative is increasingly being defined by its proactive push into battery metals, making it a well-diversified play on the global energy transition.

In its Q2 earnings report, the utility reported a 14 percent Year-on-Year growth in operating earnings per share, driven primarily by new data center growth, which accounts for the bulk of the total incremental load growth of 24GW The utility also reported that approximately 2GW of data center load came online in Q3 alone.
“Regions with concentrated data center and industrial development, including AEP's footprint, are emerging as clear winners.
“For that reason, we have secured commission approvals for data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia, with pending tariff filings in Michigan, Texas, and Virginia,” he said.
AEP is one of the country’s biggest electric utility companies, serving 11 US states, including data center hotspots Ohio and Texas.","In its Q3 earnings report, the company reported that all 28GW of load is signed to a take-or-pay electric service agreement or a letter of agreement, meaning they are tied to binding financial agreements. According to the utility, the customers driving most of the growth are substantial market players, including Google, AWS, and Meta.

In its Q2 earnings report, the utility reported a 14 percent Year-on-Year growth in operating earnings per share, driven primarily by new data center growth, which accounts for the bulk of the total incremental load growth of 24GW

The utility also reported that approximately 2GW of data center load came online in Q3 alone.

“Regions with concentrated data center and industrial development, including AEP's footprint, are emerging as clear winners. Large annual capital budgets from hyperscalers totaling hundreds of billions of dollars reinforce the conviction, strength, and staying power of this demand growth,” said William J. Fehrman, CEO of AEP, during the call.

As a result of this growth, the utility said it expects system peak demand of 65GW by 2030 across its diversified service territory, particularly in Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas.

“This growth is fueled by data centers, reshoring of manufacturing, and further economic development, which we expect to create jobs in local communities and maintain affordability as our load grows by almost 76 percent in the next five years,” said Fehrman.

Fehrman also stressed the importance of making sure that the costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly. “For that reason, we have secured commission approvals for data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia, with pending tariff filings in Michigan, Texas, and Virginia,” he said. The measures, Fehrman argued, are “designed to protect other customers from bearing the cost of grid improvements required to meet the energy demands of large load customers.”

In July, Ohio regulators approved new rules that would require new data center customers to pay for a minimum of 85 percent of the energy they say they need each month, even if they use less, to cover the cost of infrastructure required to bring electricity to those facilities. As a result of the tariff in October, the utility updated its pipeline of interconnection requests, with demand reportedly falling from more than 30GW of requests to 13GW.

In the earnings report, the utility also announced a new, increased long-term operating earnings growth rate of 7-9 percent over the next five years, bolstered by a $72 billion capital plan and supported by an expected ten percent annual growth in rate base. The $72bn will be split between $30bn for transmission infrastructure, $20bn for generation, and $17bn for distribution.

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-30 14:35:41+00:00,North East Bylines | Powerful Citizen Journalism,Miliband's clean energy plan offers real hope and must not be watered down,Peter Sagar,,,,,https://northeastbylines.co.uk/news/environment/milibands-clean-energy-plan-offers-real-hope-and-must-not-be-watered-down/,"It was reported on 19 October that the government had unveiled the country’s first ever national clean jobs plan.
Under Miliband’s new scheme, if all goes to plan, and the plan isn’t watered down, employment in this crucial area is expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.
Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly.
While that energy used to be coal, in the future it will be green carbon-free energy sources.
We have already seen the government’s original plans for a £28 billion investment in the green economy being heavily diluted, before the election even took place last year.","It was reported on 19 October that the government had unveiled the country’s first ever national clean jobs plan. This was an announcement that was long awaited, and sees the government hoping to create as many as 400,000 new jobs in 31 priority occupations such as electricians, welders, and plumbers.

Under Miliband’s new scheme, if all goes to plan, and the plan isn’t watered down, employment in this crucial area is expected to double to 860,000 by 2030. As part of a just transition, gas and oil workers will not be victims of the Green Transition, but instead will benefit from up to £20mn in total to fund bespoke careers training coming from the UK and Scottish Governments.

This is very welcome news for all who have campaigned for a long time not only for a transition to a carbon neutral economy, but for a just transition, which will protect those working in the oil and gas sectors at present.

However, there is potentially more; a New Statesman report goes on to say:

“More interestingly, this plan signals a clear leftward shift from Miliband (who is often held up as a vanguard of the ‘soft-left’ in the cabinet). The plan also includes several key employment rights measures that trade unions have long been calling for. And as a result, it has been enthusiastically backed by some of net zero’s loudest critics within the trade union movement, including representatives from GMB, Unite, Prospect, Community, and a raft of others. Their concerns congregate around worries that the clean power transition will not treat oil and gas, and other industrial workers fairly. By laying out a clear four-year strategy for clean power jobs, the Energy Secretary hopes to assuage those concerns.”

Indeed, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will close the current loophole in employment rights legislation which means that those working further than 12 miles offshore do not benefit from the full raft of workers’ rights, as part of the offer to the unions. In this way, serious benefits for those working in offshore wind will be offered and the intention is for more people to be attracted to the sector.

It is further noted that, “the department will also set up new fair work charters which stipulate that if a clean power company (in offshore wind, or solar power, for example) wants to take up the government’s clean energy bonus, they must be able to provide clear evidence that they have good industrial relations and have a recognised union for employees. Clean Power companies have grown under the government’s renewed charge towards green energy: this stipulation in Miliband’s Clean Power Jobs plan will encourage them to give back.”

This plan must not be watered down

This is very encouraging news in an area which is vital to both the economy and the environment of the country, and perhaps particularly to a region like the North East. It has been noted before on NE Bylines that we need to move towards a green economy in our region, that can not only help the environment, but also provide good jobs for our young people in a thriving and sustainable economy. We should perhaps stop seeing ourselves as an ex-coal mining region, with all the connotations of decline, unemployment and outward migration and present ourselves as an energy producing region. While that energy used to be coal, in the future it will be green carbon-free energy sources.

Indeed, we are already doing this. Wind turbines being built at Port of Tyne for what will be the biggest wind farm in the world on Dogger Bank in the North Sea, as well as geothermal energy from old mine workings in Gateshead and at Horden in County Durham.

So far, so good. But unfortunately, with this government, there must be a caveat. So many of Labour’s initial plans in many areas including the environment have been watered down, that there must be concern that this might happen here as well. We have already seen the government’s original plans for a £28 billion investment in the green economy being heavily diluted, before the election even took place last year. The plan announced on 19 October, must not be watered down as it offers hope for the environment and the economy – and a crucial political opportunity to take on Reform.

For it is clear that Reform-led councils like County Durham don’t understand the economic as well as environmental potential for a just transition to a green economy. Indeed, Reform in County Durham seem determined to go the other way and have scrapped the Climate Emergency and Net Zero pledge that County Durham Council had previously announced. It seems a shame that County Durham Council don’t see the potential for new jobs and regional revival that a just transition to a green economy gives us here in the North East.

A clear contrast with Reform 2025 Ltd.

This contrast between the positive Miliband plans and the negativity of Reform has been taken up by Ed Miliband himself who, on the day that the plans were announced spoke to the Mirror saying:

“The message of this clean energy jobs plan to Mirror readers is we’re gonna deliver for our heartland communities, and that’s what these jobs will do.

“Reform has said they want to wage war on green energy investment, and that means waging war on these jobs, on the Siemens workers and the jobs in Hull, on the new jobs at the cable factory in Scotland, at the jobs in the Isle of Wight making wind turbines, at the carbon capture and storage in Teesside.

“All of these jobs are being created, they’re at risk under a different government and they are absolutely core to our vision of the future and how we change the country.

“We know that the Net Zero economy grew three times faster than the economy as a whole last year. [Reform’s war on green jobs-] It’s anti-business, it’s anti-worker, it’s totally betraying young people and the future of young people.”

Reform doesn’t seem to have anything to offer for the future, but simply wants to wind back the clock to some idyll that never really existed. Meanwhile Labour need to up their game as well, to ensure that this is only the first of many bold and positive announcements of government policy in a number of areas. Then they will start to truly deliver the change they promised at the last election, and that the people of this country so desperately want.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/ce24c752563159efdd0b242a2bf74be5ca572df354694e007e4d95614942598f/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Fnwb0.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F10%252FEnergy_Secretary_Ed_Miliband_attends_COP29_54136365441.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Miliband%25E2%2580%2599s%2520clean%2520energy%2520plan%2520offers%2520real%2520hope%2520and%2520must%2520not%2520be%2520watered%2520down%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fenvironment%2Fmilibands-clean-energy-plan-offers-real-hope-and-must-not-be-watered-down,N,,2025-10-30 11:21:41.838808

The EPA is committed to combating per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination. This work will be guided by the following principles: strengthening the science, fulfilling statutory obligations, enhancing communication, and building partnerships.

Advancing scientific understanding through the PFAS testing strategy

In April 2025, the agency stated it would implement a PFAS testing strategy under TSCA Section 4 to seek scientific information informed by hazard characteristics and exposure pathways. EPA is exploring ways to refine this strategy to ensure it accurately reflects the President’s directives, does not create undue burden for industry, and protects human health and the environment.

International cooperation on AFFF phase-out

EPA is working with international partners in the Arctic to address PFAS contamination resulting from the application of Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF). The EPA recently co-hosted the AFFF Phase Out in the Arctic Workshop in Helsinki, Finland, with Arctic stakeholders from the oil and gas, defence, government, and indigenous communities. The workshop focused on transitioning away from firefighting foams that contain PFAS and seeking alternatives to AFFF used in firefighting activities.

The two-day workshop took place at the Finnish Environment Institute and was conducted through the Arctic Contaminants Action Program of the Arctic Council. Experts presented on research, programmes, and expertise related to PFAS/AFFF analysis, removal, remediation, and stock destruction, as well as shared case studies on actions taken to transition from AFFF. Experts further shared views on the range of alternatives and their effectiveness in remote Arctic commercial and military airports and at energy and fuel supply facilities. Many of the alternatives are effective and safer in the environment and meet the new US military specification to qualify as alternatives to AFFF.

Finland shared plans for a Phase 2 project, and participants scoped out next steps to develop a project in Alaska, Canada and Greenland to identify AFFF stocks as well as refinements to guidance for communities to remove AFFF from firefighting facilities.

EPA is convening technical sub-groups that started in July 2025 and expects to begin project work in the fall of 2025.

Strengthening regulations and safe drinking water standards

EPA’s great work on PFAS started under the first Trump Administration, and that work is continuing today. On April 28, the agency announced a suite of actions to address PFAS, including in water. On May 14, 2025, the EPA announced its intent to keep the existing maximum contaminant levels (or MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS, while extending their compliance deadlines.

EPA also intends to rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the hazard index mixture of these three plus PFBS. This second action will ensure that the agency’s regulatory determinations and any resulting drinking water regulations follow the legal process laid out in the Safe Drinking Water Act. The agency plans to issue two proposed regulations in the coming months to advance progress on these intentions. After EPA completes these two actions, the Agency will follow the Safe Drinking Water Act’s legal process to determine which additional PFAS should be regulated. While EPA cannot pre-determine the outcome, it is possible that the result could be more stringent requirements.

In the near term, many water systems are complying with state regulations or taking proactive steps to reduce PFAS in drinking water. EPA is actively working to ensure that drinking water systems will be able to comply when they go into effect.

Supporting communities through the PFAS OUTreach initiative

This year, the agency is launching a new PFAS OUTreach Initiative (called PFAS OUT) to connect with every public water system known to need system upgrades to address PFAS, including those finding PFOA and PFOS in their water. The agency will share resources, tools, funding information, and technical assistance opportunities to help ensure that no community is left behind as we work to protect public health and position water systems for compliance with PFAS drinking water standards. PFAS OUT will engage utilities, technical assistance providers and local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders to develop effective and practical solutions where they are needed most.

Additionally, EPA’s suite of Water Technical Assistance (WaterTA) initiatives provides free expertise to water systems to improve their drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater and help communities access available funding. In particular, EPA’s Tackling Emerging Contaminants (TEC) WaterTA initiative works with water systems nationwide to identify affordable solutions to assess and address PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS.

TEC services include water quality testing, technical plan development, operator training support, designing public engagement & outreach strategies, support for accessing federal funding opportunities, and more. The agency also recognises that water systems are passive receivers of PFAS, and it is committed to addressing PFAS at the source and holding polluters accountable.

Enforcement and accountability

EPA will focus its CERCLA enforcement efforts on holding responsible those who significantly contribute to the release of PFAS into the environment, including parties that manufactured PFAS or used PFAS in the manufacturing process, federal facilities, and other industrial parties. EPA does not intend to pursue otherwise potentially responsible parties where equitable factors do not support seeking response actions or costs under CERCLA, including community water systems and publicly owned treatment works. EPA can also provide contribution protection through settlements to parties it does not intend to pursue for CERCLA cleanup. A party that resolves its liability through a CERCLA settlement with the United States will not be liable for third-party contribution claims related to the matters addressed in the settlement.

Driving innovation in PFAS treatment technologies

Concerns about the effectiveness of current, widely used technologies for managing PFAS and PFAS-containing materials have motivated efforts to develop new technologies and apply existing technologies to PFAS materials. EPA is aware of and, in some cases, has participated in efforts to identify, develop, and test non-thermal destruction technologies for PFAS-containing materials. EPA efforts to identify and test emerging technologies are described in Section 6 of the agency’s Interim Guidance on the Destruction and Disposal of PFAS and Materials Containing PFAS. The interim guidance also includes a technology evaluation framework that provides a transparent, consistent approach for evaluating destruction and disposal technologies for PFAS materials. The framework can be used by managers of PFAS-containing materials and others to evaluate emerging destruction and disposal technologies and to inform decisions about managing PFAS-containing materials.

Transparency and public engagement

EPA is committed to providing meaningful, understandable, and actionable information on PFAS to the American public. The information provided on EPA’s PFAS webpages contains important background information needed to understand the details of specific actions EPA takes to address PFAS, and other emerging events related to PFAS.

EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention releases announcements geared toward stakeholders and the public when it takes important actions to protect human health and the environment from the risks presented by chemicals. These announcements are sent out to those who sign up for email alerts about pollution prevention and toxic chemicals news. A link to sign up for the email alerts is available on EPA’s website.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples.
“Natural gas remains the single most important source of power in ERCOT,” TXOGA Chief Economist Dr. Dean Foreman said in a news release.
Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation.

According to the report, total electricity demand in ERCOT rose 4.2% year over year in Q3 2025, marking a 25% increase since 2020, as population, industrial activity, and data center growth continue to expand. Natural gas supplied 47.6% of ERCOT’s total generation, more than wind and solar combined, while thermal and other dispatchable resources provided at least half of ERCOT’s power in more than 90% of all hours this quarter.

“The oil and natural gas industry is both a major electricity consumer and the supplier of the natural gas that fuels nearly half of Texas’ power,” said TXOGA President Todd Staples. “Reliable and affordable electricity is a key pillar in the foundation of the Lone State State’s economy, and natural gas generation continues to ensure both, powering homes, businesses, and industry while supporting continued economic prosperity and environmental progress.”

ERCOT’s total generation has increased nearly 25% over the past five years, with natural gas, wind, and solar driving most of the gains. Yet even as renewable generation expands, firm, dispatchable power remains essential. The region’s net peak load, the maximum hourly level of power required when wind and solar output decline, reached approximately 70 gigawatts (GW) in Q3 2025, underscoring the capacity ERCOT must maintain to ensure grid reliability.

“Natural gas remains the single most important source of power in ERCOT,” TXOGA Chief Economist Dr. Dean Foreman said in a news release. “It offers unmatched scale, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness — the stability Texans depend on to meet rising demand, integrate renewables, and keep electricity affordable.”

The report also highlights the abundance of Texas natural gas supply. TXOGA estimates that Texas produced an average of 28.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of dry natural gas in Q3 2025, about four times more than ERCOT’s power sector consumed. Total in-state consumption averaged 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for electricity generation. Since 2020, power-sector gas use has increased 15%, reflecting sustained growth in dispatchable generation and industrial demand.

He remembers where he came from, as you can also see with his wonderful family.” Fun Facts: Rich Walsh","Valero Energy General Counsel Rich Walsh watched in astonishment in 2022 and 2023 as major petroleum-related companies were silent as the Environmental Protection Agency allowed California to set more stringent fuel admission standards than required by federal law.

“This was an existential threat to our business and hundreds of other businesses, and I was shocked that no one else wanted to take it on,” Walsh told The Texas Lawbook.

The EPA and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration granted California a waiver that, in essence, mandated that automotive manufacturers must produce electric vehicles instead of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The California regulations would force consumers to purchase vehicles that run on electricity instead of liquid fuels.

“Although Valero has historically not taken the lead on this type of litigation, Mr. Walsh led the charge to round up a smaller coalition and one trade association to file lawsuits challenging these regulations,” Valero Senior Managing Counsel Megan Quinn said.

On June 20, 2025, Walsh’s efforts paid off when the U.S. Supreme Court handed Valero a sweeping victory.

“Sometimes it is very evident when we are very right, and I knew from the start that this was one of those times,” Walsh said.

The win at the Supreme Court was only one of Walsh’s tremendous successes in 2024 and 2025.

As a result, the Association of Corporate Counsel’s San Antonio Chapter and The Lawbook have named Walsh as the recipient of the 2025 San Antonio Corporate Counsel Award for General Counsel of the Year for a Large Legal Department (21 or more lawyers).

Walsh and 11 other San Antonio area general counsel will be honored on Nov. 6 at the first-ever San Antonio Corporate Counsel Awards ceremony hosted by ACC and The Lawbook.

Premium Subscriber Q&A: Walsh addresses “nuclear verdicts” and what outside counsel needs to know about him.

“Mr. Walsh has played a pivotal role in shaping Valero’s legal strategy across multiple domains, both domestically and internationally,” said Quinn, who nominated Walsh for the award. “His creativity and ability to think strategically is unmatched. He has made a lasting impact at Valero, throughout communities and in the lives of those around him. His leadership has been instrumental in navigating complex legal landscapes during major corporate transactions, political and regulatory shifts.”

“Mr. Walsh is known for his collaborative leadership style, deep legal acumen and commitment to corporate integrity and community,” she said. “He challenges those around him to think critically, creatively and develop outside-the-box solutions.”

Dowd Bennett partner James Bennett, who has worked with Valero on critical matters for more than two decades, said Walsh is “attuned to the need to find solutions that were best for the communities where Valero operated, the company’s employees, its shareholders and the government regulators whom he works with very effectively.”

“Rich is unmatched as a creative thinker, and his judgment has led to remarkable achievements by Valero and the team he has built,” Bennett said. “He identifies novel approaches to sometimes long-standing issues where the conventional wisdom has never worked before. He has extremely good instincts and, equally importantly, trusts them. He is a great general counsel because he is thoughtful and extremely effective at setting strategic goals and also identifying where his personal time is most valuable.”

Hired by Valero as an in-house counsel in 1999, Walsh was promoted to general counsel in 2020.

“My job now is like being the Oracle of Delphi — I have an incredibly competent team, so by the time a problem gets to me, its intractable,” Walsh said. “So, I hold audiences, they present their dilemmas to me, and I give guidance or chart a course. The only difference is I don’t require incense or offerings.”

Walsh oversees a legal department of 40 attorneys and 25 other professionals. The company has added the duties of risk management, compliance, insurance, governmental affairs, ESG and health, safety and environment to Walsh’s portfolio and the 158 employees in those departments.

Quinn said that Walsh has scored numerous achievements beyond engineering the historic Supreme Court victory, including:

Developing a leading government relations team at the international, federal and state levels;

Growing Valero’s PAC to become a very influential voice in the policy arena;

Creating a best-in-class ESG engagement process, developing an innovative environmental and safety audit program, putting in place one of the first environmental justice policies in the industry; and

Leading the most successful United Way campaign in company history, raising more than $21 million.

Justice Lori Massey Brissette, a former corporate executive at USAA and Northwestern Mutual who was appointed to the Texas Fourth Court of Appeals last year, said that Walsh helped “mold me into the kind of attorney and judge that I am today.”

“Rich would ensure that the company understood the facts, would consider the risk and potential liability and would bat around with me the legal issues to be addressed,” said Justice Brissette, who represented Valero when she was in private practice. “Having that kind of character at the helm of a major corporate legal department is critical.”

Walsh’s Path to Law & Valero

Walsh was born in Downey, California, a community about a dozen miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles.

“But we reversed Grapes of Wrath and moved back to where my mother grew up in Oklahoma,” he said. “So, I claim Oklahoma as the place where I grew up. My mother worked a lot of jobs over her life, but up until a couple months before her recent passing, she was still employed organizing events at Astro Bowl on Austin Highway.

Walsh’s first job came when he was 16 managing the pet department at Walmart. He had plans to move into management but was informed that he needed a college education first.

He first attended night school at Tulsa Junior College and then the University of Oklahoma, where he initially studied pre-med.

“But then I discovered that I didn’t like working with blood,” he said. “So, I changed course. I grew up very poor, and I was very driven to succeed because of that.”

After earning his bachelor’s degree from OU, Walsh went to work for Williams Pipeline as a pipeline operator. But he kept remembering that he had taken the LSAT before graduation, and he scored very well.

He decided to return to OU for law school. There he met his wife, Georgia, who became a senior lawyer drafting legislation for Texas Senator Phil Gramm.

After graduating from OU with his law degree in 1992, he accepted a position with Phillips Petroleum in its Oklahoma oil and gas section.

The position lasted half of a day.

“I walked in for my first day of work and the receptionist was crying,” he said. “She told me they had all been laid off. They were closing the office the very day I started.”

Walsh walked to the office where he had been assigned and found a “welcome basket” that included a Phillips coffee cup. Then came instructions to relocate to Phillips HQ to work in the litigation department.

Over the next few years with Phillips, Walsh worked in Venezuela, Norway and the United Kingdom.

In 1999, he joined the legal department at Valero and has steadily moved up the ranks.

“I was looking to come back to the U.S. after having worked internationally,” he said. “I started out as one of two in the litigation, labor and regulatory group at Valero.”

Walsh said his biggest challenges at Valero “are confidential and privileged, but clearly, navigating the company through COVID and the pretty significant external pressures that are imposed on companies these days.”

Two dates in 2025 certainly standout from the rest.

April 23 was when Walsh, for the first time in his career, stepped inside the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell argue the case against the EPA over the California car emission restrictions.

“I was amazed at how close you are to the justices,” he said, referring to the courtroom. “It is much more intimate than I imagined. And I had never been in a place where 100 people sat so absolutely quiet.”

Valero had filed the lawsuit under the name of its subsidiary, Diamond Alternative Energy. The original complaint was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, as required by the U.S. Clean Air Act, and challenged the EPA’s decision during the Biden administration to allow California to set its own standards for vehicle emissions and electric cars.

The legal argument was that the federal government had exceeded its authority to grant California the exception, which they argued would have cost the fuel industry billions of dollars annually.

The D.C. Circuit rejected the lawsuit, claiming Valero did not have standing to challenge the EPA’s decision.

Valero appealed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.

“The government has tilted the playing field and foreclosed us from being able to freely sell our product,” Sullivan & Cromwell partner Jeffrey Wall, who represented Valero, told the justices.

As oral argument concluded, Chief Justice John Roberts recognized retiring U.S. Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler for presenting a record 160th argument before the nation’s highest court.

“I had a pretty good day,” Walsh said. “I got sworn in at the U.S. Supreme Court. We argued our case, but I got to watch a standing applause led by the justices for a solicitor general of the U.S. who had just given his final argument — albeit against us — before the court. [Kneedler] holds the record for the most cases argued before the U.S. Supreme Court and served through numerous administrations. That was pretty awesome.”

But June 30, Walsh acknowledges, was an even better day.

The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, said the appeals court had wrongly dismissed Valero’s challenge to the EPA’s exemption.

“The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority.

Christopher Carroll, a partner at Kennedys who has worked with Walsh over 17 years, said the Valero GC has a creative intelligence that is rare.

“With the size and complexity of a corporation like Valero, the issues Rich confronts on a daily basis are varied and fraught with challenges and difficulties,” Carroll said. “Valero is at the apex of the energy industry in no small part because of how Rich deals with all those challenges and difficulties.”

Valero Litigation Section Chief Alex Miller said that Walsh’s “strategic vision” is what sets him apart.

“When analyzing an issue, Rich doesn’t just think several steps ahead, he approaches each issue in the context of its broader impact on business dynamics and long-term strategy, often weaving in references to historic battles,” Miller said. “Working with Rich keeps me sharp and has made me a stronger strategic thinker.”

Mike Eaves, a partner at Calvert Eaves Clarke & Stelly in Beaumont, said Walsh is a “formidable adversary when it comes to protecting Valero’s interests in the legal arena,” but he said Walsh also “cultivates relationships with opponents with an eye toward the larger picture of what he is attempting to ultimately accomplish.”

“For example, prior to Valero’s acquisition of the Port Arthur refinery, the facility’s previous owners were constantly being attacked, harangued and sued by numerous civic groups based on a myriad of real and/or perceived environmental issues,” Eaves told The Lawbook. “Most of these complaints were unfounded, and they were therefore defended aggressively by the prior refinery owners in numerous multi-party legal actions. This endless stream of lawsuits only led to further frustration on the part of the company and ever-increasing acrimony with the community in a continuous Boolean Loop of litigation.”

“After Valero acquired the facility, Rich studied the situation and the issues involved,” he said. “He then reached out to local community activists and was able to forge an amicable — and litigation-free — relationship built on trust and mutual respect, and that peaceful relationship between Valero and the Port Arthur community exists to this day.”

“Rich is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met. In addition to being a brilliant attorney and a shrewd legal strategist, he takes ‘thinking outside the box’ to an entirely new level; it is an ability that has served him well over the years as Valero’s general counsel,” Eaves said.

Lawyers who work with Valero said Walsh has built an incredible legal team and he trusts the team to execute on his vision.

“Rich takes the time to know each individual person on his team at a personal level, including their strengths and aspirations for their own development,” Bennett of Dowd Bennett said. “This leads to a collaborative approach where every member is playing to their greatest strengths.”

“Rich has seen it and done it all in his industry, starting with going to law school at Oklahoma, to studying at Oxford in England, and practicing law in Norway,” he said. “Not a bad run for someone who’s best stories are still about an early job running the live animal sales department at his local Wal-Mart. He remembers where he came from, as you can also see with his wonderful family.”

They focused on expanding public transit, reducing food waste, lowering home energy costs, supporting green workforce development, building more-resilient landscapes, securing federal and state resources, and much more.

Since then, the MI Healthy Climate (MHC) Fellows program – originally the MI Healthy Climate Corps – successfully completed its first and second cohorts and is preparing to launch its third and final round under the current budget.

Applications are being accepted through Nov. 17 for the 2026 cohort of 15 fellows who will serve from Jan. 21-Dec. 18. An informational webinar recording is available, and host communities and agencies are listed below. With opportunities serving communities across the state on projects across all areas of Michigan’s climate action efforts, applicants will apply directly to the project and host community that fit their skills and interests.

“Hosts gain the energy and know-how to carry out programs and initiatives that wouldn’t otherwise be possible,” said Jordan Power, senior climate action officer in EGLE’s Office of Climate and Energy. “Fellows gain invaluable experience and connections that will shape their futures, joining a network of climate leaders already making great impact across the state.”

“Our climate fellows are like gardeners cultivating fertile ground,” said Angel Squalls, who manages the program through the nonprofit Community Economic Development Association of Michigan. “Together we’ve learned we can plant the seeds, enjoy the journey, and see our efforts grow.”

The second Fellows’ cohort of 27 members has just wrapped up its yearlong term of service. Here’s a snapshot of a few of their efforts:

Mason Christerfield, Detroit 2030 District – Serving as a building data analyst for the public-private partnership, Christerfield helped reduce energy and water consumption at more than 100 properties while advancing sustainability and helping nonprofits and houses of worship access funding. He called the MHC Fellows a great opportunity to tackle complex challenges alongside like-minded peers.

“It allows me to learn from others, contribute my skills, and make a meaningful impact in my community while working toward a sustainable future,” Christerfield said. “I want to help build a strong foundation for Detroit’s sustainability efforts by creating tangible impacts such as improved air quality and reduced energy costs for marginalized and often forgotten communities.”

Mary-Elizabeth Estrada, Michigan AFL-CIO Workforce Development Institute – Adding to her four years of experience as a climate professional, Estrada served the institute as its climate and energy jobs fellow. She teamed up with the BlueGreen Alliance Foundation to conduct a water workforce analysis survey, sponsored a scholarship art competition for high schoolers to design graphics for a traveling Trades of Today and Tomorrow exhibit trailer, and helped put on a two-day youth STEAM camp in partnership with Avalon Village for skilled trade career awareness. She hopes to one day bring green workforce programs to middle and high school students to spotlight meaningful opportunities that are good-paying and address climate change.

“I am honored to serve Michiganders and contribute to one of the strongest climate plans in the country,” Estrada said. “I hope to advance a just transition in Michigan for workers by supporting clean energy apprenticeship readiness programs and engaging communities that have been directly impacted by emerging industries.""

Paola Rivera Gonzalez, Michigan Environmental Council – Originally from Utuado, Puerto Rico, Rivera Gonzalez served her fellowship in Marquette as the council’s Upper Peninsula clean energy organizer, planning events and hosting quarterly meetings that brought together academics, tribal representatives, regional planners, and county officials to network and share resources related to Marquette County’s climate action plan.

“Michigan has become my home in the contiguous U.S. and has sparked my passion for all the outdoor activities and natural communities that I now know,” Rivera Gonzalez said. “Michigan taught me to snowshoe, camp, snowboard, paddleboard, and admire the northern lights. It also taught me the resiliency of Michiganders advocating to keep their land and water clean.”

Lucas Roff, Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan – Roff’s diverse resume includes working in veterinary clinics, manufacturing plants, and repairing log cabins. As an environmental technician for the council, he provided technical assistance to member tribes along with greenhouse gas (GHG) benchmarking to help set reduction goals. At powwows, farmers markets, and health fairs, he collected feedback on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program and GHG reduction strategies. He also hosted educational programs on wetlands and the Great Lakes with Ojibwe Charter School, including field trips for water and sediment sampling and wildlife identification.

“I strive to make a change in this community and over the entire U.P.,” Roff said. “MHC Fellows is an excellent program that allows me to network with individuals who have the same goals as I do: caring for your community and protecting this Earth.”

About the MHC Fellows program

The service program is dedicated to developing an enduring, capable network of climate professionals committed to serving communities, building a more sustainable future for Michigan, and advancing the MI Healthy Climate Plan and its goal of a prosperous, equitable, carbon-neutral future for all Michiganders. MHC Fellows are paired with hosts in state agencies, local governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations all over Michigan.

“The MI Healthy Climate Fellows are weaving climate leadership into the fabric of Michigan communities and organizations,” said Phil Roos, Director of EGLE. “Their service leaves behind stronger partnerships, innovative solutions, and a model for how emerging leaders can make a difference.”

Fellows earn a living stipend and benefit from career-focused networking, training, and professional experience. Their ranks have included recent college graduates, graduate students, and people making mid- or post-career transitions to climate-related work. Some have served or will serve in more than one cohort. Others have been hired by their hosts or begun other careers in the sustainability sector.

The program supports Michigan’s leadership in clean energy jobs. In a 2024 report, Michigan led the Midwest and was sixth in the nation for clean energy job growth. At the time, Michigan boasted 127,690 clean energy jobs, with the sector growing nearly twice as fast as economy-wide employment.

Prospective MHC Fellows and anyone interested in supporting the program can find more information on the MHC Fellows webpage.

Our experience in Cancer Alley shows why it is so important for the EU to preserve laws that require companies to tackle their pollution and climate impacts.
Nearly every census tract in Cancer Alley ranks in the top five percent nationally for cancer risk from toxic air pollution, according to a 2023 study.
I know that many Europeans, like our communities in Cancer Alley, understand that pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil industry are a fundamental threat to our lives and wellbeing.
They should not let fossil fuel companies tell them otherwise.","My home state of Louisiana, known to most Europeans for its Mardi Gras carnival, blues, and beignets, is also a global epicentre for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry.

Pollution from the industry explains the deadly nickname, 'Cancer Alley', an 85-mile stretch along the Mississippi river between New Orleans and Baton Rouge where communities live side by side with some 200 oil refineries and petrochemical operations.

Living in Cancer Alley means that I have a message for the European Parliament as it continues to debate the EU’s flagship corporate accountability law: do not give in to the fossil fuel industry.

The EU law, known as the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, requires companies operating in the EU to address their impacts on communities and workers and to implement a plan to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Over the past year, as European companies and some member states have pushed a wider deregulation agenda, US and EU fossil fuel companies have particularly targeted the corporate accountability law.

Fossil-fuel companies have lobbied EU officials directly and have asked US president Donald Trump to weaken the law as part of trade negotiations with the EU.

As part of the EU-US trade deal, the EU also agreed to procure US fossil fuel and nuclear energy products worth $750bn [€645bn] through 2028 and to “work to provide additional flexibilities” in implementation of the EU’s carbon border tax. US officials and firms are now pushing the EU to roll back regulations that would require firms importing natural gas to the EU to limit methane emissions, a greenhouse gas and harmful pollutant.

Our experience in Cancer Alley shows why it is so important for the EU to preserve laws that require companies to tackle their pollution and climate impacts.

Nearly every census tract in Cancer Alley ranks in the top five percent nationally for cancer risk from toxic air pollution, according to a 2023 study.

My own town in 2023 had the highest risk of cancer from industrial air pollution in the country, more than seven times the national average.

The harms of pollution are disproportionately borne by Cancer Alley’s Black residents, many of whom are descendants of the enslaved people that worked on the plantations that preceded the fossil fuel industry.

Cancer Alley’s health crisis is primarily a product of state and federal government’s failure to adequately regulate the fossil-fuel industry

Friends and family members have suffered and even died from cancer, reproductive complications, and respiratory ailments. Babies are also frequently born underweight, which increases the health risks associated with premature births.

Cancer Alley’s health crisis is primarily a product of state and federal government’s failure to adequately regulate the fossil-fuel industry.

A 2011 report by the US Environmental Protection Agency attributed Louisiana’s weak enforcement of US air and water quality regulation to the state’s “lack of resources, natural disasters, and a culture in which the [relevant] state agency is expected to protect industry.”

Since taking office again, Trump has further weakened federal environmental and pollution control regulations, including proposals to limit rules on power plant emissions and industrial toxins.

So, while there are aspects of Louisiana and US culture that I would highly recommend, following their lead on climate and environmental policies that enable pollution by the fossil fuel industry is not one of them.

Fortunately, there are MEPs speaking up against weakening the EU’s corporate accountability law.

On 22 October, the European Parliament rejected proposed changes to the law that would have reduced the number of companies covered and weakened its climate provisions.

EU parliamentarians are now trying to negotiate a compromise that would satisfy the call to simplify EU regulation while preserving key elements of the law.

As these negotiations move forward, EU parliamentarians should push back against any revived proposal to reduce the scope of the EU’s corporate accountability law, weaken its climate protections, or limit access to justice for victims of corporate abuses. EU institutions should also preserve other key elements of European climate policy, including limits on methane emissions.

I know that many Europeans, like our communities in Cancer Alley, understand that pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil industry are a fundamental threat to our lives and wellbeing.

They should not let fossil fuel companies tell them otherwise.

Nova Scotia continues to make progress on the energy file in 2025:

Last week, the Province signed a memorandum of understanding with Ontario to explore small modular reactor technology as a clean energy option.

On October 16, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator launched the offshore wind call-for-bids process, which starts with a call for information and a prequalification process for potential developers. This effort follows the strategic direction given to the regulator by the federal and provincial governments.

In September, Prime Minister Mark Carney recognized Nova Scotia’s Wind West project as one of national interest that could be further developed and considered by the new Major Projects Office as a nation-building project. That same month, the Province passed the Powering the Offshore Act to update legislation related to offshore wind and tidal energy. The ban on hydraulic fracturing was also lifted to open up the opportunity to develop Nova Scotia’s estimated seven trillion cubic feet of onshore natural gas.

In July, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator opened a call for bids for offshore petroleum exploration. It is an opportunity to explore 13 shallow and deep-water parcels that are rich with potential in and around the Sable Island area.

This means the longer the government shutdown, the deeper the hit on small business contractors.
To better understand the scale and scope of the impact of the government shutdown on small business contractors, the Chamber utilized data from Bloomberg Government to analyze the number of small business contractors by state and to approximate the monthly and weekly value of their contracts.
Shutting down the government for the month of October has put $450 million at risk for Alabama small business contractors.
We also urge Congress to consider ways to help make federal contractors, especially small business contractors, whole.","To the Members of the United States Congress:

For over 80 years, the federal government has made it a priority to ensure that America’s small businesses receive a fair proportion of federal contracts.

Last year, there were at least 65,500 small business contractors located in all 50 states who received over $155 billion in payment for goods and services provided to the federal government. This includes everything from supplying high-tech machinery and specialized services to general office supplies and landscaping.

For many of these small businesses, federal contracts represent a sizable portion of their overall revenue. Navigating federal contracting rules can be complicated, but once done, a federal contract can be a reliable source of revenue. That is until there is a government shutdown.

Contracts funded with lapsed discretionary appropriations can immediately come to a halt. When the government reopens, rarely are contractors made whole. The purchase of many goods may only be delayed by a government shutdown, though some are permanently forgone. While historically even furloughed federal employees have received back pay when the government reopens, that is not the case for federal contractors who are providing services to the government. This means the longer the government shutdown, the deeper the hit on small business contractors.

To better understand the scale and scope of the impact of the government shutdown on small business contractors, the Chamber utilized data from Bloomberg Government to analyze the number of small business contractors by state and to approximate the monthly and weekly value of their contracts. Our analysis shows the 65,500 small business contractors in the United States have nearly $3 billion a week at risk, with $12 billion just in the month of October alone. Businesses in every state in the union have tens of millions, and in some cases, billions of dollars at risk. And that is if the shutdown ended today. The attached table details our findings.

For example:

· There are 1,037 small businesses in Alabama who provide goods and services to the federal government. Every week that the federal government is shut down puts approximately $104 million in payments to these Alabama businesses at risk. Shutting down the government for the month of October has put $450 million at risk for Alabama small business contractors.

The Chamber is again calling on Congress to immediately pass the continuing resolution to reopen and fund the government. We also urge Congress to consider ways to help make federal contractors, especially small business contractors, whole.

TerraPower Submits Natrium Reactorfor GDA in UK

TerraPower has entered the Natrium reactor design for review and approval under the Generic Design Assessment process managed by the UK Office of Nuclear Regulation. The multi-phase project can take up to four years to complete.

TerraPower announced the official submission of the Natrium reactor and energy storage system into the United Kingdom’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process. This is the company’s first regulatory step to deploying the Natrium technology in an international market.

“This submission marks a substantial step towards bringing the revolutionary Natrium reactor and energy storage system to the United Kingdom,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower President and CEO.

“TerraPower is committed to delivering Natrium units across the globe, and our industry-leading regulatory team is setting the standard on how to license and deploy advanced nuclear technologies.”

In its press statement TerraPower said it recently completed the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The UK’s GDA process will build on the company’s experience and efforts; and allow for TerraPower to establish deployment timelines for Natrium sites in the country.

The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. This innovative addition allows a Natrium plant to integrate seamlessly with renewable resources and leads to faster, more cost-effective decarbonization of the electric grid while producing dispatchable carbon-free energy.

TerraPower and KBR (NYSE: KBR) announced earlier this fall their efforts to identify sites for the Natrium reactor in the UK. As the UK strategizes how to best meet growing energy demand, innovative solutions like TerraPower’s Natrium technology with clean, baseload power plus gigawatt-scale energy storage will be needed to achieve both a decarbonized and a reliable electric grid.

Hyundai E&C Signs on as EPC for FERMI America

Hyundai Engineering & Construction signed a front-end engineering design contract on Friday with Fermi America to build four large-scale nuclear power plants in the United States. This marks the first time a Korean company has been awarded a contract to design and construct large-scale nuclear power plants in the country.

Under the contract, Hyundai E&C will carry out preliminary design work, including site layout development, cooling system reviews, and cost and schedule estimation, marking the first phase of construction.

Fermi America, a private US energy developer, is leading a $500 billion project near Amarillo, Texas, to create the world’s largest private power grid supporting next-generation artificial intelligence infrastructure.

“We expect to create strong synergy with Fermi America, a fast-growing company that listed on the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange in October, just nine months after its founding,” a Hyundai E&C official said.

“Building on the close energy partnership between Korea and the US, we will seek concrete ways to enhance cooperation in the US nuclear power plant market.”

The project covers about 5,200 acres and will generate 11 GW of independent power capacity. It will combine four AP1000 large-scale nuclear reactors, plus small modular reactors for additional power generation, a gas-fired combined cycle power plant, solar power facilities, and a battery energy storage system. An AI data center will also be built to connect and utilize the generated power.

The company signed a business agreement with Fermi America in July and has since engaged in detailed discussions on hybrid energy planning, nuclear system design, and overall engineering, procurement and construction strategy.

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is currently reviewing the project’s integrated permit. Hyundai E&C and Fermi America plan to move forward with detailed engineering and construction preparation in parallel, with the aim of signing a full EPC contract in the first half of 2026.

Joint Venture EPC to Deliver Cascade SMR facility at Energy Northwest

(WNN) Energy Northwest has selected a joint venture of Aecon, Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co and Black & Veatch to design and build the first phase of the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility near Richland, Washington.

The public power agency said it is in negotiations with the Cascade Nuclear Partners joint venture to collaboratively complete the planning, design, and construction of the first four out of 12 Xe-100 advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) under a progressive design-build (PDB) model. This development phase will help define the project’s scope, schedule, and cost parameters before advancing to full execution.

Last year Energy Northwest announced a multi-year agreement with Amazon focused on comprehensive environmental, safety, permitting, licensing and risk analyses for the SMR project. Amazon funded the initial feasibility phase for a plant to be sited near Energy Northwest’s Columbia Generating Station nuclear energy facility in Richland after which it expects to submit a construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Construction is anticipated to begin by the end of the decade, with operations targeted for the 2030s.

X-energy’s small modular reactor plant will feature X-energy’s Xe-100, a Generation IV advanced high temperature gas-cooled reactor design using tri-structural isotropic – or TRISO – particle fuel.

Energy Northwest CEO Bob Schuetz said the selection of Cascade Nuclear Partners is a “strategic milestone” which reflects the continued momentum for the project.

“Their specialized knowledge in nuclear construction, collaborative approach, and strong alignment with Energy Northwest’s values gives us confidence in their ability to help deliver this critical project successfully.”

In October 2024 Amazon committed $500M to build the first four of a planned 12 Xe-100 SMRs at the Columbia Generating station. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP, and the University of Michigan, will invest approximately $500 million in Series C-1 financing round for X-energy.

X-energy and Amazon plan to establish and standardize a deployment and financing model to develop projects in partnership with infrastructure and utility partners. The investment includes manufacturing capacity to develop the SMR equipment to support more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.

Nuclear energy, once seen as outdated, is now becoming one of the key engines driving the digital and energy economy forward.","Google and NextEra Energy are joining forces to bring back the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa. The electricity from this plant will power Google’s growing AI systems and data centers, helping the company reach its clean energy goals.

The partnership comes as Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, reported strong third-quarter earnings and a rise in stock value following better-than-expected results. Alphabet’s revenue grew, driven by gains in cloud services and AI investments. The company raised its capital spending forecast to over $90 billion for 2025. This shows its commitment to expanding clean, reliable energy for its growing data network.

The project gives the U.S. nuclear industry a fresh boost at a time when demand for reliable, low-carbon electricity is rising sharply. As data and AI grow, companies are racing to get enough clean energy. They need it to power their technology all day and night.

Google’s Nuclear Comeback: Powering AI the Clean Way

The Duane Arnold Energy Center is located near Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It stopped operating in 2020 after more than 45 years of service. Now, NextEra Energy, one of the largest renewable energy companies in the U.S., plans to restart the plant by 2029.

Once operational, the reactor will generate about 615 megawatts (MW) of power, enough to supply hundreds of thousands of homes. Under a 25-year agreement, Google will purchase most of the plant’s output to run its expanding network of cloud and AI data centers.

The restart could create hundreds of construction jobs and dozens of permanent roles when the plant reopens. Local suppliers, engineering firms, and service companies will also benefit. State officials expect the project to increase tax revenue and economic activity across eastern Iowa.

Just after this deal, Alphabet reported its 3rd Quarter financial results.

Alphabet’s Q3 Earnings Fuel the Next Energy Push

Alphabet announced its third-quarter 2025 earnings. Total revenue reached $102.3 billion. This marks a 16% rise compared to last year. Net income rose to $27.6 billion, driven by strong ad sales, continued growth in Google Cloud, and higher demand for AI-powered services.

Google Cloud generated $15.16 billion in quarterly revenue, up 26% year over year. Its core Search and “Other” businesses brought in $56.57 billion, while YouTube ads contributed another $8.8 billion.

Alphabet increased its annual capital spending forecast to $91–93 billion. This change reflects investments in data centers, AI infrastructure, and clean energy projects, including the Duane Arnold restart.

The results highlight how Google’s financial strength supports its climate commitments. The company is investing heavily in clean power, energy storage, and long-term sustainability as AI models and data operations grow.

Following the release, Google’s stock broke a record with the price surging to its highest level.

AI’s Growing Appetite for Electricity

Artificial intelligence and large-scale data centers are transforming the energy landscape. Training advanced AI models and handling billions of searches requires a lot of computing power. So, they also need constant electricity.

In 2024, data centers worldwide consumed about 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, or roughly 1.5% of global demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that number could rise to 945 TWh by 2030, more than doubling in just six years.

A report from Goldman Sachs suggests that total data center power demand could increase 160% by 2030 compared with 2023 levels. In the U.S. alone, data centers could account for 8% of national electricity use by the end of the decade.

That surge makes always-on, low-carbon energy essential. Unlike solar and wind, nuclear power provides a steady output regardless of the weather. For Google and other AI companies, stability is vital. It helps them keep their networks online 24/7 and cut emissions.

Why Tech Giants Are Turning to Nuclear Power

Tech giants are now among the most active investors in advanced nuclear energy. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are pursuing nuclear deals to meet both AI expansion and climate goals.

SEE MORE: Meta, Google, and Amazon Join Global Pledge to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050

Their reasons are straightforward:

Reliability: Nuclear reactors generate power 24/7, supporting constant digital workloads.

Low-carbon: They produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions.

Cost stability: Uranium fuel costs are predictable over long timeframes.

Grid support: Nuclear power balances variable renewables like solar and wind.

For Google, using nuclear power aligns with its plan to run all operations on clean energy every hour of every day by 2030. NextEra and other utilities can reach new markets. They supply low-carbon electricity directly to data centers and tech campuses.

Engineering a Second Life for Duane Arnold

Restarting a nuclear plant is not easy. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must approve the restart first. They will review safety systems and environmental impact.

NextEra must rebuild cooling towers, replace old parts, and update digital controls before operations can start again. The company will also train a new workforce to operate the plant under updated safety rules.

Experts estimate that reviving an older reactor can be 30–40% cheaper than building a new one. Even so, the project includes billions in upgrades. It also faces complex licensing and global supply-chain challenges.

Still, the economic payoff could be significant. Restarting Duane Arnold boosts local energy reliability and supports federal clean power goals. It shows how old infrastructure can meet today’s climate needs.

Google’s Carbon-Free Energy Goal

Google has matched 100% of its annual electricity use with renewable power purchases since 2017. But its next milestone is far tougher—running entirely on carbon-free energy at all times by 2030.

The company already sources solar, wind, and geothermal power across multiple continents. Yet, because these sources are intermittent, nuclear can play an important balancing role.

The Duane Arnold partnership ensures a steady supply when the grid fluctuates. Google is exploring small modular reactors (SMRs), geothermal wells, and long-duration energy storage. These are key parts of its clean power strategy.

Google wants to diversify its clean energy sources. This will help its AI infrastructure stay strong against climate change and keep costs stable. The chart below shows 6how t6he tech giant’s clean energy avoided emissions.

Powering the Digital Future

The Google–NextEra deal marks a new chapter in how technology companies think about power. For Google, it guarantees access to reliable, low-carbon electricity for decades. NextEra builds a profitable model. It supplies the data economy and extends the lifespan of nuclear infrastructure.

If successful, the project could serve as a blueprint for reviving other shuttered U.S. reactors. It demonstrates how legacy assets can be modernized to meet today’s energy and AI needs without adding new carbon emissions.

More broadly, it highlights a turning point in the clean energy transition. As AI use grows worldwide, the demand for “firm clean power” increases too. This includes reliable sources like nuclear, hydro, and geothermal energy. Federal tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act make projects more appealing to private investors.

Rebuilding and restarting the Duane Arnold Energy Center will take several years of engineering work, testing, and regulatory review. If the process stays on schedule, the plant could be back online by 2029.

For Google, this partnership is more than an energy deal. It also reflects how the company is linking its financial strength to its climate and AI goals. After posting strong third-quarter earnings and a solid rise in revenue, the company has shown that its investments in AI and cloud services are not only profitable but also shaping its long-term sustainability plans.

The Duane Arnold project fits into that vision by ensuring that Google’s expanding data operations are powered by clean, reliable energy. This collaboration shows that the future of AI depends as much on clean, continuous power as it does on computing power.

This includes building the country’s first wireless EV charging road, debuted in Detroit in 2023. At the end of last year, a deal was inked between wireless EV charging specialist Electreon and Commercial EV manufacturer Xos, Inc. to make this technology available for commercial vehicles, including UPS trucks in Detroit.

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

Governments should create state-wide or multi-state lending programs that back climate innovators developing hard tech and software focused on alternatives to rare-earth minerals, renewable energy, and climate resilience. Offering zero- or low-interest loans and non-dilutive grants as an extra incentive for technologies built domestically would accelerate adoption while boosting local economies. Pairing this funding with university partnerships would strengthen R&D and ensure innovation stays rooted in local communities.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

I plan to visit local schools and bring entrepreneurs into the classroom to introduce students to Michigan’s clean energy economy and the broader world of sustainable transportation. By connecting their daily choices—carpooling, walking, biking—to climate goals and career paths in clean energy, we can empower the next generation to see themselves as innovators, not just consumers.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

The Bahamas’ Sovereign Climate Securities program deserves more attention. It monetizes seagrass beds, which are natural carbon reservoirs, by generating blue carbon credits that fund renewable energy investments. This model turns natural ecosystems into sustainable capital while protecting biodiversity, and is a blueprint for how nations can finance climate action without adversely affecting the environment.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Technology and collaboration are converging faster than ever. AI and predictive analytics are turning data into prevention strategies, helping communities anticipate floods, wildfires, and other climate risks. Cities, policymakers, urban planners, designers, and architects can use these insights to guide land-use and infrastructure planning. Rather than react to crises, we’re building resilient, future-ready communities.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

We must stop politicizing and exploiting climate action and start sharing responsibility across governments, businesses, and individuals. Access to clean air, safe water, good jobs, and stable housing are the foundations of healthy, thriving communities. Addressing these needs can launch the next industrial revolution—one powered by renewable energy, automation, and AI. But progress depends on people. Workers must have the tools and training to lead this transition. Furthermore, it’s time to end the $1.3 trillion in fossil-fuel subsidies that distort markets and feed the myth that clean energy is costly, and instead invest in innovation that lifts every nation.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leaders-Justine-Johnson2.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 12:07:43.888413

Several renewable energy team members from Forvis Mazars attended and collaborated to share key takeaways from the event. Despite the current headwinds facing the industry—including recent tax legislation impacting certain tax incentives, stubbornly high interest rates, and long interconnection queues—representative companies remained committed to providing renewable energy solutions throughout the U.S. from large developers to independent owner operators.

Developers have learned to remain nimble and flexible with shifting policies, having contingency plans and scaling solutions to get projects done. While this requires leadership to make difficult staffing and capital expenditure decisions, many organizations are learning how to operate leaner than ever before while enhancing the value received from their service providers. This article will highlight some of the key issues raised at the conference and how Forvis Mazars can assist.

Development Assets – Interconnection & Beyond

With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025, certain investment tax credits (namely the Investment Tax Credit (ITC)) are no longer eligible for certain renewable energy entities. This has had a significant impact on developers, independent power producers, construction companies, and many others in the development pipeline.

Specifically, there is a broad expectation that energy pricing will increase given the strong demand for energy, which is being accelerated by many large data center projects to support cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. With the ineligibility of the federal subsidy for some projects placed in service, construction companies and suppliers will likely feel downward pressure on margins as developers model out projects to achieve their expected return on investment (ROI).

As a result of the ITC’s ineligibility, companies are now focusing on projects with a higher likelihood of reaching interconnection and meeting the IRS’ placed-in-service deadline, while spending less time and resources on speculative projects. In many ways, developers are getting back to the basics of developing high-quality projects while ensuring appropriate leverage via third-party debt and/or proceeds from tax equity investors. Many developers continue to prioritize cash generation through the transfer of ITCs as allowed with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

In the past few years, we have observed a move from developing as many projects as possible to a more targeted approach of emphasizing the completion of projects into service to monetize the ITCs. This has been one of the most notable changes in strategy in recent years. We have also seen an expansion of renewable energy projects into the southeastern states due to continued demand from that region.

Financial Modeling

With the changes in tax laws and regulations, accurate financial modeling is critically important. Financial modeling will help guide companies to make informed decisions, manage risk, and ensure long-term project viability.

As we connected with conference attendees on this topic, several organizations have reduced the amount of internal resources in this area, given the industry headwinds. With the loss of legacy knowledge, our consulting teams have found opportunities to come alongside developers and investors to help fully outsource this function or provide specific training to team members on best practices. Companies will need to make sure their models are accurately capturing the anticipated market shifts for their projects, including interest rates, construction costs, and energy pricing, just to name a few.

We continue to see opportunities to work with companies to assist with model due diligence, which gives companies an extra set of eyes on their processes, policies, and procedures to help achieve more accurate results.

SALT Explorer

State and local tax (SALT) was a consistent topic throughout the conference. As margins get squeezed and local municipalities continue to enforce their unique tax regulations, there is strong demand for resources that address these specific needs. With more than 10,000 unique tax jurisdictions in the U.S., it can be overwhelming for organizations looking to do business in new states. We had the opportunity to connect with companies and discuss our web-based application, SALT Explorer, which features live-rate lookup for sales tax (using an address or GPS coordinates) and is updated in real time with local guidance on navigating taxes in all 50 states and related municipalities.

SALT Explorer’s goal is to help developers save time and achieve greater efficiencies in their tax research processes for bidding and tax compliance filings. SALT Explorer is available to help with a more accurate calculation of project-based tax exposure and gross-receipts calculations, along with easy access to SALT professionals at Forvis Mazars.

SALT Explorer is a prime example of how collaboration and innovation can help solve real problems that developers face daily around the country.

Networking, Community, & Shared Learning

The conference was a great opportunity for collaboration. Instead of competition, networking took precedence and reiterated the value in learning from one another. Attendees reconnected with longtime colleagues, made new friends, and shared insights in both formal and informal settings—from breakout rooms and roundtables to coffee breaks and evening happy hours.

With each visitor to our exhibitor booth and others we met throughout the conference, we were constantly reminded that relationships remain the cornerstone of any industry, and clean energy is no exception. This was evident not only for professionals from Forvis Mazars, but also other industry partners who interacted and created opportunities to help one another.

In addition, some of our colleagues attended events hosted by Solar Sisters, a nonprofit organization focused on empowering women through clean energy entrepreneurship. At RE+, their presence was designed to support community, mentorship, and empowerment for women in the clean energy industry.

Conclusion

The 2025 RE+ conference confirmed a large shift as the industry looks to move forward amid much uncertainty. In many ways, it is as simple as “getting back to the basics” for all companies regardless of size. As the industry grows more complex, the winners will be those who can harness relationships and innovation to lead the way forward.",https://www.forvismazars.us/getmedia/f9a5c4ee-544f-45fa-8e7f-ae6a28d54e82/1032683612-landscape-large.jpg?width=1920&height=1080&ext=.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 11:21:55.730210

It was the equivalent of a mini car company inside of a big one.

Ford subsequently lifted the lid on the project, and now it’s talking publicly about the vehicle, a mid-sized electric truck that’s set to cost around $30,000. The first ones will be revealed to buyers in 2027.

The automaker says this is the equivalent of a “Model T moment” that involves rethinking the way EVs are built compared with conventional cars and trucks. That includes re-envisioning the assembly line as an “assembly tree” structured into three parallel sub-assembly lines to simultaneously build the front, rear, and battery. Field, the chief officer of EVs, is overseeing this new manufacturing approach, as well as new underpinnings for the vehicle. To build the new pickup, the company is spending $2 billion to upgrade its factory in Louisville, Ky.

For Field, the challenge is avoiding the bottlenecks that sometimes doom innovation in Detroit. “It’s one thing to make a creative environment where you can come up with big ideas,” he told MIT News earlier this year. “It’s another to create an execution-focused environment to crank things out.”

Ford isn’t alone in the EV truck race: Slate, funded by Amazon, is racing to introduce its own inexpensive pickup and competitors include Rivian and other Detroit companies. Pulling it off on time and at a reasonable price will tell whether Ford is on track.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Titans-Doug-Field.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 13:05:46.475979

But I truly believe if we focus on the economics of clean energy and climate change, it will happen.
Republican congressional districts are now home to more clean energy jobs than Democratic districts.
That's because 42 of our 50 states now have more clean energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs.","Climate change is an environmental issue. It's a health issue. It's a social justice issue. But it's also increasingly an economic issue. A pocketbook issue. And once something becomes a pocketbook issue, people start paying attention.

We all need to do a better job of understanding and communicating the economic costs of climate inaction and the economic benefits of climate action. And we need to make sure we hold our elected officials accountable to do something about it.

Climate-related disasters now regularly cost the United States $150 billion each year. Homeowners insurance rates are up 40 percent over the past six years. In some parts of the country, it's almost impossible to get insurance. Electricity rates are up more than 20 percent over the past five years, and will continue to rise with the advent of AI, the growth of data centers and the increasing number of gadgets we all plug into the wall.

On the other side of the coin, the cheapest power we can now produce comes from solar, wind and batteries. Electric vehicles are faster, less expensive to operate and safer and more fun to drive than gas-powered vehicles. Advances in energy efficiency, from Energy Star appliances to programmable thermostats and better insulation in our attics is saving homeowners money by reducing the electricity they have to buy.

Because of these technological advances, clean energy has quietly become a huge and important part of our economy. More than 3.5 million Americans now get up every day and go to work in clean energy occupations. More people now work in clean energy occupations than work as lawyers or bankers or real estate agents in America. More than 80 percent of all new energy jobs last year were in clean energy fields, and today, three times as many people work in clean energy today than work in fossil fuels.

And if Washington doesn't stop us, the clean economy is just getting started. In the past three years, companies have announced plans to invest more than $130 billion in 400 major clean energy related factories and other projects in America. Together, they're expected to create 123,000 new jobs. When's the last time we've seen that sort of investment in American manufacturing? Not in our lifetimes.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

My mission is simple: To make clean energy and climate action nonpartisan again. In these politically fraught times, that may seem impossible. But I truly believe if we focus on the economics of clean energy and climate change, it will happen. There should be nothing partisan or political about creating jobs, driving economic growth, making America more competitive and cutting costs for consumers and businesses.

That's what we can do - and are doing - with clean energy in America. When I first started working on these issues, clean energy was something for California and a few other liberal states. Not today.

Texas is now the biggest state for wind energy, followed by Iowa and Oklahoma. My home state of North Carolina for years has been one of the top states for solar. Georgia's Republican governor has pledged to make his state the ""electric mobility capital of the country""—if South Carolina and Tennessee don't beat him to it with dozens of EV and battery factories flocking to those states—he might just do it.

Republican congressional districts are now home to more clean energy jobs than Democratic districts. More than 80 percent of all new major clean energy-related factories announced in recent years have been in Red states. And unless you live in one of a handful of states, you probably don't know a coal miner or an oilfield worker, but you probably know somebody who works in solar or energy efficiency. That's because 42 of our 50 states now have more clean energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs.

Remember, it was Richard Nixon who signed the Clean Air Act and created the Environmental Protection Agency. It was George H.W. Bush who enacted our most important energy efficiency laws, and his son George W. who declared America needed to kick its addiction to oil. Our greatest conservationist president, of course, was Republican Theodore Roosevelt.

Clean energy and climate action used to be bipartisan issues—as they should be. The only reason these issues have become partisan is because we let politicians make them partisan. We let them divide us, split us and obfuscate the fact that we all want clean air and water, we all want cleaner energy and we all want to leave a better place for our children.

We need to change the narrative. That's my goal.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Innovation.

Innovation is the reason why solar panels, batteries and wind turbines cost a fraction of what they did a decade ago, and are now the cheapest sources of power available. Innovation is transforming the auto industry, making electric vehicles the new standard in many countries. It's because of innovation that your refrigerator uses one-fourth of the power than the one you probably grew up with, and your television is now thinner than a book and can use less power than your toaster.

And innovation just keeps going, thanks to passionate and undaunted clean energy entrepreneurs and investors across the country who are devoted to the fact that we can do good for our environment while also doing good for our economy.

If you could stand up and talk to world leaders at the next COP, what would you say?

Washington is not America, and America is not the world. In this time when the United States is going backward on climate and clean energy, the rest of the world can - and must - continue to lead.

As a friend of mine likes to say, what's happening in America will pass. Maybe like a gallstone, but it will pass. Until then, it's up to the rest of the world to keep progress going on building a cleaner economy and a better environment.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leaders-Bob-Keefe.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 11:21:59.395152

Solar Installers to Reduce Costs to $2 Per Watt?","There is a long-running debate over the relative weights of individual and government responsibility in limiting the effects of climate change.

Now, at a time when the U.S. government is largely abdicating its role, I spent a Saturday hanging out with a group that focuses on what its members can do in their households and community.

It was an antidote to cynicism.

The event was the Energy Smart Home Expo, organized by Electrify Central Ohio and held at Ohio State University, a few miles from where I live in Columbus. The exhibitors included rooftop solar companies, electric vehicle advocates, energy efficiency professionals and environmental nonprofits, among others.

One of my first stops was a table where volunteer Rachel Kutzley demonstrated gadgets that could help people reduce their utility bills.

She pointed a thermal camera at a mug of hot tea and the camera’s screen showed heat leakage from the top. At home, I could use this to identify the areas around windows, baseboards and other parts of the house where heat is leaking. Once I have this information, I can fill those gaps with caulk or other materials.

“That can be the best way to bring down your home heating costs,” she said.

A thermal camera costs about $150, or, if you have a group like Electrify Central Ohio in your area, you can easily borrow one for a day.

She also had a smart plug, which is a device you can insert in a wall outlet and then you plug your appliance or home electronic device into it. The plug, which you can buy for as little as $10, will tell you how much electricity the device is using, and it can help you identify energy hogs in the home that can be unplugged when not in use.

I asked her a version of the question I asked almost everyone that day: How do you muster enthusiasm for saving energy at a time when the federal government has largely abandoned its ambitions to make a shift to cleaner power?

“We need to do the right thing for the next generation,” she said.

I wanted to get an advocate’s perspective, and found one just a few tables down. Mryia Williams is the senior Ohio program assistant for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that organizes group-buying programs for rooftop solar and advocates for solar-friendly policies.

In her spare time, she serves as the volunteer executive director of Drive Electric Columbus, a group that promotes EVs.

Williams’ two advocacy passions took big hits from the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which had rapid phaseouts of tax credits for solar and EVs. Ohio’s state government isn’t much better, having mostly abandoned policies that sought to encourage renewable energy.

So how does she keep going?

“I’m going to get up every day, I’m going to go about helping people, just like I’ve always helped them,” she said.

Part of what motivates her is the belief that rooftop solar and EVs are doing good in the world, and that good has value even in small doses.

Across the aisle from her was Appalachian Renewable Power, a solar installer based in Athens, in southeastern Ohio. John McNamara, the company’s chief operating officer, said the phaseout of federal tax credits is a blow, but his company still anticipates a strong 2026.

A key factor, he explained, is that the payback period—the time it takes for electricity bill savings to cover the costs of buying rooftop solar—is still pretty good even without tax credits. This period is about four years right now, with tax credits, and it would be about six years without tax credits.

And, utility rates continue to rise, which means additional savings for consumers who produce their own electricity, he said.

Electrify Central Ohio is run by two volunteers, Madeline Fleisher, an attorney specializing in energy issues, and Andy Leber, an Ohio State psychology professor. They formed the group in 2022 after each of them had completed projects in their homes to reduce the fossil fuel use, and they realized there wasn’t an easy way for local residents to find answers to basic questions.

They formed a Facebook group and host online and in-person meetings where the public can share contractor recommendations, talk about experiences with equipment such as heat pumps and generally commiserate.

I asked Fleisher if the organization has changed its focus now that the federal government has pared back much of its support for reducing emissions.

“What we were doing has not changed at all,” she said. “It has always been about helping people understand what their options are in the world today.”

Any substantial change will eventually require government buy-in, Fleisher said, but there remains a role for individuals to make progress in the meantime. She noted that about one-third of Ohio’s carbon emissions come from residential energy use and driving private vehicles. She wanted to drive home the point that people can do a lot to reduce emissions in their own lives, even in the absence of government action.

Leber said it’s a false choice to talk about whether progress comes through structural changes by government or through consumer choices of consumers. Both are crucial in the fight against climate change.

“The answer is that the government and individuals need to do everything they can,” he said.

But he is also mindful of a trope of climate denial in which governments and companies blame rising emissions on consumers to shift responsibility away from themselves. It’s possible to reject this form of climate denial while still realizing that individual actions can do a lot of good, he said.

I’m going to end with a treat. Among the businesses with a table was The Buckeye Lady, which specializes in making buckeye candy, a chocolate and peanut butter confection that looks like the nut from the buckeye tree.

Alicia Hindman, the Buckeye lady herself, who now has a storefront and a regional following, was at the expo to demonstrate the virtues of a portable induction cooktop. An induction cooktop runs on electricity, using a magnetic field to heat the cookware and its contents, while the cooktop surface remains cool.

She stirred melted chocolate on the cooktop and explained why this was preferable to cooking with gas.

“They conserve energy, which is really nice, and they conserve space, so you don’t have to house a whole stove,” she said.

This was a recurring theme at many of the tables, and it offers hope for broader consumer adoption: Cleaner technologies often have advantages in terms of quality and lifetime costs, to the point that the environmental benefits become an afterthought.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

The Trump Administration Shifts the Offshore Wind Industry Into Reverse: President Donald Trump has used the levers of government to slow and even stop development of offshore wind power, as Andrew S. Lewis reports for Mother Jones. This story is a good roundup of months of actions that have combined to cause damage to the nascent industry, raising concerns about states’ ability to reduce their fossil fuel use.

Elon Musk’s Politics May Have Cost Tesla 1 Million Vehicle Sales: Yale University economists have issued a working paper in which they find Tesla’s U.S. sales would have been between 67 percent and 83 percent higher from October 2022 to April 2025 if not for the effect of CEO Elon Musk’s partisanship, which drove customers away Musk’s support for Donald Trump has cost Tesla sales with environmentally minded customers who were likely to oppose Trump’s politics, as Akash Sriram reports for Reuters.

The Trump Administration Seeks to Speed Data Center Grid Connections: The Department of Energy has proposed a rule that would expand federal control over how large electricity users connect to the grid, accelerating the building of data centers and power plants that serve them, as I wrote for ICN. Among the interesting parts of the proposal is a 60-day timeline to approve grid connections for projects, if the developer is willing to make the data center flexible about the amount of power it needs at any given time. Companies are going to want this expedited approval, which means we are likely to see more projects like the one Aligned Data Centers is planning for an undisclosed location in the Pacific Northwest, pairing a data center with a 31-megawatt battery, as Julian Spector reports for Canary Media.

Is It Possible for U.S. Solar Installers to Reduce Costs to $2 Per Watt? One of the big challenges for rooftop solar adoption in the United States is the inability to drive down costs even as panel prices decrease, as Lisa Martine Jenkins writes for Latitude Media. The cost of a rooftop system here is about $3 per wall, while it’s $1 per watt in Australia. A recent report from Tesla says lower prices are possible through a combination of regulatory changes, improvements in how installers operate and cost-saving innovations in the design of some parts. A separate report from the nonprofit Permit Power found that if installers can get costs down to $1 per watt, it would lead to 18.2 million more families installing solar and add about 200 gigawatts of additional capacity.

Fusion is a reverse of what happens in today's nuclear power plants — nuclear fission — where large atoms are split in a chain reaction to release energy.
Unlike nuclear fission, nuclear fusion leaves behind no radioactive waste, thus holding the promise of delivering abundant, climate-friendly energy without pollution and radioactive waste.","Germany consumes vast amounts of energy to sustain its manufacturing might and energy-intensive sectors like the automotive and chemical industry.

The country, Europe's largest economy, still relies heavily on fossil fuels for its energy needs, even though the share of renewable sources like wind and solar has risen steadily over the past two decades.

The German government has been implementing an ambitious energy transition plan to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. It completely phased out nuclear power in 2023, and plans to wean itself off coal by 2038.

To balance the energy and environmental commitments, Berlin is also betting on new technologies such as green hydrogen and nuclear fusion.

A smart bet?

Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Cabinet this month unveiled an action plan to accelerate the development of nuclear fusion technology. It wants Germany to build the world's first fusion reactor, allocating €1.7 billion ($1.98 billion) in funding for the project.

Berlin hopes the technology will provide abundant clean, safe and reliable energy in the future.

Sarah Klein, commissioner for fusion research at the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology in Aachen, Germany, says investing in fusion technology is a ""smart long‑term strategic bet.""

""[It] keeps Germany at the forefront of a global technology race and — alongside renewables — is crucial for ensuring energy sovereignty after the phaseout of fossil fuels,"" she told DW.

Sibylle Günter, scientific director of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics, agreed, noting that German energy demand is ""rising steadily.""

""Nuclear fusion is a technology that can help us secure our energy supply without CO2 emissions in the long term and remain competitive as an industrial nation,"" Günter told DW.

'Catalyst for innovation'

Scientists have for decades sought to harness nuclear fusion to generate energy.

It involves bashing together two light atomic nuclei at such high temperatures and pressure that they fuse, and release energy. It's the same basic process that sees hydrogen in the sun converted into helium, generating sunlight and making life on Earth possible.

Fusion is a reverse of what happens in today's nuclear power plants — nuclear fission — where large atoms are split in a chain reaction to release energy.

Unlike nuclear fission, nuclear fusion leaves behind no radioactive waste, thus holding the promise of delivering abundant, climate-friendly energy without pollution and radioactive waste.

Germany is not alone in betting big on nuclear fusion.

Countries like the US, China, Japan and the UK have been pumping billions into accelerating the development of the technology. In addition, dozens of private startups have joined the fray.

""The most innovative economies in the world are already making substantial investments in fusion. Therefore, investing in fusion is a vital future strategy for Germany's high-tech sector,"" Klein said.

The Fraunhofer scientist underlines that the investment is crucial for the country to remain competitive on the global stage and secure technological sovereignty.

""Beyond the science, fusion acts as a catalyst for innovation,"" she said, pointing to other critical technologies such as superconducting magnets, high‑power systems, advanced materials, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).

""It is vital to involve industry stakeholders early to initiate and leverage spillover effects into other markets,"" she added.

Waste of money?

Critics, however, view the spending of vast sums on the pursuit of nuclear fusion as misguided and a waste of resources. They argue that the money could be better spent on scaling up other renewable projects.

But Sibylle Günter is convinced there mustn't be a ""conflict between renewables and fusion energy"" as the two can ""complement each other.""

""Wind and solar power cannot supply electricity continuously, but fusion can. Fusion can also provide process heat for industry and energy for the production of synthetic fuels such as hydrogen,"" she said.

After decades of research, scientists first managed to achieve a net energy gain — meaning the energy delivered by the fusion reaction was higher than what was used to make the atomic nuclei fuse — at the end of 2022.

The experiment used high-powered lasers to achieve the feat.

Other concepts use strong magnetic fields to confine super-hot plasma particles that combine and fuse to release energy.

When will fusion power plants become reality?

The 2022 breakthrough and subsequent experiments have raised hopes of unlocking fusion's full potential in the near future.

Daniel Kammen, Bloomberg distinguished professor of energy and climate justice at Johns Hopkins University, thinks the ""old adage"" that nuclear fusion is five decades away, and has been five decades away for many decades is ""no longer true.""

""Advances in the diversity of approaches, in the use of machine learning and AI to control issues like magnetic (tokamak) confinement, and in system operation have all radically changed the situation,"" he told DW in an emailed statement.

""I have forecast that fusion prototypes will be in the pilot phase on the grid within a decade, and possibly sooner.""

But other experts, including Sarah Klein, say it will take longer for commercially viable fusion power to materialize. ""It's true that commercial fusion remains a long‑term prospect with significant technical and economic uncertainty. So it cannot substitute for the urgent deployment of renewables and storage today.""

Klein's view is shared by Sibylle Günter, who expects the first fusion-power plants to go on the grid ""in about two decades,"" but only if the necessary efforts are made now.

""The question is: Are we prepared today to invest in a technology so that it will be available when we need it to meet our growing energy needs?""

“Permitting reform can help lower costs, modernize the electric grid, and create clean energy jobs for Maryland families.
While the governors do not all endorse each specific reform, governors are in broad agreement on the need to improve federal energy permitting.","More than a dozen U.S. governors, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, released a package of reform priorities to improve federal permitting and regulatory processes for critical energy infrastructure projects.

The governors are urging Congress to enact reforms to ensure federal permitting processes are streamlined and administered in a technology-neutral and apolitical manner.

The effort is led by Govs. Shapiro and Stitt, who are the co-chairs of the National Governors Association (NGA) Governors Energy and Infrastructure Working Group.

“This isn’t a Republican or Democrat issue. Every American needs to heat their home and power their vehicle,” Stitt, who is the current NGA chair, said. “As the demand for energy rises as we bring new technologies and AI online, we need to complete energy infrastructure projects in a faster, more efficient way. I’m thankful to Governor Shapiro and our fellow Governors who participated in this task force for their innovative ideas to make American energy more accessible for everyone.”

Along with Stitt and Shapiro, the other governors on the working group include Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox.

“In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power,” Shapiro said. “My Administration has prioritized streamlining government to work for the people it serves and has responsibly sped up permitting to get new energy projects online and grow Pennsylvania’s economy. It’s far past time that we position the United States to do the same in order to win the energy and AI race, and lower energy costs for all Americans.”

The governors noted that there is increasing demand for electricity to serve the computing, industrial, manufacturing, building and transportation industries. The reform recommendations were in several categories, including Streamlining Federal Agency Reviews, Reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Reforms to Interstate Energy Transmission, Reforms to Nuclear Energy Regulation, and Reforms to the Clean Water Act.

“When it comes to energy infrastructure, we need to move from no and slow, to yes and now,” Moore, the current vice chair of NGA, said. “Permitting reform can help lower costs, modernize the electric grid, and create clean energy jobs for Maryland families. Commonsense energy policy is a bipartisan priority to get rid of government gridlock without sacrificing environmental safety. I’m proud of this bipartisan group of Governors for coming to the table and finding a set of commonsense solutions we believe can meet the moment.”

The working group was formed last February by Stitt and Shapiro at the NGA’s Winter Meeting.

“I’m proud to have worked with my fellow governors to develop the pragmatic permitting reforms we need now,” Cox, former NGA chair, said. “If we want to power new homes and businesses, strengthen the grid, and double our capacity, we have to build like we used to. Congress should move swiftly on these bipartisan proposals. It would be a major win for the American people.”

Over the past several months, Stitt and Shapiro have solicited ideas from the working group to accelerate the project. While the governors do not all endorse each specific reform, governors are in broad agreement on the need to improve federal energy permitting. They are also in broad agreement that this should be done by incorporating new technologies and common interagency digital systems, broadening categorical exclusions, reforming certain litigation processes, and ensuring that federal agencies have the resources and staff needed to implement permitting reforms in a timely and technology neutral manner. They are also in agreement to end the retroactive cancellation of permits.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2414748899.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 12:12:47.417452

""Permitting reform underpins our energy, AI and manufacturing future—now is the time for Congress to act.""
The American Petroleum Institute also launched a seven-figure ad buy last month that pushed lawmakers to pass a comprehensive permitting overhaul.
""These assets are key to America's diverse energy portfolio, which has powered manufacturers' global competitiveness,"" it said.","A leading business group — in a report shared exclusively with Axios — is trying to jump-start efforts in Congress to cut red tape so that new AI and other projects can roll out more rapidly.

Why it matters: The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) carries considerable clout with Republicans.

Its report released Wednesday argues that streamlining the permitting process is key to prevailing in AI and fulfilling President Trump's ""energy dominance"" agenda.

Overhauling permitting is one of the few areas of widespread agreement on Capitol Hill, though a compromise has remained elusive.

Driving the news: The group's report says AI ""has become integral to modern manufacturing."" Sixty percent of the manufacturers NAM surveyed expect to deploy artificial intelligence by 2027, while 80% say it's essential to growing their business by 2030.

But it said bureaucratic red tape remains a hindrance to further progress.

""Unclear timelines, lack of agency coordination, overlapping statutes and endless litigation continue to drive up the costs of critical projects or halt them altogether,"" it said.

""Permitting reform underpins our energy, AI and manufacturing future—now is the time for Congress to act.""

Catch up fast: NAM is one of several prominent groups to recently call for Congress to hasten work on permitting.

A bipartisan group of more than a dozen governors — led by Oklahoma's Kevin Stitt and Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro — put out a package of priorities Tuesday to improve permitting and regulatory processes for energy infrastructure projects.

The American Petroleum Institute also launched a seven-figure ad buy last month that pushed lawmakers to pass a comprehensive permitting overhaul.

Zoom in: Unlike other actions that have been done through executive orders, many of those involved say a successful overhaul must have the force of law to ensure certainty throughout subsequent presidential administrations and Congresses.

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is working on a bipartisan permitting package to overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

In July, House Republicans revived a push to overhaul environmental reviews in what they say would be a way to unlock fossil fuels and renewable energy alike.

Reality check: Democrats and Republicans remain apart on specifics.

Republicans and some Democrats have argued that NEPA, which guides federal environmental reviews, has unreasonably delayed infrastructure projects and opened the door to frivolous lawsuits.

But some Democrats are suspicious of what they consider attempts to weaken NEPA.

NAM's report contends that the judicial review process under NEPA allowing court challenges of agencies' decisions ""has long been abused, with incredibly lengthy and often frivolous litigation too often holding up projects.""

It said manufacturers need a workable statute of limitations on appeals, as well as guardrails that limit legal action to affected stakeholders that offer substantive public input and clearer limits on when courts can invalidate an agency's action.

Its report also urges that lawmakers invest more heavily in solar, wind and battery storage in addition to nuclear and fossil fuels.

""These assets are key to America's diverse energy portfolio, which has powered manufacturers' global competitiveness,"" it said. ""Policymakers

should embrace all sources of energy and ensure that both tax and regulatory policies encourage greater investments in the domestic production of all energy technologies.""",https://images.axios.com/b-aVwX8aF471v5p2SzbGbceVg04=/0x0:5000x2813/1366x768/2025/10/28/1761666618227.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 11:24:13.246712

But, as a condition of approval of replacement generation, Duke is required to study the feasibility of operating coal and gas units simultaneously at the Cayuga site and to put the coal units up for sale. Duke admits that the Cayuga coal units are not needed for reliability.

Duke earned a 0% (F) for the second year in a row in the Sierra Club’s Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges report that the organization released earlier this week. Reasons for its low scores include the company’s plan to extend coal-burning at Gibson through 2038, doubling down on often unprofitable coal-burning at Edwardsport, and its paltry investments in wind, solar, and storage.

Statement from Megan Anderson, Senior Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Indiana:

“Duke’s failure to provide affordable, renewable energy has led customers to where we are today, but retiring the outdated Cayuga coal plant is the right move for customers. Governor Braun allegedly cares about energy affordability, so he should stop giving handouts to the coal industry and focus on providing tangible relief to struggling Hoosier families.

Almost immediately after taking office in late-January, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal to the world that transitioning to green energy was not going to be a priority under his administration.
Environmental advocacy group E2 estimates that, in February and March alone, 13 investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing projects worth a combined $5 billion were canceled or downsized.
According to data from Wellesley College researchers, 26 other clean energy projects totaling $27.6 billion in capital were paused or canceled between January and the end of July.
In recent years, those partnerships have included the state's Clean Energy Fund, which offers grants and low-cost financing to clean energy projects for small businesses, as well as the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy, which brings together the state government, industry associations and research labs to partner on scaling up emerging low-carbon technologies.","Over the last 10 months, the Trump administration’s sweeping rollbacks of critical green energy programs have stalled momentum toward decarbonization, leaving both U.S. industries and international partners scrambling to keep climate goals on track.

""In the energy transition world, it’s been a sea change from the prior administration to the new administration,"" said Holland & Knight international energy project attorney George Humphrey, during an October 21 panel discussion at 2025's One Ocean Week conference in Seattle, Washington.

Almost immediately after taking office in late-January, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal to the world that transitioning to green energy was not going to be a priority under his administration. On January 20, Trump signed an order to begin withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, made it so federal waters couldn't be used for offshore wind leasing, and paused all permitting for wind projects. In the ensuing weeks, his administration proceeded to dismantle core climate programs at home, delay efficiency standards for appliances, roll back vehicle emissions rules, and launch reviews to repeal greenhouse gas limits on power plants.

Then in October, Trump's Department of Energy announced that it would also be canceling more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era grants for hundreds of state-level green energy projects, including a $1 billion initiative in Washington state that would have built out robust supply chain infrastructure supporting hydrogen-powered trucks, factories, ships and power plants. As a result, states and regions face a ""patchwork of regulatory uncertainty,"" said Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance treasurer Selena Elmer at One Ocean Week, as coalitions have had to search for new sources of funding for projects viewed as critical to meeting ambitious climate goals.

That uncertainty has rippled through every corner of the clean-energy sector, from ports that have been forced to shelve infrastructure upgrades supporting offshore wind projects, to manufacturers of hydrogen, solar and battery technologies who have slowed or suspended new factory plans over fears that shifting federal policies could undermine long-term returns on clean-energy investments. Environmental advocacy group E2 estimates that, in February and March alone, 13 investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing projects worth a combined $5 billion were canceled or downsized. According to data from Wellesley College researchers, 26 other clean energy projects totaling $27.6 billion in capital were paused or canceled between January and the end of July.

The impacts of the Trump administration's energy policies have extended well past U.S. borders as well, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voting on October 17 to postpone passing its framework for taxing global shipping emissions to 2026, after Trump threatened to impose sanctions against any nations that supported the plan. Without that plan in place, environmental advocates have warned that the delay could jeopardize the IMO's ability to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, and hinder progress toward benchmark goals in 2030 and 2040.

Despite those obstacles though, speakers at One Ocean Week remained optimistic that local and state-level collaborations featuring a diverse array of public and private stakeholders could still help bridge funding gaps for green initiatives, led by climate-forward states like Washington.

""Long after the current president has moved on, Washington state will still be leading the fight against climate change, and we're going to do that with or without the federal government,"" said Washington state lawmaker Joe Fitzgibbon.

Others emphasized how regional initiatives like Washington state’s clean-energy partnerships have already kept decarbonization projects moving forward, even as national policies have shifted or stalled. In recent years, those partnerships have included the state's Clean Energy Fund, which offers grants and low-cost financing to clean energy projects for small businesses, as well as the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy, which brings together the state government, industry associations and research labs to partner on scaling up emerging low-carbon technologies.

Those local initiatives also underscore a broader view shared by One Ocean Week panelists, that even as federal policy pulls back, the work of building a cleaner, low-carbon future is continuing in states and communities determined to make progress on their own terms.

""We are not taking a single step backward,"" said Fitzgibbon.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2022/12/15/EMISSIONS-CONTAINER-SHIP-POLLUTION-CLIMATE-CHANGE-iStock-Arkadij-Schell-1326664988.jpg?height=635&t=1671166945&width=1200,N,,2025-10-30 11:22:07.126664

October 29, 2025 (Source) — Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU) (OTCQX: UURAF) (“Ucore” or the “Company“) issued the following statement regarding the G7 Energy and Environment Ministers’ Meeting taking place in Toronto, Ontario, October 30-31, 2025.

Public statements by government officials ahead of the meeting indicate that ministers intend to move beyond discussion toward concrete measures that strengthen allied critical mineral supply chains. With partners including the United States and Australia a multilateral approach is the mandate. These measures include long-term offtake agreements with price-support features, strategic stockpiling, and targeted public financing for mining, refining, and midstream processing – tools aimed at improving market stability, enhancing security of supply, and catalyzing private investment across the energy-transition value chain.

“We will see this week many examples of us moving beyond talks to firm commitments,” said Canada’s Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in remarks previewing the meeting.

What this means for Ucore shareholders

Improved bankability & revenue visibility: Durable pricing frameworks and government-backed offtakes can reduce commodity price volatility, narrowing financing risk and improving the economics of North American rare earth refining.

Faster path to domestic supply: Strategic stockpiles and procurement programs can accelerate qualification cycles and enable earlier, larger-scale purchases of high-purity rare earth oxides (REOs) by automakers, wind OEMs, and defense supply chains.

Reduced single-country risk: Coordinated G7 action to diversify supply reduces exposure to concentrated sources for rare earth magnets and battery materials -supportive of regional refining capacity and multi-source feedstock strategies.

“Rare earths are foundational to the clean energy transition and modern manufacturing,” said Pat Ryan, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO of Ucore. “As policy frameworks take shape to secure and decarbonize energy systems, Ucore is progressing North American refining capacity designed to deliver high-purity rare earth oxides responsibly and at scale. We see working with key allied Western world countries to achieve this objective as a priority.“

GM is reassessing EV production strategy after $35 billion in plug-in investments and a $1.6 billion third-quarter EV-related charge.

General Motors has temporarily cut about 5,500 workers across three U.S. plants as the automaker reassesses electric vehicle production following the elimination of federal EV tax credits. The move reflects GM’s response to a sharp slowdown in EV demand despite years of heavy investment in plug-in technology.

The largest impact is at GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit, where 3,400 employees who were furloughed over the summer are affected. About 2,200 of those workers are expected to return in January when the plant resumes one-shift operations, while 1,200 remain on indefinite furlough. Factory Zero produces the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, and Hummer EV.

Other affected facilities include GM’s Ultium battery plant in Warren, Ohio, where 1,400 employees were laid off, with 850 potentially returning in May and 550 considered indefinite, and the Spring Hill, Tennessee plant, where 710 temporary layoffs occurred.

The staffing cuts are part of a broader retrenchment as GM scales back EV production amid declining market growth. EV sales were already slowing before the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle was eliminated in September. GM had lobbied to retain the incentives and aimed to reduce EV costs to stimulate demand, but the company has had to downgrade its ambitious EV strategy.

Under CEO Mary Barra, GM invested $35 billion in plug-in technology, a strategy now being reevaluated. The automaker took a $1.6 billion charge in the third quarter tied to EV investments and expects additional charges in the fourth quarter as it adjusts production needs. The latest workforce reductions follow cuts of more than 200 salaried positions at GM’s Tech Center in Warren, Michigan.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/103020205-GM-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:21:40.364638

Authorization Positions Company to Generate Non-Dilutive, Tax-Free Capital to Support Growth, Innovation, and Sustainable Expansion

BELVIDERE, NJ, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Edible Garden AG Incorporated (“Edible Garden” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EDBL, EDBLW), a leader in controlled environment agriculture (CEA), locally grown, organic, and sustainable produce and products, today announced that the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) has preliminarily approved the Company’s application under the Technology Business Tax Certificate Transfer Program (the “Program”), also known as the Net Operating Loss (NOL) Program, for State Fiscal Year 2025. Final allocations under the Program will be based a number of factors including but not limited to location of our facilities, total available tax benefits per applicant and total requested amount.

The preliminary approval authorizes Edible Garden to transfer up to approximately $3.35 million of its unused New Jersey net operating losses and research and development (R&D) tax credits to an approved corporate buyer. If a sale is completed, the Company could generate up to approximately $3.35 million in cash proceeds, providing non-dilutive capital to support working capital, growth initiatives, and innovation. The transaction remains subject to identifying an approved corporate buyer, final allocation under the Program, closing, and compliance approval by the NJEDA.

Through the NJEDA NOL Program, qualified New Jersey-based technology and innovation-driven companies can convert certain tax assets—such as unused net operating losses and R&D credits—into working capital, creating a non-dilutive source of liquidity that supports continued growth and investment without issuing equity or incurring debt. The NOL Program is part of New Jersey’s $75 million annual allocation designed to foster innovation and business expansion across the state.

Jim Kras, Chief Executive Officer of Edible Garden, commented, “We are pleased that the NJEDA has preliminarily approved our application, authorizing us to sell up to $3.35 million of unused tax assets under the NOL Program. If completed, this transaction could provide non-dilutive capital that strengthens our balance sheet, supports R&D, and advances our strategic growth initiatives. We appreciate the NJEDA’s ongoing commitment to supporting innovative and sustainable companies such as Edible Garden.”

“This recognition underscores Edible Garden’s alignment with New Jersey’s leadership in sustainability and agtech. The ability to unlock the value of these tax assets is expected to enhance our financial flexibility as we continue executing on our growth plans and creating long-term value for our shareholders,” concluded Mr. Kras.

In rural Georgia, tap water in homes near a Meta data center runs brown and dirty.
There will be data For years, data centers were built near cities, where proximity to corporate headquarters and dense internet infrastructure helped reduce processing delays.
For a largely agricultural community like the one in and around Richland Parish, water consumption is a hot topic.
The State of Louisiana competed for the Meta data center by rewriting zoning laws and signing into law a sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029.","Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has broken ground on what could become the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere. Situated between a 200-student elementary school and swaths of farmland, the massive installation—called the Hyperion—will occupy 2,250 acres of previously state-owned land in Richland Parish in northeastern Louisiana. The data center would power Meta’s artificial intelligence-related features, and it has the potential to upend lives in a mostly agrarian area.

Meta has made sweeping promises to locals, as have state and utility officials, about the potential for prosperity from the installation: cheaper power, new jobs, and millions of dollars in community investment. But with the facility not expected to open until 2030, it is unclear whether those benefits will outweigh the costs—or whether the data center’s enormous power and water needs will strain the area’s fragile infrastructure instead of reviving it.

Across the United States, data centers have profoundly affected residents of the often impoverished communities in which they are constructed. In Memphis, air pollution from turbines at an xAI data center caused respiratory problems. In rural Georgia, tap water in homes near a Meta data center runs brown and dirty. The rapid buildout of such facilities greatly increases the risk of blackouts in the communities where they’re located, while Bloomberg reported that power bills more than doubled over a five-year period in communities surrounding data centers, costs borne primarily by consumers.

There will be data

For years, data centers were built near cities, where proximity to corporate headquarters and dense internet infrastructure helped reduce processing delays. But as land and energy costs in urban areas soared, companies began looking elsewhere—often to rural communities with cheaper property, fewer regulations, and eager local governments.

“The way a data center impacts northeastern Louisiana is going to be completely different to how it impacts Arizona, Texas, or Northern Virginia,” said Merritt Cahoon, the head of the Deep Tech Initiative at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University.

For a largely agricultural community like the one in and around Richland Parish, water consumption is a hot topic. Large data centers use as much water as a small town to cool down the supercomputers that power them. This amounts to 5 million gallons of water per day, or nearly 2 billion per year, but it’s difficult to know the true number: Many data centers do not track or publicize their water and energy usage.

“There’s a lack of standardized practices, both in terms of how different data centers are operating and in how we even account for our understanding of what their energy or water consumption is,” Ian Hitchcock, a research associate at the Deep Tech Initiative, said. “This is because we don't have universal reporting requirements, and at the moment, data centers are not being terribly forthcoming about reporting on those things.” Earlier this year, Cahoon and Hitchcock co-published a report on the sustainability challenges that data centers pose.

Tech companies often work with local governments to keep information about their water and energy consumption under wraps. In Wisconsin, it took a lawsuit against Racine County for local officials to release records on the expected water use of a Microsoft data center. In Memphis, too, local officials signed nondisclosure agreements simply to begin discussion on the data center with xAI.

Some farmers in Richland Parish are unconcerned with the new strain the data center will put on the water grid. “I’m not debating the fact that other areas with data centers have had water shortages, but those areas don’t have the Mississippi River,” Dustin Morris, who farms corn and soybeans, said. Richland Parish is situated near the Mississippi River and receives its water in part from the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer. Because of this, farmers like Morris are confident that the aquifer will be refilled fast enough to keep pace with the new data center.

In addition to searching for large, cheap swaths of land and access to power, Hitchcock said, tech companies often look for utility companies that will build the infrastructure necessary to fuel a data center. Richland Parish checks all of these boxes. The State of Louisiana competed for the Meta data center by rewriting zoning laws and signing into law a sales tax exemption for data centers built before 2029. Land costs are low too.

Promises made, promises kept?

Each day, Meta’s Hyperion data center will consume about twice the energy used by New Orleans on a peak day, which could create problems with Louisiana’s aging and unreliable power grid. The utility company Entergy agreed to build three new gas plants on Meta’s behalf to support the new data center’s consumption. These new natural gas plants will most likely contribute to air pollution.

Entergy said, however, that Meta’s presence in the region would make customers’ electric bills “lower than they otherwise would have been.” But with such an energy-demanding neighbor, will Richland Parish residents be able to keep the lights on?

It’s likely that a greater electricity load, even if it comes from one large customer, will lead to higher bills for all customers—unless utility companies create a new rate class for data centers that requires them to pay more, instead of billing them as any other ratepayer. And while Entergy said that Meta will pay “the full cost of the utility infrastructure that will benefit their Richland Parish Data Center,” the “full cost” is tenuously defined: Meta will pay the first half of a 30-year loan for Entergy’s new gas plants, but the rest of that cost, plus $550 million for a new transmission line, will be covered by local customers, according to reporting fromWired.

Tim Cywinski, the communications director of the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club, is familiar with the burdens that data centers can place on communities. He worked alongside residents of Charles City County, Virginia, to delay and eventually stop the tech company Diode Ventures from building a data center in the rural county. “Big Tech is trying to buy up farmland because it’s cheap and it gives them the space they need,” Cywinski said. “They target small, financially struggling counties, and the result is that residents—many of whom are already facing economic hardship—are sold out to the highest bidder.”

To fight these characterizations, the large corporations behind data center developments invest millions of dollars in local infrastructure. Meta takes care to maintain a community-focused image: It has said that it will invest $200 million in improving infrastructure in Richland Parish, including roads and water systems. Meta also has Richland-focused social media accounts on several platforms, on which it features local businesses and spreads news about its competitive grants that fund schools, nonprofits, and other organizations.

Francis Jordan, a farmer who grows peanuts, corn, soybeans, and beans in northeast Louisiana, hopes that the data center and infrastructure investment that comes with it will be a lifeline for the area. In recent years, the agriculture industry in the United States has suffered from low crop prices, high operating costs, and labor shortages. “Having the data center will bring investment and money to help with the roads, the hospital, and the school system, especially right now, when agriculture is in such dire straits,” Jordan said.

Outside of infrastructure and grants, though, data centers provide few benefits to the communities surrounding them—even when it comes to employment, which is often touted as a perk. Once the construction period is over, data centers employ a very small number of people. This is true in Richland Parish. Meta has hired three construction companies from other parts of the United States to build Hyperion, totaling 5,000 jobs at peak construction. The temporary influx of people has created a boom in small business in the area—but this bubble will most likely burst once the data center has been built.

Meta has said that the data center will create 500 jobs once it is operational, but there is no guarantee that these jobs will go to locals, nor has Meta said how it estimated that number. Entergy said only that it anticipates adding some number of jobs in the area.

Even if those companies don’t hire locals or open up as many jobs as promised, Jordan hopes that the data center will attract other industries to invest in North Louisiana, creating indirect jobs and thereby bolstering the economy. This could help counteract the “brain drain” that many rural areas deal with. Jordan’s three children, who are now adults, left their hometown in pursuit of career opportunities.

“When Meta is finished and other industries follow it here, there may be jobs that let some of our children stay here and live,” Jordan said. “All the jobs aren't going to be for locals, but it still brings in people who are going to spend money here and raise their kids here.”

One report estimates that residents of northeast Louisiana will occupy 95 percent of jobs related to the data center—but this means only that those roles will be worked on-site, not that people native to the region will fill them. It’s often the case that data centers employ specialized engineers and technicians, who aren’t necessarily local to the places in which they work.

Who really benefits?

The outsize strain placed on local utilities, in combination with the lack of truly impactful economic opportunities provided by data centers, has led many to believe that they take much more than they give to their host communities. And in areas where economic growth has stagnated and resources are scarce, the eagerness to build data centers reflects a sense of urgency to improve local economic conditions.

“Communities that have faced decades of underinvestment can feel desperate for any kind of development, no matter how tenuous the benefits. But local officials need to ask hard questions and not just rubber-stamp anything that looks like economic growth,” Hitchcock said.

To many, the Meta deal evokes Louisiana’s history of allowing industry to operate at the expense of Louisianians. Such is the case with Cancer Alley, an 85-mile stretch of once-pastoral land along the Mississippi River that became inundated with petrochemical plants in the mid-20th century. Today, the area has some of the highest cancer rates in the country due to the extreme levels of pollution in the air, water, and soil.

“Louisiana has a track record of approving big, bad industrial projects that come with the tradeoff of making people sick, and the people never even see the benefits of that revenue,” Cywinski said.

In his time advocating for transparency around data centers, Cywinski has found that community action is the best way to enforce local demands and delay—or even stop altogether—the building process. Cywinski recounted how he and residents of Charles City County, Virginia, successfully protested the construction of the Diode data center earlier this year.

“We organized an educational town hall, and 200 people showed up. From there, neighbors formed a core group to fight back,” he said. “They spoke at every board of supervisors meeting, did their own third-party research, and made sure their voices were heard. Eventually, Diode realized they couldn’t win and pulled their application. The community won.”

Cywinski and Angelle Bradford, the chair and manager of the Delta Chapter of the Sierra Club, are preparing for an air permit hearing with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality on November 18. It has been challenging, Bradford said, to bring people together across the rural, remote area—but farmers, faith leaders, and landowners are organizing nonetheless.

“One of the first things that I always say when I go to communities is, ‘Our opponents always think that we're not smart enough or passionate enough or rich enough to stop them,’” Cywinski said. “But in my career, I have seen how everyday people can prove them wrong.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-30 11:24:32.980507

If we keep coal plants open, they're more expensive to operate.","GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Michigan families are being warned of higher energy bills as a federal order keeps aging coal plants open, including the J.H. Campbell plant in Ottawa County.

A federal order is keeping plants like the J.H. Campbell facility running months past their planned shutdowns.

The Department of Energy issued the order to keep it operating, a move, climate advocate Sergio Cira-Reyes with the Urban Core Collective said, is already driving up costs.

""It's the worst possible time for us to keep coal plants open that are going to be more costly for our families,"" said Cira-Reyes. “... Even Consumers Energy, you know, they had agreed to close it and they would have planned for closing it. And so to this day, the plant remains open,” said Cira-Reyes.

He said Consumers Energy is following the federal order, but each week the plant stays open adds millions that could hit consumers’ bills.

“Families are struggling, you know, there's inflation which is rampant. People are struggling to pay their bills. Businesses are struggling also,” said Cira-Reyes. “... If we keep coal plants open, they're more expensive to operate. They're aging now and also it's not what the community wants,” said Cira-Reyes.

In a June SEC Consumers Energy Filing, it said keeping the J.H. Campbell plant running under a federal order cost the company $29 million between May and June.

13 ON YOUR SIDE reached out to Consumers Energy for comment. In a statement, spokesperson Brian M. Wheeler said:

""Consumers Energy disclosed in a regulatory filing this summer the net financial impact to keep the Campbell plant open was $29 million from May 23 through June. Consistent with a prior federal order, costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region – not borne solely by Consumers Energy customers. We will continue to comply with federal orders, and we will file a request later this year to recover other costs. We have worked closely with the Midwest grid operator as the plant generates electricity.""

Cira-Reyes said he's concerned about the potential cost to consumers. His team is challenging the order and urging Michigan leaders to shift toward lower-cost renewable energy.

“There's other sources of energy that are available now, like wind and solar are good examples. They're viable, they're they're more cost effective. And also they would create a shift to an economy that we can all benefit from,” said Cira-Reyes.

He’s also urging residents to reach out to state and local representatives, asking them to stop future rate hikes and protect affordable energy.

“I encourage them to, you know, connect with their elected officials. Also, connect with us. We want to hear from people about their experience.

Wood Mackenzie’s analysis concluded that almost no countries—including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States—were on track to meet their 2030 emissions goals.
Data center energy demand “is threatening to sabotage the country’s already faltering climate goals,” wrote John Fleming and Jean Su, with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a report published Wednesday.
“The reports confirm what we’ve been seeing in states on the ground for the past year—that there’s a real risk of states with stated climate goals backsliding on those,” she said.
As an example, Beck brought up North Carolina, which erased its 2030 climate goals this summer in the face of rising electricity demand.","Surging electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence is putting humanity’s climate goals out of reach, extending the life of fossil fuels and driving up emissions in the U.S. power sector while contributing to deadly extreme weather, according to two new reports published Wednesday.

With power- and water-hungry data centers forecasted to come online at staggering speeds to serve big tech companies’ seemingly bottomless appetite for AI infrastructure, utility companies have turned to fossil fuels to help meet the explosion in demand for power.

It’s a sharp departure from earlier forecasts of only modest, gradual growth in electricity demand, potentially threatening large countries’ commitments to transition away from fossil fuels. President Donald Trump and his administration have spoken glowingly about how AI will reinvigorate U.S. coal and other fossil fuel markets.

“Accelerating from deployment to a deeply decarbonized, resilient energy system is proving far more complex than simply adding megawatts,” said Prakash Sharma, vice president for scenarios and technologies at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, in a press release accompanying his company’s new report.

Wood Mackenzie’s analysis concluded that almost no countries—including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States—were on track to meet their 2030 emissions goals. But if countries across the globe show “extraordinary ambition,” according to the report, and make significant, rapid investments in renewable energy, humanity could limit warming to within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by around 2060.

The 2015 Paris Agreement called for holding Earth’s temperature rise below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) above pre-industrial levels, and ideally to just 1.5 degrees C in order to preserve a livable planet. To do that, scientists estimated the global economy would need by 2050 to achieve “net-zero” carbon emissions, in which human activity produces a negligible amount of greenhouse gases that could be absorbed by natural ecosystems rather than persisting in the atmosphere.

Among the world’s largest economies, the U.S. has the biggest gap between current climate transition investments and the spending necessary to reach net-zero emissions. The country would need to increase its spending on reducing emissions by 76 percent to meet the net-zero goal, more than double the increase the European Union would need to make and more than two-and-a-half times the increased spending necessary in China.

“A new climate leadership is emerging,” Sharma said. “As the U.S. doubles down on fossil fuels, pushing allies to buy its LNG, China is seizing the low-carbon mantle through EV and solar dominance, plus aggressive renewables deployment.”

The United States has signaled a willingness to offer tax breaks and open public lands to data centers—warehouses of servers whose computing power drives AI services and much of the internet, many of which will be powered by fossil fuels, according to International Energy Agency estimates.

Data center energy demand “is threatening to sabotage the country’s already faltering climate goals,” wrote John Fleming and Jean Su, with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a report published Wednesday. Fleming and Su found that, if AI data centers powered by fossil fuels grow as forecasted, all other sectors of the U.S. economy would need to cut emissions by 60 percent in order for the U.S. to meet its emissions targets.

“A gas-fed AI boom is going to hurdle us past any chance of keeping to our climate goal or maintaining a safe and healthy future for our planet,” said Fleming, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “To the extent that data center buildout is needed at all, it should be powered only by clean, renewable energy.”

McKenna Beck, the Ralph Cavanagh climate solutions fellow at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who was not involved in either report, agreed with that conclusion, and warned that the current demand for AI runs the risk of spoiling climate pledges at the local level, too.

“The reports confirm what we’ve been seeing in states on the ground for the past year—that there’s a real risk of states with stated climate goals backsliding on those,” she said. As an example, Beck brought up North Carolina, which erased its 2030 climate goals this summer in the face of rising electricity demand.

Beck believes that, if given the right guardrails, AI electricity demand is not destined to add a ton of emissions to the U.S. economy. “With the right incentives and requirements, data centers could actually supercharge clean energy,” she said.

But with the Trump administration actively working to stifle renewable energy growth, Beck acknowledged that any good-governance AI policies would need to be implemented on a smaller scale.

“States are on the front lines right now,” she said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2161943574-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 08:58:48.562374

Janata Energy will see their towers standing tall whilst finally making a 100-year -project a reality.
Perhaps Janata Energy is pointing us in the direction where flat solar panels are a waste of time, with Milwaukee’s “Ecacia” solar trees even showing impressive performance.","100 years later, an idea put forward by French engineer Bernard Dubos is being brought to the fore, and it’s like 3 solar panels ignited at once. In 1913, Dubos proposed the concept of a Solar Aero-Electric Power Plant that would harness the sun’s energy on a massive scale in North Africa. This forward-thinking idea was presented before the French Academy of Sciences, and the core premise of the idea was to build a towering solar structure that was vertically raised to capture the sun’s energy.

The 100-year-old project is becoming a reality in one state

While Dubos proposed the idea of Solar Aero-Electric Power Plant for North Africa, it is Texas in South Central America that has decided to harvest more power by using less space. The Texas-based startup, Janata Power, is bringing Dubos’ idea to light with its 3D solar tower technology. The skyscrappers are able to produce three times more power per unit area in comparison to the more traditional panels.

The very concept proposed by Dubos was to capture the essence of such a powerful solar building that it could seem like three panels ignited all at once. Indeed, the methaphor of the three panels igniting simultaneously signifies a significant advancement in energy density and performance.

Understanding the technology utilized by Janata Power

The way Janata Energy’s towers are structured is so as to reshape the way in which industries and airports think of clean power. Janata’s vertical tower stretches skyward and captures the sun’s power from a variety of angles. Due to the design of these solar towers, a 50% increase in solar energy generation will result.

The geometry behind each tower allows the tower to capture maximum sunlight from all angles during the day. The fact that the towers can capture maximal sunlight during all hours of the day is already a spectacular feat. Traditional panels tend to capture maximal sunlight during midday only.

According to the performance metrics of Janata Energy towers:

It has a 32% capacity factor in comparison to the 22% of other conventional systems.Wind resistance of up to 170 mph is offered to ensure peak performance during harsher weather conditions, too.

Up to three times the solar surface area is exposed to the sun.

The metrics are nothing short of impressive, and these Janata Energy systems are being tested in high-demand areas with pilot projects underway at airports, including at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

Compact and affordable power thanks to Janata Energy

At Janata Energy, the philosophy is more power, more energy, less space. The company is all in favor of a future whereby energy is sustainable and accessible to all. According to Janata Energy, even those in rural areas must have access to compact and affordable power.

Janata Energy is achieving its philosophy with a four-tier resilient system, which combines solar, grid, battery, and generator backup to guarantee power all day long. Each tower has smart sensors and over-the-air (OTA) software updates set to enhance performance. Since installations of the towers can happen within a few days, the payoff of installing these solar towers is under five years. Clearly, solar panels of the future are hitting America, and Janata Energy proves this.

Janata Energy is capturing a vertical future for solar power

A key moment for Janata Energy was the completion of the $5,5 million seed round that was led by MaC Venture Capital and Collab Capital. This was a pivitol moment for Texas, as funding will now increase and tower deployment will increase as well.

With its headquarters in Dallas, Texas, Janata Energy is planning to position itself at the very center of solar technological innovation. Janata Energy will see their towers standing tall whilst finally making a 100-year -project a reality. Perhaps Janata Energy is pointing us in the direction where flat solar panels are a waste of time, with Milwaukee’s “Ecacia” solar trees even showing impressive performance.

“EPA continues to work to fulfill our statutory obligations, emergency response efforts, and Administration priorities,” the spokesperson added.
“Despite the Democrat shutdown, EPA maintains essential operations because we are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans.
Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.” The spokesperson added that the agency is operating according to its shutdown plan, under which 89 percent of the agency’s staff was slated for furlough.
The shutdown plan states that issuance of “permits, guidance, regulations, and policies” will cease unless they are “necessary for exempted or excepted activities.”","The government shutdown isn’t stopping the Trump administration from advancing its policy priorities, especially when it comes to fossil fuels.

When it announced its contingency plans for the shutdown, the Bureau of Land Management said that staff who are in charge of processing leases and permits for oil and gas, leases for coal or “other energy and mineral resources necessary for energy production” would still have to work.

Since that time, it has continued to approve drilling permits. Between Oct. 1 and Wednesday, the bureau approved 474 permits to drill on public lands.

That figure is fairly in line with previous months when the government was open, with 494 permits approved in August and 505 in September.

Interior Secretary Burgum said during a recent event that the administration is scrounging up funding wherever it can to pay people for activities such as approving permits.

“Whether it’s a an entrance fee at a park, I’ve got nobody out there to collect that, whether it’s getting permits done, we’re grabbing any cash that was laying in any drawer to try to pay those essential people, including the people that can do the permitting, so that we can keep going,” Burgum said last week during an event at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

“We’re on a track way ahead of last year in terms of permitting, and whether it’s permitting, timber, grazing, oil and gas, infrastructure, easements… if it crosses federal land, we’re trying to do everything we can to not be handicapped,” he added.

Interior Department spokesperson Kristen Peters said in an email that drilling permits were being processed “using associated filing fees.”

She added that the Bureau of Land Management “collects a non-refundable processing fee when an oil and gas operator submits” a permit application.

At the same time, Burgum mused that the government may also consider further layoffs as a result of the funding lapse. The Trump administration has broadly sought to lay off workers and shrink the size of the government, though mid-shutdown reductions in force have been halted by the courts.

“What all of us are doing in the Cabinet is taking a hard look at ‘wow, maybe we actually don’t need all of these resources’” Burgum said while criticizing Democrats amid the ongoing shutdown.

“So maybe they’re actually helping us get to the point where we can say, ‘We don’t need as many people; we don’t need as much cost.’”

Interior in particular has sought to keep the Trump administration’s fossil fuel agenda moving forward, even as the shutdown hampers other government services.

The contingency plan from the Bureau of Land Management, which falls under Interior, says that it is keeping some staffers on in order to “address the National Energy Emergency.”

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s plan, meanwhile, states that it will have employees available “to work on priority conventional energy projects.” The term “conventional energy” typically refers to fossil fuels.

These priority projects include preparing the administration’s plan for offshore drilling for the years ahead, as well as “preparation for the anticipated calendar year 2026 offshore critical mineral lease sales and oil and gas development plans.”

While offshore minerals mining has never been done at a large scale, the White House has directed Interior to set up a program for mining the ocean floor. The plan indicates that the administration plans to auction off those mining rights next year.

When the shutdown plans were announced, Interior said on social media that it would “ensure permitting and other efforts related to American Energy Dominance are continued.”

Critics argue that the government should not be continuing to fund fossil fuel approvals while cutting back essential services.

“They can’t find money for SNAP benefits, but they can find money to keep permitting oil and gas drilling. That’s the priorities for this administration right now,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities, which has published its own tracker of the administration’s approved permits.

President Trump has expressed a fondness for fossil fuels and antipathy toward renewables, particularly repeating his intention to “drill, baby drill.”

Meanwhile, Interior may not be alone.

The New York Times has reported that at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), staffers are working on a plan that would loosen restrictions on coal plants’ mercury releases.

According to Bloomberg Law, a key EPA official said last week that staffers with jobs related to chemicals are still working during the shutdown.

“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations & Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” an EPA spokesperson said in an email.

“EPA continues to work to fulfill our statutory obligations, emergency response efforts, and Administration priorities,” the spokesperson added. “Despite the Democrat shutdown, EPA maintains essential operations because we are unwavering in our commitment to our mission of providing clean air, clean land, and clean water for all Americans. Moreover, we’ll continue to dismantle the Biden Administration’s wasteful and costly agenda.”

The spokesperson added that the agency is operating according to its shutdown plan, under which 89 percent of the agency’s staff was slated for furlough.

Our industry is ready to play its part through lending and financing.” Rachael Orr, CEO of Climate Outreach said: “This plan is right to highlight the benefits the clean energy transition can bring to people across the country.","Further detail on clean energy and the role of zero emission vehicles has been outlined in the UK Government’s updated Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan.

The framework includes plans on Sustainable Aviation Fuel, access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure and investment in clean energy to meet its targets for 2035. Originally aiming to reduce emissions by 78% against the 1990 base level, it is now targeting an 81% cut in the next decade.

The core of the government’s plans include investment in clean domestically-produced power, a national plan to deliver 400,000 extra green sector jobs, its Warm Homes agenda, including solar power, and delivery of cleaner air – including promotion of zero emission vehicles.

The report highlights the Electric Car Grant, announced this summer, but goes further and adds that it will consult on “empowering” renters and leaseholders to install home chargepoints. This includes the announcement this week on cutting red tape on cross-pavement charging solutions.

In addition, it added that “Ofgem will also ensure that Distribution Network Operators offer quality connection and smooth

and rapid connections to all customers, including chargepoint operators. These measures will help drive the transition to zero emission vehicles and ensure everyone can share the benefits’.

The plan made three key points:

A “further 100,000” chargepoints expected to be installed as a result of the Local EV Infrastructure Fund and £6 billion of private investment committed to 2030 – alongside the £25 million scheme for local authorities to expand access to cheaper at-home charging.

A zero-emission fleet of vans and heavy goods vehicles will be at the “core of a cleaner and more efficient freight and logistics sector”.

Decarbonising aviation, with the SAF Mandate requiring 22% of UK jet fuel to be sustainable aviation fuel by 2040. We are also taking steps to power ships with sustainable fuels and electricity.

Secretary of State, Ed Miliband, said:

Over the last 16 months we have put clean energy and climate action at the heart of our government’s agenda – because we know it is the route to making the British people better off.

This is about delivering better lives for people today – from warmer homes and cleaner air to cheaper transport and increased access to nature – as we tackle the climate and nature crises to protect our home for future generations.

It would be negligent to leave our children and grandchildren to face energy insecurity and climate breakdown. By providing clarity and certainty on how Britain will seize these opportunities, this plan will help unlock the investment we need in clean energy, jobs and growth at home. And it will strengthen our position as a climate leader so we can push others internationally to take the action needed to avoid disaster.

Minister for Climate, Katie White, said:

“Our world leading Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan supports good jobs now and in the future, while continuing to attract billions of pounds of investment into Britain. Today’s plan reaffirms that clean energy is the economic opportunity of the 21st century.”

Nigel Topping CMG, Chair of the Climate Change Committee, said:

“It’s good to see the first comprehensive plan from the current Government for achieving the next carbon budgets. We will assess it fully in our annual progress report in June next year.

“There have been some encouraging signs of progress in the delivery indicators in our recent progress report. However, a significant increase in roll-out rates is needed in many areas in the next few years. It’s essential that progress against these is monitored with plans adjusted accordingly if things go off track.

“Our number one recommendation remains to make electricity cheaper. This means taking policy costs off electricity bills. This is vital for ensuring the required scale-up of heat pump installations in the plan and we hope to see this addressed in the upcoming Warm Homes Plan.”

Colin Walker, Head of Transport, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said:

‘The problem isn’t those who fly to go on their annual holidays, but there’s certainly a fairness point here given 30% of flights are taken by just 3%.

“The Government is pinning its hopes for cutting aviation emissions on Sustainable Aviation Fuels and technological innovations that are still very much in their infancy, and failing to encourage ultra-frequent flyers from making more sustainable choices.”

Rain Newton Smith, CEO of the Confederation of British Industry, said:

“Clear, consistent climate laws have helped make the UK a global leader in clean energy investment and innovation. This transition is not only essential for tackling climate change – it’s a strategic economic opportunity. Businesses remain committed because they understand this transition is the backbone of a competitive, resilient economy in an uncertain world. The science hasn’t changed but the risks of inaction have.”

Shirine Khoury-Haq, The Co-operative Group Chief Executive and co-chair of the Net Zero Council said:

“Building on the significant progress that the UK continues to make in reducing its emissions, today’s announcement is another important step. It’s vital we continue to act to tackle climate change, to deliver a fairer future for generations to come.”

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said:

“This climate plan includes vital commitments to invest into manufacturing supply chains and good jobs. That’s welcome news for workers in every corner of the country.”

Friends of the Earth’s Chief Executive, Asad Rehman, said:

“There are some encouraging signs that, at long last, we have a government ready to step up and get the UK’s climate targets back on track. But we won’t know for sure until we have studied the full detail of the plan.”

Andy Prendergast, GMB National Secretary, said:

“Delivering good jobs must be the number one mission of all governments. If this plan delivers good, secure jobs and tackles climate change, it can only be a good thing.”

Rachel Solomon Williams, Executive Director of the Aldersgate Group, said:

“Economic growth must be based on decarbonisation, especially given the material risk that climate change poses to businesses and the opportunities offered by the global transition. The Climate Change Act, and the delivery plans that it requires, helps the UK to maintain its leadership position. It also offers certainty and attracts global investment to futureproof the UK economy.”

Sarah Boon, Managing Director, Corporate Affairs & Strategic Policy at UK Finance, said:

“The UK’s transition to a low‑carbon economy is a huge opportunity to drive investment, create jobs, and secure long-term growth. Our industry is ready to play its part through lending and financing.”

Rachael Orr, CEO of Climate Outreach said:

“This plan is right to highlight the benefits the clean energy transition can bring to people across the country. Almost three quarters of us are worried about climate change and there is a quiet sense of pride across the country that we are building the clean industries of the future. Many people feel genuine excitement about climate policy when it’s seen as an investment in something tangible which benefits their homes, communities and our natural world.”

Miles Celic OBE, CEO of TheCityUK, said:

“The publication of the Carbon Budget Delivery and Growth Plan (CBDGP), and the inclusion of the Investor Prospectus particularly, marks a positive step forward in providing industry with clarity on the UK’s net zero policy landscape and the government support available.”

Minnie Moll, CEO of the Design Council, said:

“We fully support the government’s stance that green growth and economic growth go hand in hand and are delighted that design has been recognised as a key clean energy job, a vital acknowledgment of the sector’s role in driving innovation for the green economy. This recognition aligns with our mission to upskill one million designers in green design skills by 2030, ensuring the UK design industry leads the way in the green transition.”

Ian Simm, CEO of Impax Asset Management said:

“By prioritising practical benefits – lower bills, good jobs, warmer homes and cleaner air – it makes a compelling case for accelerated climate action underpinning much-needed economic growth. I applaud the Secretary of State for outlining a clear path forward and look forward to continuing our work through the Net Zero Council to help unlock the investment needed to deliver it.”

Beverley Cornaby, Director, UK Corporate Leaders Group, said:

“Business leaders across the UK know that delivering on our climate goals is also an opportunity to drive innovation, unlock investment, and build resilience in the face of volatile global energy prices. It simply makes good business sense.”

Chris Cummings, Chief Executive of the Investment Association, said:

“This is an important step in establishing dialogue between potential investors and government to build confidence on policy direction, involve investors at an early stage in project development, and build capacity in government to engage constructively with investors at every stage of the capital cycle from start-up to major infrastructure project.”

Matthew Evans, COO and Director of Markets at techUK, said:

“The new plan shows climate action is good for growth and great for businesses. With digital solutions integral to delivering progress, jobs, and with the potential to cut global emissions by 20%, techUK is looking forward to working with government to achieve this ambitious plan.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/rsz_shutterstock_1192264885-1-800x445-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 11:22:11.919240

Predictions made by scientists at oil giant Exxon in the early 1980s are proving accurate. The damage done by a hotter, more chaotic world is worsening and getting more expensive.

Even so, many countries around the world are failing to meet their emissions targets, with major gaps found even this week between the commitments and actions needed to hold global warming to 1.5°C.

This has put Earth on a dangerous path, as our new report on the state of the climate reveals.

Earth’s vital signs ailing

Last year was the hottest on record. It was also likely the hottest in at least 125,000 years.

Every year, we track 34 of the planet’s vital signs. In 2024, 22 of these indicators were at record levels. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and ocean heat both hit new highs, as did losses of trees to fire. Meat consumption kept rising and fossil fuels consumption reached new heights.

The consequences of climate inaction are ever more clear. In 2024, the world’s coral reefs suffered the most widespread bleaching ever recorded, affecting roughly 84% of the world’s coral reef area between January 2023 and May 2025.

Greenland and Antarctic ice mass fell to record lows. Deadly and costly disasters surged, including the flooding in Texas which killed at least 135 people while the Los Angeles wildfires have cost more than A$380 billion. Since 2000, global climate-linked disasters have now caused more than $27 trillion in damages.

Stories and statistics like this are sadly not new. Many other reports and warnings have been published before we started this annual snapshot in 2020. Therefore, our report this year focuses on three high-impact types of climate action, across energy, nature and food.

Energy

Combined solar and wind consumption set a new record in 2024 but is still 31 times lower than fossil fuel (oil, coal, gas) energy consumption. This is despite the fact renewables are now the cheapest choice for new energy almost everywhere. One reason for this are the ongoing subsidies for fossil fuels.

By 2050, solar and wind energy could supply nearly 70% of global electricity. But this transition requires restricting the influence of the fossil fuel industry and a full phase out of fossil fuel production and use, not the expansion we continue to see globally.

As a result of surging fossil fuel consumption, energy-related emissions rose 1.3% in 2024 and reached an all-time high of 40.8 gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide equivalent. In 2024, the greatest fossil fuel greenhouse gas emitters were China (30.7% of total), the United States (12.5%), India (8.0%), the European Union (6.1%), and Russia (5.5%). Together, they accounted for 62.8% of global emissions.

Sadly, much of the rise in fossil fuel electricity generation may be due to hotter temperatures and heat waves.

Although there are concerns over the environmental impacts of renewables, the greater threat to our biodiversity is climate change and biodiversity conservation and mitigation measures can be part of project planning.

Nature

Protecting and restoring ecosystems on land and in the ocean remains one of the most powerful ways to support climate change, and support biodiversity and human well-being.

Protecting and restoring ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, mangroves and peatlands could remove or avoid around 10 Gt of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2050, which is equivalent to roughly 25% of current annual emissions.

But we must also stop destroying what we have. Global tree cover loss was almost 30 million hectares in 2024, the second highest area on record and a 4.7% increase over 2023. Tropical primary forest losses were particularly large in 2024, with fire-related losses reaching a record high of 3.2 million hectares, up from just 690 thousand hectares in 2023, a 370% increase.

Food

Approximately 30% of food is lost or wasted globally. Reducing food waste could greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions since it accounts for roughly 8–10% of global emissions. Policies supporting plant-rich diets could also help slow climate change, while offering many benefits related to human health, food security, and biodiversity.

The technical mitigation potential associated with switching away from eating meat may be in the order of 0.7–8.0 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2050. This is in part because methane emissions from cows, sheep and other ruminant livestock account for roughly half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Per capita meat consumption hit all-time highs in 2024, and we currently add 500,000 more ruminants per week.

Creating global change

In our report, we note that social tipping points can trigger climate action. These refer to moments when a small, committed minority triggers a rapid and large-scale shift in social norms, beliefs, or behaviours. Research shows sustained, nonviolent movements and protests involving just a small proportion of a population (about 3.5%) can help trigger transformative change.

Many people underestimate just how much support there is globally for climate action, with most people believing they are in a minority. This arguably fosters disengagement and isolation. But it also suggests that as awareness grows and people see their values reflected in others, the conditions for social tipping points may be strengthened.

Reaching this positive tipping point will require more than facts and policy. It will take connection, courage, and collective resolve. Climate mitigation strategies are available, cost effective and urgently needed, and we can still limit warming if we act boldly and quickly, but the window is closing.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/699102/original/file-20251029-76-lijtk5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C177%2C2120%2C1060&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-30 08:58:32.834252
