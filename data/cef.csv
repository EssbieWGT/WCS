(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia has seen an increase in special education students, and in some counties, those students now account for a quarter of enrollment. 
Required services for special education students — like one-on-one aids and nurses — have impacted schools’ budgets. Federal and state education laws mandate services be provided to special education students.  
Jackson County Schools Superintendent William Hosaflook said his county has a roughly $2.8 million deficit in order to educate around 600 special education students in his district.  
“What we have to do is look at other areas. It could be our (Career and Technical Education)  courses, it could be our (agriculture) programs, it could be our band programs, but somehow we have to reduce that to make sure that we can meet our budgetary goals,” he said. 
As lawmakers contemplate a change to West Virginia’s complicated school funding formula, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt asked lawmakers to prioritize giving counties more resources for special education students. 
“We believe that our state’s growing number of special education students that are being served in our public schools is the area where we are really falling behind,” she told members of the House Committee on Finance Thursday. “We are probably getting about half of what it costs to educate those students.”
The school aid formula is a seven-step formula that determines how much state funding goes to county school systems based on factors including the number of students enrolled in the county public school system.
While services for special education students can cost anywhere from 50% to 420% more than general education, West Virginia’s current school funding formula offers resources for only “high acuity” special cases.
West Virginia ranks near the bottom of all states for its amount of funding for special education despite the rate of special education students being the nation’s fifth highest.
“To address those needs, whether it’s staffing or the resources that have to be in place for those students. Looking at the geography, the transportation, the facilities in another area … that’s costly,” Blatt said.
She noted that public schools are currently providing special education services for students in private school or who are being homeschooled. They are also required to provide those services for students using the Hope Scholarship, the state’s school voucher program.
“Because those services aren’t available in a lot of the other school choice options,” Blatt said.
Number of special education students increasing
The number of special education students has grown nationwide due to improved identification and a better understanding of common conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD,  education experts say. 
In West Virginia, educators have linked special education needs to the state’s substance abuse crisis. Fetal drug exposure is tied to a higher likelihood of mental disorders, adverse behavior problems and needing an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
The RAND Corporation, which presented its analysis of West Virginia’s school funding formula to lawmakers last week, recommended that the state adjust its funding formula to increase funding for special education students. 
“Districts need more resources to adequately serve students from low-income families, students with disabilities and English learners,” RAND Corporation researcher Brian Phillips told lawmakers. “These students require additional support, specialized staff and services if they’re going to have an equal opportunity to succeed.”
Ahead of the legislative session, Senate and House leadership told reporters that they expected lawmakers to focus on changing the state school aid formula.
Public school officials have said that the current school aid formula isn’t working due to West Virginia’s declining student population, the rising number of special education students and other factors. Decreases in enrollment over decades — along with waning federal pandemic funds — have caused county school systems to consolidate and lay off teachers.
“If we think we’re going to fix this in 60 days, we’re absolutely wrong,” Hosaflook said. “We have to come to the table. It needs to be superintendents. It needs to be legislators. It needs to be the Department of Ed, everyone working together for public education to fix this.”

Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, questions Arkansas Department of Education officials about school vouchers during an Arkansas Legislative Council meeting on Jan. 16, 2026. (Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)During last week’s meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council, where members were asked to pour $32 million more into Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ school voucher subsidies, Republican Sen. Breanne Davis of Russellville unintentionally drew attention to a bit of the program’s perverse financial logic.
Rep. Jim Wooten of Beebe, one of a handful of Republicans who voted against the vouchers scheme when it was approved in 2023, noted that by drawing students away from public schools and reducing student numbers, the program would also reduce their state funding. That funding is tied to a set annual per-student amount.
“I’m telling you, we are hurting public schools when we take $309 million for private schools,” he said.
But Davis, who was the chief Senate sponsor of the law creating the vouchers program, argued that the difference is made up as the state raises the amount of per-student funding districts receive.
The value of a voucher is set at 90% of that per-student amount, which means that raising it will also make the vouchers more expensive – creating a circular, double-barreled assault on the state treasury, with no end in sight.
Davis’ solution, if it can be called that, also ignores the larger point Wooten was trying to make. At some point, probably when a recession causes a drop in state revenues, legislators will be forced to make a choice between funding vouchers, which benefit fewer than 45,000 students at a staggering cost of more than $300 million per year, and funding public schools, which serve 10 times as many kids.
However, there are indications that Republican legislators are at last waking up to the threat vouchers pose to the state budget, an obvious timebomb most GOP lawmakers seemed to ignore three years ago in their rush to do Sanders’ bidding.
In a rare instance of legislators standing up to the governor on one of her signature issues, there was audible dissent during a voice vote when Sanders’ latest request for more voucher money was approved by a legislative council subcommittee, on which only Republicans sit.
And for good reason. In the state budget approved last April, $187 million was appropriated for vouchers. In June,  Sanders came back to legislators to ask for $90 million more, dipping into state reserves. Now, the $32 million tranche approved by the legislative council last week (also from reserves) brings the total to $309 million – 65% more than what was appropriated just nine months ago.
The reason for the cost explosion is that starting last fall, any Arkansas parent can get a voucher subsidy, no matter their income. But it’s also the result of a conscious decision by Sanders not to avail herself of the tool legislators gave her to prevent these very kinds of cost overruns.
One of the striking features of the debate over vouchers when they were approved in 2023 was that Sanders administration officials didn’t provide a cost estimate for the program at full implementation because, they said, there was no way to know how many parents would enroll.
However, legislators put in a safeguard to prevent the kind of budget implosion vouchers have caused in Arizona and other states: The program wouldn’t operate as an entitlement, in which the state guarantees funding for every parent who chooses to participate, but would instead enroll students only to the extent of funding made available by legislators, rationing access and putting parents on waiting lists when the money ran out.
But limits on enrollment in an ideologically driven program designed to play to the Republican base was never a politically realistic prospect. And, indeed, Sanders has refused to use this tool, insisting that every parent who wants a voucher will get a voucher, no matter the cost.
In essence, she has turned her vouchers program into an entitlement that benefits largely middle-class and higher-income families, with no restraint on the total cost, which was the very scenario Republican legislators sought to prevent.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, a reliable vouchers supporter, expressed frustration that the cost of the program had not been controlled by the budget.
The Walnut Ridge lawmaker said she wanted to ensure the state wasn’t getting into an area where it has to “make some really tough choices” on what to prioritize.
“We’re fast approaching that,” she said.
Sanders’ finance secretary, Jim Hudson, told legislators that he expects the budget request for vouchers presented to legislators during the upcoming fiscal session will be “310ish,” avoiding the raids on reserve funds seen this year.
However, that’s almost exactly the same amount spent this year and unlikely to cover increases if more students receive vouchers and the state’s per-student funding continues at the same rate.
Revelations by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and other news outlets of questionable spending by homeschool parents enrolled in the program – $600 chicken coops, karate lessons, horseback riding lessons, $2,000 laptops and Shaquille O’Neal gaming chairs – has also started to draw scrutiny from Republican legislators who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey got Department of Education officials to make an eyebrow -raising admission that nothing prevents homeschool parents receiving vouchers from buying pricey items, ostensibly for educational purposes, and then returning them and pocketing the money.
In passing Sanders’ vouchers scheme, legislators ignored clear, available evidence that vouchers harm educational outcomes, rather than improving them. They ignored the social and financial impacts of draining away students from public schools, particularly in rural districts. But they won’t be able to ignore a price tag that continues to rise.
The budget session that starts in April will be the first test of how many Republican legislators are coming to their senses on this expensive boondoggle. 
Does Sanders have the political muscle to win this fight? Very likely. 
But the halcyon days of 2023, when legislators asked few questions and got out their rubber stamps to give Sanders everything she wanted, may mercifully be coming to an end.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wooten-1.16.25-1024x679.jpg,,,2026-01-23 06:36:17.226737

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Republicans in the Alaska Legislature voted down a new funding source for public school programs Thursday as they sustained Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of Senate Bill 113.
The vote on overriding the governor was 35-25, 10 votes short of the 45 needed for an override. All of the “no” votes came from Republicans in the House and Senate minority caucuses. Those voting no included some legislators, such as Sen. Rob Yundt, R-Wasilla, who had strongly supported the bill last year.
If SB 113 had been enacted, the bill would have shifted some corporate income tax payments from other states to Alaska. 
The result was expected to be between $25 million and $65 million per year in new revenue for the state treasury, and the bill called for much of that money to go to programs that help young children learn how to read and to career-technical education programs that teach Alaskans non-college trades. 
Dunleavy vetoed the bill last fall, saying he was unwilling to approve any tax measure that was not part of a comprehensive, long-term plan intended to balance state revenue and expenses.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the veto needed to be taken up during the first five days of the regular session if lawmakers wanted to override it.

(Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)Slim profit margins, high operating costs, low staff compensation, and limited government funding led to a 11% net loss in licensed child care programs in New Hampshire between 2017 and 2025, according to new research from the UNH Carsey School of Public Policy. 
A new primer, released Thursday, reports that the disparity between tuition prices parents can afford and the high costs of operating a child care program are challenges that cause programs to be “economically strained and financially complex.” 
Research shows that operating a program with separate classrooms for infants, toddlers, 3-year-olds, and 4-year-olds costs between $1.1 million and $1.8 million a year, depending on whether educators are being paid a living wage and if they have benefits. Providers try to offer benefits without increasing tuition prices, because if staff stay, program capacity can increase and revenue can improve. 
Tuition is the primary revenue source for early education programs, with staff wages and benefits the main expenses. To meet the true cost of care, research shows tuition for center-based infant care would have to rise between $5,000 and $17,000 a year, something most Granite State parents cannot afford. In 2024, tuition averaged $16,000 a year for infants. 
While funding sources like the Child Care Development Fund and programs like the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship help diversify revenue, they are not sufficient on their own. The Carsey School found that more attention toward alternative funding streams, such as partnering with the private sector and engaging with non-early education stakeholders, can lead to “a sustainable statewide ECE system.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcarehands-1024x623.jpg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

The bill targets decisions by school districts to “opt out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state, in order to raise more revenue. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.
Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”

Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill. She said the change is aimed at property tax relief and accountability, telling a legislative committee that current petition signature requirements can be difficult to achieve in larger districts and that voters should have a direct say when districts seek to exceed statutory property tax limits.
Opponents, including the Sioux Falls School District and the School Administrators of South Dakota, said the measure would weaken local decision-making by elected school boards, add election costs and single out schools compared to other local governmental entities. They pointed to current law that allows referendums by petition and noted that opt-outs that reach the ballot usually pass.
“At the end of the day, there is no other group that is required to have an election” for an opt-out, said Heath Larson with the Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
Separately, the committee advanced a bill 7-0 that would expand eligibility for South Dakota’s Partners in Education scholarship program by raising the income limit for families entering the program from 150% to 200% of the standard used to qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch. It would also allow students to remain eligible in later years if their household income stays under 250% of the standard.
Since 2016, the program has provided private-school scholarships, supported by insurance company donations in exchange for state tax credits.  Last year, lawmakers increased the program’s annual tax-credit cap from $3.5 million to $5 million.

Two state senators and a former lawmaker filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against an omnibus piece of legislation that made broad changes to property tax law, alleging it doesn’t adhere to the state constitution.
The lawsuit, filed against the state and the state’s Department of Revenue, alleges Rep. Llew Jones, a Conrad Republican, orchestrated an effort to gut the original intention of Senate Bill 542 and replaced it with “controversial” legislation through amendments and misled the public while he did it. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, Sen. Tom McGillvray and former legislator Keith Regier jointly filed the lawsuit. Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The original goal of the property tax legislation discussion was to figure out a way to lower property taxes for Montanans. Numerous bills were discussed, ranging from so-called “Homestead exemptions” to  a simple freeze to more rebates. One of the popular fixes supported pushing the tax burden onto out-of-state residents who own homes in Montana.
Regier, who is the father of Senate President Matt Regier, said the opposite has happened.
“Instead, they’ve accelerated the land grab by significantly raising taxes on multigenerational properties that will force Montanans to sell their family legacy property to someone with the financial means to pay the tax bill,” Regier said.
Montana Governor Greg Gianforte supported the Homestead Tax exemption and his office indicated support for the legislation on Wednesday.
“While the governor’s office doesn’t generally comment on litigation, the governor is proud to have signed the only two property tax bills into law that reached his desk, cutting property taxes for 80% of Montana homeowners,” Sean Southard, the Governor’s communication director said in a statement. “If Senate Bill 542 is struck down, property taxes for Montana homeowners will increase significantly, reversing the relief that 80% of homeowners received.” 
SB 542 has three parts — a $90 million tax rebate, a permanent restructuring of property tax rates, and, last, a fix to the so-called “Billings problem.” That fix essentially pushed state funds to cities whose charters ran afoul with the changes around mill levies.
Cities with a charter that has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval could have lost millions if the state reimbursement wasn’t added. The suit calls that “vote buying.”
“Individual homeowners received rebates, favored property classes received rate reductions, and charter cities received revenue protection,” the lawsuit reads. “Each piece targeted a different constituency, and each required bundling to secure sufficient votes for passage.”
McGillvray, the senate majority leader, called it “ Washington D.C.-style corruption.”
“Montanans pride ourselves that our Legislature debates each policy idea on its own merits, with genuine public participation,” McGillvray said in a statement. “We’re not Washington, D.C., where massive bills get cobbled together behind closed doors and shoved down legislators’ throats as ‘must pass’ legislation.”
 ‘The cost of doing business’ 

The suit says that 10 days before SB 542 had a hearing in the Senate’s Taxation committee, Rep. Jones had already decided to gut the original bill, which was originally a three-page bill that froze property taxes for two years. By the end, it was a 40-page behemoth, which some legislators took to calling “Frankenstein”,  and included none of the original wording of SB 542 as introduced by Sen. Wylie Galt.
“At that hearing, neither Jones nor any other legislator disclosed the plan to Montana citizens who testified in support of what they believed was a simple property valuation freeze,” the suit reads.
The suit calls pairing unpopular legislation with things that are more palatable “log rolling,” which the suit says violates the state’s constitution and the single-subject bill rule. Essentially, the title of the bill should reflect what’s in it, at least in theory.
The lawsuit even quotes Jones, saying “When later asked about using cash rebates to buy votes for a complex rate restructuring bill, Jones admitted: “On the rebate deal, I support it because now it’s what it takes to pass the bill … [S]ometimes, that’s the cost of doing business up here.”
The suit says the bill combined multiple subjects into a single bill: specific appropriation for a one-time rebate, permanent property tax rate restructuring, as well as charter overrides and municipal reimbursement. The suit says that’s unconstitutional.
It goes on to say, in direct terms, “If the Legislature can deliberately bundle appropriations with substantive policy to buy votes, then Article V, § 11(4) becomes meaningless – a suggestion rather than a command.”
The bundling also pushed legislators into an unconstitutional choice, the suit says.
“Accept the controversial permanent rate restructuring if they wanted to support the popular temporary rebate; or reject the popular rebate if they opposed the controversial restructuring,” the suit states, going on to say that’s why the single-subject rule exists.
Frustration has been mounting everywhere over the issue. Missoula County caught some criticism from legislators over an 8% tax hike in response to state legislation.
And the Department of Revenue is fielding questions on property taxes, though it said that fewer people appealed their property taxes last year in comparison to 2024.
Hertz pointed out during the session that SB 542 was likely unconstitutional, as did House Taxation chair Rep. Paul Fielder.
“I’ve been critical when Montana courts overstep their constitutional boundaries,” Hertz said in a statement. “The Legislature must abide by the same standard. The courts exist to enforce constitutional limits when the legislative process itself has been corrupted.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s education commissioner is not happy with the conduct of some locally elected school board members, and he wants to do something about it.
Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas made clear Wednesday during a Board of Education meeting in Tallahassee that he wants the Legislature to give his department more authority over school board members seeking to “elevate themselves for political reasons.”
His comments came amid complaints against Clay County School Board member Robert Alvero.
Alvero came under scrutiny last month for comments he made in a social media video, that “I have had 80% more negative experience with the African American community in this country than with white people.”
Following the comments, Kamoutsas in December said he was “directing” Alvero to come before the state board.
Wednesday, Alvero didn’t show.

 More of Alvero’s comment:

	 “With that being said, doesn’t mean I haven’t had good experiences with African American people. I have met a lot of great African American people, and I am still friends with them because they’re good, decent people. But that’s the 20% of the people I have met. They’re African Americans. The other 80%, they’re being nasty. They’re being rude. They’re being problematic. Always trying to fight. Always disrespecting. So why would I want to be around people like that?”

“For me, this unfortunate incident is a reminder that the Legislature needs to look at this board’s authority with regard to school board members. Too many have sought to elevate themselves for political reasons, disregarding their duty to educate children, and this board’s unfortunately limited in its ability to demand accountability,” Kamoutsas said. 
“Comments that distract from the mission of serving students undermines the confidence of this entire school system,” Kamoutsas said. 
The state Board of Education comprises gubernatorial appointees, while local school boards are elected by citizens of their respective counties.
Alvero retained an attorney, former state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a conservative firebrand.
In an email response to questions from the Phoenix Wednesday, Sabatini replied, in entirety, “The state education board should cease attempting to be the political correctness police” [sic] 
In a social media post in December, Sabatini said Alvero is “receiving ridiculous criticism based on so-called ‘racist’ & ‘politically incorrect’ remarks he made.”
“The fake outrage against Alvero is complete & total nonsense,” Sabatini wrote. 
“ANY adverse state action taken against Alvero in an attempt to punish him & force him into adopting politically correct viewpoints, will be responded to with a lawsuit for First Amendment Retaliation.” 
State board chair Ryan Petty said of Clay County voters, “Hopefully they’ll take action at the next election to remove him from office.”
Critics call for lawmaker Sabatini’s resignation from Florida House over inflammatory rhetoric

Republican state Sen. Jennifer Bradley, who represents that region of the state, called upon Alvero to resign last month, as did House Speaker-designate Sam Garrison, like Bradley of Fleming Island.
“We will always protect people’s First Amendment rights to say what they want to say, but we also have to be mindful that our children hear that,” state board member Layla Collins said. 
In 2020, critics called for Sabatini to resign from the Florida House over his own inflammatory rhetoric.
Kamoutsas has not replied to an emailed question from the Phoenix asking about what precedent oversight by appointees over elected officials would follow, or set.

A look at other counties
Since Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Kamoutsas last year, he has focused on local school boards, including in Alachua and Leon counties.
In Alachua, a similar situation arose. Kamoutsas called in front of the state board that county’s vice chair, Tina Certain, after comments and actions in the aftermath of the deaths of pro wrestler Hulk Hogan and conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“This board took a lot of criticism for our attempts to hold the Alachua School Board vice chair Certain accountable for her actions, and we were accused of doing that in a very partisan manner and because of partisanship, and nothing could have been further from the truth,” Petty said. 

The Clay County situation shows that accountability comes regardless of political ideology, Petty insisted, although he described Alvero as “a so-called conservative, because I don’t think the views that he expressed were conservative in any nature — not that we’re getting into the politics of it.” Petty added: “But the comments he made were absolutely inexcusable, and should never be uttered by anybody in a position there.”
According to his bio on the Clay County school website, Alvero has served with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and Florida State Guard.

Carter Nordman, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, held a news conference Jan. 21, 2026 unveiling House Republicans' property tax proposal. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)House Republicans released their property tax plan Wednesday, starting down the path toward finding a compromise with the governor and the GOP Senate majority on one of their top session priorities.
House Speaker Pat Grassley and Rep. Carter Nordman, who chairs the House Ways and Means committee, unveiled House Study Bill 596 Wednesday. It joins the list of property tax bills to be considered this year, alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal announced in her 2026 Condition of the State address and Senate Republicans’ proposal released last week, Senate Study Bill 3001.
Nordman said House GOP lawmakers crafted their legislation with a focus on “real, tangible relief for all homeowners.”
“While there may be three different proposals out there right now, I am confident that we’ll be able to find common ground and accomplish property tax reform this year,” Nordman said. “… This plan prioritizes the taxpayer over the taxing entities. It brings simplicity, it brings transparency, and most importantly, it brings relief.”
There are some similarities between the House proposal and the governor’s plan, such as a 2% revenue cap for local governments outside of new construction, with exemptions for school funding and the debt levy. Both bills also call for a focus on finding local government efficiencies and ways for local entities to cut spending.
There are also several differences. While the governor’s bill includes a $10 million pot of one-time money for localities to finance consolidation and shared service agreements, the House bill does not have a funding mechanism to support this effort. Instead, it tasks the Iowa Councils of Government (COGs) to provide assistance with “coordination, planning and technical assistance for local government entities for the purpose of consolidating, sharing or regionalizing services.”
Grassley said COGs have already worked extensively with local governments on economic development, and said these boards were identified as a good “conduit” for working with local governments across a larger region on consolidation efforts. He also said he believes there is not necessarily a need for the fiscal backing included in Reynolds’ bill, as these changes will be driven by the revenue cap.
“Some communities have done really good with efficiency, so I’m not just blaming them in this conversation, but I’m saying with the ability to continue to collect more and more revenue, the incentive to find efficiencies, I don’t think is always taken as seriously as (it should be),” Grassley said. “So I think with that revenue gap, it will just naturally lead to more efficiencies. ”
Both the governor’s and Senate’s proposals also include a measure specifically lowering property taxes for seniors. Reynolds’ bill proposes freezing property taxes for seniors age 65 and older in homes valued at $350,000 or less, while the Senate bill goes further, eliminating most property taxes for Iowans over age 60 who no longer pay a mortgage for their home.
The House bill takes a different approach, proposing a new $25,000 exemption for all residential properties. This provision, which would mean all properties are not taxed for the first $25,000 in assessed home value, will help Iowans at all stages in their life, Nordman said.
“It gives relief to seniors, it gives relief to the working families, it gives relief to young couples who are buying a new home,” Nordman said. “So rather than just looking at one section, we’re given relief to everyone.”
The House proposal also requires bonds payable through property taxes to receive a 60% vote of approval to pass, in addition to adding new requirements on information sent to property taxpayers explaining how the tax money is used.
This bill does not include any of the measures related to changing Iowa’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes which appeared in the Senate GOP proposal, as well as property tax plans introduced by legislative leaders in 2025. Grassley said the House Republicans’ goal was to introduce a “simplified” property tax plan in comparison to previous discussions, which is why the caucus settled on advocating a 2% revenue cap.
Grassley said as the conversation on property taxes progresses, he does not see any specific points in the House bill as “deal breakers” if they are not included in a final draft. Negotiations are ongoing, he said. He added that he did not know how a consensus will be reached, but the fact that the House and Senate GOP’s and governor’s proposals are all out early in session shows that all three parties are serious about taking action on the issue this session.
“Ultimately, regardless of what the process is, our goal is to find a situation where we can find certainty for the taxpayer,” Grassley said. “So however we get there, I’m not as concerned about. But we are already engaged in those conversations.”

From groceries to heating bills to basic household expenses, residents across our state are feeling squeezed and living under the weight of rising costs that make it harder to get by.

Lisa Hammersley

Over half of Connecticut families report difficulty meeting basic needs with many more struggling to pay utility bills. Others are tapping into savings just to afford groceries and trying to survive under the pressure of an affordability crisis.
Now a similar pressure is hitting our public schools. As school districts face rising costs, communities are facing an impossible choice: cut programs and services critical to students or pass the increased expenses on to families and local taxpayers who are already stretched thin.
To avoid placing an even greater weight on the backs of taxpayers, or negatively impacting the opportunities and quality of education accessible to students, policymakers must act during the upcoming legislative session. Now is the time for Gov. Ned Lamont and legislators to provide some much-needed relief to communities and taxpayers by adjusting state education funding annually to account for inflation.
Over the past eight years, legislators across the political spectrum have come together to make significant improvements to Connecticut’s school finance system and the state’s Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula, which is the primary mechanism for distributing state education dollars to communities. A sign of that progress is this school year, after an eight-year gradual phase-in, the ECS formula will be “fully funded” for historically underfunded school districts for the first time in state history.
Although a fully funded ECS formula is a landmark achievement, it also means there are no built-in annual increases for districts going forward. This is because the phase-in of the formula is complete and the formula’s “foundation” doesn’t account for inflation. Instead, the ECS formula’s foundation amount — intended to represent the cost of educating a general education student with no additional learning needs — has remained the same since 2013 when it was raised by roughly $1,800 to the current amount of $11,525. For comparison, had the formula’s foundation simply kept pace with inflation, it would be approximately $16,000 per student today — aligning far more closely with what districts actually spend to educate their students.
While the ECS formula’s lack of accounting for inflation was largely masked as the formula was being phased in over time, it now poses a significant challenge to schools, communities, and taxpayers as the formula is fully funded and districts are left with a decade-old foundation amount that doesn’t reflect today’s costs. Without an annual adjustment for inflation, education cuts or property tax increases are the remaining options for school districts and municipalities. Neither is acceptable.
At a time when so many families are struggling to afford basic necessities, Connecticut cannot shift more of the cost of education onto the very people least able to absorb it. We cannot continually place the burden of rising costs on local taxpayers and ask municipalities to raise property taxes, particularly when many residents are already facing higher tax bills as a result of soaring home values and revaluations.
Relying on property tax revenue to always pick up the tab of inflation is not a sustainable or equitable practice. It makes our state less affordable, prevents families from settling down in Connecticut, and disproportionately harms low- and moderate-income residents who already pay a larger share of their income in property taxes. And in a state where over 57% of education funding comes from local tax dollars, it has an outsized impact on our highest-need and lowest-wealth districts — widening longstanding disparities and deepening cycles of poverty that hold families and Connecticut back.
At the same time, students’ education cannot be made to suffer because of rising costs. We cannot have students see services reduced, course offerings cut, and extracurriculars eliminated because state education funding doesn’t provide for increases in essential costs such as transportation, utilities, insurance, and instructional materials. Cuts, like the ones districts are facing due to rising costs, weaken school climates, reduce academic support, and make it harder for students to learn.
Fortunately, there is a solution and time for Gov. Lamont and the General Assembly to act and prevent communities from having to resort to education cuts or property tax hikes. Indexing the ECS formula’s foundation amount to inflation would provide predictable, annual adjustments that reflect real-world costs, support students by preventing cuts to essential programs and staff, reduce pressure on local taxpayers, and make our state more affordable, stable, and competitive. This is a simple, sustainable, and common-sense solution that would benefit every school district and community in Connecticut.
Our state has made significant progress in recent years when it comes to education funding and has taken meaningful steps toward ensuring every public school student receives fair funding no matter where they live or go to school. But without annually updating the ECS formula’s foundation for inflation, that progress will erode quickly — and students, families, and taxpayers will pay the price.
At a time when residents are stretched thin, student academic and mental health needs are growing, and teachers are in short supply, the state must step up. An annual inflation adjustment to the ECS foundation is a fair, future-focused investment that strengthens our schools, supports our taxpayers, and keeps our promise to the next generation.
Connecticut’s students deserve nothing less.
