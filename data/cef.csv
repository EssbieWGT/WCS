,California,2026-01-27 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Cracks between Newsom and frustrated lawmakers show in first budget hearings,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/cracks-between-newsom-lawmakers-budget/,"Newsom has steadily opposed major tax increases, but an ongoing, multiyear deficit and growing frustration among legislators has created a gulf between the governor and his allies on how to fix the problem.","Gavin Newsom is officially a lame-duck governor, and his final year in office seems increasingly focused on an almost certain campaign for the White House.
Meanwhile, however, he must spend at least some of his time governing California and dealing with a Legislature dominated by his fellow Democrats but increasingly less willing to cater to his whims.
Newsom’s relationship with legislators has always been more transactional than collaborative. He has even used the annual budget process to force them to adopt major policy changes with little or no scrutiny. Legislators often grumbled about being squeezed by Newsom, but felt compelled — not always but most of the time — to go along. 
However, their annoyance is becoming more public, as indicated during legislative hearings on his final budget last week. 
Newsom’s initial $349 billion budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year is, as administration officials acknowledge, merely a placeholder. It continues the current budget, with a few tweaks, but won’t be fleshed out until May, just a month before the June 15 constitutional deadline.
This year the squeeze is particularly bothersome because the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, and Department of Finance officials are both warning that the state faces large and growing budget deficits after Newsom departs.
The frustration was evident during last week’s introductory hearings for budget committees. Legislators heard Petek advise that they deal with the forecasted deficit sooner rather than later, and discussed remedies ranging from sharp cuts in spending to sharp increases in taxes. 
But in the absence of specifics from Newsom, they could only speculate.
Newsom has steadily opposed major tax increases, even though it was his administration’s immense error in revenue projections four years ago that helped create what officials call a “structural deficit,” meaning that the revenue system cannot generate enough money to pay for all the programs and services now offered.
The administration’s 2022 revenue projection error of $165 billion over four years led to Newsom declaring a $98 billion budget surplus and a sharp increase in spending, especially on social services. As an ideological tenet, Democratic legislators dislike cutting those enhancements to balance the budget, which is why increasing taxes was repeatedly mentioned during last week’s hearings.
The comments of state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, typified the squeeze that Democratic legislators are feeling. She called one of Newsom’s health care proposals, scaling back Med-Cal benefits to undocumented immigrants, “barbaric.” 
“I’m disappointed that there’s no proposal to change how our revenues come in,” Menjivar said. “We can’t just cut our way out of it. I think there should be a mixture of cuts, being strategic with how we use our dollars, but also looking to change our revenue streams.”
While the angst over the budget is palpable, reductions in federal support for expensive health and welfare programs, imposed by President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, raise the stakes even more. If they had their way, some Democrats would not only raise taxes to cover the state’s structural deficit but backstop the reductions in federal aid. 
Meanwhile, public employee unions and their allies are proposing two November ballot measures to bolster revenues: a one-time wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, and an extension of a temporary surtax on high-income taxpayers that was imposed in 2012 to close a budget deficit and later extended to 2030.
The situation leads to more questions than answers.
Will Newsom keep his promise to close this year’s deficit and the ones projected for the future?
With a presidential campaign likely in the offing, will he maintain his anti-tax increase posture?
Will Democratic legislators insist that taxes be raised to balance the budget without deep spending cuts?
In an eyeball-to-eyeball scenario, we will see who blinks first.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625_Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem_MG_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Earlier this month, the New Hampshire House passed what looks like a tiny change: a 0.05 percentage point cut to the Business Enterprise Tax. But this small number masks big consequences. 
Based on our research, the proposal would drain tens of millions of dollars from the state budget, could weaken funding for education, health care, and local services, and ultimately shift more costs onto families and property-tax payers, all while offering most businesses savings too small to meaningfully boost hiring or investment. Here’s what the data show, and why it matters for Granite Staters.  
First, this proposed change could drain millions from an already-strained state budget. Through examining past BET rate reductions, revenue trends, recent tax filing data, official state revenue projections, and interactions with the Business Profits Tax (BPT), we modeled the likely fiscal and economic effects of the proposed 0.05% change in the BET tax rate and found that if the proposed BET rate had been implemented during the current biennial state budget, it would have cost the state $26 million per year in BET revenue. 
For context, that is equivalent to more than half of last year’s budgets for the New Hampshire Veterans Home, the State Police, or the state’s road and bridge aid to towns and cities. This new annual revenue loss would be on top of the nearly $105 million in BET revenue the state is already set to lose in fiscal year 2026 due to prior reductions. These combined business tax cuts are almost twice what the state spent on targeted special education aid over the past two years. 
Second, business tax savings from the 0.05% reduction in the BET rate would be minimal and, in most cases, certainly not enough to spur hiring. The average business paying BET would save only about $47 per month from the rate reduction. When the 306 filers with more than about $18 million in taxable compensation or payments each are excluded from this calculation, the BET savings would average about $28 per month. The small savings companies will receive are clearly not enough to hire new employees, but they might be able to order a couple of pizzas. 
Third, while supporters of the tax reduction argue that reducing the BET could spur business activity and economic growth, thus ultimately increasing state revenues, the data simply do not support that claim. Historical data show no consistent statistical relationship between BET rates and job growth in New Hampshire over the last four decades. Prior studies, including New Hampshire’s own Commission to Study Business Taxes, have found no evidence that business tax cuts generate enough new economic activity to replace lost revenue, and NHFPI’s own analysis of business tax rate reductions in New Hampshire found that the business tax rate reductions cost the state about a billion dollars in revenue from 2016 to 2024.  
It is true that New Hampshire’s business tax revenues, when BPT and BET are included, have grown overall, but not consistently or as much as in many other states. From 2015 to 2024, our state’s business tax revenues more than doubled (a 118% increase). However, over the same period, business tax revenues more than tripled nationally (a 239% increase) and across the other five New England states (a 224% increase). If state business tax cuts had spurred revenue growth in New Hampshire, the state would have seen revenues outpace states that did not change their tax rates, rather than fall behind. 
Finally, cutting taxes for businesses gets expensive for Granite Staters. When business tax cuts reduce state revenue, the funding disappears, but the needs do not. Schools still need to operate, roads and bridges still need maintenance, and public health systems still need to provide care. With fewer state dollars available, communities are left struggling to meet the same obligations with fewer resources. Too often, the result is higher property taxes, which are already among the highest in the country. Those higher costs don’t stop with homeowners. They are passed on to renters and contribute to the state’s sky-high housing costs.  
The data are clear: this proposed BET cut would deliver minimal benefits to most businesses while creating real fiscal pressures for Granite Staters. As lawmakers look to the next state budget amid federal uncertainty and an ongoing affordability crisis, decisions about tax policy should be grounded in evidence and a clear-eyed understanding of who benefits and who truly pays.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/statehousedometrees-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-27 05:57:25.204578

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill to require a local election after any South Dakota school board decides to exceed property tax limitations passed the Senate on a 20-14 vote Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
The bill targets decisions by school districts to raise more revenue by “opting out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.

Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”
There are 79 active school district opt-outs across South Dakota, according to data from the Legislative Research Council, resulting in a combined total of $43 million in excess property taxes.
Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill, which was recommended by lawmakers on last summer’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force.
The bill aims to provide property tax relief and increase accountability among school districts and boards, Peterson told lawmakers, adding that the current system is “making spending limits obsolete.”
“It only makes sense that the burden should be on the school boards to get direct consent from the people if they want to circumvent spending limits,” Peterson said. “It should not be the responsibility of the people to gather petition signatures to prevent over-the-limit spending.”
Opponents of the bill said taxpayer dollars would be spent on unnecessary elections since many referred opt-outs are upheld by voters. Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said that school board members decide to opt out because of inadequate state funding. 
The bill now heads to the House of Representatives.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1659-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.
