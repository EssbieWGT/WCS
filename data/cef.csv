Like most universities, Columbia receives a great deal of federal funding. </p><p>The Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, created by the Trump Administration, announced that it will visit 10 university campuses that have  seen a shocking rise in antisemitism since October 7, 2023.</p><p>According to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, “Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses. Unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralyzed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled. Institutions that receive federal funds have a responsibility to protect all students from discrimination. Columbia’s apparent failure to uphold their end of this basic agreement raises very serious questions about the institution’s fitness to continue doing business with the United States government.”</p><p>According to Maya Sulkin in the Free Press, “even though Columbia formed a Task Force on Antisemitism weeks after Hamas’s invasion of Israel on October 7, 2023, and issued two reports that revealed shocking instances of Jew hate on campus—not just among students but professors and administrators—the college has done little to root out the problem.”As a result, on Friday the Trump Administration announced the cancellation of $400 million in federal grants to  and contracts with Columbia. </p><p>Following these developments, one could be left with the impression that higher education is doomed. Yetwe were struck by the reaction from the Call Me Back community to a conversation we had with the Chancellor of Vanderbilt University, Daniel Diermeier, last November, in an episode titled “How Vanderbilt University is getting it right.” It reminded us that some universities have impressively navigated the past 16 months.</p><p>Vanderbilt is one of them. Another is Washington University. The Chancellors of both universities (Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin and Vanderbilt’s Diermeier) recently issued a set of principles that every university should be able to adopt. They summarized these principles in a piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education, titled: “<a href='https://www.chronicle.com/article/universities-must-reject-creeping-politicization'>Universities Must Reject Creeping Politicization</a>.” You can read it here: </p><p>There have been other universities, like the University of Michigan, which in the months after October 7, 2023 experienced massive disruptions. Yet according to conversations we have had with current Jewish students, the university administration has been doing much better than others. University of Michigan President Santa Ono has taken promising steps on a number of fronts, including the University’s relationship with Israel, that could also serve as  a model.</p><p>So, against the backdrop of chaos at Columbia and Barnard this past week, we sat down with WashU’s Andrew Martin and Michigan’s Santa Ono at the ADL’s “Never is Now” Summit in New York City, for a candid conversation about what has happened at each of their universities, lessons learned, and charting a path forward. </p><p>Additional items:</p><p>ADL’s Campus Antisemitism Report Card: <a href='https://www.adl.org/campus-antisemitism-report-card'>https://www.adl.org/campus-antisemitism-report-card</a></p><p>-Free Press reporting on Columbia University:</p><p><a href='https://www.thefp.com/p/exclusive-trump-administration-cancels'>https://www.thefp.com/p/exclusive-trump-administration-cancels</a></p><p>-<a href='https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-columbia-antisemitism-federal-funding'>https://www.thefp.com/p/trump-columbia-antisemitism-federal-funding</a></p><p>CREDITS:</p><p>ILAN BENATAR - Producer & Editor</p><p>MARTIN HUERGO - Editor</p><p>YARDENA SCHWARTZ - Executive Editor of Ark Media</p><p>GABE SILVERSTEIN - Research Intern </p><p>YUVAL SEMO - Music Composer</p> ",,"https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFnZS5zaW1wbGVjYXN0Y2RuLmNvbS9pbWFnZXMvNGExZjJjY2UtNzZjYi00MDg4LTk2MzgtYWM3MjU4MGZiNTJjLzQ5OTU0Zjk3LWE0MGItNGExYy05ZTI5LTAxYTc0NDI2NDdiMC8zMDAweDMwMDAvY21iLWNvdmVyLTIwYXJ0LmpwZz9haWQ9cnNzX2ZlZWQ?ops=contain(1200,630)",,,2025-03-10 01:00:12.891760
