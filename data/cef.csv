(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia has seen an increase in special education students, and in some counties, those students now account for a quarter of enrollment. 
Required services for special education students — like one-on-one aids and nurses — have impacted schools’ budgets. Federal and state education laws mandate services be provided to special education students.  
Jackson County Schools Superintendent William Hosaflook said his county has a roughly $2.8 million deficit in order to educate around 600 special education students in his district.  
“What we have to do is look at other areas. It could be our (Career and Technical Education)  courses, it could be our (agriculture) programs, it could be our band programs, but somehow we have to reduce that to make sure that we can meet our budgetary goals,” he said. 
As lawmakers contemplate a change to West Virginia’s complicated school funding formula, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt asked lawmakers to prioritize giving counties more resources for special education students. 
“We believe that our state’s growing number of special education students that are being served in our public schools is the area where we are really falling behind,” she told members of the House Committee on Finance Thursday. “We are probably getting about half of what it costs to educate those students.”
The school aid formula is a seven-step formula that determines how much state funding goes to county school systems based on factors including the number of students enrolled in the county public school system.
While services for special education students can cost anywhere from 50% to 420% more than general education, West Virginia’s current school funding formula offers resources for only “high acuity” special cases.
West Virginia ranks near the bottom of all states for its amount of funding for special education despite the rate of special education students being the nation’s fifth highest.
“To address those needs, whether it’s staffing or the resources that have to be in place for those students. Looking at the geography, the transportation, the facilities in another area … that’s costly,” Blatt said.
She noted that public schools are currently providing special education services for students in private school or who are being homeschooled. They are also required to provide those services for students using the Hope Scholarship, the state’s school voucher program.
“Because those services aren’t available in a lot of the other school choice options,” Blatt said.
Number of special education students increasing
The number of special education students has grown nationwide due to improved identification and a better understanding of common conditions such as autism spectrum disorder and ADHD,  education experts say. 
In West Virginia, educators have linked special education needs to the state’s substance abuse crisis. Fetal drug exposure is tied to a higher likelihood of mental disorders, adverse behavior problems and needing an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).
The RAND Corporation, which presented its analysis of West Virginia’s school funding formula to lawmakers last week, recommended that the state adjust its funding formula to increase funding for special education students. 
“Districts need more resources to adequately serve students from low-income families, students with disabilities and English learners,” RAND Corporation researcher Brian Phillips told lawmakers. “These students require additional support, specialized staff and services if they’re going to have an equal opportunity to succeed.”
Ahead of the legislative session, Senate and House leadership told reporters that they expected lawmakers to focus on changing the state school aid formula.
Public school officials have said that the current school aid formula isn’t working due to West Virginia’s declining student population, the rising number of special education students and other factors. Decreases in enrollment over decades — along with waning federal pandemic funds — have caused county school systems to consolidate and lay off teachers.
“If we think we’re going to fix this in 60 days, we’re absolutely wrong,” Hosaflook said. “We have to come to the table. It needs to be superintendents. It needs to be legislators. It needs to be the Department of Ed, everyone working together for public education to fix this.”

Jim Wooten, R-Beebe, questions Arkansas Department of Education officials about school vouchers during an Arkansas Legislative Council meeting on Jan. 16, 2026. (Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)During last week’s meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council, where members were asked to pour $32 million more into Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ school voucher subsidies, Republican Sen. Breanne Davis of Russellville unintentionally drew attention to a bit of the program’s perverse financial logic.
Rep. Jim Wooten of Beebe, one of a handful of Republicans who voted against the vouchers scheme when it was approved in 2023, noted that by drawing students away from public schools and reducing student numbers, the program would also reduce their state funding. That funding is tied to a set annual per-student amount.
“I’m telling you, we are hurting public schools when we take $309 million for private schools,” he said.
But Davis, who was the chief Senate sponsor of the law creating the vouchers program, argued that the difference is made up as the state raises the amount of per-student funding districts receive.
The value of a voucher is set at 90% of that per-student amount, which means that raising it will also make the vouchers more expensive – creating a circular, double-barreled assault on the state treasury, with no end in sight.
Davis’ solution, if it can be called that, also ignores the larger point Wooten was trying to make. At some point, probably when a recession causes a drop in state revenues, legislators will be forced to make a choice between funding vouchers, which benefit fewer than 45,000 students at a staggering cost of more than $300 million per year, and funding public schools, which serve 10 times as many kids.
However, there are indications that Republican legislators are at last waking up to the threat vouchers pose to the state budget, an obvious timebomb most GOP lawmakers seemed to ignore three years ago in their rush to do Sanders’ bidding.
In a rare instance of legislators standing up to the governor on one of her signature issues, there was audible dissent during a voice vote when Sanders’ latest request for more voucher money was approved by a legislative council subcommittee, on which only Republicans sit.
And for good reason. In the state budget approved last April, $187 million was appropriated for vouchers. In June,  Sanders came back to legislators to ask for $90 million more, dipping into state reserves. Now, the $32 million tranche approved by the legislative council last week (also from reserves) brings the total to $309 million – 65% more than what was appropriated just nine months ago.
The reason for the cost explosion is that starting last fall, any Arkansas parent can get a voucher subsidy, no matter their income. But it’s also the result of a conscious decision by Sanders not to avail herself of the tool legislators gave her to prevent these very kinds of cost overruns.
One of the striking features of the debate over vouchers when they were approved in 2023 was that Sanders administration officials didn’t provide a cost estimate for the program at full implementation because, they said, there was no way to know how many parents would enroll.
However, legislators put in a safeguard to prevent the kind of budget implosion vouchers have caused in Arizona and other states: The program wouldn’t operate as an entitlement, in which the state guarantees funding for every parent who chooses to participate, but would instead enroll students only to the extent of funding made available by legislators, rationing access and putting parents on waiting lists when the money ran out.
But limits on enrollment in an ideologically driven program designed to play to the Republican base was never a politically realistic prospect. And, indeed, Sanders has refused to use this tool, insisting that every parent who wants a voucher will get a voucher, no matter the cost.
In essence, she has turned her vouchers program into an entitlement that benefits largely middle-class and higher-income families, with no restraint on the total cost, which was the very scenario Republican legislators sought to prevent.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, a reliable vouchers supporter, expressed frustration that the cost of the program had not been controlled by the budget.
The Walnut Ridge lawmaker said she wanted to ensure the state wasn’t getting into an area where it has to “make some really tough choices” on what to prioritize.
“We’re fast approaching that,” she said.
Sanders’ finance secretary, Jim Hudson, told legislators that he expects the budget request for vouchers presented to legislators during the upcoming fiscal session will be “310ish,” avoiding the raids on reserve funds seen this year.
However, that’s almost exactly the same amount spent this year and unlikely to cover increases if more students receive vouchers and the state’s per-student funding continues at the same rate.
Revelations by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette and other news outlets of questionable spending by homeschool parents enrolled in the program – $600 chicken coops, karate lessons, horseback riding lessons, $2,000 laptops and Shaquille O’Neal gaming chairs – has also started to draw scrutiny from Republican legislators who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism.
During the subcommittee hearing, Republican Sen. Jimmy Hickey got Department of Education officials to make an eyebrow -raising admission that nothing prevents homeschool parents receiving vouchers from buying pricey items, ostensibly for educational purposes, and then returning them and pocketing the money.
In passing Sanders’ vouchers scheme, legislators ignored clear, available evidence that vouchers harm educational outcomes, rather than improving them. They ignored the social and financial impacts of draining away students from public schools, particularly in rural districts. But they won’t be able to ignore a price tag that continues to rise.
The budget session that starts in April will be the first test of how many Republican legislators are coming to their senses on this expensive boondoggle. 
Does Sanders have the political muscle to win this fight? Very likely. 
But the halcyon days of 2023, when legislators asked few questions and got out their rubber stamps to give Sanders everything she wanted, may mercifully be coming to an end.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wooten-1.16.25-1024x679.jpg,,,2026-01-23 06:36:17.226737
