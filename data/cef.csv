,West Virginia,2025-10-01 18:52:58+00:00,West Virginia Department of Education,County Accountability Report Shows Continued Progress,,,,,,https://wvde.us/articles/county-accountability-report-shows-continued-progress,"Charleston, W.Va. - The West Virginia Board of Education (WVBE) approved the 2025 County Approval Status Accreditation Report during its October meeting in Charleston. The annual report serves as an overview of each school district’s operational efficiency and performance indicators, providing the public with a better understanding of their local schools’ strengths and challenges. The report includes 11 operational efficiency standards and indicators from the Balanced Scorecard.Advanced PlacementWest Virginia’s Advanced Placement® passage rate increased by 6.4% to 63.77%, up from 58.07% last year, according to the College Board. Last year, 6,066 students took 9,395 exams in West Virginia. AP allows students to take college-level courses in high school and receive college credit or advanced placement in college. Students earning a passing score on AP exams can receive college credit at colleges and universities in West Virginia and nationwide.Balance in RegulationsWVBE President L. Paul Hardesty highlighted the inconsistencies between regulations, requirements and oversight of public schools, charter schools and homeschools. He compared the 1,300-page 2025 West Virginia School Laws Code Book that contains laws passed by the West Virginia Legislature that govern public schools, to a single sheet of paper that outlines all of the legislative requirements for charters schools, and to an index card that shows all the legislative requirements for homeschooling. “There is a real misconception among the public about the author of the West Virginia Code Book. Every law in the book was passed by the Legislature - not this State Board and not the Department of Education,” Hardesty said. “I am not against school choice, but let’s be equitable and let’s be fair. The rules and oversight of public education and the rules for other school choice options sets one system up for success and the other to fail. I don’t think the public understands the way the game is played and the hand that they’ve been dealt.” The decrease in county school funding leads many county school boards to close and consolidate schools. The WVBE believes that there needs to be a better public understanding of West Virginia’s funding formula and education laws to understand the impact on local schools. Board members say they remain committed to open communication and are willing to sit down with members of the Legislature to address the challenges outlined during the meeting. To view the presentation, visit the WVBE October 2025 Meeting page. Sullivan Retirement from WVBEOctober marked the final meeting for WVBE Member Debra Sullivan. She completed her term as the longest-serving member on the current board. She was appointed by Governor Jim Justice and was known for her attention to detail and deep-rooted connection to students from across the state. Mrs. Sullivan often visited students in schools as well as  juvenile facilities where she would lead baking classes and engage in discussions about a number of meaningful topics. Mrs. Sullivan has been a policy expert spurred by her own administrative expertise and curiosity to learn. She poured over state code, legislation and important documents to ensure the State Board continued to serve children at the core of its priorities. Documents from and a recording of today’s meeting are available on the WVBE information page, and photos are available in the WVDE Flickr album. The next regularly scheduled WVBE meeting is 9 a.m., Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, in Building 6, Suite 600, 1900 Kanawha Boulevard, East, Charleston, West Virginia.",,https://wvde.us/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/2025-10/Debra_Sullivan%20Certification%20copy.jpg?itok=D5dHwOMV,,,2025-10-01 15:56:19.011396
