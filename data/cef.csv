(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill to require a local election after any South Dakota school board decides to exceed property tax limitations passed the Senate on a 20-14 vote Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
The bill targets decisions by school districts to raise more revenue by “opting out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.

Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”
There are 79 active school district opt-outs across South Dakota, according to data from the Legislative Research Council, resulting in a combined total of $43 million in excess property taxes.
Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill, which was recommended by lawmakers on last summer’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force.
The bill aims to provide property tax relief and increase accountability among school districts and boards, Peterson told lawmakers, adding that the current system is “making spending limits obsolete.”
“It only makes sense that the burden should be on the school boards to get direct consent from the people if they want to circumvent spending limits,” Peterson said. “It should not be the responsibility of the people to gather petition signatures to prevent over-the-limit spending.”
Opponents of the bill said taxpayer dollars would be spent on unnecessary elections since many referred opt-outs are upheld by voters. Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said that school board members decide to opt out because of inadequate state funding. 
The bill now heads to the House of Representatives.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1659-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

Travis Ismay, R-Newell, listens to a committee hearing on Jan. 20, 2026, at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.
