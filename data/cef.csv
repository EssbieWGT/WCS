(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)While Alaska school districts are seeing improvements in kindergarten to third grade students’ reading proficiency, which officials credit to the Alaska Reads Act, some districts are struggling to access state managed funds for a federal grant program aimed at supporting literacy programs, teacher development, and student learning.
Lawmakers with the House Education Committee heard from two district superintendents about the successes and challenges of the Comprehensive Literacy State Development grant program — which in 2024 awarded $50 million to Alaska schools over five years. 
In 2025, roughly half of Alaska’s districts, or 27 school districts, qualified for these grant funds administered through the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, according to the department. 
The program is aimed at advancing literacy for children from birth through 12th grade students, including pre-literacy skills, reading and writing. The program focuses on districts with disadvantaged children, including those living in poverty, English language learners and students with disabilities.
While all Alaska districts are required by state law to implement the Alaska Read’s Act, the policy did not come with additional state funding, said Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, co-chair of the education committee, in an interview on Monday. She said some districts are struggling to fund the kindergarten through third grade reading initiatives. “I would like to see us supporting schools so that everybody gets the support they need to implement the law the way it was written,” she said.
The program isn’t new, but it has more money and it’s funding more districts now. In 2019, nearly one third of Alaska districts were awarded $25 million over five years, according to DEED. 
“The literacy grant is a really powerful tool that is going to help the districts that it’s in, a lot,” Himschoot said. “I’ve heard a lot of gratitude from superintendents about having this opportunity for those who have it, but we did hear about some bumps in the rollout of it.”
District officials’ testimony prompted Himschoot to send a list of questions to DEED about how the grant is managed. 
Michael Robbins, superintendent of the Bristol Bay Borough School District, which serves approximately 135 students, said the grant has been crucial for implementing the Alaska Reads Act, particularly supporting teachers’ training professional development, which helps retention. “The grant supports training, coaching and leadership development grounded in research-based instruction, including the science of reading,” he said. 
“It creates consistency across classrooms in schools, helps prevent problems before they grow, and ensure that limited resources are utilized where that matters most,” Robbins said.
But Robbins said in implementing the grant, districts need more “clear, timely and reasonable guidance around allowable use of grant funds” from DEED.
He said the district would like to use the money for professional services vendors to provide training to teachers, and funding to attend conferences. “The approval process has been particularly cumbersome as some districts have had to resubmit their application multiple times, which takes valuable time from our grant leaders and administrators, as well as delaying the implementation of important activities,” he said.
Officials with DEED did not attend the legislative hearing, but department spokesperson Bryan Zadalis said by email on Monday that the department recognizes the importance of clear guidance, which is communicated through multiple channels including webinars and office hours. “DEED also aligns state-level guidance with federal updates as they are released to ensure accuracy and compliance, which can at times require sequencing information rather than issuing it prematurely,” he said. 
In addition, Robbins, who formerly served as the superintendent of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District, said that that district did not qualify for grant funding. “The need was there, but the resources are not,” he said. “We need to find ways for all districts and all students to have access to the same level of support and opportunity.”
Robyn Taylor is superintendent of the Petersburg School District which serves approximately 420 students, and was awarded $350,000 per year through the grant program. She testified to lawmakers and echoed the need for equity in supporting reading programs across Alaska’s school districts. She said Petersburg still continues to have challenges with implementing the Alaska Reads Act, which she called “a real tension.” 
“In Petersburg alone, between FY 25 and FY 26 we eliminated one of our three elementary reading interventionist positions, positions that were directly supporting Reads Act implementation and student outcomes,” she said. She said the district was told that CLSD funds were for supplementing programs not replacing funding. 
“(The) restriction makes it difficult to use this grant to maintain positions or systems that are already working but are no longer financially sustainable under current funding structures,” she said. 
Taylor and Himschoot both emphasized that districts who did not qualify for funding need support with the administrative work to apply. They said some schools should have easily qualified for the funding, but didn’t in part because they lack proper documentation of their students’ need for free or reduced school meals, which is one of the federal poverty guidelines. “It’s not that they don’t have kids in need,” Himschoot said. “It’s that they haven’t been identified through the paperwork, because they don’t have the capacity in their district to go chase that down.”
Zadalis said the grant process is a competitive one. He said the primary source of education funding is through the state’s funding formula, but districts may also access state or federal funding through other grants focused on literacy efforts. 
Taylor said Petersburg students are making gains in reading proficiency, and the district is committed to continuing improvements beyond the grant cycle. “What we are asking for is greater flexibility, clearer and earlier guidance,” she said. “And increased trust in districts to make decisions that reflect local context and student needs.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington spent roughly $500 million last year in settlements and jury verdicts in cases involving government misconduct.
The skyrocketing lawsuit payouts are hamstringing state and local government budgets.
Lawmakers pitched one way of dealing with the issue Tuesday. They want to make these civil claims subject to arbitration to reduce costs. For one, legal fees often stack up in these cases, which can end with jury verdicts that reach tens of millions of dollars in damages. 
Legislators also face a budget question, as the state agency that handles these payments is asking for hundreds of millions of dollars to address the rising costs. Legislators punted on dealing with the budget concerns last year.
“What has been happening to the budgets of our school districts, our cities, our counties and the state are untenable,” said state Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, lead sponsor of the bill requiring arbitration. “We are simply at the point in time that we cannot continue to do fiscal management and responsibility without addressing tort liability.”
Dhingra’s bill, if passed into law, won’t be a silver bullet. It’s unclear how much money it would save, but it likely wouldn’t make a huge dent in the surging payouts.
Lawyers who bring these claims are opposed to the bill. They say the state doesn’t have the infrastructure to support arbitration in all these cases and that it would be an obstacle to justice for people harmed by the government.
The state is self-insured, meaning the legal payouts come from agency funding that would otherwise go toward services. Legislation and court rulings have expanded liability in recent years, exposing the state to more lawsuits.
Payments have continued apace after last year’s record. In the first half of the current fiscal year, which began July 1, the state paid nearly $237 million, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The costs represent accountability for the state as it grapples with decades of alleged misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases. The deluge of lawsuits in recent years shows no signs of slowing down.
The state has also paid roughly $36 million in legal expenses, $13 million of which is going to the state attorney general’s office, which represents state agencies. The rest is going to outside firms that provided contracted legal services to the state.
Lawyers representing people who sue the government can also collect court-ordered legal fees when the state loses a case.
Last year, the state Department of Enterprise Services warned that without a more permanent fix to funding the state’s self-insurance fund, its deficit could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027. By mid-2029, the gap could be anywhere from $2 billion to $3.2 billion. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson’s budget plan, released last month, puts $955 million toward addressing the problem. He said last month that on any shortlist of budget challenges the state is facing, tort liability would be there.
The legislation
Senate Bill 6239 looks to deal with the growing liability through civil arbitration for tort claims against the state and local government entities. 
This means a neutral third-party could make a decision on how much plaintiffs win in their cases outside of court. The cases could still go to a traditional jury trial. 
The legislation wouldn’t limit monetary damages or attorney fees that could be ordered, but would provide an option to resolve cases early, said Dhingra, who chairs the Senate Law and Justice Committee. The two sides would likely split the cost of the arbitration. 
The bill is scheduled for a committee vote Thursday. If passed by the Senate and House and signed by Ferguson, it would take effect immediately.
Currently, arbitration is required in civil lawsuits in county superior courts claiming less than $15,000 in damages, or if a judge approves, up to $100,000. Under the measure, all claims against governments would be subject to arbitration.
The issue looms over not just the state but its local governments, which are similarly dealing with rising liability. 
Cities, counties and school districts are in lockstep in support of the legislation. Pierce County has received 140 claims seeking a total of over $320 million related to alleged abuse in the 20th century at the county’s juvenile detention center, County Executive Ryan Mello told lawmakers on Tuesday. So far, the county has paid out more than $9 million.

The size of the claims threatens to undermine the county’s funding for core services like elections and criminal justice, Mello said. 
On the other side of the debate, Gabriel Galanda, an influential Indigenous rights attorney in Seattle, called the arbitration bill an “assault on civil rights protection.”
“State juries do justice,” Galanda told senators. “State juries bring daylight to situations the government tries to hide from daylight.

In an interview Tuesday morning, Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said the memo about planning for new budget cuts was sent to state agency directors because of uncertainty over how the Idaho Legislature’s new federal tax conformity bill, House Bill 519, will impact the amount of revenue available to spend in the state budget.
“The big issue right now is tax conformity,” Grow told the Idaho Capital Sun. “And I don’t know where we are, but you saw a bill that came up Friday from the House that essentially conformed (with federal tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act).”

In the new budget memo, Keith Bybee, budget and policy analysis division manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office, gave agency directors until noon on Friday to submit budget reduction plans. 
Under the memo, state agency directors must submit two plans – one for cutting an additional 1% and another plan for cutting an additional 2% from their budgets in both this year’s fiscal year 2026 and next year’s fiscal year 2027. 
Those new cuts would be in addition to the 3% budget cuts that Gov. Brad Little announced last summer in response to state revenue shortfalls, which could bring the total impact of the cuts up to 5% for both this year and next. 
“While JFAC is working through the current budget cycle for FY 2026 and FY 2027, it is evaluating options to balance the state budget,” Bybee wrote in Monday’s memo. “One of those options is to further reduce budgets in FY 2026 and FY 2027.”
 Senate Minority Caucus chairwoman says she doesn’t support additional cuts, calls on Legislature to dip into rainy day funds

Idaho Education News first reported on the additional new budget reductions Monday. 
Bybee sent the memo on behalf of the co-chairs of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short.

JFAC is a powerful committee of the Idaho Legislature that sets all of the state budgets for every state agency and department. Grow and Rep. Josh Tanner, also R-Eagle, are the two co-chairs of JFAC.
Senate Minority Caucus Chair Janie Ward-Engelking, a Boise Democrat who serves on JFAC, said she strongly opposes new budget cuts, which she said will hurt the state coming this late in the fiscal year. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30 each year. That means that the current fiscal year 2026 is a little more than halfway over.
“We are already cutting into the bone on some of these agencies,” Ward-Engelking said in an interview at the Idaho State Capitol. “Half of the year is already done, so half of their budget or more has been expended, depending on if it is personnel, and we could be talking about massive furloughs. I am not in favor of this.” 
Instead of cutting state agency budgets deeper, Ward-Engelking said the state should dip into its rainy day reserve funds or make implementation of the federal tax changes effective as of January 2026, not retroactive as currently proposed.

“We have rainy day funds,” Ward-Engelking said. “That’s taxpayer money that is sitting there. We seeded the clouds. We made it rain. But we can fix this.”
After the Legislature cut state revenue by approving $450 million in tax cuts and tax credits in 2025, Ward-Engelking blamed the Idaho Legislature for the budget issues dominating the 2026 session. Ward-Engelking said legislators cut taxes too deeply, which already reduced state revenue too much.

 Idaho’s tax conformity bill has big implications for the state budget

Bybee circulated the memo about planning for additional budget cuts shortly after the Idaho Legislature introduced a new bill. House Bill 519, that is designed to fully adopt the federal tax changes President Donald Trump championed in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Rep. Jeff Ehlers, the Meridian Republican who sponsored House Bill 519, estimated it would cost $155 million per year to comply with the federal tax changes. The $155 million estimate is identical to the estimate Little provided for tax conformity earlier this month when he delivered the State of the State address. 
But there is a key difference between Little’s proposal to comply with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the plan in House Bill 519. Little structured his budget proposal so that Idaho would comply with the tax changes effective Jan. 1, 2026. But Ehlers’ bill calls for adopting the tax changes retroactively – with personal changes going back to 2025 and business changes going back to 2022. 
Idaho state lawmaker proposes full adoption of ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ tax changes 

That retroactive compliance could have an additional budget impact compared Little’s plan to begin compliance in 2026. 
“If the Legislature is going to go ahead and put (conformity) back in 2025, that’s at least $155 million, and that wipes out that increased revenue that we tried to have,” Grow said Tuesday. 
The state budget is built around revenue collections, and the largest sources of state revenue are tax collections. Cutting taxes reduces the amount of money that individuals or businesses pay and reduces the amount of revenue collected by the state to pay for programs and services in the state budget such as funding for roads and bridges, funding to fight wildfires on state land, funding for the state’s K-12 public school system and funding for the pay and benefits of more than 20,000 state employees. 
The state budget has faced a revenue shortfall for fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 following five years of income tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature that reduced state revenue by a combined total of $4 billion, according to the nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. 
Revenue collections rebounded in December thanks to strong corporate income tax collections that reversed the projected budget deficit for fiscal year 2026. 
Grow said Friday’s deadline for agency directors to identify new cuts of 1% and 2% represents a quick timeline. But Grow said tax conformity has a big impact on the state budget, and he wants to understand the revenue impact before JFAC moves forward setting maintenance budgets for state agencies or begins cutting budgets through recissions. 
Grow said approving new, additional budget cuts could allow the Idaho Legislature breathing room in the budget to conform to the federal tax cuts and still pass a balanced budget that leaves a positive ending cash balance. 
“(Fiscal year) 26 has got to be strengthened as far as the bottom line,” Grow said. 
The federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes about 39 tax changes, Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said. Some of those tax changes for individuals include no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on workers’ tips, an expanded deduction for senior citizens and not interest on borrower’s car loan interest.

Mike Dunleavy gestures during his State of the State address on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has proposed a 4% statewide summer sales tax, effective through 2034, as part of his plan to bring Alaska’s state revenue and expenses in line for the long term.
If adopted, the sales tax would be Alaska’s first statewide, general-purpose levy since state legislators abolished Alaska’s income tax in 1980.
Alongside the tax bill, the governor has proposed a tighter state spending cap and a constitutional amendment that would guarantee a Permanent Fund dividend lower than scheduled by current law but above what legislators have approved in recent years.
“This comprehensive plan is designed to bridge the next seven years by stabilizing state finances, limiting spending growth, restoring a rules-based PFD, and sharing responsibility through targeted, time-limited revenue measures that support investment and predictability,” the governor wrote in a letter to state lawmakers.
Since 2015, persistently low oil prices and plateaued oil production from the North Slope have dogged state lawmakers who have struggled to balance Alaska’s need for services with the desire to pay large Permanent Fund dividends.
While most of Alaska’s general-purpose state revenue comes from the Alaska Permanent Fund, oil remains the No. 2 source of flexible spending money for the state, leaving the annual budget process subject to the vagaries of global markets.
The governor’s plan resembles one drafted by a bipartisan, bicameral legislative working group in 2021 and 2022. That plan and others like it have never significantly advanced in the Legislature.
Senate Bill 227, containing the bulk of the governor’s plan, was introduced on Monday and referred to the Senate Finance Committee for further discussion. An identical version will be introduced in the House on Wednesday.
The most fiscally consequential item in the bill is the sales tax, which would peak during the summer tourist season and drop to 2% between October and March.
That tax is expected to raise as much as $815 million per year for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend by Fiscal Year 2032. 
Dunleavy’s proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 — fiscal year 2027 — is about $7.75 billion and has a deficit of almost $1.5 billion.
The Dunleavy administration expects that revenue from oil production and a proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline will compensate for the phaseout of all the taxes in the long term.
Under SB 227, the state’s corporate income tax would fall to zero in 2031; the sales tax wouldn’t expire until 2034, leaving individual Alaskans paying higher tax rates than corporations for a period.
“Normally, sales tax is left to local governments. So I know it was a hot issue in Anchorage when the Mayor proposed that, so I think it is going to hit a lot of households,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, applauded Dunleavy on Monday for putting forward a fiscal proposal, even if he disagrees with some of the components.
“The governor’s putting out a bill. I commend him for that. He’s putting out, you know, he’s throwing out ideas. I give him credit for that,” he said.
Wielechowski and other legislators said they want to fully analyze what the governor is proposing before opining on it. 
“There are a lot of parts to this bill, and the No. 1 thing for me — without a complete analysis — is it’s really unclear on how this is going to affect hard-working Alaskans,” said House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer. “It is my No. 1 priority to make sure everyday Alaskans aren’t on the losing end of this.”
The Alaska Municipal League, which represents local governments across Alaska, is particularly interested in the governor’s proposal.
The League has previously said it would prefer a statewide income tax to a sales tax.
In almost every part of Alaska, except for Anchorage, sales taxes are a pillar of services. 
Many cities and boroughs exempt certain things, like food and utilities. Under the Dunleavy proposal, the state would be in charge of collecting sales taxes and would remit money to cities and boroughs.
Local exemptions and sales tax caps could vanish in the process, with the state instead determining what is taxed and not. 
“This is a 56-page bill that we are still going through. Sales tax is a major component of that, but sales tax shouldn’t be thought about independently from the other components,” said Nils Andreassen, director of the league.
In addition to the sales tax, SB 227 temporarily raises the state’s minimum oil tax, adds a surcharge of 15 cents per barrel of oil produced on the North Slope and adds part of the corporate sales tax update that Dunleavy vetoed last year.
Andreassen noted that regardless of its source, tax revenue flows into the state’s general fund for any number of uses.
“All taxes are connected at some level,” he said. 
The governor’s plan for the Permanent Fund dividend, enclosed in a constitutional amendment proposal separate to SB 227, is similar to one he proposed in 2021. 
Currently, the state’s No. 1 source of general-purpose revenue is an annual transfer from the Permanent Fund to the state treasury. In FY27, that transfer will be worth $4 billion.
The “50-50 dividend” proposed by the governor would reserve half of that transfer for dividends, or about $2 billion, if it were in place this year.
That amounts to roughly $3,200 per PFD recipient, based on the number of recipients in 2025.
Under a current, disused formula in place since the 1980s, the dividend would be about $3,800 per recipient.
That formula hasn’t been used since 2015, and lawmakers have instead set the amount by fiat, typically using a figure that can be paid with available revenue after services are covered. 
Legislators can ignore formulas in state law because the state’s annual budget bill is a law, and when one law conflicts with another, the newer law takes precedence.
Putting a dividend formula in the constitution would bind future governors and legislatures, and put the dividend atop the annual budgetary priority list, alongside education and other constitutionally mandated functions.
Adopting a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds of the House, two-thirds of the Senate, and approval by voters in the next general election.

Meanwhile, however, he must spend at least some of his time governing California and dealing with a Legislature dominated by his fellow Democrats but increasingly less willing to cater to his whims.
Newsom’s relationship with legislators has always been more transactional than collaborative. He has even used the annual budget process to force them to adopt major policy changes with little or no scrutiny. Legislators often grumbled about being squeezed by Newsom, but felt compelled — not always but most of the time — to go along. 
However, their annoyance is becoming more public, as indicated during legislative hearings on his final budget last week. 
Newsom’s initial $349 billion budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year is, as administration officials acknowledge, merely a placeholder. It continues the current budget, with a few tweaks, but won’t be fleshed out until May, just a month before the June 15 constitutional deadline.
This year the squeeze is particularly bothersome because the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, and Department of Finance officials are both warning that the state faces large and growing budget deficits after Newsom departs.
The frustration was evident during last week’s introductory hearings for budget committees. Legislators heard Petek advise that they deal with the forecasted deficit sooner rather than later, and discussed remedies ranging from sharp cuts in spending to sharp increases in taxes. 
But in the absence of specifics from Newsom, they could only speculate.
Newsom has steadily opposed major tax increases, even though it was his administration’s immense error in revenue projections four years ago that helped create what officials call a “structural deficit,” meaning that the revenue system cannot generate enough money to pay for all the programs and services now offered.
The administration’s 2022 revenue projection error of $165 billion over four years led to Newsom declaring a $98 billion budget surplus and a sharp increase in spending, especially on social services. As an ideological tenet, Democratic legislators dislike cutting those enhancements to balance the budget, which is why increasing taxes was repeatedly mentioned during last week’s hearings.
The comments of state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, typified the squeeze that Democratic legislators are feeling. She called one of Newsom’s health care proposals, scaling back Med-Cal benefits to undocumented immigrants, “barbaric.” 
“I’m disappointed that there’s no proposal to change how our revenues come in,” Menjivar said. “We can’t just cut our way out of it. I think there should be a mixture of cuts, being strategic with how we use our dollars, but also looking to change our revenue streams.”
While the angst over the budget is palpable, reductions in federal support for expensive health and welfare programs, imposed by President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, raise the stakes even more. If they had their way, some Democrats would not only raise taxes to cover the state’s structural deficit but backstop the reductions in federal aid. 
Meanwhile, public employee unions and their allies are proposing two November ballot measures to bolster revenues: a one-time wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, and an extension of a temporary surtax on high-income taxpayers that was imposed in 2012 to close a budget deficit and later extended to 2030.
The situation leads to more questions than answers.
Will Newsom keep his promise to close this year’s deficit and the ones projected for the future?
With a presidential campaign likely in the offing, will he maintain his anti-tax increase posture?
Will Democratic legislators insist that taxes be raised to balance the budget without deep spending cuts?
In an eyeball-to-eyeball scenario, we will see who blinks first.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625_Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem_MG_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Earlier this month, the New Hampshire House passed what looks like a tiny change: a 0.05 percentage point cut to the Business Enterprise Tax. But this small number masks big consequences. 
Based on our research, the proposal would drain tens of millions of dollars from the state budget, could weaken funding for education, health care, and local services, and ultimately shift more costs onto families and property-tax payers, all while offering most businesses savings too small to meaningfully boost hiring or investment. Here’s what the data show, and why it matters for Granite Staters.  
First, this proposed change could drain millions from an already-strained state budget. Through examining past BET rate reductions, revenue trends, recent tax filing data, official state revenue projections, and interactions with the Business Profits Tax (BPT), we modeled the likely fiscal and economic effects of the proposed 0.05% change in the BET tax rate and found that if the proposed BET rate had been implemented during the current biennial state budget, it would have cost the state $26 million per year in BET revenue. 
For context, that is equivalent to more than half of last year’s budgets for the New Hampshire Veterans Home, the State Police, or the state’s road and bridge aid to towns and cities. This new annual revenue loss would be on top of the nearly $105 million in BET revenue the state is already set to lose in fiscal year 2026 due to prior reductions. These combined business tax cuts are almost twice what the state spent on targeted special education aid over the past two years. 
Second, business tax savings from the 0.05% reduction in the BET rate would be minimal and, in most cases, certainly not enough to spur hiring. The average business paying BET would save only about $47 per month from the rate reduction. When the 306 filers with more than about $18 million in taxable compensation or payments each are excluded from this calculation, the BET savings would average about $28 per month. The small savings companies will receive are clearly not enough to hire new employees, but they might be able to order a couple of pizzas. 
Third, while supporters of the tax reduction argue that reducing the BET could spur business activity and economic growth, thus ultimately increasing state revenues, the data simply do not support that claim. Historical data show no consistent statistical relationship between BET rates and job growth in New Hampshire over the last four decades. Prior studies, including New Hampshire’s own Commission to Study Business Taxes, have found no evidence that business tax cuts generate enough new economic activity to replace lost revenue, and NHFPI’s own analysis of business tax rate reductions in New Hampshire found that the business tax rate reductions cost the state about a billion dollars in revenue from 2016 to 2024.  
It is true that New Hampshire’s business tax revenues, when BPT and BET are included, have grown overall, but not consistently or as much as in many other states. From 2015 to 2024, our state’s business tax revenues more than doubled (a 118% increase). However, over the same period, business tax revenues more than tripled nationally (a 239% increase) and across the other five New England states (a 224% increase). If state business tax cuts had spurred revenue growth in New Hampshire, the state would have seen revenues outpace states that did not change their tax rates, rather than fall behind. 
Finally, cutting taxes for businesses gets expensive for Granite Staters. When business tax cuts reduce state revenue, the funding disappears, but the needs do not. Schools still need to operate, roads and bridges still need maintenance, and public health systems still need to provide care. With fewer state dollars available, communities are left struggling to meet the same obligations with fewer resources. Too often, the result is higher property taxes, which are already among the highest in the country. Those higher costs don’t stop with homeowners. They are passed on to renters and contribute to the state’s sky-high housing costs.  
The data are clear: this proposed BET cut would deliver minimal benefits to most businesses while creating real fiscal pressures for Granite Staters. As lawmakers look to the next state budget amid federal uncertainty and an ongoing affordability crisis, decisions about tax policy should be grounded in evidence and a clear-eyed understanding of who benefits and who truly pays.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/statehousedometrees-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-27 05:57:25.204578

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill to require a local election after any South Dakota school board decides to exceed property tax limitations passed the Senate on a 20-14 vote Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
The bill targets decisions by school districts to raise more revenue by “opting out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.

Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”
There are 79 active school district opt-outs across South Dakota, according to data from the Legislative Research Council, resulting in a combined total of $43 million in excess property taxes.
Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill, which was recommended by lawmakers on last summer’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force.
The bill aims to provide property tax relief and increase accountability among school districts and boards, Peterson told lawmakers, adding that the current system is “making spending limits obsolete.”
“It only makes sense that the burden should be on the school boards to get direct consent from the people if they want to circumvent spending limits,” Peterson said. “It should not be the responsibility of the people to gather petition signatures to prevent over-the-limit spending.”
Opponents of the bill said taxpayer dollars would be spent on unnecessary elections since many referred opt-outs are upheld by voters. Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said that school board members decide to opt out because of inadequate state funding. 
The bill now heads to the House of Representatives.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1659-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.
