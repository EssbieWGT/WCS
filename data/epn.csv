H.R. 6938 - Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026, became public law on January 23, 2026, and fully funds ENERGY STAR for 2026. The ENERGY STAR program was initially going to be cut, but Congress not only secured ENERGY STAR for 2026, but stipulated a mandatory annual spending level that places a binding legal requirement on the administration to fund the program. 
 
The bipartisan bill includes $33 million for the ENERGY STAR program which is a slight increase over FY2024's $32 million. This curtails a trend of decreased spending that the ENERGY STAR program has received over the past decade.

Due to their low boiling points, VOCs are prevalent in indoor environments, with concentrations in homes, schools, and offices often two to five times higher than outdoors. Chronic exposure to VOCs is linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular damage, and an increased cancer risk. Children and adolescents who spend a significant amount of time in educational buildings are particularly vulnerable to these effects. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the related health risks to those in day care centres, schools, high-schools and universities across 17 member states of the European Union (EU) by utilizing a previously published dataset and collecting data on levels of 9 VOCs. Health risks were assessed using the World Health Organization’s Indoor Air Quality Risk Calculator. Point of departure indices (PODIs) and cancer risks were calculated, with values above 1.0 and 10 cases/1 million population respectively indicating an increased health risk. Our results showed that formaldehyde exposure poses an increased risk of respiratory, neurological and carcinogenic effects in educational buildings in 14 of the countries studied. Additionally, neurological risks from exposure to benzene were above the limit in 4 EU countries. These findings indicate the need to reduce formaldehyde and benzene concentrations in European educational buildings to protect the health of the next generation.",,,,,2026-01-28 06:00:13.543877

,,2026-01-28 02:43:30+00:00,Nature,Reclassifying hospital energy demand toward industry-like requirements for hygienic and resilient indoor environments - Scientific Reports,,,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-33606-2,"Hospitals, traditionally classified within the tertiary sector due to their service-oriented nature, nevertheless exhibit energy demands and technical characteristics akin to those of industrial facilities. Motivated by this, this paper redefines hospital energy demand by emphasizing shared energy forms and consumption processes between healthcare and industry. Methodologically, the study conducts a comparative analysis of energy intensity across regions, highlights process-level similarities and regulatory disparities, proposes a hybrid regulatory framework tailored to healthcare buildings, and reviews the literature on Distributed Energy Systems (DES) in hospitals. To complement these analyses with quantitative evidence, a dynamic TRNSYS&nbsp;18 mini-scenario is introduced for a representative block of Specialities Operating Theatres (OTs). The simulation provides hourly cooling and electrical loads and yields an annual combined electricity intensity of approximately 780&nbsp;$$\text{kWh}\cdot$$m$$\vphantom{0}^{-2}\cdot$$yr$$\vphantom{0}^{-1}$$, a value that exceeds legacy, medium-size, and even hyperscale data-centre benchmarks. This empirical result supports the claim that critical hospital zones behave energetically as clean-process environments, closer to industrial or infrastructural uses than to conventional tertiary spaces. The findings show that hospitals consume energy at levels closer to industry than to commercial buildings, with critical continuous loads. The industrial sector has already demonstrated rigorous adoption of DES, setting a precedent for their integration in healthcare. Despite progress, the literature lacks comprehensive and region-specific reviews on integrating DES in healthcare, including cogeneration (CHP), trigeneration (CCHP), solar energy systems, and medical waste-to-energy (WtE) recovery. Fully integrated solar–CCHP–WtE systems, in particular, remain underexplored. A novel contribution of this work lies in formulating a hybrid regulatory framework that redefines hospitals as industrial-scale energy hubs, bridging the gap between rigorous industrial DES practices and the specialized operational requirements of the healthcare sector. Overall, the integration of DES presents hospitals with significant opportunities to enhance energy efficiency, improve system reliability, and achieve substantial environmental benefits, all while maintaining the stringent quality standards required in healthcare environments.",,,,,2026-01-28 01:59:43.833308

The agency issued a memo in 2019 during the first Trump administration that it would phase out animal testing, a decision the Biden administration reversed two years later. EPA is reviving that goal and will prioritize developing alternative research methods, even for the small amount of animal testing that is statutorily required, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“We are confident we will continue to find in the weeks and months ahead, new technologies, new alternative methods that allow us to reduce animal testing on something that might be required today but it may not be necessary just a few months from now,” Zeldin said in a speech Thursday.
