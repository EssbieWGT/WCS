From Victoria to Ottawa, their program included meetings and seminars with a wide range of Canadian stakeholders in mining governance and environmental permitting. 

As Sweden and Canada move forward in this field, finding the best ways to balance all the different interests is a key priority. Working together as strategic partners with shared values and objectives is of great importance. 

Thank you for interesting conversations on similarities and opportunities for learning between Sweden and Canada, as well as reflections on the newly signed Strategic Partnership between our countries. We look forward to continued dialogue and future collaboration.

,,2025-12-06 09:13:17+00:00,www.legalfix.com,Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),,,,,,https://www.legalfix.com/topics/environmental-law/environmental-protection-agency--epa-/CO,"The mission of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect human health and the environment.

The EPA works to ensure that:

•	Americans have clean air, land and water;

•	National efforts to reduce environmental risks are based on the best available scientific information;

•	Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are administered and enforced fairly, effectively, and as Congress intended;

•	Environmental stewardship is integral to U.S. policies concerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy;

•	All parts of society—communities, individuals, businesses, and state, local, and tribal governments—have access to accurate information sufficient to effectively participate in managing human health and environmental risks;

•	Contaminated lands and toxic sites are cleaned up by potentially responsible parties and revitalized; and

•	Chemicals in the marketplace are reviewed for safety.

To accomplish this mission, the EPA:

Develops and Enforces Regulations

When Congress writes an environmental law, the EPA implements it by writing regulations. Often, the EPA sets national standards that states and tribes enforce through their own regulations. If they fail to meet the national standards, the EPA can help them. The EPA also enforces its regulations, and helps companies understand the requirements.

Gives Grants

Nearly half of the EPA’s budget goes into grants to state environmental programs, non-profits, educational institutions, and others. They use the money for a wide variety of projects, from scientific studies that help the EPA make decisions, to community cleanups. Overall, grants help the EPA achieve its overall mission: protect human health and the environment.

Studies Environmental Issues

At laboratories located throughout the nation, the EPA identifies and tries to solve environmental problems. To learn even more, the EPA shares information with other countries, private sector organizations, academic institutions, and other agencies.

Sponsors Partnerships

The EPA doesn’t protect the environment on its own.  It works with businesses, non-profit organizations, and state and local governments through dozens of partnerships. A few examples include conserving water and energy, minimizing greenhouse gases, re-using solid waste, and getting a handle on pesticide risks. In return, the EPA shares information and publicly recognizes its partners.

Teaches People About the Environment

The EPA believes that protecting the environment is everyone's responsibility and starts with understanding the issues. The basics include reducing how much energy and materials you use, reusing what you can, and recycling the rest.

Publishes Information

Through written materials and its website, the EPA informs the public about its activities.

What the EPA Doesn’t Do

Some problems that seem like something the EPA would handle are actually the responsibility of other federal, tribal, state, or local agencies. It may be most appropriate for a person to contact their city, county, or state environmental or health agency, or another federal agency, rather than the EPA.  

For example:

•	The Endangered Species Act is primarily managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 

•	The Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management addresses the problem of nuclear waste.",,,,,2025-12-06 12:04:21.189577
