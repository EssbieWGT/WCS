But they are struggling. They do not have the resilience to cope with the challenges they face, now and in the future. Surface water quality overall has been in decline since before the first of these assessments was carried out by the EPA in the late 2000s.

It is very disappointing to report that water quality is not improving despite the many actions that are underway, across all sectors. It’s clear the scale and pace of implementation needs to be increased and sustained.”

Dr Eimear Cotter, Director of the EPA’s Office of Evidence and Assessment, on the Water Quality in Ireland Report 2019-2024.
