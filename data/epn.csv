,,2025-11-30 01:11:13+00:00,www.facebook.com,"Yale - Last week, the Trump administration made three separate decisions that will affect the environment. First, the EPA proposed stripping protections for wetlands and streams, reducing the scope of the Clean Water Act. The EPA is seeking to redefine what counts as a wetland or stream, thereby limiting the area under its jurisdiction and potentially allowing more pollution into these waterways. Second, several wildlife agencies moved to reduce the scope of the Endangered Species Act. This would likely prevent future regulations designed to protect species not already classified as endangered. Finally, the Department of the Interior is allowing new oil and gas drilling in 1.3 billion acres of coastal waters, including those in Alaska and the Arctic. This represents a significant expansion of the areas open to fossil fuel extraction at a time when fossil fuel emissions are linked to global warming.

A total of 48 composite samples (12 each of yam, cassava, cocoyam, and waterleaf) were collected from the Ibaa community and its Right-of-Way (ROW) zone. Edible portions were acid-digested (HNO₃/HClO₄, 3:1) and analyzed for As, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (GF-AAS; Hitachi Z-2000, Tokyo, Japan). Quality assurance included reagent blanks, certified reference materials, and spike recoveries, with recoveries of 92–107%, RSD &lt; 5%, and detection limits of 1.73&nbsp;µg/L (Pb), 0.02&nbsp;µg/L (Cd, Cu, Zn), and 2.0&nbsp;µg/L (As). Mean concentrations (mg/kg) in crops from the ROW were Pb: 0.0028–0.0118, As: 0.0002–0.0030, Cd: 0.0008–0.0027, Cu: 7.99–9.37, and Zn: 16.17–77.51, while control samples showed significantly lower levels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated two dominant contamination sources: anthropogenic Pb–Cd inputs from petroleum activities and Cu from agrochemical use. Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) revealed higher exposure in children, with maximum values for Zn (7.9 × 10-1 mg/kg/day), Cu (1.0 × 10-1), and As (9.5 × 10-5) in cocoyam. Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) for Zn and Cu in children exceeded unity, and the Hazard Index (HI) peaked at 5.5 for cocoyam, surpassing the USEPA safety threshold (HI &gt; 1). Total Lifetime Cancer Risk (TLCR) for As reached 1.5 × 10-4, exceeding the acceptable limit (1 × 10-4). These findings demonstrate significant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks, particularly for children consuming food crops from petroleum-exposed soils. Enhanced regulatory oversight, phytoremediation, and continuous biomonitoring are strongly recommended to mitigate dietary exposure in oil-impacted communities.",,,,,2025-11-29 13:02:38.333120

We build and test predictive visitation models suitable for publicly-managed parks, open space, and other protected lands based on multiple sources of digital mobility data including geotagged posts to social media platforms, community science observations, and a mobile device location dataset from a commercial vendor. Using observational visitation data series from the United States’ National Park Service, Forest Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service, we quantify the accuracy of statistical models to predict on-the-ground visitation using individual and combined sources of mobility data alongside other covariates. We find the predictive models performed best in settings where some on-site visitation data can be integrated into the models. On-site visitation data helps to account for meaningful differences in modeled relationships both within and across the three agencies considered. We find variation in the usefulness of the digital mobility data sources, with models combining multiple data sources outperforming those using a single source, including those based solely on mobile device locations. We discuss the practical implications of these findings as well as paths forward to improve visitation estimation on public lands.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-26926-w/MediaObjects/41598_2025_26926_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-11-28 14:00:42.473890
