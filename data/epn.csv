The study, which found that glyphosate poses no cancer or other health risks to people, was retracted because it relied exclusively on unpublished Monsanto studies. The study failed to review any research that was not conducted by Monsanto, the maker of glyphosate, now owned by Bayer. The journal also found that the paper may have been ghostwritten by Monsanto employees and that financial compensation from Monsanto was not disclosed.

The article has been cited extensively by regulatory agencies around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as evidence that glyphosate poses no cancer risk to humans. The paper is in the top 0.1% of cited articles on glyphosate in the scientific literature, meaning it is more highly cited than 99.9% of articles written on the chemical.",,https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:04:46.518359

This approval reflects the confidence placed in Related Midwest, CRG, Clayco, and our many development and construction partners as we work together to build a world-class quantum hub while responsibly addressing potential environmental concerns.

The IEPA’s decision paves the way for construction of the PsiQuantum facility, establishing the physical environment needed to build one of the world’s first commercial-scale quantum computers right here on the site.

At Clayco, CRG, and LJC, we’re proud to collaborate with so many exceptional partners to bring this transformative project to life, including Related Midwest, BOWA Construction, All Construction, and many others. A heartfelt thank-you to Governor JB Pritzker and to the leadership at IQMP for their steadfast leadership and guidance throughout this process.

The implementation of Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (EASR) is the biggest advancement in environmental legislation in almost thirty years.  
 
Transforming the way we regulate allows us to have a more targeted approach. It moves the dial on prevention and enables quick interventions when operators are at risk of non-compliance.  

This allows us to deliver a more efficient public service.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana is responsible for registering and monitoring pesticide use and regulating the presence of unregistered or banned products on the local market; however, this regulation is ineffective. Farmers frequently acquire pesticides directly from vendors who may not possess sufficient training, and the lack of stringent measures facilitates the accessibility of hazardous products. Furthermore, while regulations mandate safe handling and disposal practices, there are also possible oversights at the community level, leaving farmers largely dependent on their own knowledge, practices, or what they have learnt from other colleagues. This study explores the safety practices, perceived exposure levels, and awareness among rural farmers in the Hohoe municipality of Ghana.   Methods A qualitative ethnographic approach was adopted, involving in-depth interviews with 13 purposively selected farmers with over five years of farming experience. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews guide informed by prior literature. Thematic analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti version 25, with open and selective coding techniques.   Results Four major themes emerged: knowledge and practices of pesticide use, health risks and exposure, safety practices, pesticide storage and disposal. Most farmers (approximately 10 out of 13) reported using Glyphosate as their primary herbicide, followed by Paraquat Dichloride and 2,4-D, relying on vendor recommendations for application methods. Common health complaints included eye and skin irritation, waist pain, and temporary vision loss. While some farmers used PPE like boots and gloves, many lacked complete protective gear, especially eye protection. Pesticide containers were often stored at home or discarded on farms or by burning, indicating poor disposal practices. Awareness of pesticide expiry dates and proper dosage was inconsistent.   Conclusion The study reveals substantial gaps in pesticide safety knowledge and practices among rural farmers, posing significant public health risks. Targeted interventions, including regular training on safe pesticide handling, PPE use, and environmentally sound disposal methods, are critical to reducing occupational exposure and its associated health burdens.",,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0337693.g001&size=inline,,,2025-12-02 15:02:27.970442

Lawmakers, including representatives from Illinois, had recently called on the EPA to release promised federal funding they said was being held up and slowing the process.  “We don't have an agreement in place yet for the replacements, just for the inventory, and we're working towards the replacement plan,” said Niraj Patel, St. Louis water commissioner.  The city’s Water Division is surveying residents and conducting home inspections to get a true count of lead service lines. St. Louis is estimated to have one of the highest numbers of lead services lines in the country, according to analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Cumulative impact (risk) assessments (CIAs) need to integrate ecological and human health, especially to support tribal sovereignty and lifeways, however TEK is often missing from cumulative impact assessments that account for both chemical and non-chemical stressors. This product is responsive to multiple and direct requests from EPA Tribal partnership groups and tribes for ORD to consider and demonstrate how TEK can be woven into its research, including considerations for the confidentiality and sensitivity of TEK information. To directly respond to this call, this product builds on ORD supported research over the last eight years utilizing the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM’s) Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) for Riparian Assessment Framework which leverages multi-disciplinary teams to combine both quantitative and qualitative information into assessing the suitability of riparian areas to support Tribal water quality management and related lifeways. The next step in this research is to better understand the synergistic and cumulative effects that can impact Tribes and their members exponentially by stifling cultural practices, contaminating cultural ecological resources, and adding social and economic stressors. Ecological function-based risk assessment provides a scaffolding for exploring methods that can incorporate TEK into tribal cumulative impact assessments that can consider single or multiple sources with a spatial assessment in order to support tribal decision making on tribal lands.",,https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-epa-7453784384723492243/60003581/thumb.png,,,2025-12-01 15:03:11.418726
