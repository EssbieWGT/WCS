New guidance from EPA promises more flexibility to begin certain project activities before receiving a New Source Review (NSR) permit for new industrial facilities and/or expansion of existing facilities. These NSR permits are enforceable legal documents that typically determine what construction is allowed, what air emissions must be met, and how the source can be operated consistently with air quality requirements. These efforts are intended to remove barriers that stifle construction and, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated, “make America the AI capital of the world.” The September 2 letter from EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Aaron Szabo, to Maricopa County Air Quality Department Director Philip McNeeley, confirms EPA’s intention to propose and finalize modification to the NSR regulations in 2026 to address modification of the definition of “begin actual construction.” In the meantime, Szabo suggests in the letter that EPA will advise on matters of interpretation of the term on a case-by-case basis: “Consistent with the views expressed in the March 2020 Draft Guidance, the EPA continues to recognize that the definition of ‘begin actual construction’ in EPA’s regulation prohibits ‘the initiation of physical on-site construction on an emissions unit’ and that this does not prohibit initiation of physical on-site construction of those parts of a facility that do not qualify as an emission unit.” EPA also signaled that its interpretation of “emission unit” will not be “overly broad.” However, environmental groups argue EPA does not have the authority to allow substantial on-site work before preconstruction air permits for an entire facility are in place. Environmental groups have sent letters to EPA arguing that this issue requires formal rulemaking rather than case-by-case guidance. While this issue has not yet spurred litigation, it is possible environmental groups could file a petition for review or attempt to elicit persons with standing to enjoin projects from proceeding before preconstruction air permits have been issued. Given the heightened scrutiny from environmental groups, construction projects should proceed cautiously. Projects must assist the regulatory agency in developing an administrative record that supports a regulatory conclusion that the proposed preconstruction activities are distinguishable from construction of the emission unit, capture device, etc. It is critical to stay up to date with the latest EPA guidance, review permit provisions, and attend to comprehensive recordkeeping. Doing so safeguards project timelines and budgets, preserves the reputations of project participants, and mitigates the risks of relying on administrative guidance before issuance of a NSR permit. Owners, developers, and contractors involved in construction projects should take care to participate in the rulemaking process on this issue when the opportunity arises to ensure EPA is made aware of the practical intricacies of preconstruction activities as they relate to the implementation of any administrative guidance or formal rulemaking. If you are unsure of what activities you can legally conduct prior to the issuance of any preconstruction permits or if you need assistance navigating the permitting landscape, please reach out to the authors of this alert.",,https://www.steptoe-johnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook.jpg,,,2025-11-22 01:59:02.114574

Adoption makes that possible by opening the door to stability and belonging for children who need a family. During National Adoption Month, we commend the parents whose love has changed lives and the children whose presence has completed families -- and we recommit to caring for the many children still waiting for the comfort and security of a permanent home.Adoption reflects the deep value our Nation places on family and abundant life. As President, I am committed to empowering families who answer the call to open their hearts and homes to children. Through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, I made the adoption tax credit more accessible and expanded the child tax credit, helping remove financial barriers to adopting and allowing families to save more of their income to care for their children. While adoption creates beautiful new beginnings, too many children in our foster care system still wait for a permanent home. During my first term, I took monumental action to strengthen America's foster care and adoption systems by signing into law the landmark Family First Prevention Services Act -- the most sweeping reform of Federal child welfare policy in decades. This law utilizes proven intervention methods to keep families intact and prevent unnecessary separation. This term, I remain firmly committed to continuing this vital work alongside First Lady Melania Trump. Just last week, I signed an Executive Order on Fostering the Future for American Children and Families, to harness Federal support, technology, and strategic partnerships to provide young Americans in, or transitioning out of, the foster-care system with the tools they need to become successful adults. This effort is strengthened by the leadership of the First Lady whose work continues to uplift and protect the well-being of America's children -- ensuring every child has greater access to a strong foundation for the future. This month, we recognize the profound truth that all children are a gift from God, worthy of love, care, and family. We honor the parents and families who welcome children into their homes and provide the stability and guidance every young person deserves. Above all, we commit to protecting children, supporting those who care for them, and strengthening the pillar of family across our great Nation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2025 as National Adoption Month throughout the United States. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by supporting children in need of a safe and loving home, uplifting the families who welcome them, and helping strengthen the bonds of family and community across our Nation. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thisseventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.
