Lawmakers, including representatives from Illinois, had recently called on the EPA to release promised federal funding they said was being held up and slowing the process.  “We don't have an agreement in place yet for the replacements, just for the inventory, and we're working towards the replacement plan,” said Niraj Patel, St. Louis water commissioner.  The city’s Water Division is surveying residents and conducting home inspections to get a true count of lead service lines. St. Louis is estimated to have one of the highest numbers of lead services lines in the country, according to analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Cumulative impact (risk) assessments (CIAs) need to integrate ecological and human health, especially to support tribal sovereignty and lifeways, however TEK is often missing from cumulative impact assessments that account for both chemical and non-chemical stressors. This product is responsive to multiple and direct requests from EPA Tribal partnership groups and tribes for ORD to consider and demonstrate how TEK can be woven into its research, including considerations for the confidentiality and sensitivity of TEK information. To directly respond to this call, this product builds on ORD supported research over the last eight years utilizing the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM’s) Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) for Riparian Assessment Framework which leverages multi-disciplinary teams to combine both quantitative and qualitative information into assessing the suitability of riparian areas to support Tribal water quality management and related lifeways. The next step in this research is to better understand the synergistic and cumulative effects that can impact Tribes and their members exponentially by stifling cultural practices, contaminating cultural ecological resources, and adding social and economic stressors. Ecological function-based risk assessment provides a scaffolding for exploring methods that can incorporate TEK into tribal cumulative impact assessments that can consider single or multiple sources with a spatial assessment in order to support tribal decision making on tribal lands.",,https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-epa-7453784384723492243/60003581/thumb.png,,,2025-12-01 15:03:11.418726

Indoor radon exposure is a significant concern due to its carcinogenic effects. This study assessed radon concentrations in primary schools and kindergartens in Kermanshah, Iran, estimated the annual effective dose, and evaluated potential health risks. This cross-sectional study randomly selected 24 primary schools and kindergartens across Kermanshah. Radon concentrations were measured seasonally using a radon meter (SARAD, RTM1688). Air samples were collected at breathing height and at least 40&nbsp;cm from walls. Building characteristics were recorded using a checklist, and meteorological parameters were measured during sampling. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25. The average annual radon concentration was 37.1 ± 6.1&nbsp;Bq/m2 in kindergartens and 30.9 ± 6.5&nbsp;Bq/m2 in primary schools. The highest concentration was recorded in winter (39.4 ± 4.9&nbsp;Bq/m2) and the lowest in summer (30.6 ± 6.1&nbsp;Bq/m2). Radon concentrations correlated significantly with classroom size and relative humidity (p ≤ 0.01) but not with building age. Ground-floor rooms had higher concentrations, particularly in winter. Rooms with granite walls exhibited the highest radon concentrations (39.15&nbsp;Bq/m2), while those with plaster and paint had the lowest (28.5&nbsp;Bq/m2). The estimated annual effective lung dose was 0.28 mSv/y in kindergartens and 0.23 mSv/y in primary schools, both below the UNSCEAR recommended limit of 1.15 mSv/y. Indoor radon concentrations in Kermanshah’s primary schools and kindergartens were below WHO and ICRP safety thresholds. However, as radon’s effects build up over time, even low levels can contribute to a higher lifetime dose of radiation, increasing health risks over decades and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend mitigation even at relatively low levels. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase public awareness, and policymakers must implement radon-resistant building codes while maintaining adequate ventilation systems. Further research is needed to identify influencing factors and develop mitigation strategies.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-27090-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_27090_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-12-01 11:07:58.177880

,,2025-11-30 01:11:13+00:00,www.facebook.com,"Yale - Last week, the Trump administration made three separate decisions that will affect the environment. First, the EPA proposed stripping protections for wetlands and streams, reducing the scope of the Clean Water Act. The EPA is seeking to redefine what counts as a wetland or stream, thereby limiting the area under its jurisdiction and potentially allowing more pollution into these waterways. Second, several wildlife agencies moved to reduce the scope of the Endangered Species Act. This would likely prevent future regulations designed to protect species not already classified as endangered. Finally, the Department of the Interior is allowing new oil and gas drilling in 1.3 billion acres of coastal waters, including those in Alaska and the Arctic. This represents a significant expansion of the areas open to fossil fuel extraction at a time when fossil fuel emissions are linked to global warming.

A total of 48 composite samples (12 each of yam, cassava, cocoyam, and waterleaf) were collected from the Ibaa community and its Right-of-Way (ROW) zone. Edible portions were acid-digested (HNO₃/HClO₄, 3:1) and analyzed for As, Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn using Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (GF-AAS; Hitachi Z-2000, Tokyo, Japan). Quality assurance included reagent blanks, certified reference materials, and spike recoveries, with recoveries of 92–107%, RSD &lt; 5%, and detection limits of 1.73&nbsp;µg/L (Pb), 0.02&nbsp;µg/L (Cd, Cu, Zn), and 2.0&nbsp;µg/L (As). Mean concentrations (mg/kg) in crops from the ROW were Pb: 0.0028–0.0118, As: 0.0002–0.0030, Cd: 0.0008–0.0027, Cu: 7.99–9.37, and Zn: 16.17–77.51, while control samples showed significantly lower levels. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated two dominant contamination sources: anthropogenic Pb–Cd inputs from petroleum activities and Cu from agrochemical use. Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) revealed higher exposure in children, with maximum values for Zn (7.9 × 10-1 mg/kg/day), Cu (1.0 × 10-1), and As (9.5 × 10-5) in cocoyam. Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) for Zn and Cu in children exceeded unity, and the Hazard Index (HI) peaked at 5.5 for cocoyam, surpassing the USEPA safety threshold (HI &gt; 1). Total Lifetime Cancer Risk (TLCR) for As reached 1.5 × 10-4, exceeding the acceptable limit (1 × 10-4). These findings demonstrate significant non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks, particularly for children consuming food crops from petroleum-exposed soils. Enhanced regulatory oversight, phytoremediation, and continuous biomonitoring are strongly recommended to mitigate dietary exposure in oil-impacted communities.",,,,,2025-11-29 13:02:38.333120
