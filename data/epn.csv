The organization‚Äôs network is asking Mayors nationwide to lead the transition, pointing to the¬†inadequacy of the current system of regulating pesticides based on risk assessments of individual chemicals¬†or individual chemical families. Chemicals interact, causing increased impacts on¬†human,¬†ecological health, and¬†biodiversity. Moreover, humans, other species, and the biosphere rarely experience exposure to single chemicals or chemical families;¬†exposure to multiple chemicals¬†is the rule, not the exception.¬†¬† Synergistic effects associated with the use of the weedkiller glyphosate¬†have been implicated in several studies showing magnified adverse impact in soil organisms and in mixture with other chemicals:¬† The extensive use of glyphosate is linked to effects on nontarget soil organisms, with the risks to soil ecosystems widely studied. (See¬†here,¬†here,¬†here,¬†here, and¬†here.)¬†¬† One study¬†shows that frequent application in tropical systems of glyphosate ‚Äúreduced soil macroarthropod richness by 21% and altered community composition.¬†¬† ‚ÄúA recent global risk assessment of glyphosate further estimated that 67‚àí93% of soils pose high risks to¬†Collembola¬†[springtails] and 43‚àí67% pose medium to high risks to […]",,https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/playing-field.children.jpg,,,2025-11-17 00:59:03.859541

Conventional physical disinfection methods have proven ineffective, and chemical treatments carry potential risks to both human health and the environment. In this context, radiation technology emerges as a promising alternative due to its superior disinfection efficiency. This study examines five varieties of traditional Chinese paper: Xuan paper 1, Xuan paper 2, Bamboo paper 1, Bamboo paper 2, and Bark paper. Following electron beam irradiation, we evaluated tensile strength, polymerization, and color change in both fresh and aged samples. Our results indicate that while irradiation treatment has minor effects on tensile strength and color variability, it significantly reduces the degree of polymerization. In contrast, accelerated aging treatment negatively impacts nearly all parameters. Consequently, we propose that irradiation treatment exerts minimal influence on traditional paper, suggesting it could serve as an effective sterilization method for artifact preservation.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs40494-025-02153-4/MediaObjects/40494_2025_2153_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-11-15 13:02:22.672622
