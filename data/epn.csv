We spoke about many things ‚Äî including his plans on recruitment and partnering with institutions around the country, and even creating opportunities to engage entrepreneurs interested in contracting with the Navy through their procurement process.

I say all that to say: this is absolutely disheartening. When you have served in the federal government and know the character of the people who often become mere headlines to others, it becomes very clear that something is deeply wrong within our country.

Admiral Holsey, a man of honor and integrity, will be stepping down at the end of this year ‚Äî two years ahead of schedule according to the announcement by Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense. 

He is one of only two Black four-star officers leading a U.S. combatant command. 
‚Äî
His departure comes amid escalating tensions in the Caribbean, specifically with Venezuela. 
‚Äî

üá∫üá∏ 
This is bigger than politics. When good men ‚Äî a few good men ‚Äî step down from service to their country, we should all be concerned.
