The agency issued a memo in 2019 during the first Trump administration that it would phase out animal testing, a decision the Biden administration reversed two years later. EPA is reviving that goal and will prioritize developing alternative research methods, even for the small amount of animal testing that is statutorily required, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“We are confident we will continue to find in the weeks and months ahead, new technologies, new alternative methods that allow us to reduce animal testing on something that might be required today but it may not be necessary just a few months from now,” Zeldin said in a speech Thursday.

To this end, Beyond Pesticides and allies are calling on U.S. Representatives and Senators to become aÂ cosponsor of theÂ Opportunities in Organic Act, which is expected to be reintroduced in early 2026 by U.S. Senator Peter Welch and U.S. RepresentativeÂ Jimmy Panetta. In its Pesticide-Induced Diseases Database, Beyond Pesticides critiques studies associating pesticides with serious adverse effects ignored by the regulatory process, including multigenerational effects, chronic low-dose exposure and aging, impacts on fertility dysfunction, synergistic effects associated with mixtures, and endocrine disrupting effects, among others. At the same time, there is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the environmental, health,Â climate, andÂ economicÂ benefits of organic agriculture.Â  With theÂ weakening of pesticide regulation, theÂ organic alternativeÂ has become especially important, according to health and environmental advocates. However, the organic growth needed to reverseÂ the looming health and environmentalÂ crisesÂ will not be achieved without a societal investmentÂ in organic transition, they say. Although consumption of organic food continues to grow in the U.S., domestic productionÂ lags behind.Â TheÂ Opportunities in […]",,https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/OrganicFarm.NoChemicalSpraying.jpg,,,2026-01-26 00:58:52.559110
