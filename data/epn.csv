Where a WCPP applies, owners and operators must ensure that exposures do not exceed the EPA’s limits, even if they are far below OSHA’s regulatory values. As a result, employers may be obligated to implement engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to achieve exposure levels well beneath OSHA’s PELs/STELs.",,https://ogletree.com/app/uploads/Insights/manufacturing/Manufacturing_crystal-kwok-487021-unsplash-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-05 15:21:02.169977

This marks the fifth proposed approval of a PFAS pesticide since Trump took office. The pesticide is a “forever chemical” — one of a group called PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.  It comes more than a month into a federal government shutdown where food stamp benefits have been delayed and are only expected to be paid at 50% of the normal rate. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not receiving paychecks and millions of people across the nation are seeing increased disruptions to their daily lives — from air travel to securing home loans.
