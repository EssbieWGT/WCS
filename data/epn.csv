I‚Äôm deeply grateful for the Governor‚Äôs confidence and for the opportunity to serve California at a moment when strong intergovernmental partnerships matter more than ever. I‚Äôm especially excited to work under the leadership of CalEPA Secretary Yana Garcia, who has been an unwavering champion, protecting public health, advancing environmental justice, and delivering results for communities across the state of California.

In this role, I will lead CalEPA‚Äôs tribal and border affairs portfolio, focusing on strengthening government-to-government relationships with tribal nations, deepening cross-border and binational collaboration, and ensuring that communities most impacted by environmental challenges have a meaningful voice in policy development and implementation. I look forward to helping translate policy into meaningful results that further expands opportunities for communities to grow and thrive.
