Multiple press reports indicate not much progress has been made thus far in resolving the shutdown dispute. On a Sunday morning show on Fox News, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said: “Right now, we’re at a stalemate.” The Senate was in session on  October 3 and October 6 but was unable to pass an extension of the funding. The House is not in session. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that if the President determines that negotiations are not productive, he will begin layoffs – echoing a memo issued by OMB before the shutdown (referenced in our prior alert), which stated that certain federal workers could be “RIF’ed,” essentially fired, instead of furloughed. Several press reports have stated that in past shutdowns, federal workers have not been fired.

In response to a petition from the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), a certifier of packaging and products for commercial composting, the NOSB‚Äôs Crops Subcommittee (CS) voted to keep synthetic compostable materials out of compost permitted in certified organic production. According to comments submitted by Beyond Pesticides, compost from plant and animal materials is of fundamental importance to organic practices. Composting is one way that organic growers meet the requirement in law to ‚Äúfoster soil fertility, primarily through the management of the organic content of the soil through proper tillage, crop rotation, and manuring.‚Äù The integrity of organic production has always been tied to the integrity of compost.
