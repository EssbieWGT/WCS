My final day with the Agency will be November 14.

This decision comes with deep reflection and a full heart. It has been an extraordinary honor to serve this country and people—working to protect public health and the environment. #publichealth #environment

As an immigrant, the opportunity to serve across nine presidential administrations, ten EPA Administrators, and eight Regional Administrators has been both humbling and profoundly meaningful. I am especially proud to have been the first person of color to lead multiple EPA organizations and regional offices. #publicservice #immigrants 

The past decade in EPA Region 7 has been the most rewarding part of my journey. To my colleagues in the Heartland: your commitment, integrity, passion, and dedication to public service have inspired me every single day. The impact you make—both in the communities you serve and in the sustainability culture you foster—is something I will always carry with me. #SevenStrong #communities #partners Iowa Department of Natural Resources Kansas Department of Health and Environment Missouri Department of Natural Resources Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment

Sincere thanks for the privilege of serving alongside you. I will always take pride in what we have accomplished together and will continue cheering you on from afar. I look forward to seeing you around the next bend in the road—where I hope to be moving even faster and greener! #Speed #Sustainability

If you are in the Kansas City metro area before November 14, please feel free to stop by for a quick chat, a goodbye, or even a photo together—it would mean a great deal to me. Otherwise, I look forward to being connected with you here on LinkedIn!
