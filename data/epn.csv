During this period, dry weather and windy conditions, in combination with fallen leaves and increased sunlight reaching and warming the forest floor, can elevate the likelihood of a wildfire. Almost all wildfires are caused by humans and are therefore preventable. Maintaining awareness of fire danger and observing appropriate precautions are things that everyone can do to minimize the likelihood of starting a dangerous wildfire.",,https://portal.ct.gov/Assets/Images/facebook-default_01.png,,,2025-09-18 11:03:31.150647

We identified opportunities for NbS in the US by mapping both critical habitat for birds under a changing climate and carbon stocks and sinks. We then investigated the alignment of these locations with areas important for human well-being and land-dependencies. Finally, we identified High Priority NbS areas that align with irrecoverable carbon to focus conservation efforts on places with significant long-term carbon storage potential. Although ~ 30% of US lands have some protection, &lt; 3% of protected US lands align with priorities for birds, carbon, and human well-being. Of the 312&nbsp;million acres of priority areas for birds, carbon, and human well-being identified, 71% lack legal protection or formal conservation plans (14% of US lands). Targeting such areas for NbS conservation and restoration would help achieve equitable climate benefits by guiding conservation investments to marginalized communities, while also ensuring maintenance of lands that are critical for biodiversity tracking a changing climate. At least 80% of all birds, carbon, and human well-being priorities co-occur with local communities who have cultural and socioeconomic ties to the land, making it imperative to work with these communities to achieve successful conservation outcomes.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-16693-z/MediaObjects/41598_2025_16693_Fig1_HTML.jpg,,,2025-09-17 05:58:24.880968
