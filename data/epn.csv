The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.” The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters. The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.” The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade. Each new definition has been challenged in the courts. Babst Calland will stay up to date on WOTUS developments and the Clean Water Act, in general.

Faith Burns, fellow for energy policy at Americans for Prosperity, issued the following statement:  “This is a giant step forward to unleashing American energy abundance. Nearly every earth moving activity, from the construction of LNG pipelines to oil and gas drilling to home construction, is subject to an evaluation of whether any ‘waters of the United States’ could be impacted.  It is also a strong reminder that our businesses need clarity, consistency, and predictability to plan and invest in this economy. Today, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle recommended clawing back more of the sweeping authority the agencies have used to stop landowners, farmers, manufacturers, and individuals seeking to build across America.” In recent years, the definition of WOTUS, that outlines the scope of federal jurisdiction over Clean Water Act permitting, has been the subject of multiple rulemakings, litigation, and U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Currently, two definitions of “waters of the United States” are being implemented across the country.
