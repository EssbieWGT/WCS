Today, COP30 is bringing together in Belém, Brazil, from 10 to 21 November 2025, the various actors of climate governance in a tense geopolitical context, marked by the rise of anti-environmental populism and the erosion of multilateralism. At this point of stocktaking, the aim is less to oppose successes and failures than to assess the capacity of the international system to mobilise in the face of the climate emergency. A discussion with Mathilde Jourde, researcher at IRIS, head of the Climate, Environment and Security Programme. What is the retrospective since the adoption of the Paris Agreement? Since 1992, the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have been the annual meeting of the Convention’s member states to review progress and determine the measures to be implemented for the years ahead. Often described in binary terms as “successes” or “failures”, the COPs are frequently subject to a reductive reading that obscures their real progress. Yet several notable advances can be highlighted over the past ten years. COP26 stood out for its call for the gradual reduction of electricity generation from coal. COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, was a historic milestone as it endorsed, for the first time, the creation of a “loss and damage” fund to support the most vulnerable countries. COP28, held in Dubai, concluded with a call for a gradual transition away from fossil fuels. Finally, COP29 led to an agreement on a new quantified goal (NCQG) for climate finance for developing countries, to support their efforts to tackle climate change. At the same time, these international negotiations have translated into progress at national level.

The Fast-track Approvals Amendment Bill passed its first reading on Thursday and Chris Bishop, the minister responsible for Resource Management Act (RMA) reform, wants it through Parliament by year’s end. The bill makes changes to the fast-track regime that was passed less than a year ago, with Bishop describing it as “a range of technical and machinery amendments” to streamline processes, based on consultation with stakeholders. Bishop estimated the changes would slash up to six weeks off approval times. The bill also allows the infrastructure minister (Bishop) to refer new supermarket developments to a fast-track consenting panel on the grounds that the project would increase competition in the grocery sector, using a tool called a Government Policy Statement (GPS). “It takes, on average, 18 months and $1 million to obtain consent for a new supermarket, which, when you think about it, is totally nuts… We’re fixing that,” Bishop said.

The Fast-track Approvals Amendment Bill passed its first reading on Thursday and Chris Bishop, the minister responsible for Resource Management Act (RMA) reform, wants it through Parliament by year’s end. The bill makes changes to the fast-track regime that was passed less than a year ago, with Bishop describing it as “a range of technical and machinery amendments” to streamline processes, based on consultation with stakeholders. Bishop estimated the changes would slash up to six weeks off approval times. The bill also allows the infrastructure minister (Bishop) to refer new supermarket developments to a fast-track consenting panel on the grounds that the project would increase competition in the grocery sector, using a tool called a Government Policy Statement (GPS). “It takes, on average, 18 months and $1 million to obtain consent for a new supermarket, which, when you think about it, is totally nuts… We’re fixing that,” Bishop said.
