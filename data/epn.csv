To examine the individual and combined effects of prenatal PAHs exposure and maternal psychological distress on birth outcomes, with emphasis on effect modification by pre-pregnancy BMI. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 699 pregnant women from two primary hospitals in Hefei, China, from April 2020 through October 2022. Urinary PAHs were assessed using gas chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed via Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), respectively. Logistic regression and BKMR models were used to explore the individual and combined effects of prenatal PAHs exposure and psychological distress on birth outcomes. Logistic regression revealed significant associations between PAHs and anxiety symptoms with adverse birth outcomes. In the overall population, 1-OHPHe is significantly associated with low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.25, 4.03), 2-OHDBF and 2-OHPHe were significantly associated with preterm birth (PTB), respectively (1.43, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.98; 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.90). GAD-7 score in the third tertile was positively linked to macrosomia (OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.28, 10.06). BKMR demonstrated that among pre-pregnancy overweight/obese women (BMI ≧ 24.0), combined exposure to PAHs, depression, and anxiety was positively associated with LBW. Meanwhile, among the women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI (18.5–23.9), combined exposure was positively associated with macrosomia and PTB. Study results indicate that combined exposure to PAHs, anxiety, and depression increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41370-025-00829-4/MediaObjects/41370_2025_829_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-12-13 23:57:48.206492
