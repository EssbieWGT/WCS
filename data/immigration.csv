Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said today that the U.S. struck a boat allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea, marking at least the third time this week that the U.S. has attacked a vessel it says was involved in drug trafficking.

“The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X. “Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters—and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.”

Hegseth said that this vessel belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the Trump administration has named a designated terrorist organization, and was hit in the Caribbean.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and at least a half a dozen other senators are calling on the U.S. Education Department to pressure immigration authorities to refrain from carrying out enforcement within 1,000 feet of any school property, citing recent classroom disruptions in the Chicago area.

Today, they sent the letter, first provided to NBC News, to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, demanding that she step in and ask the Department of Homeland Security to curb its operations around schools.

“Federal agents continue to use unwarranted, excessive levels of force around Chicago, demonstrating an alarming lack of care or regard for the health and wellbeing of children, particularly by conducting unfocused, inflammatory operations within close proximity of school grounds,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We demand you pressure your colleague, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, to reinstate restrictions on Federal immigration enforcement operations in and around places of education.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that the U.S. and numerous other countries are committed to the demilitarization of Gaza, stressing that Israel had met its commitment to withdraw its forces from areas of the Palestinian territory.

""If Hamas refuses to demilitarize, it’ll be a violation of the agreement, and that’ll have to be enforced,"" Rubio said. I’m not going to get into the mechanisms by which it is going to be enforced, but it’ll have to be enforced.""

Speaking from the Civilian Military Coordination Center in Israel, Rubio said ""miles of tunnels"" set up by Hamas posed a challenge to the demilitarization efforts.

""We’re dealing with miles and miles of kilometers of tunnel networks,"" he said. ""We’re dealing with two decades of terrorist infrastructure. All that has to be confronted, and we’ll do that together with Israel.""

He emphasized the multinational commitment to disarmament.

""Understand over two dozen countries signed on to this, including regional powers, regional countries, Arab countries, majority Muslim countries, signed on to the commitment that there would not, that there would be a demilitarized Gaza, and that there would not be a Hamas with the capability to threaten Israel,"" Rubio said.

Responding to the Knesset's vote to advance a bill to annex the occupied West Bank, Rubio said, ""It was used to embarrass Netanyahu."" He added that he doesn't think annexation will actually happen and said it would jeopardize the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel.

""It’s a threat to the peace process, and everybody knows it,"" he said. ""But I’m not getting to the middle of Israeli politics. We’re focused on peace and security.""

Statement

Verdict

The Ontario ad is an edited, heavily condensed version of a Ronald Reagan speech, but the sentiment is unchanged and is an accurate reflection of the former president's views on protectionism.

Analysis

Trump said late last night that he was canceling trade talks with Canada after the province of Ontario ran an ad attacking his trade war and the negative effects it anticipates from higher trade tariffs.

The ad used an edited speech by Ronald Reagan in 1987 in which he said, among other things: ""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries, and the triggering of fierce trade wars.""

Trump dismissed the ad as “FAKE,” implying it misrepresented or distorted the former president’s words.

The Ontario ad changes the order of Reagan’s words, quotes only part of some sentences and removes some of the very specific original context on how he had — very reluctantly and contrary to his economic philosophy — just imposed tariffs on Japan in a dispute over semiconductors.

But the sentiment expressed in the ad is unchanged: Reagan's speech was anti-protectionist and he did say, referring to his own tariffs, that “over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.”

Trump has doubled down on his criticism this morning, posting on Truth Social that Canada ""fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.""

The Reagan Foundation said it was considering its legal options regarding the ad, which it said misrepresents the remarks and used the speech without permission. But that legality issue aside, it’s not clear in what way Reagan’s words were misrepresented.

Ambassador Steve Fagin, a seasoned career U.S. diplomat, is expected to be tapped as the State Department's liaison to the Civilian Military Coordination Center monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas and coordinating the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Fagin is currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Yemen and has almost two decades of field experience in the foreign service.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit the coordination center in southern Israel later this week.

“We’ll be assigning some career, experienced State Department personnel to sort of be there to help coordinate all these efforts,” Rubio told reporters shortly before his departure for Israel on Wednesday. “It’s important particularly over the next couple of weeks, that we keep the cease fire together.”

Fagin will face an uphill battle increasing humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of a starving population in Gaza.

After two years of war, a United Nations hunger monitor warned in August that Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip were confronting manmade faminelike conditions.

The flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza increased 46% in the first week of the fragile U.S. brokered ceasefire, according to the U.N.

Fagin is also likely to face some skepticism from aid groups after the U.S. backed the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which required Palestinians to travel to four aid distribution hubs rather than bringing the aid directly to civilians.

“Humanitarian assistance must enter the Gaza Strip at scale to meet the enormous needs of the population wherever they are,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, said yesterday.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime political foe of Trump who previously sued him for making misleading statements to banks, is scheduled to be arraigned today in federal court on bank fraud charges.

A grand jury in Virginia indicted James, a Democrat, this month, weeks after Trump posted a message on Truth Social pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against her and two other political adversaries.

James is charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges she falsely claimed that a home in Norfolk, Virginia, was her second residence, allowing her to obtain favorable loan terms, and that she rented the property to a family of three.

For the 12th time, Senate Democrats blocked the Republican Party’s government funding legislation this week without a single senator switching his or her vote.

Just three Democratic caucus members voted for the bill: John Fetterman, D-Pa.; Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; and Angus King, I-Maine. That means Republicans are still five votes short of the 60-vote threshold to ensure passage of the bill, just as they have been since before the government shut down 23 days ago.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he’s taken aback by some of the Democratic posturing and rhetoric.

“I’m surprised at how open they’ve been about it,” Thune said in an interview Thursday. “That statement yesterday by that House member that they know the American people are going to suffer but this is their leverage? This isn’t about leverage. This isn’t a political game. It’s about people’s lives.”

This submission focuses on the health impacts of air pollution caused by fossil fuels, drawing on HRW’s recent research and advocacy on environmental issues. In particular, it draws out findings and lessons from our work on fossil fuel production (e.g. refining) and use (e.g. coal-fired power plants) across a variety of locations in countries: the United States, Türkiye, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The findings summarized in this brief illustrate a consistent human rights impact: fossil fuel production, combustion and processing are a major source of deadly air pollution that seriously harms health—causing respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and premature deaths, particularly among children, older people and people with pre‑existing health conditions.

Our research further shows that regulatory agencies frequently fail to monitor or enforce air quality standards, to the detriment of public health and in some cases, in violation of the right to health information. The people living in and around oil, gas, and coal extraction sites, refineries, power plants, and pipelines often have extremely limited means to protect their health from the devastating impacts of toxic air pollution.

After briefly summarizing our research findings, HRW respectfully offers recommendations for tackling these challenges and strengthening air quality protections in line with human rights obligations.

Weak or unenforced regulations

HRW research has identified that governments often fail to adopt and implement comprehensive pollutant limits consistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. This includes standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), responsible for the most deaths worldwide from any air pollutant, according to the Health Effects Institute (HEI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW documented that enforcement of air quality standards is poor. HRW found that although air quality standards were generally in line with EU standards (although less robust than WHO guidelines), local officials tasked with various aspects of air quality management said they weren’t enforced. Likewise, between 2018 and 2022 the state breached Energy Community Treaty standards on emissions (for PM2.5, NOx, and SO2) from prescribed coal-fired power plants. In 2020 the plants were emitting almost 10 times as much SO2 as permitted by the treaty. The country had one of the world’s highest mortality rates from air pollution, according to WHO data.

A 2023 HRW investigation into the toxic air pollution caused by expanding fossil fuel operations in the UAE found that PM2.5 concentrations have been consistently above WHO-recommended levels. HRW also analyzed the annual PM10 concentrations from 2018 to 2022 throughout the country, finding that the average of all the stations in 2022 was more than eight times the yearly WHO recommendation. Based on WHO estimates of the death rate attributable to outdoor air pollution, 1,872 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in the UAE in 2019. While the government recognizes the problem of air pollution, its current air-quality standards are much weaker than what the WHO recommends. For instance, the UAE lacks regulatory limits on PM 2.5 (daily and annual), PM10 (annual), NO2 (annual).

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that air quality standards are less strict than those recommended by WHO and do not include a limit for PM2.5, leaving a major regulatory gap. By early 2024 Türkiye had become Europe’s largest coal-fired electricity producer , accounting for 73 percent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and certain coal projects that are planned (and seeking approvals and financing) but not yet built. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, more than 35,000 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in 2019 in Türkiye.

Flawed environmental impact assessments

Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are a critical tool to determine a proposed activity or project’s possible impact on air quality and the health of fenceline communities. Inadequate EIAs allow polluting activities to be approved despite known risks to human health.

Successive Turkish governments have built and expanded two of the country’s biggest coal power plants, plants A and B, in Afşin-Elbistan. HRW found that air pollution levels near plant A – and the later-built plant B two kilometers away – are dangerously high and that residents are experiencing health conditions that academic studies have attributed to air pollution from the plants. Despite this, Turkish authorities were presented with an EIA that gave the go-ahead for the expansion of plant A, which is projected to lead to an estimated 1,900 premature deaths over its 30-year economic lifespan. HRW found the EIA failed to meet national and international standards.

Specifically, HRW found that the EIA: (i) lacked an adequate assessment of baseline air quality which fails to integrate the existing air pollution problem of the region, (ii) ignored the impact of air pollution on human health; (iii) failed to adequately evaluate the worst-case scenario as technological deficiencies of the Afşin Elbistan A Plant were not taken into account; (iv) lacked a cumulative impact assessment based on the planned projects and relevant existing industrial installations; and (v) failed to respect consultation and participation rights. In 2025, authorities approved the Afşin-Elbistan plant’s expansion.

Disproportionate health impacts on marginalized populations

HRW research on the health impacts of the fossil fuel industry has identified that, in many cases, polluting facilities are located within or near marginalized communities, compounding existing inequalities and exposing residents to greater health risks. A defining feature of the fossil fuel industry is its tendency to produce sacrifice zones - places where residents suffer devastating physical and mental health consequences that violate their human rights as a result of living in pollution hotspots and heavily contaminated areas.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found that migrant workers—comprising 88% of the population—face severe health impacts from toxic air pollution. Migrant workers, including low-wage workers engaged in outdoor work, described a myriad of health problems that they believe could be related to the toxic air they are breathing: respiratory ailments, skin problems, eye problems, dizziness, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies. In the UAE, people with certain health conditions such as asthma, pregnant women and other people, children, older people, people with disabilities, migrant workers especially those working outdoors, people living in poverty and other socially and economically marginalized populations are more likely to be exposed to or adversely impacted by harmful air pollution.

In the US state of Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents of the predominantly Black and low-income region known as “Cancer Alley” suffer elevated rates of cancer, reproductive, and respiratory illnesses linked to emissions from fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. Many of the residents of Cancer Alley Human Rights Watch interviewed experienced maternal, reproductive, and newborn health harms. Virtually all could name immediate family members, friends or neighbors who had experienced such harms, including low-birth weight, preterm birth, miscarriage, stillbirths, high risk pregnancy and birth, and infertility. Yet expansion is underway with at least 19 new fossil fuel and petrochemical plants planned at Cancer Alley, including within many of the same predominantly Black and poor communities.

Poor air quality monitoring

Air monitoring is essential for assessing air quality and preventing harmful pollution. When monitoring is lacking or is incomplete, people’s health is put at considerable risk. HRW has identified significant gaps in pollutant monitoring at or nearby fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW showed that air pollution monitoring stations are often not working or unavailable. Local government officials, particularly outside of Sarajevo, reported having insufficient budgets and a shortage of adequately trained personnel to maintain monitoring stations and report data. The country’s 17 air pollution monitoring stations sometimes are out of service, particularly in Republika Srpska, and many do not adequately monitor PM2.5.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found major inconsistencies and data gaps in official air quality monitoring networks. Although some data from monitoring stations across the country is shared, key pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are sometimes missing from public datasets. The available data is also dispersed across multiple platforms and applications that display inconsistent totals for the number of monitoring stations. Moreover, while existing air quality websites provide measurements from ground level monitoring stations, some do not measure all relevant pollutants, and the standards displayed are less stringent than WHO recommendations.

In Louisiana, USA (2024), HRW found that petrochemical companies underestimated benzene emissions from their operations by up to 28 times. Since 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required oil refineries to install fenceline monitors to measure benzene levels at their perimeters, where emissions can reach nearby communities. However, out of thousands of petrochemical plants nationwide, only 13 have been required to install similar monitors under federal action. Of these, only four have provided enough data for analysis, revealing two plants, including one located in Cancer Alley, with benzene concentrations exceeding EPA regulatory limits.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that the number of monitoring stations remains insufficient. While the Turkish government’s air quality monitoring website provides measurements from ground level monitoring stations across the country, the historic data is at times incomplete and pollution hotspots like Afşin-Elbistan are not closely monitored. According to 2016-2019 data analysis, conditions in at least 21 of 81 provinces could not be adequately assessed because data was available for fewer than 75 percent of days. These shortcomings prevent the Turkish government from reliably monitoring the impact of coal-fired power plants on air quality.

Limited availability of air quality information

Access to information about environmental and health risks and impacts associated with a proposed activity or project is a key component of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. HRW has documented numerous cases in which governments have failed to identify or disclose the air pollution risks posed by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, thereby threatening the human rights of nearby communities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW reported that while major polluters are legally required to submit air quality data to the government, this information is not made public. Warnings to avoid outdoor activities or to limit vehicular transport on days with poor air quality were largely limited to the capital, Sarajevo. In the absence of adequate government monitoring and communication, a series of citizen-run sensors fill the gap - young people said they regularly use apps or websites that report on air quality, some of them operated by civil society. Others receive air quality updates from television and radio, while others, particularly older people, say they assess air quality based on the smell or the appearance of the air, neither of which is appropriate to determine the extent of air pollution or assess health risks.

In the UAE (2023), HRW documented a dearth of public information about the impacts of air pollution, its sources, and how at-risk populations can protect themselves. The UAE government acknowledged that “[t]here is currently no system to warn the public about inevitable high-level pollution episodes (for example, dust storms) and to provide guidance on how to reduce personal exposure to pollution,” yet it has done little to address these gaps. Migrant workers told HRW that they had no information about the risks of air pollution, its sources, who is most impacted, and how they can protect themselves. Existing air quality websites did not provide practical advice on protection measures and lacked detailed information for at-risk groups. They only exist in Arabic and English and are not accessible to migrant workers who may not speak either of these languages; information is not available in accessible formats.

In Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents’ complaints to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) went unanswered. When residents have questions or concerns about industrial operations, they are instructed to contact the LDEQ. However, instead of serving as a trusted source of information, the agency has become a source of profound frustration for many. The lack of information and action has led many residents to stop contacting the agency altogether.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW noted that emissions from large combustion plants, including coal plants, are not publicly available. Even when courts have ordered the government to provide emissions data of coal plants publicly, the authorities have not revealed the data. Residents in Çoğulhan, Berçenek, and Altunelma, said they have not received any information about the extent of environmental problems in the region, possible health effects, or how to participate in decisions around the coal plant that would enable them to address or prevent health risks and seek remediation for health harms. The Environment Ministry provides some health advice via a website, such as suggesting that members of sensitive groups limit outdoor activities when air pollution levels are high, but it does not provide detailed practical advice for at-risk groups.

Recommendations

As a guiding principle, States should implement moratoria on new or expanded fossil fuel operations and begin phase-out of existing operations. In addition, we recommend the following:

Regulation and enforcement

Order an immediate pause of all fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment until they operate in accordance with relevant legal protections.

Develop and enforce stringent regulations to limit air pollution related to fossil fuel and petrochemical operations, including through legally binding pollutant limits on particulate matter (PM 2.5 ​ and PM 10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2​), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in line with the WHO’s 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. Regulations should also seek a phase-out of venting and flaring of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas and air pollutant.

Mandate science-based buffer zones separating fossil fuel and petrochemical operations from residential, educational, and recreational areas. As a guiding principle, communities should not be relocated to allow for industry expansion or continued operation. On the contrary, states should prioritize decommissioning and or relocating life-threatening facilities away from where people live, work, learn and play.

Environmental impact assessments

Deny permits for fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that would result in a disproportionate burden of harm in already overburdened communities.

Require EIAs to include air quality and health impact assessments for all fossil fuel and petrochemical projects, including short and long-term health risks from exposure to PM 2.5, PM10, NOX, SO2, CH4 and other pollutants.

Require comprehensive baseline and cumulative air quality assessments, considering existing and planned industrial installations.

Ensure affected individuals and communities can meaningfully participate in the EIA process.

In a recent case addressing sovereign immunity for Native American tribes, Washington Supreme Court Justice Sal Mungia issued an unusual concurrence: He agreed with the state high court’s legal ruling that, under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the Stillaguamish tribe is immune from a lawsuit over land ownership. “But I dissent,” he wrote in Flying T Ranch v. Stillaguamish, “from the racism embedded in the federal case law that applies to this dispute.”

Mungia’s concurrence lays out the racist stereotypes rooted in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings cited by the Washington high court. In these 19th-century cases, justices described Native Americans as “low in the grade of organized society” and with a “savage nature.” These cases, Mungia argued, were based on racist premises.

Mungia’s concurrence was striking not only for pointing out the prejudices baked into long-standing precedents, but also for how it engaged with his role as a state court judge in our federal system. Mungia acknowledged that the Washington Supreme Court is bound to follow U.S. Supreme Court precedents. However, “we are not bound to stay silent as to the underlying racism and prejudices that are woven into the very fabric of those opinions,” he argued. He called on his colleagues to “clearly, loudly, and unequivocally state that was ‘wrong.’”

While the cases Mungia condemns are more than a century old, state judges have also sharply critiqued some contemporary U.S. Supreme Court decisions as resting on their own illegitimate bases. Last month, for example, Justice Todd Eddins of the Hawaii Supreme Court pointed to recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, including on its shadow docket, as reflecting a “throw-judges-under-the-bus disdain for district courts, the fact-finders of the federal judiciary.” Looking at the high court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence, Eddins argued in his Hilo Bay Marina v. Hawaii concurrence that the justices had “repackaged and whitewashed facts to achieve a desired outcome” and imposed policy preferences by “unprincipled fiat.”

When it comes to critiquing the U.S. Supreme Court, state supreme court justices enjoy a unique institutional posture: Like all judges, they can speak to the reality of having to apply problematic precedents, but they also sit outside the federal judicial hierarchy that often leads lower court judges to bite their tongues. Notably, while federal judges have increasingly spoken up to criticize the Court’s use of the shadow docket in litigation involving the Trump administration — which is highly unusual in itself — they’ve largely done so anonymously.

State supreme court justices are also in a special position because they sit atop state judiciaries as the ultimate word in interpreting state laws. This means that within their own sphere, they can model an alternative to the Court in how they interpret, apply, and grapple with their states’ constitutions, laws, and precedents. Eddins, for example, observed that when it comes to interpreting his state’s constitution, he treats recent Supreme Court jurisprudence as “white noise.” And as Mungia notes, the Washington Supreme Court has previously repudiated some of its own prior decisions that “disregarded the rights of Native Americans and their treaty rights.”

Historically, controversial Supreme Court decisions weren’t the end of the conversation about the meaning of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws. Cases like Lochner v. New York, which invalidated labor protections as inconsistent with the right to freedom of contract, were just the beginning of dialogue — and sometimes conflict, between the Supreme Court and Congress, the states, and other institutional actors. Today’s state court opinions may signal a new generation of contestation.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank.
Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK?
This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month.
President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco.","The United Nations is urging Israel to open the Rafah border crossing to allow urgently needed aid into the Gaza Strip. This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump asserted Thursday that he had the authority to continue to launch airstrikes against alleged drug boats in international waters without a congressional declaration of war. Since September, the Pentagon says it’s struck nine alleged drug boats, killing 37 people.

President Donald Trump: “Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them. You know? They’re going to be, like, dead. OK.”

Trump also denied reports by The Wall Street Journal that the U.S. is sending B-1 bombers near Venezuela. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced he’s deploying armed forces along the country’s coastline.

Vladimir Padrino López: “No attempt to destabilize the Venezuelan nation will pass through here. They may send however many CIA-affiliated units in covert operations from any flank of the nation, and any attempt will fail, as they have failed so far.”

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

The Trump administration has released a list of wealthy donors and corporations funding President Trump’s $300 million construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House. Among the donors are Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Palantir, Lockheed Martin and more. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution. No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/49/79549/full_hd/H6-Pregnant-ICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:25.364572

The wait is over. The Texas Supreme Court recently finalized amendments to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 201, implementing the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (“UIDDA”).[1] The amendments took effect August 31, 2025, marking a shift in how parties conduct interstate discovery involving Texas witnesses.

By adopting the UIDDA, Texas has joined the overwhelming majority of states in streamlining interstate discovery. Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Hampshire remain the only states that have yet to adopt some version of the UIDDA, leaving them as outliers in an otherwise uniform national system.

What Changed

For decades, attorneys seeking evidence in Texas for an out-of-state proceeding were first required to obtain a “mandate, writ, or commission” from the court where the lawsuit was pending. This process was cumbersome because it involved unnecessary delays and expenses.

Now, under Rule 201.3, a party simply submits an out-of-state subpoena to a court clerk in the Texas county where discovery is sought. The clerk must then promptly issue an equivalent Texas subpoena incorporating the same terms—with no judicial stamp of approval required.

The new rule applies to subpoenas requiring witnesses to:

Attend and give testimony at depositions (oral examination or written questions); or

Produce documents or tangible things.

Importantly, this request does not constitute an appearance in Texas courts, which means out-of-state attorneys can obtain subpoenas without needing to be licensed in Texas, seek pro hac vice admission, or hire local counsel to issue and serve the subpoena.

Once issued, the Texas subpoena must be served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 176 and 205. From there, Texas law controls. Any discovery disputes, whether concerning protective orders or enforcement, get resolved in Texas courts.

One Key Limitation: Property Inspections

Texas’s version of the UIDDA, however, includes a notable exception that prevents clerks from issuing subpoenas for premises inspections. Litigants will still need a court order for subpoenas seeking inspection of property. Rule 201.3 covers testimony and documents, while carving out and preserving Texas’s traditional requirement for judicial oversight of property inspections.

Why This Matters

The new rule simplifies interstate discovery by eliminating jurisdictional hurdles, reducing costs, and accelerating the discovery process. By directing clerks to act “promptly” and without the need for judicial intervention, the UIDDA framework removes delays that previously plagued litigation across state lines. This change benefits both out-of-state parties seeking discovery in Texas and Texas litigants conducting discovery in other UIDDA states that require reciprocity.

Companies with employees, documents, or operations in Texas can expect to see an increase in out-of-state discovery requests, as the process is now more efficient for parties in litigation elsewhere to obtain testimony and documents from Texas witnesses. Businesses should review their document retention policies and ensure employees understand their potential obligations when served with out-of-state subpoenas.

[1] On June 11, 2023, the Texas Legislature passed H.B. 3929, directing the Texas Supreme Court to consider adopting the UIDDA before September 1, 2025. Tex. HB 3929, 88th Leg., R.S. (2023).

Mr. Blanche conveyed the warning in a letter a day after several officials in San Francisco, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, and Brooke Jenkins, the city’s district attorney, said that they might seek to arrest federal agents who break California law during immigration raids.

The suggestion, Ms. Jenkins said, came from seeing agents confronting people in Los Angeles and Chicago. While she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents on city streets, she said she would use video footage to identify agents using excessive force and ask a judge for arrest warrants.

Their idea would be to prosecute immigration agents who overstep their authority, for example by using excessive force, state officials said. But the ability of states to arrest federal officers is without much legal precedent.

He also said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause prevents federal officers from being held on a state criminal charge if the alleged crime occurred while the officer was performing federal duties.

“The Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any state or local official who violates these federal statutes,” he wrote, “or directs or conspires with others to violate them.”

He concluded that “federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities.”

The Trump administration had said on Wednesday that it was sending U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to Alameda, Calif., to prepare for an operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. President Trump on Thursday called off the crackdown in the city, though it was unclear what that meant for the rest of the Bay Area.

Mr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration.

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting.
She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.
“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny.
“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said.","The widow of one of the people killed when a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Texas last month has spoken out to question whether the political violence rising under the Trump administration played a role in her husband’s death.

Stephany Gauffeny lost her husband, Miguel García-Hernández, when he became the second of two men to die in the attack outside a detention center in Dallas, after succumbing to his gunshot wounds.

“There’s so much hate going on with immigrants and ICE now, so it has crossed my mind if this would have happened under a different administration. It has certainly played a part in his death,” said the 32-year-old mother in an interview with the Guardian, her first since her husband’s death.

She added: “Sometimes it feels better to be asleep than to be awake, because when I sleep I forget about everything and when I wake up this reality hits me.”

Three days after García-Hernández’s death, Gauffeny gave birth to their third child, a son, Miles Alexander, the name chosen by the father he will never meet. A week after the birth the family buried García-Hernández, 31, in Arlington, where they had recently bought a house, on the outskirts of Dallas.

The authorities described the shooting as a lone, “targeted attack” on ICE and said the gunman, Joshua Jahn – who shot himself dead after spraying the exterior of the facility with bullets – wrote “ANTI-ICE” on one bullet casing.

But in the violent chaos, no law enforcement officers were injured and instead a government van was hit that was holding shackled immigrants on their way to detention. Three detainees from Latin America were shot, including García-Hernández.

The other two victims were 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador, who died on the day of the shooting, and 33-year-old José Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, who was later released from the hospital.

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting. García-Hernández, who was undocumented, had been hospitalized in critical condition.

She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.

“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny. As she sat for the interview at her lawyer’s office in Dallas last week, she watched over her newborn sleeping in his stroller by her side.

“How many people were in the van? How many times did he actually get shot? Was he conscious at all? They never gave me any details,” she said.

García-Hernández was born in San Luis Potosí, a state in central Mexico. He came to the United States as an undocumented 14-year-old in 2008, and built a life in Texas. But on 8 August this year, García-Hernández had been arrested for driving under the influence and taken to the Tarrant county corrections center in Fort Worth. On that same date, ICE placed a detainer against his release, which allowed immigration officials to pick him up once he served a short time in jail.

“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said. She is currently weighing filing a lawsuit against the authorities.

Because García-Hernández was married to a US citizen and he was the primary source of income for his household, he was able to apply for a waiver that, if granted, would have effectively erased the transgression of his illegal entry into the US and allowed him to get a green card.

“He wanted to have his own painting company; he made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment. He was so excited and had a lot going for him,” Gauffeny said.

On the day of the shooting, Donald Trump, in the context of the anti-ICE message on one bullet casing, posted on Truth Social: “This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the ‘WORST of the WORST’ Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists.”

ICE issued a statement six days after the shooting about García-Hernández’s death, saying: “Our thoughts are with his family and this tragedy underscores the terrible cost of dangerous rhetoric and violence against the men and women of ICE who are simply carrying out their sworn law enforcement mission.”

Gauffeny said that while the family experienced an outpouring of support from many, including via a fundraiser, she has also been targeted with hate messages from strangers.

“I received comments on social media from people saying that they are not sorry,” she said, adding: “Does the fact that he entered illegally mean that he deserves to be killed the way he was killed?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0989fe25ceaeb0cd09a7bb868d47cfbe4b4d1f11/8_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf4c26c8ab8ea597c575edfe6ab2e3f2",N,,2025-10-24 09:02:34.716725

An outright win is next to impossible. The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.

It then partnered with three other far-right parties – the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), New Social Contract (NSC), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – to form a coalition government.

But in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the coalition government over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.

In a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.

Coalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.

Following the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.

Then, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.

Now, with an election imminent, opinion polls suggest the PVV will secure the most seats in the 150-seat parliament. While a winner needs 76 seats to form a government, no single party ever makes it to that figure, which has led to a history of coalitions.

According to a poll by the Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, on October 14, the PVV is projected to secure 31 seats. The centre-left Green-Labour alliance (GroenLinks-PvdA) is polling at 25 seats, and the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is polling at 23.

PVV’s former coalition partner, the centre-right VVD, could take 14 seats and the BBB, four. So far, the NSC is not projected to secure any seats at all.

Immigration fears

At the end of September, EenVandaag polled 27,191 people and found that the main sticking point between voters – and, hence, between the leaders, PVV and GroenLinks-PvdA – is immigration. Half of all voters said it was the key issue on which they would be voting this year. Housing was the second-most important issue at 46 percent, and “Dutch identity” came third at 37 percent.

While the PVV is firmly anti-immigration and wants to impose a much stricter border policy and asylum laws, GroenLinks-PvdA would prefer to allow a net migration figure of 40,000 and 60,000 migrants per year.

Tempers are running high over this issue. Last month at The Hague, a right-wing activist known as “Els Rechts” organised an anti-migration protest that attracted 1,500 attendees. According to reports, protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, set a police car alight and smashed windows of the left-wing Democrats 66 (D66) party offices.

While left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.

Esme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.

“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”

Whatever its merits, the right-wing message that immigration is at the root of many social ills seems to be taking hold. The far-left, pro-immigration BIJ1 party, which rejects this message, is not projected to win any seats at all in this election.

Immigration “is a key term especially for right-wing political parties to win the election”, Noura Oul Fakir, a candidate for the BIJ1 party, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t focus on it because we look at everything that’s been going on from a systemic point of view, that every form of oppression is interlinked … This fight for equality and justice, it’s about more than just immigration, but it’s also interlinked with other issues that we see nowadays.”

People ‘more emboldened to express racist views’

By January 1, 2024, the Netherlands was hosting 2.9 million migrants (16.2 percent of the population), compared to the average across European Union member states of 9.9 percent (44.7 million people in total).

Similarly, Germany hosts 16.9 million migrants (20.2 percent of the population); France, 9.3 million (13.6 percent of the population); Spain, 8.8 million (18.2 percent of the population); and Italy, 6.7 million (11.3 percent of the population), according to figures from the EU.

Mark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.

For instance, the Netherlands is currently short of 434,000 homes, including for 353,000 asylum seekers and 81,000 Dutch first-time buyers, according to figures commissioned by the Ministry of Housing and Spatial Planning (VRO).

Immigration has, therefore, been blamed for what is seen as a housing crisis.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 316,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2024, 19,000 fewer than in 2023. But CBS also found that population growth is still mainly down to net migration, with the largest number of migrants coming from Ukraine and Syria.

“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.

“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.

Anecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.

“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.

For Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.

“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.

Nearly half of voters still undecided

While the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.

Furthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.

Notable incidents over the years include Wilders’ likening of Islam to Nazism in 2007 and his reference to the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as “fascist” in a letter to a Dutch news outlet. His letter and comments led to Wilders being prosecuted for inciting hatred and discrimination, which he denied. In 2011, he was acquitted by a judge who ruled that his comments had fallen within the scope of free speech.

More recently, in August this year, Wilders posted an image on X that depicted a smiling, blonde and blue-eyed woman, representing the PVV; and a wrinkled, angry-looking elderly woman wearing a headscarf, representing the PvdA. It was accompanied by the words: “The choice is yours on 29/10.”

Fake news and misinformation have also driven the rise in far-right narratives, analysts say.

The Facebook page ‘Wij doen GEEN aangifte tegen Geert Wilders’ (We are NOT filing charges against Geert Wilders), which claims to be a PVV supporters’ page boasting 129,000 followers, said it does not intend to be “discriminatory, hateful, or incite violence”, but has nevertheless posted AI-generated images of this nature.

In one such image, which received 1,700 likes, a white family is seemingly being harassed by men of colour.

In another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.

While the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.

Still, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has warned voters not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.

And a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.

This will be no easy task, however.

“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.

Still, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.

“I think it’s very easy to kind of feel that division between ‘us and them’. Us campaigning on the left and this growing mass of the far right,” Swain said.

“We need to tackle fighting the influence of lobbying and of fake news in our political structures. And I think that becoming more united as a population would naturally fall from that.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/epa_68efccf68fa0-1760546038.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-24 10:00:37.554586

Leaders say it's not about interfering but rather about alerting and informing the community.

Flyers will be passed around to businesses around the state, community leaders saying Thursday the hotline is not just a number, it’s a lifeline to protecting immigrant families.

""The threat from this administration is strangling the life from our communities, and I take that personally,"" Portland City Councilor Wes Pelletier said.

Passionate statements from local leaders on Thursday in Portland as they announced the launch of a hotline meant to protect immigrants and their families who may be fearful of seeing ICE on Maine streets.

""Our families, our friends, our neighbors are afraid to go to school, to work, to worship, to the hospital, to the store,"" Rev. Dr. Jodi Cohen Hayashida, a minister in Auburn, said.

Members of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice say the ICE Watch Hotline will help people from having to rely on internet posts or word of mouth.

""So we know that this tactic is effective in deterring law enforcement activity,"" Presente! Maine Executive Director Crystal Cron said.

Cron is one of the hotline organizers. She says once the number is called, you will be connected to a volunteer operator, where you can either get supportive advice or report that agents are in your area.

They'll also take a step further: sending people to the location to interact with the agents and answer questions from anyone involved.

Betsy Smith is a spokesperson for the National Police Association, which supports American law enforcement. She believes this hotline only hurts the community.

""A hotline to protect criminals is absolutely obscene,"" Smith said. ""It prevents law enforcement from arresting criminal illegal aliens... It's dangerous, it's unconstitutional, and it's un-American.""

That hotline went live Thursday.

The number is 207-544-9989.

Volunteers will be there to take calls in the morning and evening.

Leaders say they're still building out a list of operators.

“The Maine ICE Watch Hotline is a lifeline for families, a bridge for neighbors and a promise that no one in our community will face fear alone,” said Portland At-Large City Councilor Pious Ali, speaking at a press event at City Hall Thursday.

The goal of the project, which is organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice, is to provide accurate, real-time information about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.

“This isn’t about panic — it’s about protection,” Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine said. “It’s about staying informed, connected and ready to act together. When ICE shows up, we show up too — not with fear but with solidarity. This hotline is a step towards the community we all deserve, one rooted in trust, care and collective defense.”

The hotline has already trained over 150 volunteers, both as operators to receive calls as well as verifiers to confirm or refute reported sightings of immigrant enforcement activity, Cron said. While there are already volunteers across the state, Cron said they are seeking more in rural areas.

Federal actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states have been on the rise. The press conference was held two days after 50 federal agents descended on New York City’s Canal Street, reportedly arresting nine men.

Last month, a Portland resident was detained by ICE agents after dropping off their child at the Gerald E. Talbot Community School. Nationally, schools, like workplaces, have become frequent targets and there is research tying the raids to increased student absences.

Wes Pelletier said at the press event that, as councilor for Portland District 2, he represents some of the city’s more diverse neighborhoods and has “seen firsthand how fear has taken hold of our communities. Truancy is on the rise… our parks and playgrounds and our streets are more quiet.”

Pelletier, who is among the volunteers that have taken the verifier training, said over the past few months there’s been quiet organizing but there’s been a growing need for a “unified network to share information that doesn’t cause undo panic, is integrated in the communities it serves, and that balances safety with accessibility.”

After the hotline receives a call of a potential sighting, the report is passed to a regional verifier response group. If they confirm that immigration agents are present, an alert will go out through texts and social media. Verifiers are also trained to observe enforcement actions and gather more information. Afterwards, the hotline will help track the detainee through the immigration system while connecting impacted people with legal representation, financial and other support.

Similar grassroots efforts have been launched elsewhere to protect immigrant communities and push back against federal enforcement actions.

Ahead of the Trump administration’s deployment of immigration authorities last month to Chicago, community groups similarly launched a hotline to help keep tabs on agent activity. Since then, volunteers have organized a vast rapid response network that includes blowing whistles to alert neighbors if ICE or Border Patrol agents are spotted nearby and documenting encounters with federal agents on their phones.

Cron said they’ve connected with and learned from groups in other states, including Siembra NC, in North Carolina, and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network in Massachusetts.

The role of local law enforcement

While the speakers focused on federal immigration activity, enforcement in Maine has routinely been initiated by local law enforcement.

Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 minor traffic stops and similar incidents where more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status alone. This is not a complete picture of such incidents, but rather the organization’s best estimate based on verifiable reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” ILAP shared in a statement.

While ICE arrests in Maine double, governor delays deciding on limits for local police cooperation

The state Legislature has considered prohibiting or restricting state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities, though both remain in limbo heading into the next session in January. One of those bills passed the Legislature and rests with Gov. Janet Mills.

“When our governor refuses to sign a bill that will prevent local and state law enforcement from being used to enforce harsh federal immigration laws, it sends the wrong message,” said Ali. “It tells the federal agencies that they can come into our neighborhoods and act without restraint.”

Cron said the hotline guidance is the same regardless of whether it is a federal or local officer and people should call in if they see any suspicious law enforcement activity.

An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities.

As of Tuesday night, no police departments in Maine have formal agreements with federal immigration authorities, after Wells Police Department terminated its agreement under the 287(g) program.

This means departments in Maine have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.

Another layer is where immigration detainees are housed. The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics.

Earlier this week, the board postponed its decision, with some members raising concern that ending the contract would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel.

Legal experts say that already occurs, as it’s common practice for federal authorities to transfer immigration detainees from facility to facility.

As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.

The hotline is currently available from 6-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. Monday through Friday. The coalition is encouraging interested parties to volunteer or share information about the hotline on social media or by displaying one of their posters.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4699-scaled-e1761245956885-2048x1327.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 10:00:46.735526

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.","Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called ""Freaky Friday,"" offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans – many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It's a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I'm more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it's easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I'm not happy with my country.

“It's like they're not compromising. They're not coming to a happy medium. They're just combative. And that's all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an ""extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for staunching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him – or other lawyers – to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system's gotten a lot faster. When it's come to helping people, the system's gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Iraq War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile.

The Franklin County Commissioners expect more than 4,100 residents — including 1,700 children — will be impacted by the SNAP changes.
Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.
“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said.
“Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity.","Upcoming changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will soon restrict which Ohioans are eligible for benefits.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, changes “non-citizen eligibility for SNAP.”

Only U.S. citizens, green card holders who have gone through a five-year waiting period, and some Haitian and Cuban nationals with special status will be eligible for SNAP. This means refugees, people who have been granted asylum and human trafficking survivors will all lose their benefits, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service gave states 120 days to implement these changes, meaning Nov. 1 is the deadline.

More than 183,000 Franklin County residents receive SNAP benefits and most of them are children and seniors, said Joy Bivens, deputy Franklin County administrator of health and human services. The Franklin County Commissioners expect more than 4,100 residents — including 1,700 children — will be impacted by the SNAP changes.

Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.

“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said. “They are people who have endured trauma, made tremendous sacrifices and risked their lives to give their families security and freedom. These individuals often arrive with no local family connections and no established community. Without this support, they are often left to navigate life in an unfamiliar country with very limited resources, they face food insecurity, housing instability and limited access to health care.”

Approximately 1.39 million Ohioans receive an average of $190 of SNAP benefits each month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines — $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP.

“When families can’t rely on SNAP, they are forced to spend their limited income on food, and often at the expense of medical care, rent or utilities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” said Franklin County Commissioner John O’Grady. “Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity. Children may face developmental display delays. Families may confront chronic health issues.”

SNAP helps stabilize families when they are new to the U.S., said Jewish Family Services CEO Karen Mozenter.

“They have done everything right, and they are eager to contribute as Americans,” she said. “Cutting off the support that helps them feed their families and care for them while they find their footing in a new country, that hurts them and that hurts all of us.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is serving 58% more families now than at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said President and CEO Matt Habash.

“Unfortunately, we don’t expect those numbers to go down,” he said. “The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of health care, and more are all putting pressure on household budgets, and now we’re dealing with cuts to SNAP — America’s first line of defense against hunger.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761296680.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=CuVmDKNI,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:33.586106

Elsewhere around the country, it will be at least days before the Guard could be deployed in Portland, Oregon, and federal appeals judges are weighing whether hundreds of California National Guard members should remain under federal control.

President Donald Trump’s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors has unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.

Here’s what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities:

Judge weighs Guard in Chicago while awaiting Supreme Court decision

U.S. District Judge April Perry on Wednesday blocked the deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area until the case has been decided either in her court or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes. Perry had already blocked the deployment for two weeks through a temporary restraining order, or TRO.

Attorneys representing the federal government said they would agree to extend the order but emphasized that they would continue pressing for an emergency order from the Supreme Court that would allow for the deployment.

“Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.

Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a “dramatic step.”

Guard deployment in Portland also in limbo

An appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.

The Justice Department appealed the first order and — in a 2-1 ruling Monday — a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.

However, Immergut’s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration’s request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday’s ruling.

California legal battle goes before appellate panel

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump’s deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.

A district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Judge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California’s Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, putting Breyer’s decision on hold and allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.

The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Breyer’s June order.

The same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration’s appeal of Breyer’s Sept. 2 ruling, which found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.

Groups aim to stop Guard deployment in DC

In Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation’s capital supporting Trump’s initiative since late August.

A separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Forty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration’s actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general’s lawsuit.

Republican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.

Democrats sue to stop Guard deployment in Memphis

In Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” — but only with state lawmakers’ blessing.

Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing camouflage uniforms and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.

He followed agents’ vehicles and then honked to warn others when he was pulled over. Masked federal officers pointed a gun at him and a staffer, attempted to break his car window and took photos of their faces, before issuing a warning, he recounted.

“We were non-violent,” Huynh said of Tuesday’s incident, part of which was captured on video. “We identified ourselves as an elected official and my hands were visible.”

As the Trump administration intensifies an immigration crackdown across the nation’s third-largest city and its suburbs, elected officials in the Democratic stronghold have been increasingly caught in tense encounters with federal agents. Members of the Chicago City Council and their staff, state legislators and congressional candidates report being threatened, handcuffed and detained in recent days.

The tense political atmosphere comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to expand military deployments and jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson over immigration policies the Republican claims protect criminals. But Illinois Democrats deem the actions as scare tactics and a calculated acceleration. The clashes, amid constant arrests of immigrants and protesters, have emerged as a top campaign issue in Illinois’ March primary where an unusually high number of congressional seats are open.

“This is an escalation with the interests of creating fear and intimidation in my community and in all of Chicago,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, whose ward includes heavily immigrant and Latino neighborhoods.

During an enforcement operation Wednesday in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village and adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained, he said.

Two of those citizens work in his office, including chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and were held for hours. Bahena also serves on an elected police accountability council. Rodriguez said they did nothing wrong but didn't offer exact details.

“Trump sent his goons to my neighborhood to intimidate and in the process of helping people out, my staff got detained,” he said Thursday amid continued federal presence in Little Village. Among other things, agents deployed chemical agents and detained a 16-year-old, activists and elected officials said.

While the operation’s focus has been concentrated in Latino neighborhoods and suburbs, federal agents have been spotted all over the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs. Word of pedestrian and traffic stops outside schools, stores, courts and an O’Hare International Airport parking lot used by rideshare drivers have triggered waves of frustration amid the city’s active immigrant rights network and residents who follow vehicles, blow warning whistles and take videos.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its operations, including the detention of U.S. citizens, saying they are temporarily held for safety. The agency, which didn't answer questions about Rodriguez’ staff, accused Huynh of “stalking” agents.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said agents had to assess if he was a threat.

“This behavior is unbecoming of a public servant and is just another example of sanctuary politicians putting our officers at risk,” she said in a statement.

Also this week, City Council member Jessie Fuentes filed a federal tort claim seeking $100,000 in damages after agents grabbed and handcuffed her earlier this month at a hospital. She said she was checking on a person who was injured while being pursued by immigration agents and asked for a signed judicial warrant on the person’s behalf. She was handcuffed and let go outside the hospital. She wasn't charged.

“It is indeed a frightening time, when unidentified federal agents shove, grab, handcuff, and detain an elected official in the exercise of her duties,” said Jan Susler, Fuentes’ attorney.

Huynh, who was elected to the Illinois House in 2022, is also running for Congress to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky, among four open House seats in safely Democratic territory. Other candidates in the crowded primary have also publicized their opposition outside a federal immigration processing center, including Kat Abughazaleh who was thrown on the ground by federal agents as she protested.

For Huynh, who came to the U.S. in the 1990s from Vietnam and was granted political asylum, the feeling is eerily familiar.

“My family came as refugees from the Vietnam War where people were being picked up by the secret police all the time. We believed in the American ideal of due process,” he said. ""It is very concerning that in this country right now and very disturbing right now that we are living under this authoritarian regime.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c278143e-e38e-45e7-bc2b-4ddef29bbcf9/wirestory_7624ff7cae0b58f9b8606deacffa2474_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:15.226221

In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network.

The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement.","While a federal judge scrutinizes the constitutionality of tactics used by federal immigration authorities during ongoing protests in Chicago, these same agencies are quietly amassing behind-the-scenes surveillance technology. Originally slated to target undocumented immigrants, the technology is now being used to investigate protesters of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Backed by funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has entered into contracts with companies to provide surveillance capabilities like facial recognition algorithms, an iris-scanning identification app, controversial spyware on smartphones, and a real-time smartphone location and social media tracking system. In September alone, ICE racked up $1.4 billion in new surveillance technology contracts, the highest in at least 18 years, according to The Washington Post.

These contracts are in addition to any privately owned surveillance networks to which ICE has access. Flock Safety, for example, has allowed ICE to access over 80,000 of its AI-powered license plate reader cameras installed nationwide, according to 404 Media. The expansive—and growing—mass surveillance camera network captures the license plate number, make, model, and any distinctive features of all passing vehicles, making it possible to track cars and, by extension, drivers, often without a warrant.

Although ICE has sold its surveillance campaign as necessary to locating and deporting undocumented immigrations, the Trump administration has signaled that the technologies will also be used on American citizens. In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of ICE, told Glenn Beck during an interview shortly after the executive order was signed that the agency would ""track the money,"" ""ringleaders,"" and ""professional agitators"" who are ""being brought in"" from outside the Chicago area to protest against immigration enforcement. But whether from Chicago or elsewhere, protester or ""domestic terrorist,"" constitutional rights and limitations still apply, although adherence by federal agencies is being questioned.

Critics of mass surveillance have long warned that intrusive technologies could be used to violate Americans' privacy rights. ""We don't know if law enforcement or ICE are getting search warrants to deploy this spyware,"" Maria Villegas Bravo, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the Post. ""It's also a First Amendment issue because your phone contains all your communications, all your expressions…it has your contact lists, it has your social media. Any political organizing people do,"" she continued, is ""typically on social media now, or over the phone.""

The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement. Since early October, the Justice Department has successfully pressured social media platforms, including Meta, Apple, and Google, to remove online groups and apps that share where ICE and other immigration agents have been sighted. Although private companies are not governed by the First Amendment and are free to set their own rules about acceptable speech, it is extremely concerning that the federal government would use its power and influence to blatantly interfere with Americans' otherwise protected free speech.

The courts and public are right to worry about the constitutional violations taking place in plain view by immigration agents during protests and enforcement operations, and officers must be held accountable. But those same actors must also be held responsible for the privacy violations that are less obvious and happening behind the scenes.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-22-25-v1-a-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 05:17:42.106429

The student, whose name was not released, had attended a routine immigration check-in at the Federal Building in Des Moines on Sept. 30, according to advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, and was detained by ICE officials at the building briefly before being taken to the Hardin County Jail in Eldora.

After being transferred to the Iowa jail, the student was later sent to a detention center in Louisiana before being deported to a Central American country, according to the advocacy group. Iowa MMJ did not respond to further questions about the student’s immigration status or background; though the Des Moines Register reported his guardian was not able to speak with him for four days following his detainment, and then did not hear from him until Oct. 12, when he had been deported.

DMPS officials said in a statement shared with media that the school district was “aware that one of our high school students was detained by federal immigration authorities late last month.”

“This situation did not occur on or near school property,” The statement said. “We understand that news like this can cause concern among our students, families, and staff. Our schools are committed to being safe, welcoming places for every student with principals, teachers and staff who care about their well-being.”

The news of the DMPS student’s deportation comes after the school district has faced the high-profile arrest of former superintendent Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana who was also arrested and detained by ICE officials in late September. Since his arrest, information has been released through reporting and federal authorities showing Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and faced previous criminal charges.

The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.
The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK.
The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations.
It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.","The first group of asylum seekers removed to France under the “one in, one out” scheme includes potential victims of modern slavery, people suffering severe depression and those with family in the UK, a new report has found.

Humans For Rights Network (HFRN) interviewed those returned after crossing the Channel in small boats in mid-October while they were staying in their initial accommodation – a marquee next to a railway track in Paris.

The research was announced after the Guardian revealed that an Iranian asylum seeker, who was sent to France last month, returned to the UK just 29 days later and is being held in an immigration detention centre.

He has been referred to the national referral mechanism to investigate a claim that he is a victim of trafficking. The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.

A charity that has maintained contact with some of those returned to France has said that more of them may attempt to return to the UK due to the reception conditions in France.

The UK-France “one in, one out” treaty, which came into force on 6 August, allows the UK to detain and rapidly remove people who enter via small boats. In return, the UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route, subject to security checks.

At the time of HFRN’s research, 24 people had been returned to France and they interviewed 12 of them.

At least three of them had relatives in the UK, including two people with sisters and one with an aunt. One man told the Guardian that he reunited with his sister in the UK for the first time in more than a decade when she visited him in a detention centre. But the contact was brief after he was removed to France shortly afterwards.

Four of the men claimed to be victims of modern slavery – two having experienced it in Libya, one in Ethiopia and one in Yemen. One man was blind in one eye while two others were suffering from severe depression and one experiencing suicidal ideation.

“Overwhelmingly these men were distressed and confused, some had no contact with their lawyer, while others were unsure about what their lawyers had done to make representations regarding these experiences,” the report said.

“HFRN considers that many of the men they engaged with have significant case facts indicating their removal should never have taken place.” The charity claimed accounts of torture from some of the men were not fully investigated by the Home Office before their removal to France.

The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK. The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations. It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, which supports immigration detainees, said: “We are hearing from people who have been removed to France that they have been given no guidance on how to claim asylum or access legal support there. The impact on people who are currently detained for France is causing further anxiety and confusion, as well as suicidal thoughts.

“People in France have reported that they cannot access medical care, do not understand what is happening in their case, and many are frightened of being harmed or found by smugglers. People tell us they may risk their lives again and undertake unsafe journeys through desperation.”

One asylum seeker, who is part of a group of 11 who have been moved from Paris to new accommodation in Marseille, told the Guardian: “We don’t know what is happening to us. I have been given an appointment with the French authorities for next Monday but nobody has told me what it is for.

“Many of us have been threatened with removal to other EU countries because we were previously fingerprinted in those countries. Some people are scared of this happening and have now left the accommodation and are sleeping on the streets.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those arriving in the UK on small boats illegally will now be detained and returned thanks to the deal. We make no apologies for cracking down on illegal migration and securing our borders, and we are ramping up the pilot. We continue to work closely with our French counterparts to ensure the pilot operates effectively.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3737deec96d645c992ac4ab535747595338c54aa/525_0_4000_3202/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c6ebccff595bbd4e145919856c82c72",N,,2025-10-24 01:57:00.325090

The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.
Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.
Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.","The Senate voted 54-45, short of the 60 votes needed to advance, against the effort that would have allowed active-duty military and some federal workers who aren’t furloughed to continue receiving paychecks during the shutdown.

Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., voted with Republicans to support the measure.

Following a more than 22-hour-long speech from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that began Tuesday night, the Senate voted 54-46 on Wednesday, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move the bill forward (no new Democrats crossed the aisle).

The bill failed again, receiving 50 “yes” votes and 43 “no” votes as seven senators did not vote.

The bill failed in a 51-45 vote, with four senators abstaining from voting and the same three members of the Democratic caucus—Fetterman, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine—voting with Republicans to advance the bill, while Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., again voted with all other Democrats against it.

A federal judge blocked firings the Trump administration has carried out during the shutdown for at least two more weeks, granting a request for a restraining order filed by federal employee unions.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said the Trump administration wants “to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering bureaucracy, not just the funding,” during an appearance on “The Charlie Kirk Show” broadcast from the White House, adding he wants to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within “the next two, three months,” alleging overburdensome regulations on financial institutions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the shutdown could cost the federal government $15 billion in output daily, warning it was beginning to “cut into muscle” of the U.S. government, he said while speaking at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum, calling on Democrats to “break away” and vote with Republicans to reopen the government.

The Senate voted 49-45 in favor of a Republican-backed bill to reopen the government, which needed 60 votes to clear the filibuster.

The White House budget office said in a post on X it will “continue the RIFs [reductions in force], and wait,” blaming “the Democrats’ intransigence” for the shutdown.

The Office of Management and Budget sent layoff notices to about 4,200 government workers Friday, with the steepest cuts hitting the Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services, though it rescinded some hours after announcing them, including hundreds at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Reuters reported Monday, citing an unnamed source familiar with the issue.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a press conference raised the alarm of the shutdown approaching record territory, warning that the country was “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.”

Kalshi’s forecast for the shutdown based on betting on its predictions market rose above 37 days, before falling slightly to 35.2—which would make it the longest government shutdown in history, breaking the record set during the first Trump administration in 2019 when a shutdown lasted 35 days.

The predictions market was offering 68% odds the shutdown will last more than 30 days and a 51% chance it will last more than 35.

Consumer sentiment was virtually unchanged from last month, dipping from 55.1 to 55, according to the University of Michigan, which reported that consumer surveys indicate the shutdown hasn’t impacted consumers’ views of the economy so far, while inflation and labor market prospects remain top concerns.

Kalshi forecasted a 28-day shutdown, with a 59% chance of it lasting more than 25 days, 50% odds it will last more than 30 days and 33% for more than 35 days. The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.

Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.

President Donald Trump said “we’ll be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only gonna cut Democrat programs,” in his latest threat to force Democrats to vote in favor of the Republican spending plan to reopen the government.

The Senate rejected the GOP-backed bill for a seventh time, in a 54-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to break filibuster, with no new Democratic votes supporting the legislation.

The Senate voted 54-45 for the Republican spending plan, failing to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass, and 52-47 against a Democratic proposal.

Johnson told reporters “I hope that the furloughed workers receive back pay, of course,” but acknowledged “there are some legal analysts who are saying that that may not be appropriate or necessary, in terms of the law requiring that back pay be provided.”

Johnson said he’s spoken to Trump about the issue, and the president agrees “he doesn’t want people to go without pay.”

Trump said “in four or five days” there will be “substantial” job cuts and “a lot of those jobs will never come back” if the shutdown continues, adding “we have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate.”

Federal workers might not receive back pay for days they have been furloughed, White House budget chief Russ Vought said in a memo, arguing a 2019 law that mandated back pay is invalid and that Congress must appropriate funds specifically for that purpose in order for employees to be paid, multiple outlets reported.

Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.

Republicans rejected a Democratic-backed measure that would have kept the government open and also funded subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, after a vote of 50-45 largely along party lines.

A second “clean” funding bill pushed by Republicans, which would have kept the government open until at least Nov. 21 under current spending levels, also failed after a 52-42 vote—falling short of the 60-vote threshold to overcome the filibuster in the Senate.

Speaking at Monday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the firings the Trump administration has threatened to enact as pressure on the opposition party.

When asked if the administration has started firing government employees, Leavitt said the Office of Management and Budget is “continuing to work with agencies on who unfortunately is going to have to be laid off if this shutdown continues.”

The Senate rejected a GOP-backed bill to avert a shutdown until at least Nov. 21 in a 54-44 vote—failing to reach the 60 votes required to advance—and also voted down the Democratic proposal.

Earlier Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Johnson told reporters they wouldn’t negotiate with Democrats on their demands to extend tax credits in the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold.

The September labor market report was put on hold as the Bureau of Labor Statistics is closed due to the shutdown.

Vought announced $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago infrastructure projects—extension of the Red line and modernization of the Red and Purple lines—was “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”

It’s the latest move by the White House targeting federal funding in a Democratic-led state as it seeks to pressure Senate Democrats to vote alongside Republicans for a new federal funding plan that would lift the shutdown.

Thune told reporters senators would not vote over the weekend on a funding plan to avert a shutdown, meaning it would likely last until at least Monday.

Trump doubled down on threats to punish Democrats for withholding their votes on legislation to avert a shutdown, announcing he would meet with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Vought said the Office of Management and Budget was canceling $8 billion in Biden-era energy projects “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in states won by Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, including Colorado, California, New Jersey and New York, though it’s unclear what projects specifically will be affected.

Vought also warned in a call with House Republicans on Wednesday other infrastructure projects in New York, home to Congress’ top Democratic leaders, are under review and said the government could begin permanent layoffs due to the shutdown in a matter of days, Politico reported, citing four anonymous sources.

The administration also halted $18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects—the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway—to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” Vought said, with the Department of Transportation warning a review of the funding could take longer due to the shutdown.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d6c32f1206fc8b2f99b507/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-24 02:56:40.668321

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws.
But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.
“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said.
“Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.","Environmental groups’ request that a federal court shutter the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center was paused Wednesday because of the government shutdown.

Led by the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, a coalition of activists had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its September decision to keep open the migrant detention center, located in the heart of the Everglades, despite environmental concerns.

But the court on Wednesday agreed with the Department of Homeland Security that the case should be paused until government attorneys can work again.

“The motion to stay the appeal is granted. The movant is directed to file a notice with the court when the purpose for the stay is obviated,” the two-sentence order reads.

Although this comes just weeks after the court expedited the appeal and scheduled oral arguments for January, the federal government’s shutdown on Sept. 30 set off a cascade of missed pay, furloughed workers, and in-limbo cases.

So, on Oct. 10, government attorneys, noting that many Justice Department lawyers are banned from working until the government comes online again, asked for a pause on the case until “DOJ attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions.”

How did we get here?

The state created the sprawling, 3,000-bed facility atop the seldom-used Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Big Cypress National Park, drawing scrutiny from Democrats, immigration groups, and environmental organizations since its July 1 opening.

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws. A district judge agreed, ordering Florida to shut down the center by September’s end. But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.

A week later, DHS and Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie revealed that Florida had applied for federal reimbursement — though Friends of the Everglades believes the request was made earlier. On Sept. 30, the state received more than $608 million to pay for the construction, transportation, and equipment costs of the facility

The plaintiffs soon after appealed, asking the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider. When DHS pointed out that some government staff couldn’t work during the shutdown, Friends of the Everglades called the situation “regrettable” but argued it didn’t outweigh the environment “harms” caused by dragging out the case.

“An indefinite stay in this case … would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm where the federal action being challenged — the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Everglades that imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area — would continue during the indefinite stay period,” the attorneys wrote.

When the Eleventh Circuit released its order against them, Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, put out a statement calling the move a ruse to avoid accountability.

“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said. “Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.

“We’re more resolved than ever to keep fighting to restore the lower court’s injunction to protect the Everglades.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54627147996_e1b101abe3_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:22:51.336565

The ICE facility has been the site of ongoing protests denouncing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in Portland.

As of Monday, the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) is operating out of a previously vacant unit of the Gray’s Landing building, which is also home to low-income housing.

PIRC is a nonprofit that works with immigrants and immigrant families to provide education and support, including resources to people with appointments at the ICE field office.

Joseph Grayson, a Portland resident and frequent protester outside of the ICE facility, told KATU it's a no-brainer for PIRC to operate right next door.

""It's awesome, especially for the people that's going through the immigration process,"" Grayson said. I think that would give them a little more solace, a little more security; knowing that someone is here to fight for them other than just their family; somebody with a voice that might know the legal system.""

In a letter written to Gray’s Landing residents on Monday, Margaret Salazar, CEO of REACH Community Development, which owns the building, wrote in part, “Starting this Monday, an organization called Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) will be operating out of a previously vacant commercial space in the Gray’s Landing building.”

According to Jaymee Cuti, spokesperson with the city of Portland, the city of Portland-initiated conversations between PIRC and REACH Community Development two weeks ago, writing, “The City of Portland proudly supports immigrants pursuing citizenship – and ensuring fair treatment for anybody interacting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Lauren Schmidt, REACH Fundraising & Public Relations Manager, told KATU their partnership with the city “ensures that PIRC can operate in a secure, designated space while maintaining the safety, privacy, and comfort of Gray’s Landing residents.

Long-time resident of Gray’s Landing Susan Dooley says she doesn’t mind the move and says she understands the location is ideal for the organization’s purpose.

“I think it’s probably a good idea, because if they have to go over there [to the ICE facility], it’s right across the street; they don’t have to go very far,” Dooley said. “It doesn’t bother me. They’re gonna have to have it somewhere.”

Other tenants are not so keen on the idea, concerned that it will bring even more conflicts amid ongoing protests in the area.

Gray’s Landing residents, including Dooley, say they did not receive a notice until the move was finalized, and told KATU they wish they had a say in the matter.

According to Schmidt, the collaboration with the city of Portland and PIRC “is part of REACH’s broader commitment to supporting community stability and minimizing disruption around the building due to its close proximity to the ICE facility.”

Residents of Gray’s Landing have continuously voiced their concerns with the noise and chemicals around the ICE facility.

Dooley told KATU the use of tear gas by federal agents is interfering with her ability to breathe.

“For the last few weeks, I have been extremely disoriented, and I actually have fallen three times in my apartment the last few weeks,” Dooley said. “I just feel very weak and extremely tired all the time.”

In the letter, Salazar also acknowledged the activity around the facility and said REACH is advocating for city support to help clean sidewalks as chemical munitions are continuing to be deployed on a weekly basis.

“REACH has purchased in-unit air purifiers, which will be arriving in multiple shipments beginning next week and continuing through the end of the month,” Salazar wrote to residents. “We wanted to bring these to you sooner, but delivery times were lengthier than we had hoped.”

Gray's Landing resident Lashawnda Shavers said she has lost trust in management and said this comes after she says she has been reaching out for help for months.

""You're out here tap dancing that you're doing something because you care about the community, residents, and immigrants, but no you haven't,"" Shavers said about REACH. ""I emailed in June about support for me and the other residents, and I was told to contact local authorities.""

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.
Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.
Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.
“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home.","Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced on Thursday she had granted a pardon request for Lue Yang, a Hmong refugee and president of the Hmong Family Association of Lansing who was detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in July over a decades-old criminal conviction.

Yang was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, and came to the U.S. in 1979 as his parents fled Laos due to war and persecution for their support of the United States during the Vietnam War. In 1997, Yang was convicted on a home burglary charge, accepting a plea bargain and served a 10-month sentence.

In 2018, Yang’s conviction was expunged, however, the federal government does not recognize the expungement. Yang’s conviction complicated his immigration status, and he has been denied while applying for citizenship, State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), explained in a video advocating for Yang’s release. On July 15, Yang was detained by ICE while at work, and he has remained in custody since.

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.

Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.

Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.

However, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, which has been working with Yang’s attorney, told the Michigan Advance that, to the best of their knowledge, Yang remains in the U.S., noting that the lack of transparency from ICE leaves family members lawyers and advocates to cobble together his location.

Xiong, who was also a Hmong refugee, has strongly advocated for Yang’s return. Xiong said she was extremely grateful for the pardon, noting that his family is still facing difficulties in navigating the legal system to have him released.

“I’m grateful for that pardon from the Governor, because that means that [Yang] will have an opportunity to fight for his release, yes, but we can only do that if he is still on U.S. soil or in U.S. air,” Xiong said.

Yang’s attorney is working to vacate his case through the county court system, Xiong said.

Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, cheered the decision in a statement while addressing the urgent action to keep Yang in the U.S.

“My family and I need Lue to return home where he belongs. This pardon shows the power of humanity and community,” Ann Vue, Yang’s wife said in a statement. “So many people stood with us, checked in on us, and refused to allow us to give up. We applaud and thank Governor Whitmer for her courage in granting Lue this pardon. Now we demand ICE and [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] to bring Lue home to Michigan.”

On Thursday morning, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) spoke out on the Senate floor about the deportation of several Hmong and Lao men, sharing the story of Khone Segmany, who like Yang, committed a low-level offense as a young man, as well as another man named Khamsay.

“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home. They are members of our community, they are fathers, and their families deserve to have them by their side,” Chang said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_20251023_183750.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:17:09.857126

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters.

But what exactly a federal surge in Berkeley, Oakland or other cities would look like is anyone’s guess.

Facing a packed conference room in Oakland City Hall, Mayor Barbara Lee acknowledged she has “no information we can bring to you today” about the federal administration’s plans.

“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” Lee said. “We know border patrol agents are being stationed on the Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, we are fully prepared.”

Trump posted on Truth Social that he decided to call off a planned immigration enforcement campaign in San Francisco this Saturday after having a phone call last night with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who expressed concern that it would harm the city’s economic recovery.

However, Trump did not say whether Customs and Border Patrol intends to deploy agents elsewhere in the Bay Area. Sources told Cityside that deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility.

Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, said her organization — which provides legal and social services, and leads know-your-rights trainings — is preparing for the possibility that federal authorities will launch operations on this side of the bay.

The advocacy group is encouraging those who could be at risk of deportation to stay home as much as they can.

In an email alert Wednesday, it advised that schools and hospitals are “generally safe,” but specifically recommended people avoid “Home Depots, the flea market and other high-traffic community spaces.” Hoffman said the advice was based on “what we’ve heard and also what we’ve seen in other cities,” where Home Depot stores have been targeted by immigration authorities.

“For those who have more protected legal status, we need to be standing up for those who may not have as much protection in this moment and offering help,” she said, which might include making trips to grocery stores or schools for neighbors who are undocumented.

“This is the time for us to be showing up for each other,” Hoffman said.

The “confusing and inconsistent” messages about the operation has added to the anxiety that both clients and staff feel at Oasis Legal Services, a nonprofit that supports LGBTQ+ immigrants, spokesperson Mateo Sánchez said. The organization is offering to meet with clients virtually or by phone, rather than having them come into its Berkeley office, Sánchez said, and has given staff the option of working from home in the coming days and weeks. That plan did not change in light of Trump’s announcement Wednesday morning.

“ICE is still around,” Sánchez said. “We don’t know what it means for the Bay Area more widely.”

Officials encourage peaceful protests

Lee and other elected officials, union representatives, and faith leaders encouraged residents to look out for one another and to peacefully protest the administration. But officials also warned people not to “take the bait” by committing any acts of violence against federal officers.

“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. “So I’m not going to be quiet about what we know is coming. We know that their expectation is that Oakland is going to do something to cause them to make us the example.”

Earlier this morning, hundreds of protesters gathered near a road that leads to an island in the Oakland estuary that houses Coast Guard facilities, where CBP agents were reported to be arriving. Demonstrators who attempted to block the road were forced to disperse after agents deployed two flash bangs so several CBP vehicles could get through.

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters. But there are limits to that non-cooperation. Dickson noted that her office can’t stand in the way of a legal warrant. Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.

“I want to make it clear that if anyone attempts to enter your house or detain you, and they’re not in uniform or they don’t show credentials, please call 911 immediately,” Beere said.

Congresswoman Lateefah Simon said her office will protect members of the community, including children, families, officers, and protesters.

Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.

In her State of the City speech Wednesday night, Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii told an audience of supporters, “The moment that we’ve been preparing for as a city has arrived.”

Ishii echoed calls for people to express their opposition to the federal action peacefully.

“The feds are looking to make an example of us — they want a reason to send the National Guard here,” she said. “We want to circumvent them. When we protest, we must protest like we always do: peacefully and with intention.”

Ramped up efforts to defend against deportations

Several officials summarized efforts they’re taking to bolster the region’s defenses against federal incursions. Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services. The board also recently agreed to create an office focused on immigrant affairs to coordinate services throughout the county.

Lourdes Martinez, directing attorney of the immigrant rights practice at Centro Legal De La Raza, said ICE has already been operating in Alameda County. Her group, which runs a pro bono immigrant legal defense program, is anticipating an escalation, similar to what’s been seen in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland.

“If there has been deployment of federal law enforcement, it has really strengthened ICE and their ability to execute more detentions,” Martinez said. “So that is what we’re bracing for.”

The county also revived this year a rapid response hotline, which residents can use to call in reports of ICE activity. Martinez encouraged people to call the line instead of spreading unverified reports on other platforms. She also shared practical advice for immigrants, including that people should memorize important phone numbers and gather and keep safe documents like passports and medical records. She also recommended that people use PIN passcodes on their phones and consider disabling fingerprint or facial recognition on their cellphones.

“Just remember we are living under difficult times where ICE is allowed to racially profile,” she said.

Mike McBride, pastor of the Berkeley church The Way, advised young people to “not get caught up” engaging with federal officers, and to carry IDs and attend know-your-rights trainings.

“We will outlast this wickedness in high places, Oakland will counter hate, lies, and misinformation with love for all people,” McBride said. “Truth, justice, peace and joy. And we beg the Congress, please release the Epstein files.”",https://newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7741-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 23:56:25.713997

The moratorium’s purpose is to ensure landscapers’ safety and mitigate confusion regarding reporting of an ordinance violation by community members, according to the city’s website.

“We put a moratorium on enforcement of our leaf blower ordinance, and this is after (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) covered landscapers in Evanston just yesterday, and we received numerous requests from the community and from councilmembers to pause enforcement during this time,” Chief Legislative Policy Advisor Liza Roberson-Young said at the city’s Community Preparedness & Empowerment Seminar on Wednesday night.

Roberson-Young confirmed at the event that ICE targeted a landscaper in Evanston Tuesday.

Early Wednesday morning, an entire landscaping team was detained by ICE agents near the intersection of Waukegan Road and Church Street in Morton Grove, a Chicago suburb west of Evanston, according to an Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights alert sent around 11:18 a.m.

The moratorium is one of the efforts the city has taken to protect residents against federal agents. Since the beginning of the year, the city has strengthened its Welcoming City ordinance and more recently, City Council voted to establish “ICE free zones” on city property.

The leaf blower ordinance was adopted by the City Council in 2021, banning the use of gasoline or propane-powered leaf blowers after April 1, 2023.

Previously, violations of the ordinance with a signed witness statement and detailed description of the violation taking place were to be submitted to the city during business hours or to the Evanston Police Department’s non-emergency line outside of business hours. Violators received written warnings for first offenses and then increasing fines for further violations.

This will not be enforced under the temporary moratorium, which is effective through Dec. 31.

On Oct. 14, Oak Park also issued temporary changes to the enforcement of its own ban on gasoline-powered leaf blowers in reaction to heightened activity of federal agents in the area. Tickets for the use of these leaf blowers will only be issued to property owners in the village, rather than contractors.

Nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Republicans, the facility has been a source of controversy.

What we know:

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from the Trump administration to halt proceedings while the shutdown continues.

The lawsuit, filed by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — later joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida — challenges the facility’s operation on environmental grounds. The plaintiffs argue that federal law requires an environmental impact review before projects like the detention center can proceed.

In August, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered that operations at the facility be wound down. However, in September, a three-judge appellate panel stayed that order while the federal government appealed.

What we don't know:

It remains unclear when the case will resume, as the duration of the shutdown will determine when Department of Justice attorneys can return to work. The long-term future of the detention center is also uncertain.

The backstory:

The detention center has been a flashpoint in Florida’s immigration and environmental debates. Environmental advocates say it sits within sensitive Everglades habitat and was constructed without the legally required environmental assessments.

The case has drawn attention from both immigration attorneys and state watchdog groups. Separate lawsuits have been filed on behalf of detainees claiming inadequate legal access, and Friends of the Everglades has accused the state of withholding public records about the facility’s funding and management.

At the event, organized by the nonprofit Children’s Rights, panelists spoke on a variety of issues, including U.S. immigration policies, zero-tolerance school discipline and the harm caused by racial inequities in the foster care system.

A second panel discussion featured child welfare advocates, parents and former foster youth who spoke out against family separation and injustice perpetuated by child maltreatment investigations.

Panelists came together in response to what they view as a concerning pullback of U.S. participation in the protection of human rights on a global stage. In August, the federal government announced it would withdraw from the Universal Periodic Review — a nearly two-decade old program created by the U.N.’s Human Rights Council (HRC) that calls for a peer review of human rights records for all 193 member states.

According to Reuters, a U.S. state department official said participating in the review would imply endorsement of the council’s “persistent failure to condemn the most egregious human rights violators” and that the U.S. would not be “lectured about our human rights record by the likes of HRC members such as Venezuela, China, or Sudan.”

Global advocates denounced the U.S. decision to back out of the review, which occurs roughly every five years. Reports are reviewed by other members who offer non-binding recommendations. The U.S. was due to submit its report this November but has until July 2027.

Youth advocates consider the decision a signal of federal officials’ increasing apathy about the futures of vulnerable young people.

“They know that this is a review that will highlight the violations that are happening daily,” Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Human Rights Program, said about the federal government.

Dakwar serves on a prominent New York based civil rights panel that advises the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The group released a first-of-its-kind report last year demonstrating persistent discriminatory treatment of Black families in the state’s child welfare system, and asked Congress to implement certain changes.

Panelists came together Wednesday to demonstrate their unwillingness to allow these issues to be ignored, despite the government “doing everything in its power to circumvent accountability,” activist Joyce McMillan said.

“We have to hold them accountable and bring the human rights recommendations to them and push for the changes, whether to change the laws as they stand, abolish some of those laws that are really harmful and to enact ones that are consistent with international human rights law,” Dakwar added.

Domestic injustice also addressed

Although the global role of the U.S. prompted the gathering, domestic concerns drove the discussions.

Former foster youth on one panel described a culture of loneliness, abuse, and lack of mental healthcare access in foster care.

“Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

— Activist Tatiana Rodriguez

Youth advocate Jasiyah Gilbert, 24, spoke about the trauma he endured when he was separated from his family and placed in a group home. His mother struggled with housing and mental health issues, which the child welfare agency classified as neglect.

“It was a very carceral, jail-like environment where they’re told when to eat, when to use the bathroom,” Gilbert said of his and other foster youth’s experiences in congregate care settings. “Often, their education is sacrificed.”

Foster children frequently run away and end up homeless after being separated, he added. Solutions to the problem should focus on strengthening families by providing housing vouchers, cash assistance and other community services, he said.

Activists April Lee from Philadelphia and Tatiana Rodriguez of Massachusetts emphasized the importance of sharing parental perspectives regarding CPS investigations and foster care with policy makers.

“I also survived the system as a third generation foster youth and a parent being investigated, and I eventually lost my son,” Rodriguez shared. “Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

Panelist and attorney David Shalleck-Klein called the harms caused by the child welfare system “one of the most important civil rights issues of our time,” and pointed to a history of “illegal” practices by child welfare agencies in New York. Last year, he was part of a team that filed a class-action lawsuit defending the rights of parents under a child maltreatment investigation.

It’s easy for attorneys to identify that Fourth Amendment rights are violated when government agents enter homes without court orders, Shalleck-Klein said, or when “children are torn from parents” without judicial oversight.

“The hard part,’’ he said, “is understanding: How do we use the tools that we have as advocates to end up at a place where that stops happening?”",https://imprintnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitednations.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:00:46.185599

6:30 p.m. — Day 1 rally at Embarcadero, “We cannot claim victory yet”

Despite the “surge” of federal troops being called off, a crowd began to gather at Embarcadero Plaza on Wednesday evening bearing signs declaring “No Kings” and “No ICE or troops in the Bay.”

As the plaza filled with people, the event kicked off with local singer La Doña and a spiritual ceremony from the Danzantes del Bahia. Inside the plexiglass enclosure of the plaza’s temporary padelball court, a few muscular men in short shorts bounced around the astroturf, seemingly oblivious to (or unconcerned by) the goings-on.

“Whose head is spinning from all the news in the last 48 hours?” shouted one speaker. But, she said, “we cannot claim victory yet.” Protesters were encouraged to “adopt a corner” and look out for ICE activity.

“You should be proud of this,” added labor organizer David Huerta. You’ve kept ICE out of San Francisco.”

“But they’re still in Memphis, they’re still in D.C.” he reminded the growing crowd. “We need to continue to stand together.”

Some speeches at the 5pm rally mirrored closely those given at the noon rally, but District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder escalated her language from earlier: “While I’m here, I’ll just say. Fuck Marc Benioff. Fuck Elon Musk. Fuck David Sacks. Any anyone who ever suggested that this was okay.”

Fielder urged attendees to stay vigilant, noting that there was no guarantee that President Donald Trump could change course and send federal agents into the city any time.

District 5 Supervisor Bilal Mahmood condemned the current administration as a “dictatorship” that he compared to the one he lived under in Pakistan as a teenager. Toppling that dictatorship required people in the streets everyday, he said: “When a dictator sees that the people oppose him, he loses his power.”

“So many students didn’t show up in school today,” added Supervisor Chyanne Chen. “We don’t want them in our schools, in our hospitals … San Francisco is a sanctuary city. We will never back down. We will never leave anyone behind.”

Just before 6:30 p.m., organizers prepared the crowd, which now numbered at least a thousand, for a march to the Sansome Street immigration court. Vigils at public libraries tomorrow would continue as planned, they said.

“We didn’t see the invasion that we were worried about,” said Jane, an organizer with Bay Resistance, her voice trembling with emotion as she spoke. “What we did see today, is that the Bay is ready.” And with that, the crowd was on the march.

4 p.m. — An email to city employees on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols”

San Francisco city employees were sent an update on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols” via email on Thursday afternoon.

Employees were reminded that federal law prohibits the City from interfering with federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement. They may not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from accessing a public area of a city building or transit, said an email reviewed by Mission Local.

At the same time, city and state sanctuary policies prohibit employees from participating in immigration enforcement by giving ICE agents access to non-public buildings or records. Employees must only cooperate if there is a subpoena or warrant issued by a federal court.

They are also not required to show ICE agents personal identification or answer agents’ questions, the email added.

3 p.m. — City announces plan to dedicate $3.4 million more for immigrant legal defense and Rapid Response Network

Hours after President Trump withdrew a threat to send a “surge” of federal agents to San Francisco,” Supervisor Connie Chan announced that San Francisco would direct an additional $3.5 million to immigrant legal defense and the Rapid Response Network.”

The legal defense funds lawyers for immigrants who need representation, and the Rapid Response Network provides a 24 hour hotline for verifying ICE raids and connecting detained immigrants to attorneys.

Chan, the chair of the city’s Budget Committee, made the announcement alongside her co-sponsors Supervisors Bilal Mahmood, Chyanne Chen, Jackie Fielder and Shamann Walton.

“Despite this morning’s news, we know federal agents have been in San Francisco already. For months, we’ve seen how those attempting to follow our legal process abiding by the law at immigration centers are detained during routine check-ins,” Mahmood said.

2:55 p.m. — I told the mayor, “I love what you’re doing,” Trump says

As reported by the New York Times, President Trump spoke highly of Mayor Daniel Lurie at a White House round table. “I love what you’re doing,” he said to the Mayor. The comment comes following a phone call between Trump and Lurie, where Trump stated he would reverse his decision to deploy federal agents in San Francisco, including a planned “surge” in agents on Saturday. It is unclear how surrounding cities in the Bay Area will be affected.

District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder wrote: “I remain concerned that the Mayor’s statement today included that he would ’welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and the U.S. Attorney,’” in response to a previous announcement by Lurie.

At a press conference on Thursday, Fielder said she has “concerns that any federal agency under Trump is actually taking up immigration enforcement,” in response to Lurie potentially working with Pam Bondi and the FBI.

“We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say, I welcome this, but I don’t welcome that,” District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton added.

12:40 p.m. — Trump’s conversation with Mayor Lurie answers some questions, raises others

At noon, Mayor Daniel Lurie, city department heads,and supervisors gathered in the mayor’s office to address President Donald Trump’s decision to call off the “surge” of San Francisco.

What exactly that “surge” would look like did not seem to have been defined over the course of Lurie’s conversation with Trump.

Lurie did not give answers to which federal agents would no longer be coming to the city — whether it be the National Guard, the border patrol agents, ICE — or all of them.

Lurie also said that his conversation did not include what will happen to other Bay Area cities.

“I was told the surge was being called off,” Lurie said. “He only spoke about San Francisco. So all I can say is what he told me.”

In addition to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Lurie said he has also spoken with United States Attorney General Pam Bondi about working together to “hold drug traffickers accountable.”

In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he called Lurie after speaking with Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO — who on Oct. 9 called for the National Guard to come to San Francisco — and Jensen Huang, the president and CEO of NVIDIA.

Lurie said that he had not asked anyone to make calls on San Francisco’s behalf — “he picked up the phone and called me.”

Lurie affirmed that even with the “surge” called off for now, San Francisco will remain ready.

“I think we as a city should be prepared for any scenario,” Lurie said.

12:20 p.m. — Oakland mayor unsure if The Town is still a target

Oakland mayor Barbara Lee tells Mission Local that the situation is “fluid” and “all we know is what the press is reporting.” She confirms that “I haven’t heard from the president.”

Following a briefing from Lurie’s office, area politicians believe that the area will return for whatever passes as the “status quo.” There is no indication feds will instead raid nearby Bay Area cities. But there is no assurance that it won’t happen.

Meanwhile, Immigration enforcement activity has risen sharply in Oakland, according to Alameda County’s Rapid Response Network (ACILEP). It reported that its call volume increased from an average of 10 calls a day to 50 by 11:30 a.m.

Neither the Asian Law Caucus nor the Rapid Response networks in San Francisco or San Mateo County could confirm whether the cancellation of a federal deployment in San Francisco also included a stand-down of planned immigration operations in the region.

“No one knows for sure right now” whether Trump’s immigration enforcement will escalate across the Bay Area, said Lauren Nguyen of the Asian Law Caucus said.

12.01 p.m. — Despite news that the president has called off federal agents from entering San Francisco, at least 100 protesters gathered at City Hall for a rally at noon.

One man, Noah, came all the way from Sacramento, where he has been protesting daily outside an ICE facility where he believes people are being detained.

He said he wasn’t affiliated with an organization, and it has been just “me myself and I, and a couple of friends that are passionate about human rights.”

“If there was ever a time for us to be unified in San Francisco, it is now,” said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who started off the rally on the steps of City Hall. “We do not trust this administration. To say you’re not coming after you say you’re coming… we want to make sure our community is prepared.”

Rally emcee Sofia Bastida asked those gathered about the purported change in plans for ICE to enter San Francisco: “How are we feeling about that?”

Attendees hiss in response.

Supervisor Jackie Fielder accused tech billionaires like Marc Benioff, Elon Musk, and David Sacks of bringing about the current situation.

“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” Fielder said. “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put this idea into Trump’s head.”

“We cannot have tunnel vision,” said Olga Miranda, the head of the Local 87 labor union. She urged unity across the Bay Area. “An injury to one, an injury to all.”

As cars and trucks drove past City Hall, drivers honked in solidarity.

Those present were attentive and ready for action. Asked to repeat the rapid response network phone number, most in the crowd appeared to already know it and chanted the number in unison. (For those in San Francisco, the number is 415-200-1548.)

Celi Tamayo-Lee of SF Rising assured the crowd that the fight would continue and that the 5 p.m. mass rally to unite the region is still on.

That, she said, “is where we really show what we are about in the Bay Area.”

10:00 a.m. — Plans to deploy federal officers in San Francisco have been called off, according to a statement from Mayor Daniel Lurie.

Lurie wrote that he received a phone call from President Donald Trump last night, though he waited to release the statement till 9:30 a.m. this morning. What arrangements preceded that call are not known.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning,” he wrote.

“My team will continue to monitor the situation closely, and our city remains prepared for any scenario.”

Shortly thereafter, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying “we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.” He attributed this decision to “friends of mine who live in the area,” naming Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. His post ended: “Stay tuned!”

Advocates say the change only affects the potential National Guard or military deployment, not ICE or Customs and Border Patrol operations.

Border patrol agents already have federal authority to operate in any U.S. city, while National Guard troops generally require legal authorization for domestic use, though those limits have weakened under Trump-appointed judges.

The fate of other Bay Area cities was not mentioned. Mission Local‘s message for Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee has not yet been returned.

Protesters march outside Coast Guard Island

2:15 p.m. — Two protestors arrested by California Highway Patrol

Over 60 California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear marched in on protesters. Using batons, they pushed protestors off the street to make a tunnel for a caravan of vehicles to exit the base. Two protesters were arrested and walked off with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. One man, who resisted being moved, was grabbed by CHP officers and subdued to the ground with an elbow to the neck.

10:03 a.m. — Trump says federal agents “will not surge” S.F.

President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that after a phone call with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie last night, the federal government “will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”

The post follows days of uncertainty and online rumors that Trump was planning a mass raid at a Home Depot within 40 miles of San Francisco this weekend.

Trump wrote that “friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge” because Lurie was making “substantial progress” on crime. He added that business leaders, including Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff, had contacted him to express optimism about the city’s recovery.

Still, organizers and advocates are urging caution, noting that Trump’s statement does not necessarily rule out immigration enforcement or other federal activity in the region. They emphasize that people in surrounding cities should stay alert and prepared in case the situation changes.

9:45 a.m. — Alameda Fire Department outside Coast Guard Island

A fire truck and two other Alameda Fire Department vehicles arrive at the intersection of Dennison Street and Embarcadero. They’re met with protesters.

Officers say they’ve arrived to take someone who was injured on the island to the hospital. Soon after, a man who was not involved in the protest is wheeled through the crowd on a stretcher.

The size of the crowd dwindles, but at 11 a.m. protesters are still circling the intersection. What appears to be pieces of a white vehicle and a flash grenade canister still litter the road, on both sides of the U.S. government property line.

9:30 a.m. — Lurie says Trump “calling off” plans for federal deployment

Plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco have been called off, according to a statement from Mayor Daniel Lurie released at 9:30 a.m. today.

— Kelly Waldron, Mission Local

9:20 a.m. — In the Mission, some workers stay home, others taking the risk

In the Mission District, many Latino-owned businesses are shuttered. Despite widespread fear, some street vendors continue to sell, and a few stores remain open.

“Since yesterday, there are fewer people out,” said street vendor María V. “They’re very scared.”

María said she’s part of several neighborhood groups keeping watch for any potential presence of federal agents. Some workers who spoke to El Tecolote anonymously said they were required to come into work, but hoped their employers would soon decide to close.

— Erika Carlos, Tecolote

9 a.m. — Protesters singing

As the sun rises, the mood shifts from a standoff in the dark to skipping in the streets; literally, there’s a jump rope. Parents have brought their children. The crowd thins out slightly.

One protester wears a Stewie Griffin mask, another an inflatable chicken suit with a sign that says “Why did the chicken cross the road?” Faith leaders sing “We Shall Overcome” while a clown makes balloon animals.

— Abigail Vân Neely and Mariana Garcia, Mission Local

7:30 a.m. — Vehicle injures protester

The scene is less tense, but even more crowded, with at least 100 people.

Protesters continue to move back and forth along the crosswalk dividing the road to Coast Guard Island, but their numbers have grown, and the pace has slowed to a shuffle.

The road is now impassable. There is a line of cars backed up along Embarcadero East.

One protester, Matthew Leber, 50, limps away from the crosswalk. He says he was struck by the driver of a SUV, who refused to immediately back up when the crowd blocked the road.

“I’m still taking it in. I feel okay. I feel really proud of people standing up here against fascism,” he says. He sits on the curb and props up his leg, which is red.

Leaders reorganize the crowd to keep people moving around four crosswalks at the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. Observers with the National Lawyers’ Guild take notes to send to attorneys, if needed.

7:15 a.m. — Crowd blocks Border Patrol vehicles, flash grenades deployed

Protestors block a large white vehicle attempting to drive down the one road onto Coast Guard Island, despite organizers’ instructions to keep walking.

An officer gets between the vehicle and the crowd. Other cars start honking. Protesters are told to stay back from the blue paint designating U.S. government property beyond the crosswalk.

Two flash grenades are set off by Border Patrol as pickup trucks carrying a handful of federal agents drive through the crowd and across the bridge.

Protesters who were near the flash grenades, which can cause temporary blindness or deafness, step back to pour water over their faces. A faith leader is covered in debris from the smoke cloud the flash grenades emitted.

U.S. Coast Guard officers form a line opposite the demonstration.

6:30 a.m. — ‘We have to say no’

A couple dozen protesters are standing on either side of the one road leading into Coast Guard Island in Alameda, where federal immigration agents are set to arrive today.

Two U.S. Coast Guard officers are conducting traffic. A white shuttle bus has been let through, along with other cars driven by people who work on the island. There is a checkpoint further down the bridge.

An organizer is reminding protesters to keep moving: if they stand still in the crosswalk across the bridge, the organizer says, it will be considered an “obstruction.” It is still dark.

The organizer says law enforcement has instructed cars to keep driving as pedestrians continue walking back and forth. They play “Antipatriarcha,” a Spanish protest song by Ana Tijoux, on a speaker, and try to address the Coast Guard officers, who do not engage.

“ICE is on the island,” repeats a man who has been standing in the center of the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. for at least the last half hour. “We have to say no.”

The stream of people repeatedly crossing the road grows. One carries a small dog, called Rudy, short for Rutabaga. Rudy was brought to the protest because “he hates ICE,” his owner said. “He loves all his neighbors and he doesn’t want to lose any.”

Faith leaders begin to sing “We Shall Not Be Moved.”

“So much has been done in this administration under the name of God or some twisted version of Christianity,” said Reverend Penny Nixon with the Peninsula Solidarity Cohort. “In the Christian religion it is very clear everyone is our neighbor.”

Earlier in the day:

News of federal immigration agents coming to the Bay Area confirmed San Francisco officials’ worst fears. Though attention was recently focused on the possibility of the National Guard being sent in, those troops are heavily proscribed in their actions. Immigration agents are not.

More protests were planned for Thursday in San Francisco: The group Bay Resistance called for a “Hands Off the Bay” rally at 5 p.m. at the Embarcadero.

City officials rushed into action on Wednesday. Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a press conference that “Immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don’t feel safe going about their daily lives.” He signed an executive directive reminding city workers that they cannot, in most cases, participate in immigration enforcement.

Mission residents on Wednesday reacted with a range of emotions to the news: shrugs, fear, and support. Many said they are carrying their papers, just in case.

El Tecolote and Mission Local have put together resource guides for those wondering how to protect themselves.

Mission Local and El Tecolote are teaming up to provide a live blog for up-to-date developments in federal immigration agents’ deployment to the Bay Area.

9:55 a.m. — At a food bank in the Mission

Claudia woke up to news of the arrival of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Coast Guard base in Alameda. “The volunteers are fearful right now, “ she said in Spanish. She stood outside of La Ofrenda, a community space that offers free groceries to San Francisco residents. Behind her, about four other volunteers unpacked cardboard boxes of food.

“I feel bad that right now ICE is detaining anyone irrespective of if they have documents or not,” she continued. “They will detain you if you speak Spanish and look Latino or are brown.”

Roberto Eligió Alfaro, executive director of the non-profit Homey S.F., which supports Ofrenda, said that they now serve 200 families, but fear of ICE is keeping some home. Since the start of last month, Alfaro and José Luis Pavón have also helped operate Defensa Del Barrio, a patrol that visits neighbors in the Mission to inform them of their rights if they encounter ICE. They’ve met with about 50 businesses as well as a hundred families. “We cannot bow down to fear,” said Pavón in Spanish. “That is what Trump wants.”

Over on the 14 Muni, a woman from Daly City said in Spanish, “Truthfully, I’m not fearful about this. I’m OK.”

Others expressed worry over the news. An elderly man named Terry said he was worried that if President Trump cuts EBT and other resources he relies on, he and his neighbors could “end up on the streets.”

“If they’re coming to intimidate and toughen us up, I’ve got a problem with that,” Terry said, of CBPs arrival. “I know a lot of people that I haven’t seen lately, and I think they know that ICE is coming and that they’ve gone underground.” He added, “It makes me feel bad; it’s them, but it could be me next.”

“The world is messed up, period,” added Douglas, another man. “It’s going to take a while to fix it.”

6:30 a.m. — Immigrants carry passports ahead of potential crackdown

Last night, residents in the Mission District reacted to the planned deployment with emotions ranging from fear to calm.

More are carrying documents to prove citizenship, and at least one thought it was a good idea to send in federal agents. Many were still unaware that the president’s threats to deploy troops had escalated, with agents set to land at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda on Thursday.

Those in the know largely remained calm.

“I’m good. I’m okay. I have papers, I have my license. I work here every day,” said Luis Ledesma who runs a jewelry stall near 22nd Street. He said he usually carries a copy of his documents with him, though he forgot to bring them today.

Others also said they are carrying their documents, believing that having proof of their status was the best way to prevent harm when faced with federal immigration agents. That hasn’t always been the case.

Originally from Nicaragua, Myriai Evarra, 59, and her cousin Chalina Mena, 62, have been carrying their passports and Real IDs with them everywhere for the last year, “just in case.” On Wednesday evening they were engaged in a spirited debate at the 24th Street Mission BART Plaza.

Evarra argued that federal agents should come to San Francisco to “clean up the drugs.” Mena disagreed.

When Mena insisted that immigration agents will not be involved in drug-related enforcement, Evarra insisted that “they will at least do something.”

The federal agents are “not going to fix fentanyl or the drugs. That’s an excuse to go after immigrants. I am angry because they are going to get very violent with people,” said Mena. When asked if she was afraid, she said she was more “uncomfortable” than afraid.

6 a.m. — How to prepare for immigration enforcement

Consulting with attorneys and immigration advocates, Mission Local has compiled a list of know-your-rights tips for people in San Francisco.

For protesters:

If you plan to participate in a protest, have a plan to contact legal assistance, such as the National Lawyers Guild’s S.F. Bay Area chapter.

You have the right to peacefully assemble and to record law enforcement officers in public spaces.

If stopped by law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and don’t have to answer questions about your immigration status.

If you are stopped on the streets:

You must stay where you are until an officer tells you that you are free to go.

You don’t have to unlock your phone for any government officer who does not have a warrant.

For immigrants and their families:

When encountering law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and are advised to refuse to answer questions about your birthplace, immigration status, or how you entered the country.

You have the right to refuse a search, and to prevent immigration enforcement agents from entering your home or workplace without a valid warrant signed by a judge.

You have the right to speak with a lawyer first and ask for interpretation services. Do not sign any document before talking to an attorney.

Keep the red card with you to assert your rights under the U.S. Constitution. These cards can also be used in various ways, including being slipped under your front door or being given directly to immigration enforcement offices to declare your rights to remain silent.

Save the number 415-200-1548 on your phone. This is the San Francisco Rapid Response network’s 24-hour hotline that connects detained immigrants and their families with legal aid and support.

Fill out an emergency preparedness plan in case you are arrested, such as the one offered by the San Francisco Immigrant Legal & Education Network. Make sure both you and your family member have your A-Number, full name, date of birth and country of origin. Make copies of your passport and immigration documents and ensure your family can access them.

Carry evidence that you have been in the United States for longer than two years to reduce the risk of being placed in a deportation process without the chance to argue your case.

Last night:

About 5,000 people attended an online mobilization call held by Bay Resistance on Wednesday evening to prepare for the arrival of federal agents in the Bay Area, according to organizers.

Speakers from labor groups, attorneys, and nonprofits called for peaceful protests, but also action. They gave attendees advice on to interact with federal agents, document detentions, and to inform a rapid response network if they saw immigration enforcement.

Organizers also urged participants to join an adopt-a-block program to observe areas where immigrant day laborers might congregate. Meanwhile, hundreds of questions flooded in from attendees eager to participate.

Emily Lee of the Bay Rising Alliance, who led the call, said organizers have learned from federal agents’ actions in other cities and that the group is prepared for the coming days.

She called for humor and joy in the coming actions that would start early Thursday morning, with a vigil on the road from the Alameda Coast Guard Island to San Francisco.

“We are not going to give them the spectacle they want,” she said.

The assertion came in response to a question from Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of the Federal District Court in Washington. Judge Sooknanan was exploring the government’s position in a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which claims the extraterritorial detention is illegal.

She asked if Kristi Noem, the secretary, could send immigration detainees to any U.S. military base around the world.

“I don’t see why not,” replied August E. Flentje, a senior Justice Department lawyer.

Judge Sooknanan is deciding whether to confer class action status on migrants held in homeland security custody at the U.S. base at Guantánamo Bay. The A.C.L.U. requested that status, arguing that the operation is illegal because the men are in a limbo between deportation and detention on U.S. soil, where they have greater rights.

Over the summer, the Trump administration also held eight men at a U.S. military base in Djibouti while it fought and defeated a court challenge over its plans to deport them to South Sudan.

The A.C.L.U. challenge accuses the current administration of housing small numbers of men at Guantánamo, rather then in U.S. facilities, as part of a messaging strategy “to frighten immigrants, deter future migration, induce self-deportation and coerce people in detention to give up claims against removal and accept deportation elsewhere.” It has called conditions inhumane, and the detainees’ access to legal counsel inadequate.

During the press conference Thursday, Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that the country flew Air Force B-1 bombers near Venezuela earlier in the day.

Democrats and even some of Trump’s strongest supporters have questioned the administration’s military strikes against Venezuela.","Donald Trump said on Thursday that his administration could soon expand its military attacks on alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela and also begin pursuing them on land.

Trump, who has faced questions over whether he has the legal authority to use lethal force against the people in boats from Venezuela, said during a press conference he was not sure whether the administration would seek approval from Congress to attack people from the South American country over land.

“The land is going to be next,” Trump said during a press conference after a roundtable with members of his administration. “And we may go to the Senate; we may go to the Congress and tell them about it, but I can’t imagine they’d have any problem with it.”

Trump and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have justified the nine strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific side of South America, which have killed at least 37 people, by describing the alleged drug traffickers as terrorists.

“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth posted on social media Wednesday, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

Francisco Miranda, a U.S. citizen born in California, was allegedly arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials outside his work in North Portland Oct. 2.

After threatening him with a dog and holding him at the Portland ICE facility for several hours, ICE officials drove Miranda back to his work with no explanation for his detainment.

On Monday, a representative from California and a Connecticut senator announced the joint congressional investigation of arrests of U.S. citizens by immigration officials since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, said, “President Trump has embraced the use of federal immigration agents to terrorize communities nationwide whose politics he disfavors, a campaign that has increasingly ensnared U.S. citizens.”

Garcia is a ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Blumenthal is a ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

Their announcement of the “bicameral inquiry” came after an investigation by ProPublica found more than 170 American citizens have been detained by immigration officials this year.

Michael Fuller, a Portland attorney representing Miranda, said he spoke with Blumenthal about Miranda’s arrest on Monday.

Fuller said he hopes the inquiry reveals what sort of probable cause existed for Miranda’s “false arrest.”

The attorney said he has asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to explain probable cause for Miranda’s arrest, but the agency has not responded. As previously reported, Fuller sent a tort claim to DHS and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Oct. 6.

The tort demanded DHS produce documents that showed probable cause by Oct. 13.

‘What do you mean ‘overstay’?’

When ICE agents confronted Miranda in the parking lot outside his work around 6 a.m. Oct. 2, he immediately told them he was an American citizen and tried to show them his driver’s license, according to Fuller.

The federal agents then showed Miranda a photo of himself working on a fishing boat more than 10 years ago and asked, “Is this you?”

Miranda responded that it was him and restated that he was a citizen. The officers then said he was here on an “overstay,” suggesting he stayed in the U.S. beyond the time authorized by a visa.

In a video of the arrest, which Miranda filmed and his attorney shared with OPB, Miranda is heard saying, “What do you mean overstay? I don’t know what that is.”

Speaking with OPB on Wednesday, Fuller said, “I just hope to find out exactly – where did they get this information and why did they find it reliable enough to dispatch seven armed agents to come arrest and detain our client?”

Fuller said the only sort of explanation they’ve received for Miranda’s arrest came when ICE agents were driving him back to his work and told him sometimes the parents of people born outside the U.S. lie to their children about where they were born.

Miranda had a federally-approved Real ID, his attorney said, which is only available to citizens and legal residents.

In their own letter to Noem sent Monday, Blumenthal and Garcia also asked for documentation explaining the arrests of Miranda and other detained citizens.

The letter notes how the impacts of Trump’s escalation in immigration enforcement disproportionately impact certain communities, including the Portland area, and states the arrests coincide with “an alarming increase in racial profiling.”

After Miranda’s arrest, U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, the Democrat whose district includes Milwaukie, also called for an investigation into Miranda’s arrest.

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshalls would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a press release about the incident.

The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.","When Kent Wong died Oct. 8, labor and immigrant rights leaders across the country mourned the loss of a giant. For decades, Wong’s calm presence and iron will spurred significant advances in protections for immigrants and workers, especially those who were undocumented.

In Los Angeles, where the activist, organizer and educator was born and lived, the sense of grief among Wong’s friends and his longtime colleagues has been palpable. But the immigrant and labor movements also are wrestling with a different issue: What will happen to the myriad projects throughout California of which Wong was such a driving force?

“I worry about what the future’s going to be like without him,” said David Sickler, the former longtime regional director of the AFL-CIO, who was among the earliest organizers of immigrant labor in Los Angeles in the late 1980s and worked extensively with Wong on the issue over the ensuing years. Noting such Wong-led efforts as UCLA’s Dream Resource Center to support undocumented youth, Sickler added, “I am concerned for the many movements that he’s been a part of.”

By one friend’s count, Wong was actively involved in 14 different labor- and immigrant-related projects when he died at 69 from cardiopulmonary failure. Among his most recent achievements was guiding and supporting the 2023 creation of new labor research centers at five University of California campuses: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC San Diego. Those join existing labor research facilities at UC Merced, UC Berkeley and Wong’s longtime professional home, the UCLA Labor Center.

“Those [new] centers are in their infancy,” Sickler said. “Without seasoned, guiding hands like Kent’s, they can stumble and fail, and universities can just get rid of them” — a concern that feels all too valid amid the Trump administration’s multipronged ongoing attack on university funding.

'Unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers'

A fifth-generation Chinese American, Wong spent his career building a case for such initially unpopular ideas as protections for immigrant workers. He was a staff attorney for the Service Employees International Union, then led a seemingly endless series of initiatives — all of which had labor and immigration justice at their heart. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Vice president of the California Federation of Teachers. Founder of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance. Board chair for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. And, for more than 30 years, director of the UCLA Labor Center and a lecturer at the university. (Disclosure: CFT is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Wong’s tenure at UCLA’s labor center saw the expansion of staff from three members to 42. With the support of state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a longtime colleague, Wong led an effort that secured $15 million in one-time state funding to establish a permanent home for the center in L.A.’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, within walking distance of nearly two-dozen labor union offices.

“At the heart of everything Kent did was his unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers, whose struggles he understood deeply and whose dignity he fought to defend,” Durazo said in a statement upon Wong’s passing.

Wong’s father was a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, his mother a psychiatric social worker. He graduated from the now-shuttered People’s College of Law, a four-year, unaccredited public interest law school in Los Angeles whose aim was to train legal advocates who would address inequities in the law and society.

Wong’s locus of activity was L.A., but his work took him all over California, across the country and around the world. Nearly 20 years ago, he spearheaded the process that led to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor signing sister-city agreements with labor councils in both Shanghai and Beijing. These efforts led to the sharing of information and perspectives on labor standards, working conditions and multinational corporations that operated in both countries.

He was working on setting up a meeting of U.S. and Palestinian labor academics on many of the same issues earlier this summer. And in July, in the face of ICE and Homeland Security raids on workers and businesses in his home city, Wong facilitated a nonviolence training session for an estimated 1,400 people at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

'I'm helping to show you the moral pole'

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of Wong’s work, but that concept is hardly as passive as the words might make it appear.

“To some people, nonviolence means doing a peaceful protest — but nonviolent resistance is a much more profound concept,” said Larry Frank, a longtime colleague of Wong’s at the UCLA Labor Center and a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles. “Nonviolent resistance means being able to create a moral force that publicly challenges what leadership is doing, and what is necessary in terms of resistance.”

Wong understood such principles well. He was mentored by the Rev. James Lawson Jr., a lion of the civil rights movement. For years, Wong and Lawson, who died in 2024, co-taught the course “Nonviolence and Social Movements” at UCLA.

Wong’s greatest professional gifts may prove the most difficult to replicate. Friends remembered him for his unique ability to quickly identify someone’s strengths and see where and how those might best be integrated into a specific labor or justice project.

“He’d spend a few minutes with somebody, and then his instincts would tell him what they’d be good at,” Sickler said. “He seemed to understand the talent they possessed — and whether they were genuine or not. He could read ‘phony’ pretty quick.”

Wong also maintained a respectful posture toward those who disagreed with him, a disarming and effective approach that feels increasingly rare in 2025. But Wong’s even demeanor was never to be mistaken for a lack of conviction.

“It wasn’t so much like, ‘We’re fighting on an issue and I’m going to craft a middle ground.’ That was not his vibe,” said Roxana Tynan, executive director emerita of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. “It was more like, ‘I’m helping to show you the moral pole here. You should come over here with me and my pals. It’s way more fun.’”

'A huge force in the movement'

Wong loved good food, and he and his wife, the community organizer and activist Jai Lee Wong, hosted friends for many a Chinese meal for which he hand-selected the ingredients from local markets and cooked everything himself. He was a jazz fan who’d go out of his way to find a good club on the road. He was a devoted husband and father. But he was fundamentally a person who felt called to a purpose that could, at times, be all encompassing.

“He was, for me, the most strategic thinker and strategic actor I’ve ever worked with,” Frank said. “He had put in this work to establish relationships with labor, but also with businesses, with management. All the pieces that made him so effective, he had built over many, many years, thoughtfully, strategically. And then he was able to move so many pieces of work forward in this town — a huge force in the movement.”

The movements for labor and social justice will continue, albeit in extremely challenging circumstances. The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.

Wong’s mass training session on nonviolent resistance in L.A. this summer, designed to instruct activists and organizers on how to effectively respond to such emergencies, was a direct response to the Trump-directed incursion into his city. It was the kind of cause that animated his life and work — and his absence from these battles, to which he constantly brought both resolve and respectfulness, is still difficult for colleagues to imagine.

“I’ve never known a finer human being,” Sickler said. “Kent could be an opponent’s toughest enemy — but it’s hard to attack a guy who smiles at you and treats you respectfully.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/670558b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x945+0+66/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F83%2Fae%2Fe44bed0d45aea4e2a5d2cc61c7a0%2Flawsondedication-229.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:17.763556

But new recruits are reportedly failing physical fitness requirements and entering training programs before the agency performed background checks or finished a screening process.

ICE officials have discovered that some recruits failed drug testing or had disqualifying criminal backgrounds while they were already enrolled in training, according to NBC News.

Since the beginning of a summer hiring surge after the president approved $178 billion to expand the agency into one of the most expensive police agencies in the world, ICE has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while they were in training for falling short of requirements, according to agency data reviewed by NBC.

Most did not meet physical and academic standards — including failing open-book tests — while several were dismissed for their criminal backgrounds or over safety concerns that were flagged in background checks, the outlet reported.

At least one recruit at the agency’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, had been previously charged with strong-arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, according to a Homeland Security official speaking to NBC.

Several recruits also had not submitted fingerprints or gone through any background checks at all before entering the six-week training course, officials said.

Homeland Security deputy secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed that a majority of new recruits are former law enforcement officers who go through a different hiring process; per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass drug tests and undergo a security check before they enter training.

McLaughlin said the figures in NBC’s report are “not accurate” and “reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes.”

“The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy,” she said. “This population is expected to account for greater than 85 percent of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Trump administration has aimed for hiring 10,000 ICE agents by next year, or roughly doubling its footprint, with a major boost to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division.

Critics have warned that hitting that 10,000 target — without adequate guardrails to screen future agents and know exactly who is filling those roles — the government could open the door to repeat past mistakes, as ICE faces intense legal scrutiny over allegations of abuse and illegal use of force as Trump surges federal officers into cities across the country.

“The loosening of hiring standards and training requirements is unacceptable and will likely result in increased officer misconduct — similar to or worse than what occurred during a small surge in hiring U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the early 2000s,” Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week.

“Exacerbating our concerns, DHS has gutted offices responsible for overseeing ICE officers and ensuring accountability for use-of-force incidents,” he added. “Given these developments, greater congressional oversight of ICE’s hiring is essential.”

To boost recruitment, Homeland Security offered a “maximum $50,000 signing bonus” and student loan forgiveness. DHS also dropped age limit requirements, allowing people as young as 18 years old to apply and opening ICE to recruits older than 40 years old.

The training period at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia shrunk from 13 weeks to eight — and then six.

Recruits must also pass a physical fitness test, including running 1.5 miles under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

But dozens of new recruits were sent packing because they couldn’t pass a legal exam, in which officers are allowed to use their books and notes for a test on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment.

Another group of recruits was dismissed after medical issues or failing the physical fitness requirements. “It’s pathetic,” one career ICE official told The Atlantic.

The federal government has been struggling to enroll physically fit personnel to join the ranks since even before Trump, with military branches also regularly failing to meet recruiting goals.

One Pentagon study found that more than three-quarters of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 were ineligible for service because they were overweight, unable to pass an aptitude test, afflicted by physical or mental health issues, or ruled out by a criminal record.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/23/15/13/ICE-Detains-Immigrants-Inside-New-York-City-Courthouses-ocas0cn5.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-23 21:01:20.997564

From Los Angeles to Chicago, Portlandand New York, the evidence is ample enough that wherever Trump sends in the immigration agency, people get hurt. And not just protesters and immigrants.

That includes 13 police officers tear-gassed in Chicago earlier this month. And, now, a U.S. marshal.

Which brings us to what happened in South L.A. on Tuesday.

Federal agents boxed in the Toyota Camry of local TikToker Carlitos Ricardo Parias — better known to his hundreds of thousands of followers as Richard LA. As Parias allegedly tried to rev his way out of the trap, an ICE agent opened fire. One bullet hit the 44-year-old Mexican immigrant — and another ricocheted into the hand of a deputy U.S. marshal.

Neither suffered life-threatening injuries, but it’s easy to imagine that things could have easily turned out worse. Such is the chaos that Trump has caused by unleashing shock troops into U.S. cities.

Rather than take responsibility and apologize for an incident that could’ve easily been lethal, Team Trump went into their default spin mode of blaming everyone but themselves.

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the shooting was “the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.”

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli chimed in on social media soon after: “I urge California public officials to moderate their rhetoric toward federal law enforcement. Encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.” Hours later, he called Times reporter James Queally “an absolute joke, not a journalist” because my colleague noted it’s standard practice by most American law enforcement agencies to not shoot at moving vehicles. One reason is that it increases the chance of so-called friendly fire.

Federal authorities accuse Parias of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in. He is being charged with assault on a federal officer.

Time, and hopefully, evidence, will show what happened — and very important, what led to what happened.

The Trump administration keeps claiming that the public anger against its immigration actions is making the job more dangerous for la migra and their sister agencies. McLaughlin and her boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, keep saying there’s been a 1,000% increase in assaults on immigration agents this year like an incantation. Instead of offering concrete figures, they use the supposed stat as a shield against allegations ICE tactics are going too far and as a weapon to excuse the very brutality ICE claims it doesn’t practice.

Well, even if what they say is true, there’s only one side that’s making the job more dangerous for la migra and others during raids:

La migra.

It turns out that if you send in phalanxes of largely masked federal agents to bully and intimidate people in American cities, Americans tend not to take kindly to it.

Who knew?

We’re about to enter the sixth month of Trump’s plan to rid the country of undocumented immigrants. Sycophants are bragging that he’s doing the job, but they’re not caring to look at the mess left in its wake that’s becoming more and more perilous for everyone involved. They insist that those who are executing and planning raids are professionals, but professionals don’t make constant pendejos out of themselves.

Professionals don’t bring squadrons to chase after tamale ladies or day laborers, or stage flashy raids of apartments and parks that accomplish little else than footage for propaganda videos. They don’t go into neighborhoods with intimidation on their mind and ready to rough up anyone who gets in their way.

A ProPublica investigation showed that ICE has detained at least 170 U.S. citizens this year, many whom offered proof that they were in this country legally as la migra cuffed them and hauled them off to detention centers.

Professionals don’t lie like there’s a bonus attached to it — but that’s what Trump’s deportation Leviathan keeps doing. In September, McLaughlin put out a news release arguing that the shooting death of 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Chicago by an ICE agent was justified because he was dragged a “significant distance” and suffered serious injuries. Yet body cam footage of local police who showed up to the scene captured the two ICE agents involved in the incident describing their injuries as “nothing major.”

Closer to home, a federal jury in Los Angeles last month acquitted an activist of striking a Border Patrol agent after federal public defender Cuauhtémoc Ortega screened footage that contradicted the government’s case and poked holes in the testimony of Border Patrol staff and supervisors. Last week, ICE agents detained Oxnard activist Leonardo Martinez after a collision between their Jeep and his truck. McLaughlin initially blamed the incident on an “agitator group ... engaged in recording and verbal harassment,” but footage first published by L.A. Taco showed that la migra trailed Martinez and then crashed into him twice — not the other way around.

Professionals don’t host social media accounts that regularly spew memes that paint the picture of an American homeland where white makes right and everyone else must be eliminated, like the Department of Homeland Security does. A recent post featured medieval knights wearing chain mail and helmets and wielding longswords as they encircle the slogan “The Enemies are at the Gates” above ICE’s job listing website.

The Trump administration has normalized racism and has turned cruelty into a virtue — then its mouthpieces gasp in mock horror when people resist its officially sanctioned jackbootery.

This evil buffoonery comes straight from a president who reacted to the millions of Americans who protested this weekend at No Kings rallies by posting on social media an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown and dropping feces on his critics from a jet fighter. And yet McLaughlin, Noem and other Trump bobbleheads have the gall to question why politicians decry la migra while regular people follow and film them during raids when not shouting obscenities and taunts at them?

As I’ve written before, there’s never a nice way to conduct an immigration raid but there’s always a better way. Or at least a way that’s not dripping with malevolence.

Meanwhile, ICE is currently on a hiring spree thanks to Trump’s Bloated Beastly Bill and and has cut its training program from six months to 48 days, according to The Atlantic. It’s a desperate and potentially reckless recruitment drive.

And if you think rapidly piling more people into a clown car is going to produce less clown-like behavior by ICE on the streets of American cities, boy do I have news for you.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11b73f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F67%2F5ed35c45442fb42a524b3260fc73%2Fgettyimages-2240700506.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:32.466983

The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.
The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.","For weeks, Chicagoans and suburbanites have recorded masked federal agents pursuing people down streets, detaining them, and loading them into unmarked cars — scenes that have at times descended into chaos amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Now, in a move that could bolster both his public messaging and the state’s legal efforts to fight the Trump administration, Gov. JB Pritzker is seeking to channel those videos, testimonials and any allegations of misconduct into a centralized record overseen by a new “accountability commission.” The panel, he said, will track and scrutinize the administration’s actions with an eye toward future efforts to hold federal officials and employees accountable.

Announced Thursday in an executive order establishing the commission, the move follows weeks of resistance from Democratic-led states that have sought to challenge the Trump administration’s law enforcement crackdowns largely through the courts. Pritzker has repeatedly acknowledged that Illinois, like other states, has few direct tools to counter federal actions beyond litigation and public accountability efforts.

Hamstrung by the state’s limited authority to restrict federal immigration agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol, Pritzker said the commission will serve as a means of collecting and preserving evidence — material that could be used by a future Congress, presidential administration or in potential legal proceedings. While the panel will be empowered to recommend steps to hold the federal government accountable, Pritzker acknowledged it will have no subpoena power. It has no direct law enforcement authority.

The commission may, in the end, function as much as a public forum as a means for legal action, amplifying awareness of federal agents’ conduct as it documents possible abuses.

The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.

“We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved, so the public can know what their elected and appointed officials have done, and so the courts and the Congress can eventually hold people accountable,” Pritzker said. “Donald Trump is counting on your silence. We are counting on your courage.”

Since the latest wave of federal immigration enforcement began in early September, local officials have said they are exploring a range of options to push back against what they describe as the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive tactics in Chicago and the suburbs.

Pritzker’s executive order also comes as former Mayor Lori Lightfoot separately said this week that she and a group of attorneys were working to establish a nonprofit organization to serve as a “centralized archive” of alleged misconduct by ICE and Border Patrol agents, according to Fox 32. It’s unclear if the two efforts would work together. Pritzker and Lightfoot had a sometimes-tense relationship while she was mayor.

Though it’s not clear how strong the teeth of the new commission will be, its creation is the next step for Pritzker after he has asked Illinoisans, even before “Operation Midway Blitz” launched on Sept. 8, to record and share ICE and Border Patrol activity. In late August, during a news conference along the Chicago River with elected leaders across Chicago and the state, Pritzker issued a warning “to Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.”

Some videos people have taken were used in announcing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office’s case that obtained a federal judge’s temporary restraining order holding off the Trump administration from commanding National Guard troops onto city and suburban streets. The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.

Pritzker’s order appears to centralize that information at the state level. The federal Department of Homeland Security, for its part, has discouraged journalists and others from sharing videos of federal agents, saying ICE and Border Patrol agents have been subjected to physical threats, which it says have increased by “one thousand percent.”

The commission is expected to be chaired by former federal judge Rubén Castillo, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago who also served as a director and regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Latino civil rights and advocacy group known as MALDEF. He represented the group in redistricting cases that led to the creation of the first Hispanic-majority congressional district in Illinois and to an increase in the number of Latino-majority aldermanic and state legislative districts.

Pritzker announced his appointments to six of the nine expected seats on the new board. In addition to Castillo, Pritzker named former judge and federal prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes, who is expected to serve as vice chair. The commission is set to last for a year but could be extended, according to the executive order.

A Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Illinois House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, in a statement, called the commission “another taxpayer-funded political stunt.”

The Trump administration is now heading into the eighth week of “Operation Midway Blitz,” during which at least 1,500 arrests have been made, the Department of Homeland Security has reported. The sight of ICE and Border Patrol has become common throughout Chicago and the suburbs, as agents have repeatedly detained people first and sought information about them later, without immediate regard for citizenship or legal status.

DHS has said it’s going after the “worst of the worst,” or individuals who both lack legal status and have committed violent crimes, and it has provided several examples of people arrested in the past two months that it says fit that description. But other studies have shown that many people arrested and detained as part of nationwide sweeps have been American citizens or had no criminal record.

The department has not released comprehensive lists of detainees widely.

Pritzker’s order follows Wednesday’s legal win for the state in its ongoing fight against allowing National Guard troops to be part of the crackdown: A federal judge in Chicago indefinitely extended her restraining order barring Trump from deploying the troops to Illinois as both sides await a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Other legal efforts against the Trump administration’s actions have come from outside the state government. In a separate lawsuit, a federal judge ruled earlier this month that federal agents violated the rights of news reporters and protesters who were responding to immigration arrests in Chicago and restricted some of the agents’ future actions.

Mary Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center and another expected member of the board, on Thursday drew a comparison to a 1991 report about the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, which she said she had lived under in the 1980s.

“This report became a critical resource as Chileans worked to reestablish democratic and human rights norms,” she said. When she returned to the U.S., she added, “I never, never imagined that one day, I would be living through a similar authoritarian regime. But here we are.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-pritzker-economic-club-04_244976626-e1761252007700.jpg?w=1024&h=719,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:00.404725

Bovino described Chicago as a ""model"" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until ""we arrest them all or they self-deport.""","Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at addressing federal enforcement in Illinois, telling CBS News that his newly created Illinois Accountability Commission will serve as a permanent record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents in Chicago.

Pritzker told CBS News, in an exclusive interview, the state is documenting ""unlawful attacks"" by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers under Operation Midway Blitz.

""They are attacking people on the ground — ICE, CBP — going after people just because they're Brown or Black,"" Pritzker said. ""No one above them is holding them responsible. Greg Bovino, who is running the operation in Chicago, isn't holding them accountable. No one is. So we're going to have to keep a record.""

Pritzker's office said the task force will consist of nine people appointed by him to capture and create a public record of federal law enforcement, ultimately recommending actions to hold the federal government accountable for operations taking place here.

""The commission will be charged with three core missions. One, creating a public record of the abuses; two, capturing the impact on families and communities; and three, recommending actions to prevent further harm and pursue justice,"" Pritzker said at a press conference announcing his executive order.

He said members will be supported by the Department of Human Rights, and he expects hearings to launch ""several weeks from now.""

""Since this began, I have encouraged the people of Illinois to use their phones and to record everything they are witnessing and post it on social media,"" Pritzker said. ""We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved.""

The governor said hundreds of videos and firsthand accounts have already been collected and will be preserved for use in future legal proceedings.

""These people need to be held accountable,"" he said. ""And they will be — by the judiciary now, and by Congress or the next administration later.""

Former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Ruben Castillo, will lead the commission as chair.

""This commission is about civil rights. This commission is about the Constitution. This commission ultimately about human rights, Castillo said. ""I see the commission as a lighthouse. What does a lighthouse do? It sheds light on darkness, and there certainly seems to be – and not prejudging this – a lot of darkness going around.""

Pritzker emphasized that Illinois is not waiting for Washington to act, pointing to recent legal victories against federal enforcement actions.

""We've won at the circuit court level. We've won at the appeals court level. We are taking action now. But it's appalling that the people committing these crimes are still on the job,"" Pritzker said. ""Let's be clear: Congress isn't doing anything right now. They've become sycophants to the President. They're not holding hearings or asking questions.""

He described reports of Black Hawk helicopters, military-style weapons, and the mass detention of civilians, including children being zip-tied.

""There are people who just don't believe it until they see it,"" he said. ""We've seen pastors hit with pepper balls while praying outside ICE facilities. Peaceful protesters tackled or shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for exercising their First Amendment rights. ... That's why we're telling everyone: record it, document it, send it in.""

In his interview with CBS News, Pritzker detailed the timeline on these accountability efforts.

""We are taking those cases to court, and again we are winning. So we're taking action now. I don't want to make it seem like nothing is happening,"" he said.

The governor said they're taking cases to court now, but other actions could take years, when there's a change in administration at the White House.

""Someone's got to hold them accountable, and whether it's the courts now or the elected officials later, we've got to make sure we have a record to show,"" he said.

Pritzker said a report will be issued this January related to the work of the commission. They've created a website people can use to track this work and to report activity at ilac.illinois.gov.

Asked about this week's federal court decision blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker praised the ruling but voiced concern about what may come next.

""The courts have done a very good job stopping the worst offenses, but I'm disturbed that the Supreme Court might allow federalized National Guard troops when there is no insurrection, no rebellion,"" he said.

Pritzker said he welcomes help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.

When asked what he'd say directly to CBP Chief of Patrol Bovino, who oversees the federal operation, Pritzker offered a pointed message: ""Follow the law. Follow your own protocols. Do right by the citizens of the United States who live here in Illinois. And, finally, pronounce the name of our state correctly. It's Illinois, not Illinoise.""

Bovino defends enforcement actions, claiming ""absolute chaos in the streets""

On Thursday, Bovino also talked with CBS News and pushed back on Pritzker's claims.

""Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself, for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,"" Bovino said, accusing him and other Democratic leaders of spreading ""fake news"" about racial profiling. He denied that CBP agents have targeted neighborhoods by race or acted outside policy.

""We've arrested individuals from 30 non-Latino countries,"" he said. ""We go where the threat is.""

Bovino defended his agency's tactics, saying federal agents in Chicago have made nearly 2,700 arrests since Sept. 6 and used ""exemplary"" force amid what he called ""absolute chaos in the streets.""

""We've arrested a lot of very bad individuals: Latin Kings members, bona fide terrorists, and things like that,"" Bovino told CBS News.

Bovino said roughly 70% of arrests nationwide involve people with ""criminal or immigration history,"" though he declined to provide specific figures for Chicago, when pressed repeatedly. Earlier this month, CBS News Chicago dug into the data behind the arrests, and found some of the numbers reflected people arrested outside of Illinois.

Bovino also defended agents seen deploying tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the Broadview detention facility, despite a federal court order restricting chemical agents.

""The use of force I've seen has been exemplary, the least amount necessary to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""Those protesters were trespassing and had been given multiple warnings. That was absolutely in line with policy.""

Bovino dismissed concerns that agents fired from elevated positions or above the waist, insisting, ""It doesn't matter where you fire from. That's not a violation of policy.""

Asked if any agents had been disciplined for excessive force, Bovino said, ""To my knowledge, no.""

He also defended the possible deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, saying they would guard federal facilities, not patrol city streets.

""That was fake news,"" he said. ""It was never the intention for National Guard to be on the streets.""

Bovino described Chicago as a ""model"" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until ""we arrest them all or they self-deport.""

""We're here to protect taxpayers from violence and crimes by illegal aliens,"" Bovino said. ""We've had enough, and we're not going anywhere.""

— GOP leaders are starting to mix it up

— Lawmakers brace for a SNAP cliff

— Timeline slips for crypto market bill

The shutdown is going into next week — at least. And senators are getting restless.

There’s little hope of movement anytime soon, with President Donald Trump leaving Washington Friday for a trip to Asia for at least several days.

“Everybody knows Mike Johnson is not going to take a single step without Donald Trump’s permission,” Sen. Brian Schatz, a senior appropriator and the Senate’s next Democratic whip, told Mia. “He has to get involved.”

But after weeks of daily votes on the House-passed continuing resolution, Republican leaders are starting to mix it up a bit. Today they’re hoping to split Democrats by holding a vote on a bill from Sen. Ron Johnson to pay troops and some federal workers on the floor. That’s not expected to get enough Democratic support to pass.

Senate Republicans are looking to keep the pressure on next week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune took the step Wednesday to make two other bills available for a vote: another troop pay bill from Sen. Dan Sullivan and a bill to pay TSA employees and air traffic controllers from Sen. Ted Cruz.

They’re also discussing voting on a bill from Sen. Josh Hawley that would fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for the duration of the shutdown, Jordain Carney reports. (Read on for much more on the coming food-aid cliff.)

Meanwhile, talk of a new CR is heating up as Nov. 21, the expiration date for the House-passed stopgap, draws closer. Some Republicans are eyeing a punt though January or March. Other conservatives are pushing for a CR through December of next year, a plan that’s not likely to fly with appropriators.

“I’d like to get it done this year and not push it into next year,” said Sen. John Boozman, who oversees Military Construction-VA spending. “Although there’s good arguments for doing that, we don’t have a whole lot of time left.”

While there’s little hope of an immediate path out of the shutdown, the mood appears to be lightening, at least. Sens. Rand Paul and Gary Peters are hosting a bipartisan lunch today, and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Mike Rounds — who are part of the informal group trying to find an off-ramp — said they are planning to attend.

“There is a little bit of a better spirit. Something must be happening,” Sen. Kevin Cramer told Jordain about the vibe among senators Wednesday night.

THE LEADERSHIP SUITE

Lawmakers brace for the SNAP cliff

Millions of low-income Americans are on track to lose access to food aid Nov. 1, Meredith Lee Hill reports, but it’s not moving Democrats off their shutdown stance.

Asked Tuesday about the SNAP benefits cliff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said “it should change Republicans’ calculus, that they should sit down and negotiate, negotiate a way to address this crisis.”

At least 25 states plan to inform SNAP participants they won’t receive checks next month, including California, an overwhelmingly Democratic state with 4.5 million program recipients, Grace Yarrow reports. The food-aid cliff has largely flown under the radar as Democrats focus on the launch of open enrollment for Affordable Care Act insurance plans, also on Nov. 1.

“We’re people who want Americans to have health care and food,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “The Republicans, evidently, don’t care whether they have either.”

Trump and GOP lawmakers are, for now, blaming Democrats for risking hunger for low-income Americans. But White House officials are aware of the consequences for their own voters and are beginning to weigh their options to fill the hole, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Blumenthal: New Russia sanctions aren’t enough

The top Democrat on a bipartisan effort to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine praised new sanctions issued by the Trump administration Wednesday — but thinks they don’t go far enough.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal told Calen the new effort hitting major Russian oil companies is “a step in the right direction,” but that the secondary sanctions legislation he is spearheading with Sen. Lindsey Graham — which Trump has been reluctant to green-light — is still necessary.

Their bill would impose sanctions on countries lawmakers say are “fueling the Russian oil machine,” like China, India, Brazil and Hungary.

“Until we have those kinds of sledgehammer sanctions on the enablers economically of Russia’s slaughter, Putin will continue to think he has a green light from Trump to continue the assault,” Blumenthal added.

Graham thanked the president for his sanctions move Wednesday, and encouraged him to keep going after Russian oil companies “and the customers that buy their cheap oil and refuse to help Ukraine.”

How Senate Republicans rejected Ingrassia

Senate Republicans for months quietly raised concerns with the White House about Paul Ingrassia’s nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel before he withdrew from consideration Tuesday, Hailey Fuchs, Daniel Lippman and Jordain report.

The GOP pushback accelerated in July following a meeting between Ingrassia and bipartisan Senate Homeland Security Committee staff, where he professed to have little memory of inflammatory social media posts and writings, according to three Democratic aides who were present and granted anonymity to discuss the conversation.

“His most typical response was that he’s posted so many things he couldn’t recall,” said one of the aides.

Sens. Johnson, Hawley, Rick Scott and James Lankford were among the Republicans with concerns about Ingrassia’s nomination.

“Several of us … had direct conversations with the White House for a couple of months, actually,” Lankford said.

POLICY RUNDOWN

TIMELINE SLIPS FOR CRYPTO MARKET BILL — Crypto executives left a series of meetings on Capitol Hill Wednesday worrying that negotiations over a landmark bill establishing cryptocurrency regulations will slip into next year, Jasper Goodman, Declan Harty and Meredith report.

The meetings came after bipartisan crypto market structure legislation stalled earlier this month, with one industry official saying it would now be a “miracle” if the bill passes this year. Senate Democrats, in particular, have bristled at deadlines being imposed after negotiations and chided crypto CEOs for their response to a leaked Democratic proposal for regulating decentralized finance.

Sen. Ruben Gallego told the CEOs he was “really fucking pissed about” the industry’s response and warned them not to “be an arm of the Republican Party.”

“They used you all and your megaphones to fuck us,” Gallego said in the meeting.

CRAPO EYES MORE TAX POLICY EXTENSIONS — Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo told Benjamin and Meredith he’s “hopeful” the Senate can pass and enact an extenders package at the end of the year.

“We had those … together at the end of last year, and they didn’t get included [in the megabill],” Crapo said Wednesday. “I’m hopeful that we’ll find a vehicle, and yeah, I think that there should be one. But you know, in this Congress, you never know what’s going to be possible.”

The GOP’s big, beautiful bill extended most of the tax provisions that were due to expire at year’s end. But some provisions — such as a credit for businesses that hire certain veterans, ex-felons and other groups who have had trouble finding employment — are still at risk of lapsing in a few months.

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith has also expressed interest in reversing the curtailed gambling deduction that was included in the megabill. Crapo reiterated he wouldn’t oppose that if his members pushed for it.

Crapo huddled in Smith’s office Wednesday, though he wouldn’t share details of the discussion.

DIGNITY ACT DISCUSSIONS — Rep. Maria Salazar said Wednesday she’s confident the White House will come around to support her bill to create a “dignity status” for undocumented immigrants.

“It’s common sense. So it will happen, because I do trust that this president gets it and will get it done,” the Florida Republican said at a news conference on a bill that hasn’t seen significant movement since its reintroduction in July.

She argued Trump would see the legislation as beneficial to the economy.

“Just watch, because he knows that this problem is imminent,” Salazar said. “The country needs a secure workforce, otherwise we will not be able to have the economy that we need to have to continue being the No. 1 economy in the world.”

Salazar, joined by Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, said they are “talking to everybody,” including House leadership.

TUNNEL TALK

REPUBLICANS TANK ICE MISCONDUCT TRACKER — Republicans are threatening to block House Oversight Democrats from creating a “master ICE tracker” on their minority committee website that would document the unlawful detention of Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Top Oversight Democrat Robert Garcia said Tuesday the plan was to launch the tracker over “the next couple of weeks” and to include “every single instance that we can verify” of unlawful ICE arrests and civil rights abuses.

But Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs House Administration, denounced the initiative Wednesday. His panel has oversight authority of the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which oversees websites hosted on the House’s network.

“The House of Representatives absolutely will not maintain a website that tracks or doxes I.C.E. agents,” Steil said in a statement.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.","By MADELEINE MOORE/Salem Reporter

The state of Oregon is asking a federal judge to dismiss a Marion County lawsuit over immigration records, saying state law is clear that the county can’t share information about men on parole for local crimes with federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in U.S. District Court in Eugene to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit. The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law. The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

In a statement Tuesday, Marion County disputed Rayfield’s argument that there is no conflict between state and federal laws.

“The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed,” Elzinga said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties. In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.",https://lincolnchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cropped-LC-favi-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-23 21:01:29.247095

However, deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility; Trump’s comments about calling off a “surge” operation were only focused on San Francisco.
“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson.
Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters.
Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.","Less than an hour after President Donald Trump called off a federal “surge” in San Francisco, Oakland leaders held a press conference to calm residents and let them know officials are prepared if the administration still moves ahead with operations in the East Bay.

But what exactly a federal surge in Oakland or other cities would look like is anyone’s guess.

Facing a packed conference room in Oakland City Hall, Mayor Barbara Lee acknowledged she has “no information we can bring to you today” about the federal administration’s plans.

“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” Lee said. “We know border patrol agents are being stationed on the Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, we are fully prepared.”

Trump posted on Truth Social that he decided to call off a planned immigration enforcement campaign in San Francisco this Saturday after having a phone call last night with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who expressed concern that it would harm the city’s economic recovery. In a post on X, Governor Gavin Newsom wrote that “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason” and touted the Bay Area as “a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.” Newsom added that his office will continue to monitor the situation.

However, deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility; Trump’s comments about calling off a “surge” operation were only focused on San Francisco.

With those stakes in mind, Lee and other elected officials, union representatives, and faith leaders encouraged residents to look out for one another and to peacefully protest the administration. But officials also warned people not to “take the bait” by committing any acts of violence against federal officers.

“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. “So I’m not going to be quiet about what we know is coming. We know that their expectation is that Oakland is going to do something to cause them to make us the example.”

Earlier this morning, hundreds of protesters gathered near a road that leads to an island in the Oakland estuary that houses Coast Guard facilities, where CBP agents were reported to be arriving. Demonstrators who attempted to block the road were forced to disperse after agents deployed two flash bangs so several CBP vehicles could get through.

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters. But there are limits to that non-cooperation. Dickson noted that her office can’t stand in the way of a legal warrant. Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.

“I want to make it clear that if anyone attempts to enter your house or detain you, and they’re not in uniform or they don’t show credentials, please call 911 immediately,” Beere said.

Congresswoman Lateefah Simon said her office will protect members of the community, including children, families, officers, and protesters.

Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.

Several officials summarized efforts they’re taking to bolster the region’s defenses against federal incursions. Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services. The board also recently agreed to create an office focused on immigrant affairs to coordinate services throughout the county.

Lourdes Martinez, directing attorney of the immigrant rights practice at Centro Legal De La Raza, said ICE has already been operating in Alameda County. Her group, which runs a pro bono immigrant legal defense program, is anticipating an escalation, similar to what’s been seen in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland.

“If there has been deployment of federal law enforcement, it has really strengthened ICE and their ability to execute more detentions,” Martinez said. “So that is what we’re bracing for.”

The county also revived this year a rapid response hotline, which residents can use to call in reports of ICE activity. Martinez encouraged people to call the line instead of spreading unverified reports on other platforms. She also shared practical advice for immigrants, including that people should memorize important phone numbers and gather and keep safe documents like passports and medical records. She also recommended that people use PIN passcodes on their phones and consider disabling fingerprint or facial recognition on their cellphones.

“Just remember we are living under difficult times where ICE is allowed to racially profile,” she said.

Pastor Mike McBride advised young people to “not get caught up” engaging with federal officers, and to carry IDs and attend know-your-rights trainings.

“We will outlast this wickedness in high places, Oakland will counter hate, lies, and misinformation with love for all people,” McBride said. “Truth, justice, peace and joy. And we beg the Congress, please release the Epstein files.”",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7741-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:11.356928

Why it matters: Gov. Jared Polis' actions, first reported Wednesday by the Denver Post, may violate state laws prohibiting cooperation with ICE on most immigration matters, and if the documents were released, they could lead to more deportations.

Catch up quick: A federal immigration subpoena is seeking employment records for 10 businesses whose employees sponsored unaccompanied immigrant children, but state legislation that Polis signed in 2021 limits cooperation to criminal matters.

A Denver judge ruled in April that administration staffers could not release the records.

State of play: Now Polis is using private legal counsel to seek the case's dismissal and allow the release of a limited batch of records to ICE, court documents show.

The move is generating more controversy and blowback for the governor, who defended his actions when Axios Denver asked about the issue Wednesday.

In response, Polis continued to suggest the subpoenas are connected to a criminal matter even though a judge rejected that premise.

The intrigue: The private attorneys working with Polis billed the state $104,000, the Post reported.

What he's saying: ""We are deeply committed to finding human trafficking, and when the federal government, especially the criminal investigative unit of ICE, wants our help investigating human trafficking, we are happy to help — and that's whether Biden is president, whether Trump's president, it doesn't matter,"" Polis told us.

The other side: David Seligman, an attorney general candidate who is critical of Polis' move, argued that ICE only wants the information to deport the children's sponsors, who are typically family members.

The overall bill set aside $150 billion for immigration enforcement, with about $30 billion of that total going directly to ICE. To put that in context, Republicans nearly quadrupled the agency’s budget and ensured that ICE is far better funded than other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

In practical terms, this doesn’t just mean that the agency is suddenly flush with taxpayer cash. It also means ICE is hiring a lot of new personnel. The White House has said it intends to double the agency’s workforce, including 10,000 new deportation officers whom the president wants to deploy in January.

Its recruiting efforts, however, aren’t going especially well.

The Atlantic reported this week, for example, on the latest from an ICE training academy in Georgia, where more than a third of the new recruits have failed a relatively easy personal fitness test (do 15 pushups and 32 situps, and run 1.5 miles in 14 minutes).

One career ICE official told The Atlantic that the failure rate is “pathetic.” The same report highlighted a recent email from ICE headquarters to the agency’s top officials that lamented having many “athletically allergic candidates.”

As brutal as these details are, the scope of the problem is apparently even broader. NBC News reported:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed new recruits into its training program before they have completed the agency’s vetting process, an unusual sequence of events as it rushes to hire federal immigration officers. ... ICE officials only later discovered that some of the recruits failed drug testing, have disqualifying criminal backgrounds or don’t meet the physical or academic requirements to serve, the sources said.

According to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC, “nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center over the past three months were later sent home because they couldn’t pass the written exam, according to the data. The academic requirement includes an exam in which officers are allowed to consult their textbooks and notes at the end of a legal course.”

Or put another way, almost half of these recruits failed an open-book test.

I won’t pretend to know what the White House and ICE officials intend to do about this, but it’ll be worth watching to see if the agency lowers its standards to make it easier to deploy to American streets these “athletically allergic” agents who can’t copy answers out of a book to pass an exam.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-ICE-recruitment-zz-576ac0.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 19:01:38.060791

“It could be done in literally an hour,” he told Migrant Insider Thursday.","WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, announced his caucus would launch a “master ICE Tracker,” a digital record keeper designed to expose what he called “unconstitutional detentions and civil-rights violations” by federal immigration agents.

MIGRANT INSIDER IS SPONSORED BY:

“American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to a lawyer or even a phone call,” Garcia said. “No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should live in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like.”

According to committee staff, the tracker will compile verified reports from the public, advocacy groups, attorneys, and congressional field offices into a searchable database of ICE and CBP misconduct. “The tracker documents unconstitutional actions after they occur — it’s about accountability,” Garcia spokeswoman Sara Guerrero told Gizmodo.

A senior aide to another oversight Democrat who declined to be named in this article called the project “ICE Tracker Dot Gov” while acknowledging the tool is unlikely to be housed at that specific web address — for now. Registering a dot gov domain requires following a formal, identity-verified process managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) through the Get.gov platform. The dot gov top-level domain is reserved exclusively for verified U.S. government organizations at any level … federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and special-purpose entities.

GOP Resistance — and an Irish Provocation

Just after Garcia’s announcement, House Republicans led by Chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) vowed to block the tracker from being hosted on official servers, including the dot gov domain registrar. It’s unclear if House Republicans have the authority to block domain registries, but Secretary Kristi Noem almost certainly does, as CISA is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

“The House of Representatives absolutely will not maintain a website that tracks or doxes I.C.E. agents,” Steil said, breaking from MAGA talking points that have conflated tracking as doxxing throughout early Trump’s second term.

For example, MAGA stalwart Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), lead sponsor of the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act, absurdly claims activists are endangering agents merely by naming them.

Dominick Skinner, the founder of ICE List, a crowdsourced website that publicly identifies agents involved in raids, was recently named and shamed by Blackburn on her senate website. “Apparently the work we’ve been doing made her uncomfortable enough to cite me as the reason behind a new bill in Congress,” Skinner wrote afterward. “They want to criminalize transparency.”

A former homeless youth from Ireland now living in Amsterdam where Blackburn has zero jurisdiction, Skinner told Migrant Insider he views unmasking as moral reciprocity: “We survived because the world accepted us as migrants. I believe in frictionless borders, equal opportunity, and that in a fair world migration wouldn’t even be an issue.”

For now, ICE List operates from servers in Europe — beyond U.S. jurisdiction and, as he jokes, “safe unless they invade the Netherlands.”

A Bicameral Oversight Offensive

Garcia’s announcement of the House Oversight Committee’s ICE tracker follows a joint letter to Noem from Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) demanding records on the detention of U.S. citizens by immigration agents.

Their inquiry cites ProPublica’s investigation showing that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained this year — many held for days without water or phone access. “It’s unclear how a wrongly ensnared U.S. citizen is supposed to prove their citizenship to armed agents who don’t believe their passport or REAL ID is real,” they wrote.

ICE’s Public Collapse

Garcia’s “master tracker” lands as ICE’s standing with the public hits historic lows. In February, half the country viewed ICE favorably; by June, that number flipped — 52 percent unfavorable, 39 percent favorable, with nearly 40 percent “very unfavorable.” August Pew polling placed ICE alongside the IRS as one of the least-trusted U.S. agencies.

Among Democrats, approval sits at 13 percent, and independents disapprove nearly two-to-one. Trump, meanwhile, seems unaware that ICE is now less popular than the IRS.

Apple Joins the Firewall

The same cannot be said for the digital efforts of stateside advocates building tools to alert and catalog ICE raids. American tech companies have largely embraced the far-right’s drive to protect ICE from public accountability.

As Migrant Insider scooped earlier this month, Apple and Google quietly removed the DeICER app from its App Store after a law-enforcement complaint, invoking an anti-hate-speech rule normally reserved for shielding marginalized groups.

Apple’s notice claimed the app’s “purpose is to provide location information about law-enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.” The decision effectively made federal agents a protected class inside Apple’s ecosystem — a striking inversion of corporate civil-rights logic.

Developer Rafael “RC” Concepcion, a former Syracuse journalism professor, said DeICER had 30,000 users when Apple pulled it. “It isn’t meant to harvest people — it’s meant to inform people,” he said. “Recording public officials is not harassment. It’s democracy.”

From DeICER to Windbreaker: Tech Built for Oversight

Concepcion now wants to repurpose his privacy-first technology for Congress.

His latest platform, Windbreaker, could power the new federal tracker.

“It could be done in literally an hour,” he told Migrant Insider Thursday.

In a proposal sent to Garcia’s office reviewed by Migrant Insider, Concepcion offers Windbreaker to Oversight Democrats, describing a system that verifies reports through GPS and photo metadata, cross-checks authenticity, and stores no personal data.

“This isn’t software waiting to be funded,” the proposal reads. “It’s a shared infrastructure waiting to be adopted.” Not a week after Apple killed his app on their platform, Concepcion is already working with organizations in Chicago, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.

“DEICER platform could be implemented across states and can be used as a reporting structure and citizen facing platform to answer questions and inform on their rights,” he said on Thursday. “To get a whole of state approach ± you need to show that you’re willing to solve problems. That’s where these tools can be most helpful,” he added.

“A Ledger, Not a Map”

“This is a ledger,” a senior aide to Garcia Wednesday of the first-ever federal ICE tracker, adding: “It’s time Congress started keeping receipts.” How those receipts are gathered and where they are kept will matter.

In addition to banning DEICER, Apple also removed an app just last week that was meant to be platform for crowdsourcing evidence of abuses by immigration agents emboldened by a reckless policy dash to create a new secret police force with national jurisdiction and the blunt, sweeping authority to operate with utter impunity in American communities, especially those of color.

MY TAKE: Garcia has the opportunity to do something very important and impactful with his “master ICE tracker.” Now, he must execute by rolling out the tracker in coming weeks, as promised; then work with his colleagues in Congress and allies everywhere to encourage participation on a national level.

A minimum effort (a Google Form occasionally tended on the backend by an intern) will not due for this, not when Garcia has the chance to arm Americans with a digital sledgehammer aimed squarely at the black box of our ongoing federal immigration enforcement catastrophe.

On Wednesday, Illinois secretary of state Alexi Giannoulias unveiled a new initiative called the “Plate Watch” hotline, encouraging residents to report cases in which law enforcement vehicles appear to be using invalid or altered plates to evade identification during federal immigration raids.

In a video statement online, Giannoulias pointed to a viral video in which a federal immigration officer can be seen telling a protester next to his car that he can record him all he wants since “we change the plates out everyday”.

“I have a big problem with that … Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois registered vehicles is illegal and as secretary of state, I have zero tolerance for this type of illegal activity. We are investigating these allegations as we speak,” Giannoulias said.

“No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities,” he added.

Under Illinois state law, penalties for displaying an unauthorized license plate, obscuring or modifying license plates in any way include fines and potential jail time. The Illinois secretary of state’s office also has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicle’s license plates in such instances.

Additionally, Illinois registered vehicles must display license plates in both the front and the back. Vehicles registered in other states may only require a rear license plate and all vehicles driving on Illinois roads must have proper licensing in accordance with laws of their state, the Illinois secretary of state’s office said.

Earlier this month, a US district judge ordered federal immigration officers in the Chicago area to wear body cameras following repeated deployments of pepper balls, smoke grenades, tear gas against protestors and even local police.

As the Trump administration ramps up federal immigration raids – drawing widespread opposition from the public, Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups, several states are moving to block immigration officers from hiding their identities. The push follows instances of agents using unmarked vehicles to detain people on the streets without identifying themselves or presenting warrants.

In September, California passed a bill to ban masks for most law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while carrying out their operations.

Earlier this summer, Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require federal immigration officers to visibly display their agency name and either their own name or badge number, ensuring that tactical gear or clothing does not obscure it. The bill would also ban non-medical face coverings that conceal an officer’s identity.

Leavitt's comment at Thursday's White House press briefing, in which she also criticized other ICE tracker apps that ""left-wing activists have created,"" came after Noem took to X to warn against the proposal, announced this week by Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif.

""Let’s call this what it is: a pipeline that will funnel information on American law enforcement directly into the hands of anarchists, domestic terrorists, and cartel members,"" Noem claimed in her post.

The post included a clip of Garcia at a news conference alongside Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Monday in which he announced the plan for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee to launch such a tracker on its website.

“Over the course of the next couple of weeks, the Oversight Committee will be launching on their website a master ICE tracker where we are going to be essentially tracking every single instance that we can verify that the community will be able to send us information on,” the California Democrat said. “And it will be all available in one central place.”

Garcia, who is the top Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, joined Bass at the news conference in Los Angeles in a bid to put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions in the city and call for a congressional investigation, according to a press release from the mayor’s office.

The same day, Garcia, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is the top Democratic member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the upper chamber, sent a letter to Noem demanding answers and records relating to reports of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens.

A day before Noem's post, Bondi took to X to similarly highlight the tracker announcement and accuse Garcia and Blumenthal for ""trying to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.""

“@TheJusticeDept has ZERO tolerance for violence against law enforcement — we will prosecute any person who physically assaults our agents,"" Bondi's post continued.

Garcia responded to Bondi with his own post on X, appearing to reference a ProPublica report earlier this month about 107 American citizens being arrested by DHS as well as the saga on Capitol Hill regarding the release of files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“Hey @AGPamBondi, ICE detaining over 170 U.S. citizens is not them 'just doing their jobs,'"" Garcia wrote. “But since you have the time to tweet at me—when are you going to stop covering for pedophiles and release the Epstein files?”

President Donald Trump made immigration and border security an essential focus of his pitch to voters as a candidate in 2024, promising to carry out the largest “mass deportation"" effort in history, and the issue has been a central focus of his second term in office.

The administration’s enforcement actions in communities across the country have led to an outcry from Democrats, who have launched efforts pushing back, such as seeking to ban agents from wearing masks and requiring them to visibly show their badges. A handful of Republicans, meanwhile, have urged Trump to focus efforts on immigrants with criminal records specifically.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime foe of the president, this week said her office was launching a portal to review federal immigration enforcement actions in her state.

“New Yorkers who were present should submit videos or photos, and we will review and investigate any violations of the law,” James wrote in a post on X.

Los Angeles became ground zero for Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to American cities when he sent units to the streets against the wishes of California’s Democratic governor to quell protests against his administration’s immigration enforcement actions. Since then, he has ordered troops and federal law enforcement agents to several cities as part of his crime and immigration crackdowns.

Amid the administration’s sweeping campaign, officials, including Noem and Bondi, have sought to sound the alarm about an increase in threats against ICE agents and federal law enforcement officials. Noem has said the administration is “hardening” ICE facilities, particularly adding more security measures, including snipers on roofs, and looking at “purchasing more buildings” in cities such as Chicago and Portland to operate out of.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/trumpantifaroundtable_100825,N,,2025-10-23 19:57:33.561313

LA was the first stop before they decided to hit up D.C., then swung back around to Memphis, and now Oregon’s taking center stage. Okay, sure, the whole tour bus analogy doesn’t really work when you consider that National Guard troops are deployed locally and don’t literally travel like a minor league baseball team, but you get the point.

If you’ve been following the federalization of the National Guard over state objections, you know it’s been met with plenty of resistance — including in the courts. A federal judge eventually ordered their withdrawal after ruling that deploying the Guard in California violated the Posse Comitatus Act (which generally bans domestic use of the military for law enforcement unless Congress specifically authorizes it). In Chicago, multiple lawsuits quickly led to a series of restraining orders blocking troop activity.

Here’s a detailed look at how we got here, what’s happened so far in the courts, and where things stand.

POTUS v. PDX

The roots of Oregon v. Trump trace back to a summer marked by escalating tensions over immigration enforcement and protest activity near Portland’s ICE facility. This past June, federal authorities arrested an asylum-seeker at Portland’s Immigration Court for the first time. That catalyzed a series of small but persistent protests outside the city’s ICE building.

While these protests were initially more energetic, sometimes involving up to 100 people, they quickly tapered off. By late summer, most demonstrations involved fewer than 30 participants and rarely required police intervention. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers monitored the situation closely, activating specialized teams only when necessary, and local officials repeatedly emphasized that they had matters under control.

Despite this, POTUS began referencing Portland in public statements as a city “under siege” from “domestic terrorists,” promising to restore order with “Full Force” if necessary. Late last month, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was directing the newly-rebranded “War Department” to deploy troops to “protect War ravaged Portland” and its ICE facilities from Antifa and other “domestic terrorists.”

That same day, Major General Timothy L. Rieger requested that Oregon Governor Tina Kotek authorize mobilization of the state’s National Guard for federal purposes—a request she firmly rejected. Hours later, Secretary Hegseth issued a memorandum federalizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for a period of 60 days – but state and local officials were already one step ahead.

Oregon and Portland Push Back

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield immediately teamed up with Portland City Attorney Robert Taylor. The same day the memo was issued, these two jointly filed a comprehensive federal lawsuit challenging the President’s orders on statutory and constitutional grounds. The 34-page complaint laid out an aggressive argument that Trump had trampled state authority and disregarded limits on federalizing the Guard.

The core legal battlefield quickly emerged around 10 U.S.C. § 12406: the Cold War relic that authorizes a president to call up a state’s guard only in the event of “invasion, rebellion,” or failure of regular forces to enforce federal law. The plaintiffs argued that none of these circumstances remotely applied in Portland: there had been no foreign invaders, no insurrection, and, if anything, federal police had been overzealous in their ICE-related activities.

To bolster their point, Oregon borrowed an idea from its sunnier southern neighbor and invoked the Posse Comitatus Act. The lawsuit made clear: no matter how heated the President’s rhetoric about ""war-ravaged Portland"" or ""domestic terrorists,"" civil unrest in the form of burnout ICE protests did not meet any of these high bars. State sovereignty, the Tenth Amendment, and the principles of separation of powers, they said, were all being bulldozed in the process.

Marching Orders Meet Court Orders

Rayfield and Taylor sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) seeking to halt any mobilization, and federal District Court Judge Karin Immergut granted the motion on October 4. She noted that the protests had barely registered as a disturbance in recent weeks, let alone an emergency justifying military intervention. Immergut was unconvinced by the White House’s insistence on “rebellion” and found little merit in the notion that Portland constituted some ungoverned war zone in need of troops.

But that relief didn’t last long. Within twenty‑four hours, reports surfaced that the Trump administration was exploring a workaround: if Oregon’s National Guard couldn’t deploy, out‑of‑state units would. The War Department began organizing troops from California and Texas (roughly 300 and 400 soldiers respectively) to supplement federal law enforcement in Portland.

Plaintiffs rushed back to federal court and secured a second TRO on October 5 – this time specifically barring deployment of any federalized National Guard members (homegrown or borrowed) within Oregon’s borders. In rapid-fire succession, the Trump administration appealed both orders to the Ninth Circuit and requested an emergency administrative stay to unfreeze the deployments.

Ninth Circuit Raises the Stakes

On October 8, a Ninth Circuit panel issued an administrative stay, basically tabling Judge Immergut’s earlier TRO while it considered whether to leave the Guard benched for longer. Meanwhile, the legal filings piled up in both directions, with amici from former military brass to state governors weighing in.

Then, on October 20, a divided three-judge Ninth Circuit panel issued its highly-anticipated ruling. By a 2-1 vote, the court found that Trump had at least a “substantial likelihood” of prevailing, siding with the argument that stretched-thin federal law enforcement and national security needs could justify his invocation of §12406(3). The majority stressed that under federal law, the President is owed broad deference on questions of necessity — especially when regular forces are (in the administration’s view) tied up or insufficient in responding to unrest.

Judge Susan Graber’s strongly dissented. She insisted that the record showed nothing close to a rebellion or failure of federal forces, and warned that military intervention without hard evidence eroded the most basic state and constitutional protections.

Next Tour Stop: SCOTUS?

Does that mean that Guard boots are on Burnside? Not quite. The TROs, for now, remain largely intact pending additional Ninth Circuit review.

In the aftermath, both deployed and would-be deployed troops found themselves parked in legal limbo. Local news reported that the Oregon Guard units remained sequestered at Camp Rilea, out on the coast, and a detachment of California National Guard members (pre-trained for crowd-control duties) were cooling their heels at Camp Withycombe, just outside Portland. Neither group was permitted to set foot in Portland proper.

Governor Tina Kotek did little to mask her irritation as she requested more information from the federal government and called for judicial oversight. Attorney General Rayfield pushed even further, petitioning the Ninth Circuit for an en banc review, raising the stakes and framing the legal drama as an issue of deep constitutional consequence. While the courts haggle over briefing deadlines, it’s very possible the Supreme Court will decide to step in.

(AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant detainees.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its care, saying pregnant detainees get regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

In addition, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement Wednesday that such detentions are “exceedingly rare” — and that pregnant women currently account for less than 1% of the total number of ICE detainees in custody. The agency didn’t provide additional figures related to detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing — data that Democrats have sought for months.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union cites accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while detained in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody — including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

When asked about the letter, McLaughlin called it “another disgusting attempt to smear ICE.” She argued that the ACLU used “unsubstantiated” and “unverifiable claims.”

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of the women said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she’d been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and vaginal bleeding. During her time in detention, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU’s letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrests and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody. They demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

“Proper care for pregnancy is a basic human right, regardless of whether you are incarcerated or not and regardless of your immigration status,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat. She signed onto a Democratic Women’s Caucus letter to DHS officials in July sharing concerns about the “treatment of women” and demanding answers — including how many have given birth while detained.

Kamlager-Dove said she’s working on legislation that would “severely restrict the use of restraints on pregnant, laboring and postpartum women who are in federal custody.”

ICE guidelines already say that agents “should not detain, arrest, or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws” people “known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing,” based on a policy sent to the AP by DHS. But the document does state that such people may be detained and held in custody under “exceptional circumstances” or if their release is prohibited by law.

The policy also prohibits using restraints on pregnant detainees, but here too there are exceptions — including if there is a serious threat that the detainee will hurt herself or others, or if “an immediate and credible risk” of escape cannot be “reasonably minimized” through other methods.

The raids come as Chicago awaits the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on whether Trump can deploy the National Guard to the city or not. White House lawyers have argued immigration agents cannot enforce federal law without the help of the military. Also on Oct. 22, administration lawyers agreed to leave in place a lower court judge’s decision barring troop deployments until the higher court rules.

Agents in the morning descended on the commercial corridor of Little Village, a South Side neighborhood and heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Photos and video from the scene show masked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents sprinting after people and local business owners locking their doors ahead of agents.

""A reign of terror was brought upon our neighborhood,"" local Ald. Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY. ""They took at least eight people, of those eight, four were U.S. citizens, and two were members of my staff.""

The raids on the city’s most prominent Mexican neighborhood come as part of President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, his Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown. Trump launched the blitz on Sept. 8, saying it was needed to catch ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Many local critics say instead innocent people are being left terrorized.

Federal judges in the Northern District of Illinois handling cases related to the blitz have begun issuing rulings against the president over Homeland Security’s aggressive tactics and barring the White House from deploying the National Guard.

But the rulings out of the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago have not slowed the pace of immigration enforcement raids throughout the region. On Oct. 22, agents raided the historic South Side Mexican community and a neighboring suburb; on Oct. 21, an Illinois state house representative says federal agents stopped him at gunpoint for documenting raids on the North Side; and a Chicago alderwoman says she was also stopped by agents for documenting their activities.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to requests for comments on the raids.

Agency spokespeople last answered questions about the blitz on Oct. 8, saying ""ICE and U.S. Border Patrol officers have arrested more than 1,500 illegal aliens — including criminal pedophiles, murderers, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers.""

Here’s the latest on the blitz in Chicago.

Is the National Guard coming?

Trump moved to deploy hundreds of Illinois and Texas National Guard troops to the Chicago region as part of his blitz campaign. But a federal judge in downtown Chicago temporarily barred him from doing so.

White House lawyers had argued that a potential ""rebellion"" was underway in Chicago. Trump administration lawyers cited protests outside a local immigration enforcement facility and in response to federal agents making arrests in city neighborhoods.

U.S. District Judge April M. Perry questioned whether the Homeland Security allegations White House lawyers cited in their arguments were ""tethered to reality.""

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld Perry's decision. But Trump’s lawyers appealed again and the case is now before the Supreme Court. It’s unclear when they could rule.

Trump administration lawyers have agreed to let Perry’s order barring the National Guard deployments remain in place until the Supreme Court rules. Legal experts say the White House’s offer indicates they believe the high court will rule in their favor, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times.

Federal judge questions ICE over aggressive tactics

A group of journalists, clergy and protesters also filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security agents over their use of chemical weapons on people in the Chicago area. In an Oct. 9 court hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton said federal agents had deployed $100,000 of non-lethal weapons to stop ""rioters"" from hindering immigration enforcement.

U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order limiting agents’ use of chemical weapons in the Chicago area and compelling them to wear identification.

Ellis amended her order a week later on Oct. 16 to ensure agents wear body-worn cameras after she was concerned that immigration agents were not following her orders. She also ordered top Homeland Security officials into court to testify.

Customs and Border Patrol Deputy Incident Cmdr. Kyle Harvick and Deputy Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director Shawn Byers both told the judge on Oct. 20 that agents were following her orders to issue warnings before using chemical weapons.

Locals being teargassed say they have not heard any warnings being used. Harvick and Byers’ testimony comes after Perry found in a separate case that Homeland Security’s account of events in the city was not reliable.

Harvick also justified federal agents shooting a local pastor with a pepper ball. A clip of the incident shows Rev. David Black standing among a group of protesters before he’s shot directly in the head by an agent posted on a rooftop building.

""What’s not being shown is he was given multiple commands to move,"" Harvick said.

Byers said 75 people have been arrested in the Chicago area in connection with attempting to block immigration enforcement.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/USAT/86745755007-20251016-t-174224-z-535581252-rc-2-d-4-haduh-0-z-rtrmadp-3-usashutdownlawenforcement.JPG?crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&width=2975&height=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-23 14:17:24.903104

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has previously stated that sending troops to the city will not make it safer. The city's attorney also said he will sue to keep soldiers from being deployed to San Francisco.

Newsom's press office on Wednesday referred to the pattern of sending the Guard after creating ""stress and chaos"" with federal agents as an ""authoritarian playbook.""

San Francisco-based Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said earlier this month that he would welcome National Guard troops to the city ahead of the Dreamforce conference. But he later apologized for the remarks and said the troops' presence wasn't needed.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson issued the following statement: ""As the Secretary said on Monday, DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists—in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.""

The friends “called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” because “the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress,” Trump wrote in a post to his Truth Social platform.

“I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,” Trump wrote. “I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?’”

Two tech industry CEOs — Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce — were among the “great people” who called Trump to say “the future of San Francisco is great,” the president said.

“They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!” Trump wrote.

Nvidia declined to comment on behalf of Huang. CNN has also reached out to Salesforce for comment on behalf of Benioff.

Trump had long signaled he planned to deploy resources to San Francisco after similar operations in Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.

But in a separate statement Thursday morning, Lurie said Trump had assured him during a Wednesday night call that he “was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco.”

Remember: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff backtracked last week from comments suggesting Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco.

The mother of Katie Abraham — an Illinois woman who authorities say was killed at age 20 in a drunken-driving hit-and-run collision by a man who was in the United States illegally — said she is breaking her silence after her daughter was made the face of President Donald Trump’s amped up immigration enforcement push in Chicago.

“Losing a child unlocked a pain I never knew existed. Losing a child to a crime adds to the depths of despair. Having my child’s legacy be associated with a politically charged and controversial operation instead of the positivity and light she contributed to those within her community is simply unbearable,” Abraham’s mom, Denise Lorence, wrote in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune, headlined “My daughter is the face of Operation Midway Blitz. I am reclaiming her legacy.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in September that launched the enforcement push, which it named “Operation Midway Blitz,” in Abraham’s honor.

“I have not spoken out since it began, but as Katie’s mother, I can no longer stay silent,” Lorence continued. “The Department of Homeland Security said its immigration enforcement operation in Chicago is named in Katie’s honor. But Katie would not have wanted this.”

She said she decided to speak out after realizing the operation’s association with her daughter wasn’t going away.

“She would not have wanted to be associated with a campaign that targets Chicago — a city she not only loved but felt safe in,” Lorence said.

Her daughter wasn’t political, she avoided confrontation and “was the person people wanted to be around,” she said.

“Whether or not you agree with Operation Midway Blitz is not the story I am here to write,” Lorence wrote, but “she did not choose to be thrust into this political spotlight to advance an operation she knew nothing about.”

Lorence acknowledged that Abraham’s father, Joe Abraham, and his wife agreed that Katie’s name could be used for the operation. Joe Abraham previously told CNN the federal government failed “miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”

President Donald Trump said he feels empowered to send troops into any city he sees fit after an appeals court ruling this week endorsed his deployment into Portland, Oregon.

The Trump administration is urging the US Supreme Court to allow a similar deployment to Chicago, and the justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of troops to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city’s suburbs.

Here are the legal battles playing out:

California

The Trump administration is planning to send federal agents to San Francisco as early as today ahead of an immigration and crime crackdown, a source told CNN. Plans for the deployment had not been finalized and could be called off due to publicity, the source said.

San Francisco’s mayor announced citywide preparations to respond to deployments, and Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to sue over the action. “It might be that the Trump administration will send National Guards, or at least attempt to, in connection with and in conjunction with the ICE raids that seem imminent in San Francisco,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.

Newsom also was critical of the possible impact of deployments on upcoming elections. “You send masked men to the cities you want to militarize,” he told reporters. “You dial it up around election time. … You suppress the vote.”

Newsom announced he will deploy the California National Guard under his command on a “humanitarian mission” to support food banks as the government shutdown stalls food benefits.

Meanwhile, an appeals court is weighing whether to limit Trump’s ability to continue deploying members of National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area.

Oregon

A federal judge in Oregon will hold a hearing Friday over whether to dissolve or suspend a restraining order that bars the deployment of National Guard soldiers to Portland.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland are pushing for an appeals court to reconsider its ruling allowing the federal government to deploy the National Guard.

The brief calls for an “en banc” review, which would involve a larger group of judges from the appeals court revisiting the ruling that was handed down in a 2-1 decision from a three-judge panel earlier this week.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, is urging the court not to grant the review.

Illinois

US District Court Judge April Perry ordered an extension of the order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment after she temporarily blocked the deployment in the state this month.

The extension will likely remain in place until there’s a full trial on the issue or the Supreme Court weighs in.

Tennessee

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said there had been a “surge” in arrests, bookings and bail settings for misdemeanor offenses in Memphis that is linked to the arrival of some federal agents and National Guard troops to the city.

Harris and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit last week against the governor and the state’s attorney general for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump. A temporary injunction will be considered at a hearing on November 3, and a judge has denied a request to prevent deployment before the hearing.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-2025-10-09t134433z-1957454338-rc2d8haafekb-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-23 14:18:12.747610

The buildup comes after the Republican president said he plans to deploy troops to crack down on crime in the city, with the San Francisco Chronicle reporting that more than 100 federal agents have been dispatched to a U.S. Coast Guard base across the Bay.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has painstakingly tried to avoid Trump’s ire, responded to the escalation with a messaging pivot. … While still not mentioning Trump by name in a livestreamed address, he offered his sharpest critique of the federal administration yet, projecting a sense of unity to a liberal city waiting on edge.

“These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel,” Lurie said, surrounded by local law enforcement leaders and members of the Board of Supervisors. “They are intentionally creating a dangerous situation in the name of public safety.”

Details of the enforcement operation are unclear, including whether Trump intends to also call up California National Guard troops as he has done in other blue cities. … Jaime Ruiz, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, did not directly respond to a question about whether Guard members will be involved.

“DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists — in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco,” Ruiz said in an email.

The enforcement operation could involve immigration sweeps in other major Bay Area cities, including San Jose and Oakland. It comes after tech billionaires like David Sacks, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called for the president to send in the military (Benioff later apologized for his comments).

But those remarks, among others, appear to have piqued Trump’s attention. On Sunday, he suggested local leaders or residents had asked for federal intervention: “The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump told Fox News.

The White House has not clarified whom Trump was referring to, and city leaders say they’ve had no contract with Trump’s administration.

The threat of federal agents or National Guard rolling down Market Street has caused San Francisco politicians to lock arms — a rare moment of unity for a city where moderate and progressive Democrats are often bitterly divided.

“This is a moment where everyone has got to put aside their political differences and stay strong,” said former Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a leader of the city’s progressive wing and a frequent critic of Lurie. “This is not a comfortable position for the leader of any American city to be in.”

WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced.

CAMPAIGN YEAR(S)

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: SWALWELL FOR GOVERNOR? — Polling being conducted this week is testing how Eric Swalwell would fare if he ran for governor, Playbook has learned.

Lisa Tucker, a political consultant for Swalwell, told Playbook the survey did not come from the representative’s camp and that she didn’t know who was responsible for it. But the poll, viewed by Playbook, is nevertheless stirring chatter about Swalwell’s future.

One question tells respondents that Swalwell “could run in 2026 for either Congress or Governor,” before asking whether he’d be more effective in fighting the president in Congress or as governor.

Another tests Swalwell’s chances in a horse race against the major candidates who are in the race already. But first, it tells respondents that Katie Porter’s critics have faulted her for a “reputation for mistreating and bullying her staff” and for claiming special interests spent to “rig” last year’s Senate race against her.

Swalwell fueled rumors that he was considering running when, last week, he criticized Porter at a press conference after videos surfaced of her threatening to walk out of an interview and tearing into a staffer.

“To what I saw with Katie Porter, when you’re taking on a fascist, you can’t get flustered, and as we’re looking to who’s going to replace Gavin Newsom, we need a fighter and a protector, and not somebody who gets flustered,” Swalwell told reporters.

The survey had an overwhelmingly positive slant, suggesting it was commissioned by people supporting Swalwell. Questions tested the Congress member’s favorability after prompting respondents with information on his upbringing, a video of him at a “No Kings” protest, and by telling them that he supported the tough-on-crime Proposition 36 in a break with many Democrats.

Swalwell hasn’t said whether he’ll run, and Tucker declined to comment further.

REDISTRICTING WARS

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: CARUSO PONIES UP — Rick Caruso, the will-he-or-won’t-he contender for governor (or Los Angeles mayor), is putting his own stamp on his support for Proposition 50, Newsom’s redistricting ballot measure. Caruso, who previously pledged to financially support the effort, is sending out mail and robocalls to roughly 100,000 prospective Democratic voters in Los Angeles urging them to vote yes.

The advocacy, which costs just shy of $100,000, is distinctly Caruso-centric. The mail piece features five different photos of the real estate developer, while the robocall features his voice chiming in with “urgent news for my fellow Democrats.”

“Republicans in Texas have rigged next year’s election to give themselves five new Congressional seats. It’s wrong and California has to push back,” Caruso says in the call.

The advertising is being done independently of the official ballot measure committee led by Newsom-land, though Playbook has been told the campaign got a heads-up that Caruso would be weighing in. Top Democrats on the campaign had been irked that Tom Steyer, another billionaire — and potential gubernatorial candidate — had flooded the airwaves with its own ads that touted Steyer’s push for impeachment, a politically fraught topic the ‘yes’ side had steered clear of in its own messaging. A spokesperson for the Newsom-led committee declined to comment on Caruso’s late-breaking involvement. — Melanie Mason

GERRYMONEYING — It’s not as much as he won playing cards in Las Vegas, but Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, like Newsom a potential presidential candidate in 2028, donated $250,000 to Newsom’s committee supporting the Yes on Prop 50 campaign.

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: MAPPING LATINO POWER — Prop 50 would not only maintain but enhance Latino voters’ power in California House races, political scientists at CalTech and Cal Poly Pomona conclude in a new analysis.

The redrawn maps would keep the current number of Latino-majority districts in California, 16, while adding two districts in which 30 to 50 percent of voting-age people are Latino.

“Our analysis finds that the proposed map will likely not negatively impact Latino voting power,” political scientists Raquel Centeno and Jarred Cuellar write. “The proposed map instead diffuses and enhances that power across more districts, and in many ways reflects the changing demographics of communities within the state.”

Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia’s district would no longer have a Latino majority if Prop 50 passes, while Republican Rep. Ken Calvert’s seat — which would shift westward and become more Democratic — would gain Latino-majority status. (Garcia is running for reelection in what would still be a safe seat, while Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis is pursuing Calvert’s redrawn district.)

CA vs. TRUMP

FIRST IN POLITICO: DRILL GAVIN DRILL — The Trump administration plans to propose opening federal waters in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to offshore drilling, a move that is likely to antagonize coastal states governors — and make a direct jab at Gavin Newsom, Ben Lefebvre reports.

Full details of the plan were not yet known, but a push to bring drilling rigs to untouched sections of the U.S. coastline brought bipartisan opposition when Trump tried to carry out a similar plan during his first administration.

NEWSOMLAND

RISKING HEAVEN — Newsom suggested Trump’s allies are at risk of not getting into heaven, saying they’ll “have a lot to reconcile at the pearly gates,” Juliann Ventura writes.

“To see people in positions of power and influence do absolutely nothing when they must know better — and I believe they do … Boy, they’re going to have a lot to reconcile at the pearly gates,” Newsom said at a press conference Wednesday during the California Economic Summit in Stockton, in California’s Central Valley.

AND GETTING ‘GRACE’ — Newsom, asked if he had advice for Porter, a front-runner to succeed him, following the viral videos of her berating a staffer and threatening to walk out of an interview, offered support instead, Juliann writes in.

“Oh, I got no advice,” Newsom told reporters in Stockton on Wednesday. “I need advice. We all do, a little humility when you’re in this business. We all have those moments. So I don’t, I know people, it’s political, and people are, you know, jumping to cast whatever criticism or aspersion. She acknowledged that. And so look: a little more humility and grace, because I think all of us have been on the other side of you and your camera, those moments where we weren’t our best self. So, no advice in that respect but I think grace.”

HOUSING

SHORT-TERM PAIN — A fight over short-term rental houses and vacation homes is brewing in San Diego. City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera has proposed asking voters in the city to approve a new tax on the nearly 11,000 properties that are being rented out for short-term use, either by individuals or through companies such as Airbnb, as well as vacation homes. The goal is to free up housing for people who live in San Diego and generate revenue for a city that was forced to raise fees and cut services to close a $350 million budget deficit earlier this year.

“It’s about restoring fairness and balance in our housing market,” argues Elo-Rivera, who’s aiming to get the measure before city voters on the June ballot. Details are in flux, but the initial proposal suggests an annual tax of $5,000 per bedroom, generating about $133 million.

But the proposal could be in for a rough ride, judging by its debut Wednesday before the council’s Rules Committee. Around 100 people testified against it, railing against a tax that would be in addition to the registration fees and transient occupancy taxes they already pay, and likely drive some of them out of the business altogether. Opponents say it would eliminate jobs for cleaners, handymen and landscapers who service the properties and provide fewer options for tourists. Supporters include housing advocates and municipal unions as well as city residents who say the proliferation of short-term rentals has hollowed out neighborhoods and made it harder to live in one of the most expensive American cities.

In the end, it cleared the committee in a 3-1 vote. City Councilmember Raul Campillo was the lone dissenter, arguing the measure unfairly punishes San Diegans who own short-term rentals, will hurt the economy, won’t generate as much revenue as projected and, at a minimum, should be held until the November ballot, when more people vote. The proposal will get a full financial analysis by the city and is expected to come back for another vote in January. — Ben Fox

EDUCATION

QUESTIONNAIRE BLOWBACK — The California Faculty Association apologized for a questionnaire it circulated to candidates running for public office that asked if they had accepted money or endorsements from the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California following fierce blowback from Jewish lawmakers and organizations. In a statement Wednesday, CFA acknowledged the question “created an impression that we are specifically targeting Jewish groups” and apologized for “not being more careful with the formulation of that question, and the confusion and hurt feelings that this article has caused.”

The 29,000-member union said it shouldn’t have included JPAC, which does not make campaign contributions or endorse candidates, in the question and only intended to “have a discussion on issues like academic freedom in order to engage in conversation as part of our endorsement process.”

CFA’s apology came a day after members of the Legislature’s Jewish Caucus said it wouldn’t work with the union unless it acknowledged the “offensive and inappropriate nature of this question” and committed to “not discriminate against Jews or those who seek to partner with the Jewish community.” — Eric He

BAY AREA

END OF THE WUNDER-YEARS — Jim Wunderman, the longtime president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, announced he will leave the business advocacy group at the end of the year to take a job as head of public affairs for California Forever — tech titan Jan Sramek’s vision to build a massive new city in the fields of rural Solano County.

In his resignation letter, Wunderman touted the potential he sees in California Forever, including its pitch to create advanced manufacturing jobs and a major working shipyard. He added, “The notion of producing quality, affordable, dense, market rate housing and middle wage jobs at scale is so attractive and epitomizes everything we stand for.”

During Wunderman’s 22-year tenure at the Bay Area Council, the organization emerged as a powerhouse in shaping civic affairs and the regulatory climate in one of the nation’s most affluent regions.

CLIMATE AND ENERGY

THE NUMBERS ARE IN — The dust has settled on the Trump administration’s $8 billion axing of Energy Department funding, and California was the biggest loser in the nation. The feds cut more projects in the Golden State than anywhere else, according to a POLITICO analysis. Now, many of the state’s congressional leaders are calling foul, demanding a formal investigation into the terminations. Read last night’s California Climate to find out whose funding got cut and what the state’s leaders have to say about it.

Top Talkers

RIDING HIGH — A CBS/YouGov poll had Prop 50 passing with 62 percent support, one of the highest marks of any public survey on the redistricting measure. Of the supporters, three-quarters said they were motivated by a desire to oppose Donald Trump — who has been central to the yes campaign’s messaging.

CONSUMER WATCHDOG WOOFS — Consumer Watchdog produced a podcast featuring accounts of people whose homes burned in this year’s Los Angeles fires to show “how large insurance companies deny consumers the benefits they are owed in the wake of disasters.” The advocacy group’s attempt to shape public opinion comes as Los Angeles homeowners face surcharges to help insurers pay for the fires.

JB Pritzker announced on Thursday the creation of the Illinois Accountability Commission, a new state body tasked with investigating and documenting alleged civil rights abuses tied to federal immigration enforcement operations.

Priztker said the order establishes the commission within the Illinois Department of Human Rights to ensure ""truth, transparency and justice"" amid what he described as ""military-style assaults"" carried out under the Trump administration’s ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

""In the short time, we have witnessed countless acts of harassment and intimidation and brutality and abuse of power perpetrated against law-abiding civilians across our communities,"" Pritzker said. ""Trump's masked agents have detained innocent Americans, citizens and legal residents.""

The Illinois Accountability Commission will focus on three core missions: Creating a public record of reported abuses, documenting the impact on families and recommending actions to prevent further harm.

The commission will be chaired by Ruben Castillo, former chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Pritzker said the commission’s findings would serve as an official record for future accountability efforts.

""It is imperative that none of the impropriety, brutality and harassment perpetrated upon our people goes unnoticed. Every instance of abuse of law, breaking or violent, and violations of rights needs to be documented and archived,"" Pritzker said.

Immigration agents in Chicago

Local perspective:

The new executive order comes a day after aChicago alderman said federal immigration agents detained multiple people in Little Village, including U.S. citizens and two of his staff members.

Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) said the agents detained two members of his staff, Jacqueline Lopez and Elianne Bahena, the alderman’s chief of staff who also serves as an elected police commissioner.

Both staff members are U.S. citizens, Rodriguez said.

""All residents have the right to peacefully observe ICE/CBP activity. The federal government continues to claim that those who exercise their rights are breaking the law – these claims have been repeatedly proven as false,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.

The alderman added that the agents were ""operating lawlessly, demonstrating utter disregard for our constitutional rights.""

According to community members, a total of eight people were taken into ICE custody.

By Wednesday evening, city officials confirmed that Lopez, Bahena, and others detained during the incident were released from ICE custody after seven hours.

Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino talked to Fox News about the Little Village raid yesterday. He said he didn't see his agents do anything wrong.

""[I was at] a protest there in the Little Village area of Chicago just now and I watched our agents. They operate with extreme professionalism. They do everything right. I've not seen one instance of something that was out of control …. We are well versed in everything from the use of force to Title 8 immigration law. What we do is legal, ethical and moral,"" Bovino said.

License plate swapping

Dig deeper:

Pritzker's announcement comes a day after Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias issued a warning to federal immigration agents after reports surfaced that ICE agents have been changing or flipping state-issued license plates while carrying out what he described as ""military-style deportation efforts"" in the Chicago area.

A video circulating on social media appears to show a federal agent telling someone, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

In response, Giannoulias said, ""Swapping out license plates or tampering with them to avoid or conceal detection is illegal, unsafe and will not be tolerated in Illinois. No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-10-23-09h41m26s784.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-23 14:02:43.207728

“I would say that 97% of them would pass.” “Why would a law enforcement agency want a candidate who can’t pass the physical standards, firearms standards or the basic law enforcement standards.
Former law enforcement officers who have been hired by ICE can complete courses virtually.
We already know what happens when you hire a law enforcement agent with this speed and with this attitude,” Pierce said.
CBP’s hiring push then opened the federal agency up to risk.","When the Trump administration secured billions in funding for the Department of Homeland Security, officials immediately kicked off an aggressive push to hire thousands more deportation officers. It came with a hefty financial incentive: up to a $50,000 signing bonus.

But the effort has hit roadblocks every step of the way.

Multiple sources tell CNN that behind the scenes, ICE was ill-prepared to onboard a surge of agents in a matter of months, resulting in cut corners and people slipping through the cracks, including an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration who had to be plucked out of the pool of candidates after the agency flagged them to ICE.

“It’s a shit show,” an administration official familiar with the efforts told CNN.

The ongoing recruitment efforts were the source of tension in a multi-agency meeting this week with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the driving force behind President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda. Miller expressed frustration with senior ICE officials over the slow pace at which new recruits are hitting the streets to make immigration arrests, according to the administration official.

The signing bonus also prompted discussions internally because it’s not contingent on a key part of the hiring process, which is passing the academy, another source said. Even candidates who don’t pass the academy and are slotted for administrative jobs are still pocketing thousands of dollars.

Current and former ICE officials have argued that the agency — housed under DHS — has historically been strapped for resources and personnel. When Trump signed his sweeping agenda bill into law, it set up ICE to be the most well-funded police force in the federal government over the next four years. ICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029.

When the hiring push first got underway this year, local law enforcement, military veterans, and retired ICE employees received emails from the administration, urging them to join the ranks of the federal agency charged with Trump’s deportation agenda. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took to the airwaves. And the department flooded social media with callouts for so-called “Homeland Defenders,” and medieval images, painting officers as knights.

By January, the agency aims to bring on board 10,000 deportation officers, according to DHS. The speedy hiring push has resulted in minimal background checks, absent or confusing instructions for new hires, and physically unfit people showing up to the academy, sources told CNN. In some cases, human resources was not effectively communicating what field office new hires had to report to or how much they would be paid.

Within ICE and even up to the White House, “HR is not equipped to hire en masse. … No one has support staff to support this,” one former senior ICE official told CNN.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has assigned some of its staff to assist ICE HR staffing operations amid the influx of applications, which DHS says is upwards of 175,000 applicants.

In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin dismissed the idea that the department was struggling in its recruitment efforts and said the agency is maintaining its “high fitness and training standards.”

“CNN is cherry picking individual cases out of the more than 175,000 applications of individuals who applied to join ICE law enforcement to help us remove murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists from our country,” she said. “The fact of the matter is the vast majority of new officers — more than 85% — brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy.”

CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment

A ‘borderline impossible’ task

To become an ICE officer, there are multiple steps involved, including applying online; being virtually sworn in if hired; reporting for duty at a field office; as well as attending the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, where almost all federal law enforcement officers receive training.

The process can often take months. The administration has cut down training for ICE officers to 47 days.

According to sources familiar with the current hiring process, there are no longer interviews, marking a change from previous hiring practices. The agency is conducting provisional clearances with a promise of fuller background checks down the line, and officers are virtually swearing in new hires instead of doing so in person.

The Atlantic and NBC News earlier reported on some aspects of ICE’s recruiting struggles.

Former ICE officials told CNN that the agency faced challenges before when it tried to ramp up onboarding, including during the first Trump administration, because of rigorous vetting and training.

“They’re trying to do something borderline impossible and they’re doing it too fast,” said Scott Shuchart, former head of policy at ICE during the Biden administration.

Current and former officials chalk up the confusion among new recruits to the speed and overwhelmed staffing operation. New recruits, for example, are getting unclear guidance on when to show up to their assigned field office and then either inquiring with the academy or just showing up, according to multiple sources.

Other recruits are being pulled because of poor vetting. In one scenario, an informant for the DEA was conditionally offered a job with ICE, but DEA caught it and contacted ICE. In another case, an individual had a pending gun charge, arrived at the academy and was sent home when it came to light.

The DEA declined to respond. Due to the government shutdown, the agency’s public affairs unit tends to only respond to inquiries related to imminent threats to public safety and security.

FLETC offers multiple courses, including academic classes on the Fourth Amendment and immigration law, as well as physical arrest techniques and firearm instruction.

One of the impediments to quickly adding large numbers of gun-toting officers has been the physical requirements, according to multiple sources. Recruits are expected to do 32 sit-ups, 15 push-ups, and run one-and-a-half miles in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

More than 200 people have been terminated from the academy for not meeting physical or academic standards, according to a source, meaning that they are returned to their field office where they could be assigned administrative work and return to the academy at a later date.

Robert “Bob” Burnett, a longtime firearms instructor at FLETC who is now retired, told CNN that when he was at the academy, it was exceedingly rare for a recruit to drop out. “I didn’t see that very often,” he explained. “I would say that 97% of them would pass.”

“Why would a law enforcement agency want a candidate who can’t pass the physical standards, firearms standards or the basic law enforcement standards. It would be a liability. Most civilian jobs have special requirements to get the job. In my opinion, it’s a no brainer,” Burnett, who trained at the academy for more than two decades, told CNN.

Former law enforcement officers who have been hired by ICE can complete courses virtually.

Lessons from past surges

It’s not the first time the Department of Homeland Security has tried to quickly hire thousands of federal agents.

In the late 2000s, US Customs and Border Protection significantly increased its hiring of officers and agents. Between fiscal year 2006 through 2011, the agency increased the number of officers and agents along the US southern border by nearly 10,000, according to a 2012 Government Accountability Office report that reviewed CBP’s hiring practices. That was in a span of years; ICE is trying to accomplish the same in a matter of months.

The agency’s PR push at the time included advertisements at NASCAR, bull riding contests, among other places, said Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at Third Way, a think tank. “The advertisements were very much like the advertisements you’d see for video games — the bad guys and the good guys,” she added.

It’s reminiscent of what DHS is doing today.

“We already know how this is going to go. We already know what happens when you hire a law enforcement agent with this speed and with this attitude,” Pierce said.

CBP’s hiring push then opened the federal agency up to risk. The GAO report cited Homeland Security officials who testified that CBP’s increased hiring had “amplified the incentives and opportunities” for corruption, among other concerns.

“In particular, there have been a number of cases in which individuals, known as infiltrators, pursued employment at CBP solely to engage in mission-compromising activity,” the report found, adding that the agency also held concerns about employees who engaged in “corruption-related activities.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-04t173405z-1496775371-rc23lgatiepu-rtrmadp-3-migration-usa-new-york.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-23 14:17:28.384122

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request.
Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.
However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.
Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.","A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

""Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,"" said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.

Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.

The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.
This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space.
Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight.
DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has recorded its deadliest year since the early 2000s as agency officials push to increase the number of people in its custody.

According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year. The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.

Deaths reached a peak in 2025 for the first time since 32 deaths were recorded in 2004, and 20 deaths were recorded in 2005.

Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths. This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.

""Can staffing actually keep pace with the increase in population? And that becomes particularly challenging in more remote locations where it was already difficult to find qualified staff willing to come out and work,"" said Peter Mina, who worked at ICE for nearly a decade including most recently as the deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. ""And that just places risk all across the system, including, unfortunately, individuals in detention facing medical conditions that might result in their death.""

ICE did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the count.

Mina's former office at DHS was among those that would conduct investigations following a detainee death. Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight. CRCL was among the oversight offices at the department that saw hundreds of staff cuts earlier this year. Other CRCL employees have previously told NPR that the gutting of their office could result in more deaths in custody.

During the ongoing government shutdown, DHS has confirmed, the Office of Detention Oversight is not working.

So far this month, two more detainees have died in custody. Medical conditions surrounding deaths over the last calendar year have included tuberculosis, strokes, respiratory failure and about three possible suicides. Each preliminary report includes a synopsis of the detainees' immigration and criminal histories, as they have for past administrations, as well as the events leading to the time of death.

One reason for the rise in deaths, former employees said, is that there are just simply more people in detention.

""With that kind of spike in population, there's going to be a need for additional staffing both on the medical and mental health side, as well as even from an officer standpoint,"" Mina said.

The types of arrests being made by federal immigration officers this year are different, too. Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who worked under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said that previously most of the agency's detainees either came from the border or from local law enforcement custody.

In these cases, she said, those coming from the border tended to be younger and healthier; or health care records were generally established for those who had been previously detained in prisons or jails.

""Whereas when you pick somebody up on the street, it's a lot of unknowns. Do they have chronic medical conditions they're not even aware of? Do they have addiction issues?"" McNulty said. ""The systems and triaging and maybe even the resources to really appropriately care for people when taking in such a varied population probably should increase.""

Since the early months of the administration, officials have touted focusing their arrests in the ""interior"" of the country, as numbers of crossings at the southern border have steadily decreased.

DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement that detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

""With all these healthcare services and access to medical care ICE provides illegal aliens in detention, it should come as no surprise to the media that as we expand detention space, we need to hire more medical professionals,"" McLaughlin said.

But both Mina and McNulty said that hiring medical staff at immigration detention facilities has long been a challenge for the agency. According to a review of detainee deaths since 2004, three detention facilities have held the most deaths: Eloy Federal Contract facility just outside Phoenix; Krome Services Processing Center in Florida; and Stewart Detention Center in Georgia.

A 2021 DHS Office of Inspector General report identified ""remote locations, a cumbersome hiring process, and competing opportunities"" among the challenges to retaining and recruiting medical staff. The Eloy and Stewart facilities were specifically mentioned as among those experiencing these difficulties.

DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.

""ICE is actively recruiting healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and health administrators, to support the expanded detention capacity enabled by the historic funding provided under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,"" McLaughlin told NPR in a statement.

""Just like with the general population, unfortunately, people will die over a period of time for any series of medical ailments,"" Mina, former deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at ICE, said. ""But the real question is: In a given case, were there circumstances or actions taken or not taken that suggest that that death may have been preventable?""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5644x3175+0+296/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2Fbc%2F30d267024e79850063187235ecb6%2Fgettyimages-2235817850-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:17:15.356538

Authorities allege that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following online, tried to ram federal agents’ vehicles with his vehicle in an attempt to flee after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car. He was shot in the elbow during the incident while a ricochet bullet hit a deputy US marshal in the hand.

Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer and was expected to appear in court on Wednesday, but the US attorney’s office reported that proceedings had been delayed as Parias was still in the hospital.

As the Trump administration has waged its aggressive campaign of mass deportations, with raids across southern California, Parias has filmed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

On the TikTok profile Richard LA, Parias has for months been posting videos of federal agents arresting people, along with footage of protests and car collisions.

The 44-year-old is a well-known local figure who recently received recognition from the office of Curren Price, a Los Angeles city council member, for his impact on the community and “unfiltered portrayal of real life [that] has fostered a loyal following”.

“Richard is a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South Central Los Angeles,” Price’s office said in a statement.

On Tuesday morning, federal agents set up surveillance near his home because he was the “subject of an administrative arrest warrant” and had allegedly evaded capture in the past, according to court documents. As Parias began to drive away, agents boxed his car in, preventing him from leaving.

The agents approached Parias and ordered him to exit the vehicle, court documents say, alleging he began moving the car forward and back, “making contact” with the other vehicles. The back of the car began to fishtail and his spinning tires created large plumes of smoke, causing the agents “to fear that Parias would successfully dislodge the Camry … and injure them”, the complaint states.

An agent broke a side window on the vehicle, which did not “subdue” Parias, Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney, said in a statement, adding that an agent then opened fire and wounded Parias and a deputy US marshal.

A witness told ABC7 that Parias seemed nervous and afraid and agents fired rubber bullets and teargas. Video obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed Parias screaming for help after the shooting and firefighters responding to the scene.

Essayli said in a statement: “Vehicles are deadly weapons. Anyone who uses them against federal agents risks arrest, imprisonment and life-threatening injuries.”

The Guardian first became aware of the teenager’s case after his 20-year-old American-Palestinian cousin Sayfollah Musallet was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers.
Huckabee has not similarly spoken out about Ibrahim’s detention.","More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers have written to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel urging them to help secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American citizen who has been held in Israeli military detention for nearly eight months.

Ibrahim, a dual Palestinian-American teenager from Florida, was arrested in a raid on his family’s West Bank home in February when he was 15 years old. Israeli forces allegedly blindfolded and handcuffed the boy at 3am, according to the letter led by senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley and representatives Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost.

“As we have been told repeatedly, ‘the Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad,’” the lawmakers wrote. “We share that view and urge you to fulfill this responsibility by engaging the Israeli government directly to secure the swift release of this American boy.”

The letter follows the Guardian’s initial reporting on Ibrahim’s detention in July, which noted that he lost a significant amount of weight and contracted scabies, according to state department correspondences obtained by the Guardian.

The group of 27 lawmakers, including Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Adam Schiff and Raphael Warnock, said they had “grave concern” over Ibrahim’s treatment and demanded a response by 3 November detailing what efforts the Trump administration has made to secure his release.

In August, more than 100 US human rights, faith-based and civil rights organizations separately sent their own letter to Rubio demanding Ibrahim’s immediate release. The letter also arrives weeks after the Guardian learned the state department appointed a dedicated official to handle Ibrahim’s case.

Rubio is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Thursday for a 48-hour visit, following JD Vance, who arrived on Tuesday. Rubio’s trip will include meetings with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and comes as Trump envoys Jared Kushner and Steven Witkoff are also in the country discussing the transition to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Ibrahim has been accused of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in the West Bank in two separate incidents, according to court documents reviewed by the Guardian, though the lawmakers note that “no evidence has been publicly provided to support this allegation”. His family has not been able to contact him directly, receiving updates only through US embassy staff and former detainees.

The lawmakers also point to the March death of Walid Ahmad, a 17-year-old Palestinian who collapsed and died in Megiddo prison after six months of detention for allegedly throwing rocks. His autopsy showed he died from extreme malnutrition, torture, scabies and denial of medical care. Lawmakers warned that “it is the responsibility of the US government to ensure that this recent tragedy does not repeat itself with Mohammed.”

In a recent interview with Defense for Children International-Palestine, Ibrahim described receiving “extremely insufficient” meals, with breakfast consisting of just three tiny pieces of bread and a spoonful of labneh, and lunch amounting to half a small cup of undercooked rice, a single sausage, and three pieces of bread. “Dinner is not provided, and we receive no fruit whatsoever,” he said.

The Guardian first became aware of the teenager’s case after his 20-year-old American-Palestinian cousin Sayfollah Musallet was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers. To date, no arrests have been made in his killing, though the US ambassador, Mike Huckabee – one of the recipients of the new letter – called it a “criminal and terrorist act” and demanded Israel “aggressively investigate the murder”. Huckabee has not similarly spoken out about Ibrahim’s detention.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subject to Israeli military law and tried in military courts, where there have been well-documented concerns about due process.

All six are charged with conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injuries and resulting in death.
According to court documents, from October 2021 to February 2023, all six worked with other smugglers to facilitate the travel of illegal aliens from Guatemala through Mexico into the United States.
According to the charges, they also provided illegal aliens with scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended.
The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions.","A 41-year-old Guatemalan national is set to make his initial appearance in U.S. federal court on charges stemming from a crash of a tractor-trailer packed with at least 160 illegal aliens – many of them Guatemalan – that killed more than 50 people, including unaccompanied children, and injured over 100 more, the Justice Department announced today.

Authorities arrested Daniel Zavala Ramos aka Dany ZR in Boquerón, Guatemala, Aug. 7 pursuant to a U.S. extradition request and he was surrendered to U.S. authorities Oct. 21. He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Diana Song Quiroga in Laredo this morning.

The extradition is the result of sustained coordination between the Justice Department and Guatemalan authorities following an international enforcement operation carried out Dec. 9, 2024, the third anniversary of the tragedy. The extradition marks yet another significant step in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring those responsible to justice.

Also charged are Tomas Quino Canil, 37, Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino aka Osvaldo ZQ, 25, Josefa Quino Canil De Zavala, 43, and Alberto Marcario Chitic aka Alberto De Jesus, 32, who were all taken into custody in Guatemala Dec. 9, 2024. U.S. authorities arrested Jorge Agapito Ventura aka Jorge Ventura, George Ventura or El Raitero, 33, at his residence in Cleveland, Texas, the same day. All are now in federal custody pending further criminal proceedings.

All six are charged with conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injuries and resulting in death.

According to court documents, from October 2021 to February 2023, all six worked with other smugglers to facilitate the travel of illegal aliens from Guatemala through Mexico into the United States. They allegedly recruited them, collected payment and arranged travel by foot, microbuses, cattle trucks and tractor-trailers.

In some instances, the scheme allegedly involved the smuggling of unaccompanied minors. According to the charges, they also provided illegal aliens with scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended. The indictment further alleges some of the individuals they recruited died or suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the Dec. 9, 2021, crash.

If convicted, all face a maximum penalty of life in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s – Homeland Security Investigations’ Counter Proliferation Investigations Group in Washington D.C. conducted the joint investigation with HSI offices in Guatemala and Mexico with substantial assistance of HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit and HSI offices in Houston and Laredo, Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center, Operation Sentinel, Border Patrol, Liberty County Constable, Precinct 6; ICE - Enforcement and Removal Operations in Houston, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas and Justice Department’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training.

The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions. Guatemalan and Mexican prosecutors, with the support of law enforcement officials from both countries, were also instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jennifer Day and Mary Lou Castillo are prosecuting the case along with Senior Trial Attorney Danielle Hickman of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section with substantial assistance from HRSP Latin American Specialist/Historian Joanna Crandall.

The indictment is the result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with Department of Homeland Security, has been elevated and expanded with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border, including the Southern District of California, Districts of Arizona and New Mexico and Western and Southern Districts of Texas. Dedicated support is provided by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 420 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 370 U.S. convictions; more than 315 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the DOJ to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces and Project Safe Neighborhood.

Since his election last year, Sir Keir has held talks on illegal migration with Ms Meloni and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister.
Before the meeting in Brussels, Ms Meloni told the Italian parliament that the breakfast meeting would help find “innovative solutions” to illegal migration.
In her recent speech to the UN General Assembly, Ms Meloni took aim at so-called activist judges.
Ms Meloni has already led a successful push in Brussels to reform migration laws to make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers and house them in camps outside the EU.","Giorgia Meloni has told EU leaders to prepare for a first political debate on reforming the European Convention on Human Rights in the “coming months”, in what would be a major step forward towards changing the international rules on migration.

The Italian prime minister spoke to heads of state and government before a European Council summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday morning.

The Telegraph understands she set out a plan to reform the ECHR so that it can meet modern-day challenges over illegal immigration, such as people smuggling gangs.

It should lead to a first political debate on reforms in the Council of Europe, which is based in Strasbourg and is not an EU body but a larger human rights watchdog.

The roadmap was drawn up in coordination with Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, she told leaders from Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, the European Commission, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Sweden.

They agreed that senior officials would meet in Rome on Nov 5 to continue discussing international conventions and illegal migration.

“Prime minister Meloni provided an update on the work in progress on how the international conventions match the challenges of irregular migration and on upcoming initiatives,” an Italian government spokesperson said.

“The leaders agreed to continue to maintain close cooperation not only within the EU and the Council of Europe, but also, more generally, in various international contexts in order to promote more effectively the European approach to the orderly management of migration flows.”

The European Court of Human Rights is part of the Council of Europe and was set up to enforce the ECHR, which has been criticised for tying governments’ hands on illegal immigration.

Sir Keir Starmer has vowed the UK will never leave the ECHR, despite calls from the Tories and Reform UK to quit it, but he does want to restrict the ways it is used to fight deportations.

Nearly 37,000 migrants arrived in the UK by small boats this year, more than the total for the whole of 2024, Home Office figures showed on Thursday.

The Prime Minister argues, like Ms Meloni, that mass migration is a far greater problem now than it was when the international laws were drafted after the Second World War.

“We need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down,” he said earlier this month.

Since his election last year, Sir Keir has held talks on illegal migration with Ms Meloni and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister.

Ms Frederiksen, a Left-wing leader who defeated a surge in support for Right-wing parties with a tough migration policy, chaired the meeting in Brussels and also wants ECHR reform.

Before the meeting in Brussels, Ms Meloni told the Italian parliament that the breakfast meeting would help find “innovative solutions” to illegal migration.

“It will be an opportunity to take stock of the issue of international conventions and the need to ensure that their implementation allows us to address the challenges of modern irregular migration – challenges that were unthinkable when those conventions were written, and signed by Italy,” the hard-Right leader said.

“On this occasion, we will propose to our partners a roadmap that, in cooperation with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Berset, should lead in the coming months to an initial political debate on the topic in Strasbourg.”

Ms Meloni’s Albania plan, where migrants picked up in the Mediterranean would be processed in non-EU Albania, has been mired in legal difficulties.

Denmark has an agreement with Rwanda to process asylum seekers, but the deal is on hold amid concerns over possible legal barriers, including the ECHR.

The Netherlands is also preparing to send failed asylum seekers to Uganda in a plan that is expected to face legal challenges.

In her recent speech to the UN General Assembly, Ms Meloni took aim at so-called activist judges.

“These rules were established at a time when mass irregular migration did not exist and nor did human traffickers,” she said in New York.

“These conventions are no longer current in this context and, when they are interpreted in an ideological and unidirectional way by politicised judges, they end up trampling on the law, rather than upholding it.”

Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have made the informal talks on migration a fixture of European Council summits.

Fourteen EU states, including Germany, Poland, Austria and Hungary, have taken part in meetings of the “migration hawks”, as they are called in Brussels.

Ms Meloni has already led a successful push in Brussels to reform migration laws to make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers and house them in camps outside the EU.

In the first eight months of this year, 112,000 people crossed illegally into Europe, down 21 per cent from 2024 and 52 per cent from the same period in 2023. The EU has signed return deals with non-EU countries, while its member states have cracked down on illegal immigration and moved to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers.

All 27 EU member states, as well as the UK, belong to the 46-state Council of Europe and are signatories to the ECHR.

A Council of Europe spokesman told The Telegraph: “Secretary General Alain Berset acknowledges prime minister Meloni’s outreach. He stresses that political dialogue and collaboration within the Council of Europe is the right method to addressing migration on our continent. And he reaffirms the importance of ensuring the integrity of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.”

,Human Rights,2025-10-23 13:32:45+00:00,Free Movement,New suitability rules will apply to Appendix FM and other human rights applications,Alex Piletska,,,,,https://freemovement.org.uk/new-suitability-rules-will-apply-to-appendix-fm-and-other-human-rights-applications/,"The new version, in SUI 11.3, applies to all four types of breaches of immigration law, past and present: SUI 11.3.
Appendix FM Applications under Appendix FM, namely applications as a partner, parent or child of a British or settled person (or someone with another type of qualifying leave), will usually engage Article 8 ECHR.
That is not the case with applications founded on Article 8 ECHR rights like the applications under Appendix FM.
Appendix Private Life Like Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life had previously enjoyed slightly more generous category-specific suitability requirements, which were confusingly also found in Appendix FM for some of the applications found in this section but which harmonised with Part 9 in others.
This has been retained, with the references to the Appendix FM suitability grounds amended to “SUI 2.1.","One of the biggest changes introduced by the most recent statement of changes is not so much the replacement of the Part 9 grounds for refusal with a new yet very similar “Part Suitability” but rather the way these rules will now apply in full to the following applications that previously enjoyed carve-outs and exceptions:

Appendix FM

Appendix Private Life

Appendix Adult Dependent Relative

Appendix Settlement Family Life

There are also other minor amendments, including incorporating the exceptions for overstayers currently found in paragraph 39E into Part Suitability.

These changes take effect from 11 November 2025. Aside from some very limited exceptions which will be discussed below, there are no provisions for considering an application under the old rules where an application is lodged before this date but decided after.

Part Suitability

As discussed above, many of the various carve outs for different application routes are now gone, replaced with this:

SUI 1.1. This Part applies to all routes under these rules, except:

(a) Appendix EU; and

(b) Appendix EU (Family Permit); and

(c) Part 11 (Asylum), except Part Suitability does apply to paragraphs 352ZH to 352ZS, and 352I to 352X; and

(d) Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland; and

(e) Appendix Settlement Protection.

There are still some limited exceptions for some routes:

SUI 1.2. For the following Appendixes, only the stated provisions of this Part apply:

(a) For applications for permission to stay under Appendix Domestic Worker who is a Victim of Modern Slavery, paragraphs DWMS 2.1: SUI.2.1(c), SUI.2.2, SUI .3.1, SUI.3.2, SUI 5.1(b), SUI 5.1(c), SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5, SUI 9.1., SUI 9.2., SUI 10.1., SUI 14.1, SUI 14.2., SUI 24.1, SUI 28.1, SUI 29.1; and

(b) For applications permission granted under the Agreement, paragraphs SUI 2.2, SUI 3.2, SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5., SUI 8.2, SUI 10.2., and SUI 27.2 apply where the criminal offence or adverse conduct occurred after 11pm on 31 December 2020; and

(c) for applications for permission to stay under Appendix ECAA Extension of 14 Stay, paragraphs SUI 2.1, SUI 3.1, SUI 5.1, SUI 5.3., SUI 8.1, SUI 9.1, SUI 10.1, SUI 16.1, SUI 17.1 and SUI 27.1, and in relation to such permission paragraphs SUI 2.2, SUI 3.2, SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5, SUI 8.2, SUI 10.2. and SUI 27.2 apply where the criminal offence or adverse conduct occurred after 11pm on 31 December 2020.

The only other part of the rules exempt from the regime is Appendix Electronic Travel Authorisation.

Because the new appendix uses the simplified “permission” to refer to permission to enter and permission to stay (including settlement), there is a provision that stipulates that people with settlement are excluded from any rules that allow for permission to be cancelled (also known as curtailed):

SUI 1.4. Where a person has settlement and is in-country (not including at the UK border) their permission can only be cancelled on the grounds contained in section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

The rest of Part Suitability is substantially identical to the current Part 9 rules, aside from the following changes.

This is reflected in the changes to para 6.2 of the rules, which now defines permission as “either permission to enter or permission to stay and includes settlement”, with effect from 11 November 2025.

Although people with settlement who are in the UK are protected from having their indefinite leave to remain curtailed by the above provision, this does not appear to be the case for people with indefinite leave who are outside the UK or at the border. As this represents a potential risk for indefinite leave to remain holders, it may be a good idea to naturalise as a British citizen as soon as possible, just to be on the safe side.

Additional ground for refusal under Appendix FM

There will now be an additional ground for refusing entry clearance applications where there is a safeguarding concern, which will presumably (though not explicitly) only apply to children:

SUI 6.1. An application for entry clearance under Appendix FM must be refused if the decision maker considers the applicant’s parent or parent’s partner poses a risk to the applicant.

Grounds for refusal on the basis of deception

The substance of these grounds has been retained under the new rules, with a minor amendment to the wording. At present, the grounds refer to refusal or cancellation of existing permission where the decision maker “can prove that it is more likely than not the applicant used deception”. This has been changed to “the decision maker is satisfied the applicant used deception”:

SUI 9.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where the decision maker is satisfied that the applicant used deception by:

(a) making false representations or providing false documents or false information in relation to the application (whether or not relevant to the application); or

(b) not disclosing relevant facts in relation to the application.

SUI 9.2. Permission extended under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 may be cancelled where the decision maker is satisfied the applicant used deception by:

(a) making false representations or providing false documents or false information in relation to an application (whether or not relevant to the application); or

(b) not disclosing relevant facts in relation to an application.

We will have to wait and see if this represents a change in how allegations of deception are considered, particularly in light of any updated guidance, though my feeling is that this is unlikely to be the case because of the substantial case law on this subject which will still apply to the new rules.

The other minor change is that the new wording of the mandatory ground for refusal on the basis of deception now specifies that the relevant way that deception is used for the purposes of these provisions is by making false representations, false documents or false information, or by not disclosing material facts, whereas the previous version simply said “used deception”, though I don’t think anything turns on this.

Previous breach of immigration law

Under the current rules, the definition of “previously breached immigration laws” is found in the “Interpretation” section at para 6.2 of the rules and reads “a person previously breached immigration laws if they overstayed or used deception in relation to a previous application”, which means that, in my view at least, other breaches of immigration law such as breaching conditions of leave or being an illegal entrant aren’t technically caught by it.

The new mandatory and discretionary grounds for refusal on the basis of past breaches are identical to the current ones, only the term is now fully defined:

SUI 11.4. An applicant will be treated as having breached immigration laws if, aged 18 or over, they:

(a) overstayed their permission, unless an exception in SUI 11.5. or SUI 11.6. applied to that period of overstaying; or

(b) breached a condition attached to their permission, unless entry clearance or further permission has subsequently been granted in the knowledge of the breach; or

(a) were (or still are) an illegal entrant; or

(b) used deception in relation to a previous application (whether or not 19 successfully).

The typo in the “a, b, a, b” lettering above is not mine.

The current version of para 9.8.3 allows for an application for permission to stay to be refused on a discretionary basis where the applicant had previously failed to comply with the conditions of their permission unless permission has been granted in the knowledge of the previous breach. The new version, in SUI 11.3, applies to all four types of breaches of immigration law, past and present:

SUI 11.3. An application for permission may be refused where the applicant is, or has been, in breach of immigration laws as defined in SUI 11.4

The “unless permission has been granted in the knowledge of the previous breach” exception still applies to a breach of conditions but not the other three breaches of immigration law in SUI 11.4.

That means that someone who is applying for settlement, for example, who had previously overstayed but was since granted leave, could potentially face a refusal of their application because of that past overstaying, though it’s too early to know how widely this power will be used in practice, as it remains a discretionary ground.

The other change is the simplification of the confusingly-drafted para 9.8.2 (“contrived in a significant way to frustrate the intention of the rules”), which under the new rules will read:

SUI 11.2. An application for entry clearance or permission to enter may be refused where:

(a) the applicant has previously breached immigration laws as defined in SUI 11.4; and

(b) the application was made outside the relevant time period in SUI 12.1; and

(c) the applicant has acted to frustrate immigration controls (see SUI 11.7.).

This is further defined as follows:

SUI 11.7. An applicant will be treated as having acted to frustrate immigration controls, if aged 18 or over, they (for example):

(a) failed to cooperate with the redocumentation, arrest or removal process; or

(b) used a false identity; or

(c) failed to report as required or absconded from immigration custody or bail; or

(d) obtained state or public authority benefits, tax credits, employment or goods or services they were not entitled to or accessed housing in the private rented sector; or

(e) used multiple identities; or

(f) participated in immigration related crime.

I don’t love the “for example” that precedes the list, as it makes it clear that the list is not exhaustive. However, this is still preferable to the wording of the current version, which is incorrectly drafted, and which also excludes some of these examples, only for them to turn up in the guidance.

Exceptions for overstayers

These provisions, currently found in para 39E of the rules, are being imported into Part Suitability wholesale:

SUI 13.1. An applicant will not be treated as an overstayer if:

(a) their application was made within 14 days of their previous permission expiring, and the decision maker considers that there was a good reason beyond the control of the applicant or their representative, provided in or with the application, why the application could not be made in-time; or

(b) the application was made:

(i) following the refusal or rejection of a previous application for permission which was made in-time; and

(ii) within 14 days of:

(1) the refusal or rejection of that previous application; or

(2) the expiry of any permission extended by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971; or

(3) the expiry of the time-limit for making an in-time application for administrative review or appeal in relation to the previous application (where applicable); or

(4) any administrative review or appeal in relation to the previous application being concluded, withdrawn, abandoned or lapsing; or

(c) the period of overstaying was between 24 January 2020 and 31 August 2020; or

(d) the applicant has, or had, permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route, and the period of overstaying was between 1 July 2020 and 31 January 2021: or

(e) the period of overstaying:

(i) is between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2023; and

(ii) is covered by an exceptional assurance.

SUI 13.2. For the purpose of SUI 13.1(e)(ii), “exceptional assurance” means a written notice given to a person by the Home Office stating that they would not be considered an overstayer for the period specified in the notice.

All of the above changes take effect from 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions. That means that even if an application is lodged before this date, it will be considered under the new rules if it is decided on or after 11 November 2025.

Application to human rights applications

Although the changes to the grounds themselves are mostly minor, the impending application of all of these grounds to the human rights routes like Appendix FM, which previously benefited from more generous category-specific suitability rules, is unprecedented.

Before I go on to the minutiae of the category-specific changes, which mostly touch on exceptional circumstances but not in a way that will sufficiently reassure you, I just want to pause to consider what this means. To use the Appendix FM partner route as an example, if you are lodging an entry clearance application under the new rules, the following suitability grounds will now apply to you for the first time:

Mandatory refusal for a conviction for which the applicant was imprisoned for at least 12 months, no matter how much time has passed since then

Discretionary refusal for any other convictions, including out of court disposals, no matter how much time has passed since then

Mandatory cancellation of permission where someone has been convicted of an offence with a sentence of over 12 months

Mandatory re-entry bans for breaching immigration laws, including relevant overstaying (there are still exceptions for e.g. overstaying for less than 30 days)

Discretionary refusal for current or previous breaches of immigration law for in-country applications

Of course, applications like these have a human rights dimension so the application of these new provisions isn’t quite as straightforward as when these kinds of grounds for refusal were first introduced to apply to other categories like work and study routes. This is explicitly recognised by the preamble to Part Suitability:

Where a refusal under this Part would be incompatible with the UK obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) the route specific rules set out the approach to be taken.

I will look at these category-specific changes below.

Appendix FM

Applications under Appendix FM, namely applications as a partner, parent or child of a British or settled person (or someone with another type of qualifying leave), will usually engage Article 8 ECHR. Accordingly, these routes contain provisions for waiving some of the requirements where someone doesn’t meet the rules.

GEN 3.1-3.2

GEN 3.1 of Appendix FM provides an exception for people who cannot meet the financial requirement, provided all other requirements of the rules are met, and allows for other sources of income to be taken into account. GEN 3.2 is a more general provision that allows an application to be granted when any of the other requirements are not met.

In both cases, the applicant has to show that there are “exceptional circumstances which would render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family member”. This is a high threshold and in practice, grants of leave under these provisions are rare.

The new rules amend these provisions so that an application can only be granted on the basis of these exceptional circumstances if the applicant doesn’t fall foul of particular Part Suitability provisions:

D-ECP.1.2A. Where paragraph GEN 3.2(3) applies but the applicant does not meet the suitability paragraphs SUI 2.1., SUI 2.3., SUI 4.1., SUI 5.1., in Part Suitability, the application on Appendix FM will be refused.

Those four grounds of refusal are as follows.

(1) SSHD personally directed the applicant to be excluded, exclusion order or deportation order:

SUI 2.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where:

(a) the Secretary of State has personally directed that the applicant be excluded from the UK; or

(b) the applicant is the subject of an exclusion order; or

(c) the applicant is the subject of a deportation order, or a decision to make a deportation order

(2) Excluded person under 8B(4) of the 1971 Act:

SUI 2.3. An application for entry clearance must be refused where the applicant is an excluded person, as defined by section 8B(4) of the Immigration Act 1971, and the person does not fall within section 8B(5A) or 8B(5B) of that Act.

(3) Exclusion from the Refugee Convention:

SUI 4.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where a decision maker:

(a) has at any time decided that paragraph 339AA (exclusion from Refugee Convention), 339AC (danger to the UK), 339D (exclusion from a grant of humanitarian protection) or 339GB (revocation of humanitarian protection on grounds of exclusion) of these rules applies to the applicant; or

(b) has decided that paragraph 339AA, 339AC, 339D or 339GB of these rules would apply, but for the fact that the person has not made a protection claim in the UK, or that the person has made a protection claim which was finally determined without reference to any of the relevant matters described in paragraphs 339AA, 339AC, 339D or 339GB.

(4) Criminality:

SUI 5.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where the applicant:

(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK or overseas for which they have received a custodial sentence of 12 months or more; or

(b) is a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the law; or

(c) has committed a criminal offence, or offences, which caused serious harm.

These exclusions also apply to applications that rely on EX.1 (relationship with a qualifying child or insurmountable obstacles to the couple living outside the UK), as the relevant paragraphs dealing with those applications have been amended in line with the above.

The effect of this appears to be that where any Part Suitability mandatory grounds for refusal are engaged, the only way your application can still succeed is if the “exceptional circumstances” exemption under GEN 3.2 applies, as long as the relevant ground is not one of the four excluded suitability grounds listed above.

Transitional provisions

All of these changes take effect on 11 November 2025, though all of the relevant category-specific changes in Appendix FM do have transitional provisions that mean that an application will be considered under the previous rules if lodged on 10 November 2025 or earlier.

This is slightly confusing, as the Part Suitability changes take effect on 11 November 2025 without any transitional provisions.

Case study

Frank is a US national who was convicted of an offence 20 years ago for which he received a custodial sentence of 14 months.

On 10 November 2025, he lodges an entry clearance application to join his British husband in the UK. All the other requirements of the route (other than potentially suitability) are met. His application is decided on 22 January 2026.

When his application is decided, the decision maker will look at the Appendix FM rules as they were on 10 November 2025, other than a few minor differences that don’t have transitional provisions, such as references to para 39E now referring to Part Suitability, which do not make substantive changes to suitability.

Under the previous suitability rules, found in Section S-EC: Suitability of Appendix FM, he would qualify for entry clearance because his sentence was for more than 12 months but less than four years, and more than 10 years have passed since. So, looking at just Appendix FM as it was on 10 November 2025, the application should be granted.

However, the decision maker will presumably also have to also look at Part Suitability, as there are no transitional provisions for when that takes effect on 11 November 2025, and the first section of Part Suitability says that it applies at all applications without any carve out for Appendix FM. Under Part Suitability, he must be refused under SUI 5.1(a) because of his sentence of over 12 months.

Assuming that there is a point to the transitional provisions, there are two possible options for what they were intended to do:

(1) The Home Office intended for anyone who applies under Appendix FM before 11 November to have their application decided under the old suitability rules, without reference to Part Suitability, and they just didn’t notice that Part Suitability will apply to all applications decided after 11 November because they thought preserving the old Appendix FM suitability rules for people like Frank would be enough.

In that case, Frank’s application would succeed, as long as those instructions were communicated to the relevant decision makers.

(2) The Home Office intended Part Suitability to apply to Appendix FM applications lodged before 11 November so what they wanted to preserve through their transitional provisions for people like Frank is the original definition of GEN 3.2, which in this case and for anyone who applies before 11 November, will be capable of waiving all requirements of Part Suitability, including the four grounds that can never be waived for anyone applying under the new rules.

The effect of this is that Frank faces a mandatory refusal under SUI 5.1(a) unless he can show that there are exceptional circumstances that would “render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family member”.

If Frank includes strong evidence to this effect, the application may be granted. Otherwise, the application would be refused.

Rules as written, the correct interpretation must be (2), otherwise the Home Office would have applied transitional provisions not just to the various changes to Appendix FM but also to the repeal of the first section of Part 9, which deals with which routes it applies to. But this might just be an oversight.

Article 8 compatibility

There are still human rights considerations to be taken into account, even beyond the fact that Appendix FM is, at least in theory, drafted in a way as to be compliant with Article 8. There will undoubtedly be cases where the new rules mandate a refusal but where that refusal would nevertheless breach the applicant’s human rights and thus should still succeed.

There are no provisions, for example, for someone currently in the UK as a partner under Appendix FM who has a historic conviction and who would now presumably be subject to a mandatory refusal at the extension stage. It is difficult to imagine someone with a conviction for which they were sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment in the 1970s, and who has lived in the UK for seven years with their British spouse and minor British children, being required to leave the UK because they no longer qualify under the new rules at the extension stage.

When the current version of the Part 9 suitability rules came into effect, they only applied to non-human rights applications like work and study routes, so the people who were suddenly excluded from further grants of leave or settlement had limited avenues to challenge these decisions. That is not the case with applications founded on Article 8 ECHR rights like the applications under Appendix FM.

Appendix Private Life

Like Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life had previously enjoyed slightly more generous category-specific suitability requirements, which were confusingly also found in Appendix FM for some of the applications found in this section but which harmonised with Part 9 in others.

The main change is just Part Suitability applying to this appendix without any carve-outs. The route currently contains a human rights exception:

PL 8.1. If the applicant does not meet the suitability requirements (subject to PL 8.2), or does not meet any of the eligibility requirements in PL 3.1., PL 4.1. or PL 5.1. the decision maker must be satisfied that refusal of permission to stay would not breach Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention on the basis of private life.

PL 8.2. Where PL 8.1. applies and the applicant falls for refusal under suitability paragraphs S-LTR.1.2., S-LTR.1.3., S-LTR.1.4., S-LTR.1.5., S-LTR.1.6 or S-LTR 1.8. of Appendix FM of these rules the application on the Private Life route will be refused.

This has been retained, with the references to the Appendix FM suitability grounds amended to “SUI 2.1. SUI 3.1., SUI 4.1., or SUI 5.1. of Part Suitability”, which are the four excluded grounds for refusal referred to above.

The current rules include an exception to some of the grounds for refusal and the new rules retain this exception without substantive amendment:

PL 12.4. Where any of the following occur during the applicant’s qualifying period for settlement, the applicant must be refused settlement unless the applicant has completed a continuous qualifying period of 10 years with permission as set out in PL 12.6. and has completed 5 years continuous residence with such permission after the date of the first grant of permission after the suitability ground came to the attention of the decision maker:

(a) involvement in a sham marriage or civil partnership (SUI 8.1. of Part Suitability); or

(b) use of false documents or information or deception (SUI 9.1. and SUI 10.1. of Part Suitability); or

(c) litigation debt owed to the Home Office, unless the debt has been paid (SUI 17.1. of Part Suitability); or

(d) debt to the NHS, unless the debt has been paid, or the total value of outstanding charges is under £500 (SUI 16.1. of Part Suitability); or

(e) the applicant has breached the conditions of their permission (SUI 11.1. of Part Suitability).

These changes take effect on 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions.

Appendix Adult Dependent Relative

As above, the main change is the Part Suitability will now apply to these applications without any carve-outs.

This appendix contains a human rights exception:

ADR 7.1. If the applicant does not meet all the suitability requirements (subject to ADR 7.2) or does not meet all of the eligibility requirements in ADR 3.1. to ADR 6.4., but the decision maker is satisfied that refusal of the application would breach Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, because it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant or their family, the applicant will meet the Article 8 ECHR eligibility requirement.

ADR 7.2. Where ADR 7.1. applies and the applicant falls for refusal on suitability grounds under S-EC.1.2 to S-EC.1.5, or S-LTR.1.2 to S-LTR.1.6. of Appendix FM of these rules the application as an Adult Dependent Relative must be refused.

These remain in the new rules unamended, which is presumably a mistake, as the exclusionary provision in ADR 7.2 refers to the suitability rules in Appendix FM that the statement of changes deletes in their entirety. Until they are amended in a future statement of changes, it seems ADR 7.2 will have no applicability.

As with Appendix Private Life, this route already contains the same exception to the five grounds for refusal listed above for in-country applications, which have been retained under the new rules.

These changes take effect on 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions.

Appendix Settlement Family Life

Again, the main change is that Part Suitability will now apply to these applications without carve-outs.

As with Appendix Private Life and Appendix Adult Dependent Relative, this route already contains the same exception to the five specified grounds for refusal, and this has been retained under the new rules.

“I think people are shaking their heads that Congress has reached this point in America.” Democrats have been largely steamrolled by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies all year.
They have relied on the courts to hold the line against illegal actions by the White House, a hope that has met with mixed success.
At the White House luncheon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily celebrated Mr. Vought as “Darth Vader,” for the fear provoked by the man behind the administration’s determined drive to strip spending power from Congress.
“You’re doing a great job, I have to tell you,” Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Vought.","By almost any measure, Congress is failing. And flailing.

The government is shut down for the 22nd day, with many federal workers not being paid, agencies and museums closed, and top lawmakers making no serious effort to resolve the disruptive impasse. Congressional staff members have begun referring to themselves as volunteers.

The House has, quite literally, ground to a halt. The chamber has not voted since Sept. 19 and Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to call members back, preventing them from doing any legislative work. He has refused to seat a new duly elected Democratic member from Arizona one month after her victory, though he encouraged her to return home and work for constituents she does not yet officially represent because he won’t administer her the oath of office.

As the Trump administration shifts billions of dollars around to take care of its priorities during the shutdown with scant input from lawmakers, ignoring Congress’s clear constitutional supremacy over the power of the purse, Republicans in control have done nothing to push back.

“The Congress is adrift,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. “It’s like we have given up. And that’s not a good signal to the American public.”

Since assuming office in January, Mr. Trump and his top aides, seasoned from their first stint in the White House, have aggressively and enthusiastically usurped congressional power with little resistance from G.O.P. leaders in the House and the Senate. In many instances, they have willingly ceded their prerogatives and cheered on the president.

Even as administration policies threaten economic harm to huge swaths of rural America that they represent, congressional Republicans have been mainly silent as Mr. Trump has unilaterally imposed and threatened tariffs to achieve his own strategic, political and economic goals. Never mind that the Constitution gives Congress chief responsibility for levying tariffs.

The administration has embarked on deadly military operations off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia without the consent of Congress and no call from Republican lawmakers to scrutinize any oversight of the activities, even as the Pentagon cracks down on media coverage and communications with Congress.

Despite deep bipartisan support for sanctions on Russia over its war with Ukraine, Republicans have repeatedly reversed course and delayed legislative action because of mixed signals from Mr. Trump, who only days ago exhibited a willingness to restrain Moscow before he again pulled back. On Wednesday, his administration announced new penalties on Russia but still sidestepped Congress, which has pressed for more stringent measures.

Mr. Trump himself suggested this week that Congress had little left to do after passing its sweeping domestic policy and tax bill this year since Republicans had packaged all of his top priorities into the special filibuster-proof measure adopted solely with G.O.P. votes.

“There is a real danger that self-inflicted wounds by this institution will imperil it,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “I think people are shaking their heads that Congress has reached this point in America.”

Democrats have been largely steamrolled by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies all year. They have relied on the courts to hold the line against illegal actions by the White House, a hope that has met with mixed success.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, and his members are now employing what little leverage they do possess by denying Republicans the 60 votes they need to pass a short-term spending bill to fund the government. They are demanding that Republicans join them in extending pandemic-era Obamacare insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year to avoid big premium increases on millions of people.

But Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, refuse to negotiate with Democrats until they approve the short-term spending bill, creating the impasse that has shuttered much of the government.

And Republican leaders have made it clear that they view their role as subordinate to the president, saying they won’t open talks with their Democratic counterparts unless Mr. Trump allows them to do so.

The current shutdown has been distinguished from past ones by a marked lack of urgency to resolve it, with senators repeating the same failed votes for days on end in a “Groundhog Day” exhibition before flying home for the weekends. The House chamber, on the other hand, has remained entirely empty except for occasional brief pro forma sessions in an extraordinary display of absenteeism.

Mr. Johnson has said he wants lawmakers to stay away to keep the pressure on Democrats. But there is a belief among both Democrats and Republicans that he doesn’t want to take the risk that fractious House members could convene and make his job holding the line more difficult.

He has also used the excuse of the House being out of formal session to refuse to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who was elected in September in a special election to replace her late father, Raúl.

There are evidently some limits to what Congress will swallow. Republicans this week pressed the White House to withdraw the nomination of Paul Ingrassia to head the Office of Special Counsel after Politico disclosed a series of racist and offensive texts he sent.

Senate Republicans also raised the alarm on behalf of cattle ranchers who have been battered in recent years after Mr. Trump suggested that he might increase imports of Argentine beef to bolster markets there. The administration showed signs of heeding their calls.

But the funding impasse now has top Republicans talking about the possibility of a yearlong extension of current federal spending. That would further undermine Congress’s authority, shifting the power to shape spending from the once formidable Appropriations Committees to the White House and its budget director, Russell T. Vought.

At the White House luncheon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily celebrated Mr. Vought as “Darth Vader,” for the fear provoked by the man behind the administration’s determined drive to strip spending power from Congress.

“You’re doing a great job, I have to tell you,” Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Vought.

Then Senate Republicans gave a round of applause to the man eager to render them irrelevant.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/22/multimedia/22DC-ASSESS-top-hvmk/22DC-ASSESS-top-hvmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 09:56:52.545066

This story was originally published October 22, 2025 at 1:56 PM.","The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office and Caldwell Police Department released a joint statement Wednesday saying they wanted to clarify the situation around Sunday’s raid in Wilder, which was not an ICE-led operation, despite what the Department of Homeland Security indicated.

In a statement to the media Tuesday, Homeland Security said that “ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation” and that “as part of the operation ICE law enforcement officers arrested 105 illegal aliens.”

The raid at La Catedral Arena, where four people were arrested as part of an FBI criminal investigation on alleged illegal gambling, was in fact led by the FBI’s Treasure Valley Metro Violent Crime and Gang Task Force, according to Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram.

The FBI has said several times that it was the lead agency and that ICE was there “as part of the broader federal team to process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations.”

In their joint statement, Donahue and Ingram criticized Homeland Security for putting out a statement that was “deeply misleading to the public.”

“To be clear, this was not an ICE-led enforcement action,” the pair stated. “The statement released by DHS yesterday claiming responsibility for dismantling a criminal organization was completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts.”

Roughly 200 law enforcement agents were present at the racetrack, including Caldwell and Nampa police, and Canyon County officers, who were part of the task force. There were 10 agencies represented in total.

Five people have been charged in the gambling operation, after a fifth was arrested Monday night, and Homeland Security said ICE agents took 105 people into custody over their immigration status.

Donahue and Ingram said they normally would limit any comments on “active federal investigations,” but “we feel it’s important to address the confusion caused by recent public statements from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”

They also noted that questions about the raid and cases should be directed to the FBI’s Salt Lake City Field Office.

“Our agencies remain committed to supporting the rule of law within our jurisdictions, regardless of whether they are state, local, or federal operations,” they said in the statement.

Democratic San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Wednesday that ""our communities have already endured the painful impact of aggressive immigration enforcement.
""For the last 10 months, we have been taking steps to prepare for this kind of escalation here in San Francisco,"" he continued.
""Immigrants are the small business owners, essential workers, community leaders, and neighbors who make San Francisco a place that we are proud to call home.
""San Francisco will never stand by as our neighbors are targeted, and neither will I.""","President Donald Trump's assault on immigrants in Democrat-led cities continued Wednesday with confirmation from the US Coast Guard that its base in Alameda, California is preparing to host 100 federal agents—whose looming arrival is seen as ""a likely precursor"" to the Republican deploying National Guard troops to San Francisco.

The San Francisco Chronicle initially reported that agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—an agency in the US Department of Homeland Security—were headed to the Bay Area, citing a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A spokesperson from the Coast Guard, also part of DHS, then confirmed that the base would serve as a ""place of operations.""

""This support of DHS agencies continues the Coast Guard's operations to control, secure, and defend US borders and maritime approaches,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to multiple local media outlets. ""Through a whole-of-government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.""

As KQED pointed out Wednesday, the region has already seen increased immigration enforcement in recent months:

Since May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP officials have been escalating operations throughout the Bay Area, moving to have undocumented immigrants’ asylum cases dismissed and arresting them outside of courtrooms and ICE field offices.

More than 2,000 people were arrested in San Francisco's ""Area of Responsibility"" between January and July 2025, according to Mission Local.

The reporting on the federal agents due to start arriving in the Bay Area on Thursday followed various threats from Trump to send National Guard soldiers into San Francisco, as he has with Los Angeles, California; Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; and Chicago, Illinois. The president and Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee have also collaborated to deploy National Guard troops in Memphis.

A federal judge has blocked the National Guard deployment in Illinois—where ICE's Operation Midway Blitz is ongoing—but the Trump administration has appealed to the US Supreme Court. Citing two unnamed officials, CBS News' Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported on social media Wednesday that Border Patrol's Gregory Bovino, who has led immigration raids in Chicago and Los Angeles, ""is expected to be involved in the operation"" in the Bay Area.

Elected officials across California have condemned the deployment of federal agents and Trump's threats to send National Guard troops. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom—a likely 2028 presidential candidate—declared in a Wednesday video on social media that ""this is right out of the dictator's handbook.""

Newsom accused Trump of sending in masked immigration agents to cause ""anxiety,"" so he can then justify deploying the National Guard. As the governor put it, ""This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.""

Democratic San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Wednesday that ""our communities have already endured the painful impact of aggressive immigration enforcement. At the same time, we continue to see escalated operations across the country, with military personnel on the ground in cities like Chicago and Portland.""

""For the last 10 months, we have been taking steps to prepare for this kind of escalation here in San Francisco,"" he continued. ""Just a few minutes ago, I signed an executive directive that will build on these preparations, strengthen the city's support for our immigrant communities, and ensure our departments are coordinated ahead of any federal deployment.""

""Immigrants are the small business owners, essential workers, community leaders, and neighbors who make San Francisco a place that we are proud to call home. They fuel our economy—contributing nearly $275 billion in output and $23 billion in annual tax revenue across California,"" he added. ""San Francisco will never stand by as our neighbors are targeted, and neither will I.""

Meanwhile, in Alameda, where the base is located, the city said in a Wednesday statement that ""the Alameda Police Department (APD) is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.""

The city also shared various resources and stressed its commitment ""to the values of dignity, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of ethnic or national origin, gender, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or immigration status.""

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former speaker of the House of Representatives, said Tuesday that ""San Francisco does not want or need Donald Trump's chaos. Our city takes great pride in the steps we've taken to significantly increase public safety and reduce crime—without the interference of a president just seeking headlines.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week threatened to sue over any deployment of the National Guard, as did San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu—who on Monday urged the US Supreme Court ""to uphold the bedrock legal principle that domestic law enforcement is not the military's job.""

""San Francisco has seen historic drops in crime,"" Chiu said, ""and our local law enforcement are more than capable of keeping our city safe while upholding First Amendment rights.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61879173&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C171%2C0%2C171,N,,2025-10-23 14:02:46.420132

Transportation secretary joins House Republicans to discuss shutdown impact on travel

We’re hearing now from Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, who is repeating the Republican party line that the reason Democrats refuse to pass the continuing resolution to reopen the federal government is because they are trying to appease a “a radical base” that is “out of control”.

Duffy said that 28 October was the first day that air traffic controllers will go without a full paycheck.

“I want to reiterate we are all about safety,” Duffy said. “But again, I can’t guarantee you that your flight is going to be on time. I can’t guarantee you that your flight is not going to be canceled.”

The pair will meet at 12.05pm ET/7.05pm local time.

This comes as vice-president JD Vance met with the Israeli prime minister earlier this week, and just left the region to travel back to Washington.

Vance says West Bank annexation legislation is an 'insult'

Amy Sedghi

Vice-president JD Vance has said that Israel would not annex the West Bank, the day after Israeli lawmakers voted to advance two bills paving the way for the territory’s annexation.

“If it was a political stunt it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance said on the tarmac as he wrapped up his visit in Israel.

“The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel, the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel, that will continue to be our policy,” he added.

Earlier, as secretary of state Marco Rubio travelled to the region, he warned Israel against annexation. “I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said as he boarded his plane. Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal”, he told reporters.

Donald Trump has repeated his insistence that Chicago needs federal law enforcement on its streets. In a post on Truth Social he wrote:

14 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago, four DEAD! What does failed Governor Pritzker, and the equally pathetic Mayor, say now? BRING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND BRING THEM IN NOW!!!

This comes after the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal to the supreme court, after an appeals court upheld a federal district judge’s decision to block the deployment of the national guard to Chicago.

Just a note that the latest failed vote on a funding bill to reopen the federal government took place after Jeff Merkley, the Democratic senator of Oregon, wrapped up a marathon speech on the Senate floor that lasted almost 23 hours.

Aided by placards behind him, declaring “Trump is violating the law”, the 68-year-old lawmaker issued a far-ranging critique of the administration’s policies.

“The fight isn’t over-we need to keep standing together to resist Trump’s attempts to tighten his authoritarian grip,” Merkley said, after wrapping his floor speech, that came in a couple of hours shy of breaking the record set by his Democratic colleague, Cory Booker, who spoke continuously for more than 25 hours back in April.

Shutdown enters day 23 as Senate Republicans push bill to fund troops

The government shutdown entered its 23rd day, with little end in sight. On Wednesday the Senate failed, for the 12th time, to pass a House-passed stopgap funding bill.

Today, the upper chamber will also vote on legislation to continue paying federal workers who haven’t stopped working during the shutdown, as well as members of the military. The Shutdown Fairness Act is co-sponsored by Republican senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin.

The snag? It also needs 60 votes to advance, and Democrats look poised to hold out.

More than half of Americans, including about three in 10 Republicans, believe president Donald Trump is using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll that also found growing concern about US political divisions nine months into his second term in office.

Some 55% of poll respondents in the six-day poll, which closed on Monday, agreed with a statement that the Republican president is using law enforcement to target his enemies, while 26% disagreed and the rest were unsure or did not respond.

Some 85% of the poll respondents who identified themselves as Democrats agreed, as did 29% of the Republican poll takers.

Trump’s justice department in the past month has brought criminal charges against three prominent adversaries of the president, including former FBI director James Comey, New York state attorney general Letitia James and former national security adviser John Bolton. All three have denied wrongdoing.

The US justice department has historically kept an arm’s length distance from the president, seeking to protect prosecutorial independence. Trump campaigned ahead of the 2024 presidential election with pledges for retribution against his enemies.

He had particular disdain for Comey and James, who had led criminal probes against him that he contends were politically motivated. Trump has denied ordering the justice department to indict his foes, though last month he appeared to push federal prosecutors to charge Comey and James.

New York City’s three mayoral contenders had a fiery debate on Wednesday night in their final televised face-off less than two weeks before voters decide the city’s next leader on 4 November.

Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa participated in a tense and often chaotic discussion. The current mayor, Eric Adams, who dropped out of the race weeks earlier, once again did not attend.

“It’s us versus them,” Sliwa declared in his opening remarks, grouping Cuomo and Mamdani together despite their mutual disapproval of one another.

Mamdani opened by accusing both rivals of focusing more on urging each other to drop out than on offering new ideas. The former governor’s allies have urged Sliwa to withdraw to consolidate anti-Mamdani votes, though it is unclear how many conservatives would back Cuomo.

Cuomo claimed Mamdani “has no new ideas” and merely rehashed ideas from former mayor Bill de Blasio, prompting Mamdani to fire back: “I have plans for our future, my opponents only have fear.”

Beginning with the topic of ICE raids in New York, Cuomo said federal immigration agents should not focus on quality-of-life offenses like street vending, calling those a police matter. He added he would have personally called Donald Trump to rein in ICE.

Sliwa countered that, unlike Cuomo and Mamdani, he would “negotiate with Donald Trump and try to get the best deal possible”. Mamdani hit back, calling Cuomo “Donald Trump’s puppet”.

The two then sparred over which candidate Trump preferred. Cuomo claimed Trump wanted Mamdani elected so he could “come in and take over the city”, calling the progressive “Trump’s dream”.

The debate later turned to the city’s record 150,000 homeless students. Mamdani spoke about plans to double a program pairing shelter families with city workers for regular check-ins. Cuomo said the “homeless rate has more than doubled” since he left office, without clarifying his figures.

Pregnant women have reported bleeding, miscarriages, being shackled and other instances of medical neglect while in US immigration custody, according to a group of prominent civil rights organizations.

The groups – which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and its Louisiana chapter, the National Immigration Project, Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South and Sanctuary Now Abolition Project – sent a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Senate committees on Wednesday, describing interviews with more than a dozen women.

“ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” the letter said.

It noted in particular that ICE had “detained several cases of pregnant individuals arising from domestic disputes. This practice endangers survivors of domestic violence, particularly pregnant individuals, who are more vulnerable to abuse and violence.”

Some of the pregnant women reported being shackled and held in other restraints during transport; detention in solitary confinement; delayed and substandard prenatal care; denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food; lack of interpretation and translation in medical encounters; medical care without informed consent; and medical neglect leading to dangerous infection after miscarriage, the letter said.

The letter specifically detailed the experience of six women held in two detention centers in Basile, Louisiana, and Lumpkin, Georgia.

The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, rolled out a “Federal Action Reporting Portal” form urging New York residents to share photos and videos of federal immigration enforcement action across the state, just a day after a high-profile ICE raid rattled Manhattan’s Chinatown and prompted hundreds to come out in protest.

A US congressman revealed in a Wednesday press conference that four US citizens were arrested and held for “nearly 24 hours” after Tuesday’s raid. Protests broke out in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.

“Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,” James wrote in a statement announcing the portal.

“If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law.”

The form offers spaces to submit images and video footage of the raid, as well as a place to indicate location information. Before submitting, users must check a box that indicates that “the attorney general may use any documents, photographs, or videos I provided in a public document, including in a legal proceeding or public report or statement”.

The Guardian has contacted James’s office for more information.

White House East Wing will be torn down ‘within days’ even as no plans filed for Trump’s new ballroom

Lauren Aratani

Trump administration officials confirmed to various outlets on Wednesday that the White House’s East Wing will be demolished “within days”, a revelation given the administration has not submitted plans for the new ballroom to the federal agency that oversees construction of federal buildings.

In discussion with reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump was asked by Jeff Mason of Reuters to respond to the widespread surprise that the entire East Wing is being torn down. Trump said the wing he described as a separate building “was never thought of as being much; it was a very small building”.

“Rather than allowing that to hurt a very expensive, beautiful building,” he continued. “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.”

Then, pointing at a model of the new ballroom on a table in front of him, and a new structure leading to the ballroom in the location where the East Wing used to be, Trump added: “The way it was shown, it looked like we were touching the White House. We don’t touch the White House.”

“That’s a bridge, a glass bridge going from the White House to the ballroom,” Trump said, of the new structure that will replace the East Wing.

Trump said the result is “going to be probably the finest ballroom ever built” and that the ballroom is “being paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”.

The New York Times, citing a senior administration official, reported that the ballroom plans will mean the demolition of the entire East Wing. The official also said the demolition should be finished by this weekend.

Two Trump officials told NBC News similar information, saying the entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished “within days”.

The US has sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies, as the Trump administration increased pressure on the Kremlin to negotiate an end to its war against Ukraine.

The sanctions were the first against Russia since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, and were targeted to cut key revenues from oil sales that finance the Russian war machine.

The move against Russia marks the latest swing of the pendulum under the Trump administration from coercing Kyiv to sue for peace to growing frustration with Vladimir Putin’s maximalist demands.

“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” said the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in a statement announcing the sanctions against Russia. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”

The British government sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil last week. The EU has sanctioned Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company, but not Lukoil, which is privately owned, largely due to exemptions for Hungary and Slovakia, which buy Russian oil.

Trump, speaking in the Oval Office with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Wednesday, also confirmed he had cancelled a planned summit with Putin in another sign of a breakdown in negotiations between Washington and Moscow.

“We cancelled the meeting with President Putin,” Trump said. “It didn’t feel right to me. It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get so I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future.”

The US military has for the first time attacked and destroyed two boats on the Pacific side of South America, as part of its controversial fight against what it says are drug-trafficking activities.

The strikes – on Tuesday night and then early on Wednesday – killed five people, according to the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. They came on top of at least seven other strikes in the Caribbean that have killed at least 32 people and raised tensions with Colombia and Venezuela.

Hegseth released a brief video of the Tuesday night strike, showing a small boat, half-filled with brown packages, moving along at sea. Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless in flames.

In a post on social media, Hegseth took the unusual step of equating the alleged drug traffickers to the terror group that conducted the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.

“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, who is in the midst of a spat with Donald Trump over the boat strikes and tariffs, said: “The attack on another boat in the Pacific … killed people. It is murder. Whether in the Caribbean or Pacific, the US government strategy breaks the norms of international law.”

Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine.

The University of Virginia (UVA) has become the latest institution to agree to the Trump administration’s demands concerning discrimination in admissions and hiring following significant pressure from the justice department.

The deal, which the department announced on Wednesday, comes after the president of the esteemed public university resigned in June to resolve a justice department investigation into UVA’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

If the president, Jim Ryan, had stayed in the job, he was told “hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld”, according to Mark Warner, a Democratic senator from Virginia.

The deal means the justice department will end its investigation into the school, while the school agreed “not engage in unlawful racial discrimination in its university programming, admissions, hiring or other activities. UVA will provide relevant information and data to the Department of Justice on a quarterly basis through 2028,” the announcement states.

The University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and Brown had already reached agreements with the Trump administration to have federal funding, which had been cut, restored in exchange for settlements concerning claims of alleged antisemitism. They also agreed to demands such as adopting the administration’s definitions of male and female.

Trump poised to send scores of federal agents to San Francisco

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I am Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that the Trump administration appears poised to send dozens of federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation, prompting condemnation from California leaders.

Details of the deployment were still emerging, but it will reportedly involve more than 100 federal agents, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The agents are reportedly set to begin using the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city located across the bay from San Francisco. It remained unclear whether national guard troops would also be involved.

The deployment follows weeks of threats by Donald Trump to target the Democratic-run city. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, criticised the move, calling it “right out of the dictator’s handbook”.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the [national] guard,” Newsom said in a video statement. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

Mia Bonta, the state assembly member who represents Alameda, denounced the arrival of federal agents in her district as “authoritarian theatrics”. “This is against our values as Alamedans to have our city used as a staging ground to inflict fear, terror and state-sponsored violence across the Bay,” she said.

San Francisco is the latest major city targeted by Trump’s campaign of mass immigration arrests. The deployment is expected to trigger a showdown between the administration and local leaders, who have pledged to block militarized immigration enforcement in the city.

San Franciscans have been readying for months for Trump to make good on repeated threats to send troops to the city. At a Wednesday afternoon press conference, San Francisco’s mayor, Daniel Lurie, reiterated that the city was prepared.

“For months, we have been anticipating the possibility of some kind of federal deployment in our city,” said Lurie, adding that he had taken further executive actions on Wednesday to “strengthen the city’s support for our immigrant communities, and ensure our departments are coordinated ahead of any federal deployment”.

In other developments:

Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin was not being “honest and forthright” in Ukraine talks, the US treasury chief has said. The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil came a day after a planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest was shelved, with Washington expressing its disappointment at the lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations with Moscow.

Trump administration officials confirmed to various outlets on Wednesday that the White House’s East Wing will be demolished “within days”, a revelation given that the administration has not submitted plans for the new ballroom to the federal agency that oversees construction of federal buildings.

The president declared himself the arbiter of whether or not his own administration should pay him damages over past federal investigations, telling reporters that any such decision “would have to go across my desk”. Trump insisted on Tuesday that the government owed him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct, while at the same time asserting his personal authority over any potential payout.

A small boat half-filled with brown packages is seen moving along at sea and then explodes and floats motionless in flames, in a brief video released by the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. The operation happened off coast of Colombia, marking the first such strike in the Pacific. Seven previous attacks in Caribbean killed at least 32 people.

The University of Virginia (UVA) has become the latest school to agree to the Trump administration’s demands concerning discrimination in admissions and hiring after significant pressure from the justice department.

Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Maine, said on Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognised as a Nazi symbol.

Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley spoke for nearly 23 hours on the Senate floor to press the case that Trump is acting as an authoritarian by prosecuting political enemies and deploying the military into Merkley’s home town of Portland.

This is not crowd control but a campaign of intimidation and a clear message that dissent will be punished. It comes on the heels of a similar use of excessive force against protesters in Los Angeles.

The congressional Department of Homeland Security oversight committees should hold public hearings to examine agents’ excessive use of force. They should consider legislative remedies to strengthen oversight and accountability of immigration enforcement operations.

(Chicago, October 23, 2025) – Federal law enforcement agents have since mid-September 2025 used excessive force against peaceful protesters, legal observers, volunteer street medics, and journalists during demonstrations outside a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in suburban Chicago, Human Rights Watch said today. Protests at the Broadview, Illinois facility escalated following the start of ICE’s “Operation Midway Blitz” on September 8 and an increase in immigration raids and seizures throughout the Chicago area.

Based on accounts by witnesses and videos that Human Rights Watch analyzed, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents—sometimes in the presence of state and local police, and other federal agents—repeatedly used excessive force against small groups of protesters who appeared to pose no threat to the agents or to public security, and against clearly identifiable journalists, legal observers, and volunteer street medics. They detained dozens of protesters, and at least one journalist and one volunteer street medic. The violent response comes on the heels of law enforcement’s use of excessive force against protesters opposing immigration raids in June in Los Angeles.

“This is not crowd control, but a campaign of intimidation,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “Federal agents are using chemical irritants and firing projectiles at peaceful protesters, volunteer street medics, and journalists in broad daylight. The message is clear that dissent will be punished.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people who were present during the Broadview protests: 7 protesters, 4 journalists, 1 volunteer street medic, 2 immigration rights advocates, and a religious leader. Researchers also analyzed 17 videos recorded during the protests that were posted to social media or provided to researchers. On October 17, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem summarizing these findings, posing questions, and offering the opportunity to comment, but has not received a response.

Witnesses and video confirm that DHS agents used tear gas and fired projectiles directly into groups of protesters, including from the detention facility roof, often without warning, and without protesters appearing to pose any risk to agents. Witnesses and verified footage show there were sometimes as few as 10 protesters and never more than 250.

Raven Geary, a journalist who attended over two dozen protests at the detention facility and was shot in the face with a pepper spray projectile on September 26, said she has been to many protests over the years but that, “I have never seen anything like this response in my life. There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.”

Two volunteer street medics described attending to dozens of people, most of whom needed treatment for exposure to chemical irritants, and some for projectile impact injuries.

Ashley Vaughan, a protester who uses a cane, said that on September 12, agents shot them with pepper balls, causing them to momentarily “black out.” On September 19, agents shot Reverend David Black in the head with a pepper ball while he was peacefully praying near the facility, in an incident captured on video. According to the National Lawyers Guild of Chicago, at least 10 legal observers have been injured.

The lawyers guild said that from September 19 to October 14, federal agents and state and local officers detained at least 78 people at the protests. Two people interviewed, and the colleague of a third, said they were held for 6 to 12 hours and denied access to their attorneys despite numerous requests.

DHS issued a statement on September 19 saying, “rioters assaulted law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.” It also posted photographs on X of what it said were two “pyrotechnic smoke bombs,” two guns, and two pen knives that it had confiscated from protesters. Human Rights Watch could not independently confirm these claims. All those interviewed said they never saw protesters attack law enforcement in any way, or attempt to damage property, consistent with the content Human Rights Watch reviewed.

A coalition of media organizations and individual plaintiffs, including journalists and protesters, filed a class action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against President Donald Trump and senior officials from DHS, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, and other federal agencies, citing the use of excessive force, suppression of free speech and religious expression, and unlawful arrests. In response, on October 9, a US district court issued a temporary restraining order, placing limits on protest policing tactics by federal law enforcement deployed throughout northern Illinois. Photographs apparently show federal agents on October 14 deploying chemical irritants against protesters on the south side of Chicago in an incident that could potentially violate the restraining order.

During the protests, federal agents have repeatedly used excessive and unnecessary force, and in many cases have simply attacked protestors and others without provocation. These findings also implicate civil rights protections under the US Constitution, as well as DHS policies, which include restrictions on when and how law enforcement agents may use force to disperse protests.

The congressional DHS oversight committees should hold public hearings to examine agents’ excessive use of force in the Chicago area, Human Rights Watch said. They should subpoena internal ICE records related to enforcement planning, as well as arrest and use-of-force protocols. Committees should engage independent civil and human rights organizations to provide testimony and evidence and consider legislative remedies to strengthen oversight and accountability of immigration enforcement operations.

“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” Wille said. “These violent abuses are part of a broader assault on US democratic norms and institutions.”

For more details on the Broadview protests and applicable legal standards, please see below.

Operation Midway Blitz

Operation Midway Blitz resulted in the arrest of over 1,000 immigrants in the Chicago area from September 8 to October 3, 2025, according to DHS. DHS agents took many of them to the Broadview detention facility, where demonstrations have taken place since August.

In one fatal incident, an ICE officer shot at a Mexican migrant near Chicago on September 12. On September 30, federal agents raided a South Shore apartment complex using aggressive and violent tactics, detaining 37 people—many without warrants—including US citizens. On October 4, federal agents shot and injured a woman in Brighton Park during an immigration operation, claiming her vehicle hit a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicle.

Excessive Use of Force

After the federal government initiated Operation Midway Blitz on September 8, protesters who had already been gathering outside the detention facility began to appear in larger groups and more often. On September 23, ICE put up a reinforced perimeter fence around the detention facility, pushing the protesters away and onto side streets, witnesses said.

A volunteer street medic present outside the detention facility every Friday since August 8 said that agents’ actions against anyone standing outside the detention facility began to escalate over the course of September: “Initially you could be on the sidewalk, but if you took a step onto the driveway, agents would yell at you. Then as the days passed, it became that anyone stepping on the driveway would get shot with pepper balls. Then, anyone just on the street was getting hit by pepper balls. Then, they put up the fence, and now it’s anyone who gets near the fence gets hit with pepper balls.”

The medic also said that, early on, agents sometimes issued “get back” warnings on an intercom system and on occasion warned they were about to fire tear gas, but that they had completely stopped doing so by mid-September.

Reverend David Black, who began attending the protests on August 29, said agents escalated their use of force over September and that while the number of protesters increased, they remained peaceful.

Photographs and videos analyzed show DHS agents repeatedly deployed a range of what is called “less lethal force” against protesters, including tear gas, pepper balls, and foam projectile rounds, a type of kinetic impact projectile designed to some degree incapacitate or deter a target through blunt force trauma rather than penetration.

All witnesses said that agents used less-lethal force without warning and against people who posed no threat to them. Those interviewed also said they did not see protesters using force against agents. They said they saw some protesters trying to block ICE vehicles by standing in front of them.Two witnesses said that on some occasions, protesters kicked tear gas cannisters away from them, apparently to protect themselves. One video uploaded to X on September 27 shows at least two tear gas canisters being thrown back in the direction of agents. A journalist said that some protesters threw soft toys at agents. Some protesters wore gas masks and held plastic shields to protect themselves.

Law Enforcement Agencies at the Broadview Protests

According to those interviewed and the media content reviewed, almost all DHS agents at the protests had their faces covered, obscuring their identities, and many were not wearing badges or uniforms that otherwise clearly identified their positions within their agencies, undermining accountability as well as basic protections from arbitrary detention or abuse.

Based on witness accounts and analyzed footage, Human Rights Watch identified the following agencies and units from the DHS at the protests in various configurations at different times: ICE, including Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations; CBP, including the Border Patrol Tactical Unit; and the Federal Protective Service.

Agents were also often present from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as were local and state law enforcement officials.

Senior leaders of agencies have appeared at the protest site, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the US Border Patrol’s commander-at-large Gregory K. Bovino. On October 3, Noem told a group of agents from various federal agencies: “We are going to go hard. We are going to hammer these guys … we are going to prosecute them … we are not taking this anymore … We are going to give you guys all the authority that you need to go out there and arrest these individuals who are advocating for violence against you.”

After that, Bovino, a Border Patrol chief from California appointed to lead operations in Chicago, said: “That crowd there is an unsafe crowd ... we are going to roll them all the way out of here. And when they resist, what happens? They get arrested. So, it’s now going to be a free arrest zone.” Noem then added that the agents’ role was to “make sure that these individuals aren’t allowed to conduct this activity anymore.”

Three witnesses said state troopers, Broadview local police, and members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office and Northern Illinois Police Alarm System were there. At times, they helped push protesters away from the area around the detention facility and made arrests, witnesses said. According to the lawyers guild, during protests on the weekend of October 10, state troopers clubbed protesters with long wooden batons, throwing people to the ground and in one instance, dragging a woman across a concrete barrier and through the street. One video uploaded to YouTube on October 5 shows state troopers pushing and arresting protesters near the detention facility.

Firing Kinetic Impact Projectiles and Tear Gas Directly at Protesters

In the cases Human Rights Watch documented outside the detention facility, agents appeared most often to have used chemical irritants, including CS (a type of tear gas), CN (mace), and OC (pepper spray), as well as foam projectile rounds. The chemical irritants were dispersed by grenades, sprayed from large cylinders, and contained in pepper balls, which are small, circular projectiles filled with a chemical irritant fired from a compressed air launcher resembling a paintball gun. Under international human rights standards, the use of less-lethal force and riot control agents such as tear gas is appropriate only when nonviolent means are not effective and even then, should be used with restraint and according to criteria of proportionality.

Ashley Vaughan, who carries a cane, said that, at around 6 p.m. on September 12, agents standing on the detention facility’s roof shot them in the face and body with pepper balls while they were livestreaming. Vaughan said they briefly lost consciousness. When they came to, they saw approximately 15 to 20 agents leaving the detention facility and attempting to push protesters back.

“I was trying to get up,” they said. “[The agents] were probably about a foot in front of me as they were shooting at me.” Vaughan said a few protesters tried to help them up and that agents shot at all of them at least 10 more times. “I couldn’t see for a few days due to the swelling. I had two black eyes. I’m lucky I didn’t lose my vision,” Vaughan said. Vaughan’s wounds took several weeks to heal.

A video verified by researchers shows Vaughan on the ground outside the detention facility. One agent points his pepper ball launcher toward Vaughan and fires. At least six pepper ball impact points can be seen on the sidewalk. Agents continue to fire pepper balls at Vaughan and other protesters as Vaughan gets up and is helped away.

At around 6 p.m. on September 19, Reverend Black, of the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, said he was praying with his hands outstretched with a small group of protesters outside the detention facility. Agents positioned on the roof started firing pepper balls at the group. “They seemed to be targeting my head, because the first couple of rounds hit my head and face ... I was praying; there was no justification for them to open fire on us.”

Human Rights Watch verified two videos uploaded to Facebook and Instagram on the same day that show Reverend Black standing with his hands outstretched, with three agents positioned directly above him on the roof of the detention facility. All three appear to shoot several projectiles in the direction of Black, with at least two hitting him, one in the torso and a second in the head.

As protesters rinsed his eyes with water, 15 to 20 agents left the detention facility and began pushing protesters into a street opposite the detention facility. Then, Black said, agents indiscriminately sprayed the protesters with mace, “soaking” him in the chemical agent. A video Human Rights Watch verified shows agents pushing Black and other protesters away from the detention facility and one of the agents spraying Black in the face with a chemical irritant from less than a meter away. Black had to leave the protests for around an hour to be treated but was not seriously injured.

Also on September 19, a protester who asked not to be named said he saw agents firing from the roof of the detention facility, and that multiple projectiles hit him in the head and left hip.

A volunteer street medic said that on September 26, he mostly helped people flush out their eyes that day, he remembered his colleague treating someone with a forehead laceration caused by a pepper ball fired at close range. The medic also treated someone who had a severe nosebleed after being hit in the face and the back of the head. Another volunteer street medic said he saw an officer yell, “Hey, bitch,” at a protester before shooting at her with pepper balls.

Stuart Hall, 66, a protester and army veteran, said that on September 26 at around 8 a.m., he was standing near the detention facility when agents fired on him: “I hadn’t been advancing [towards the facility], but the pepper balls hit me—two in the legs, two in the torso, and one in my arm.”

Also on September 26, a volunteer street medic said an agent on the roof started firing foam projectile rounds, but that the medic himself “could not see any provoking action from the crowd.” He said the agent also fired at someone playing guitar, and that the round went through the wooden body of the guitar. Another protester described the same incident.

Another volunteer street medic said that on September 26, agents fired on protesters who were reading letters of solidarity pinned to the detention facility’s fence: “I treated one older woman who had just walked up to the fence to read a note and got shot with pepper balls.”

Human Rights Watch analyzed a video posted to Instagram on September 26 of a protester covered in wounds consistent with being shot at close range with kinetic impact projectiles such as pepper balls.

Witnesses said that agents frequently deployed tear gas directly at protesters, rather than above their heads or in front of a crowd. One video posted to X the evening of September 27 that Human Rights Watch analyzed shows agents deploying tear gas canisters directly at protesters. Firing tear gas canisters directly at individuals, particularly if aimed at the head, rather than above their heads or in front of crowds, can prove fatal.

Hitting and Other Physical Violence

Agents also resorted to using physical violence with their hands against protesters for no justifiable reason, protesters and other witnesses said.

On September 19, a volunteer street medic said he saw an officer grab and hold someone in a headlock unprovoked.

On September 26, a protester said he was trying to ask agents a question, when they started kicking and kneeing him in the face and back. At one point, he said, agents had him pinned to the ground, with someone shoving his left cheek and jaw into the ground with their knee, while he felt pressure to his back and spine. A friend who had been standing next to him was violently tackled to the ground by multiple agents, he said. The protestor shared a video of the incident with Human Rights Watch.

A protester said that on the morning of October 3, DHS agents came out of the detention facility to disperse the crowds:

The agents seemed aggravated that people were not moving. An officer wearing a black gaiter mask and baseball cap ripped off my gas mask and upper cut my lip and nose with his palm. Soon after that, agents went from pushing to grabbing bodies. I counted four agents who grabbed onto my breasts. The same officer who tore off my gas mask grabbed and pushed my left breast so hard, it left a bruise where his thumb was under my breast.

Violence Against Journalists, Observers, Medics

Raven Geary, a journalist, said she saw agents fire in the direction of journalists on at least 12 occasions from the beginning of September to early October. She said journalists were wearing lanyards around their necks with their media affiliations, and many had “Press” markings on their bags and helmets.

She said agents firing at people followed journalists as they were dispersing and ducking for cover. In one case, she said, agents sneaked up on two journalists hiding behind a vehicle and fired a pepper spray projectile directly at one, causing a bloody nose.

On the morning of September 26, Geary said she and about six other journalists hid behind a vehicle when agents opened fire on a group of protesters without warning. Agents pursued the journalists from the gate of the detention facility, firing at them. Geary raised her head to look above the hood of the vehicle and an officer wearing a skull motif face mask fired a pepper spray projectile directly at the camera Geary was holding up to her face. “I felt a tremendous pain on the side of my face,” she said. She was left with bruising and a swollen face for days. Geary said she saw patches on the officer’s uniform including one indicating he worked at an ICE field office in Pheonix and one indicating an Arizona border county.

Also on September 26, Paul Goyette, a journalist who been covering the protests since August 29, said multiple agents shot pepper balls directly at his chest. Goyette said agents fired a projectile at his friend that day and his friend had to go to the hospital with a concussion. Goyette said his friend, a former marine, identified the projectile that hit him as a baton round (a type of kinetic impact projectile).

The class action lawsuit says that Charles Thrush, a journalism student and reporter for Block Club Chicago, was reporting on the protests on September 26 when agents shot him in the left hand with pepper balls with no dispersal warnings. Thrush was wearing clearly identifiable press credentials around his neck, standing apart from protesters, and videotaping federal agents as they fired pepper balls at two protesters attempting to shelter behind a collapsible umbrella. Thrush said in a sworn declaration, that on several occasions that day, agents deployed tear gas at him at close range though his press pass was visible. Thrush continued to experience chemical burning from the pepper balls and tear gas for 12 hours.

An agent targeted and shot a CBS reporter, Asal Rezaei, with pepper balls as she drove past the detention facility on September 28, when there was no protest. “A masked ICE agent pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. He saw that my window was open,” Rezaei said in a CBS News report. “I was sitting right there with my window open. A lot of it went inside my car and on my face. I immediately felt it burning, and I started throwing up.” CBS news reported that the Broadview Police department is investigating the incident.

Human Rights Watch also analyzed a video posted to Instagram at 8:40 p.m. on September 27, according to the timestamp. The video shows agents firing tear gas at journalists standing on the opposite side of an intersection near the detention facility. Many start coughing. No evidence of a warning can be seen or heard in the video.

The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker cited other incidents of agents shooting at journalists with pepper balls and tear gas cannisters outside the detention facility.

Adriano Kalin, a photojournalist, said that on the morning of September 26, he saw agents open fire on a group of legal observers who were sitting on the ground with their backs to the detention facility, while wearing identifiable green hats. According to a lawyers guild spokesperson, on September 19, an agent shot a legal observer with a pepper ball in the neck and on September 27, an agent shot a legal observer directly in the face. The lawyers guild said that during protests on the weekend of October 10, state troopers clubbed multiple legal observers.

One of the volunteer street medics said that agents regularly impeded him and his colleagues from treating injured protesters by shooting pepper balls at them, ordering them to move, or pushing them while they treated victims. He said an agent fired directly at him, “while I was on my knees trying to help this guy who was hit.”

Both volunteer street medics said on September 27, at around 8:30 p.m., agents fired chemical irritants into and then dismantled two medical tents that the medics were using to triage and treat injured protesters.

Vaughan said that agents in front of the detention facility fired projectiles at volunteer street medics, preventing the medics from evacuating Vaughan after they were injured by pepper balls on September 19. Instead, Broadview police agents later evacuated Vaughan to an ambulance, which then took them to the hospital along with other injured protesters.

Arrests

Of those arrested between September 19 and October 14, at least 20 individuals were released without charge, while about 58 were charged with offenses under federal, state, or local law, according to the lawyers guild.

One protester said that on September 26, agents assaulted and then detained him while he was trying to speak to them. DHS agents detained him for over 12 hours inside the detention facility, repeatedly interrogated him about the contents of his bag, and why he had attended the protest, and denied him medical treatment though he was in pain from being kicked, kneed, and slammed to the ground when detained. He was also denied access to his lawyer, despite his lawyer’s efforts to gain access. He was eventually released without charge.

A journalist, Steve Held, was detained and held for over six hours before being released without charge, during which time his attorney was denied access to him, Geary said.

Applicable Legal Standards

International Law

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, protects the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. US obligations under the covenant extend to authorities at every level of government: federal, state, and local. The Unites States is thus obliged to ensure that all law enforcement personnel respect human rights.

The ICCPR allows only for limited restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect a narrow range of important interests including public order, public safety, and the rights of others. Restrictions on the right should be carefully tailored. More specifically, they should both be necessary for and proportionate to a permissible ground for restriction. Restrictions justified on grounds of public safety require the authorities to demonstrate “a real and significant risk to the safety of persons (to life and security of person) or a similar risk of serious damage to property.”

Under international human rights standards, law enforcement should only use force if other means to address a genuine threat have proved ineffective or have no likelihood of achieving the intended result. When using force, law enforcement should provide clear warnings, exercise restraint, and act proportionately, taking into account both the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved.

Federal Law

The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the right to free speech and peaceful assembly. These rights are a core pillar of the country’s system of governance. US courts have evolved a deep jurisprudence governing permissible regulation of, and limitations on, the exercise of these rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures by law enforcement, including the use of excessive force during an arrest or other seizure.

DHS Use of Force Policies

Events at the detention facility demonstrate that DHS agencies have not followed their own written policies, which are substantially aligned with international human rights standards on the use of force by law enforcement.

DHS written policy allows law enforcement agents to use force only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative exists, and only the level of force that is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. An updated 2023 DHS policy prohibits the use of deadly force against individuals who pose a threat only to themselves or property, and bans chokeholds unless deadly force is otherwise authorized.

Within DHS, ICE has written standards that authorize force only after all reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. ICE agents must use only the amount of force necessary to gain control of a detainee, protect safety, prevent serious property damage, or maintain facility order. Force must never be used as punishment, and restraints must not be applied to the neck or in ways that restrict breathing or cause pain. While ICE does not have a protest-specific policy document, its enforcement actions during protests are subject to DHS oversight.

CBP has its own use-of-force policy, which outlines strict guidelines for the use of less-lethal force by agents, including that such force must be both objectively reasonable and necessary based on the totality of circumstances. Less-lethal devices and techniques—such as batons, chemical agents, and electronic control weapons—may be used to gain control of a subject, protect safety, or prevent serious property damage, but only when lesser means are ineffective or pose greater risk.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510CCA_ChicagoProtest_header%20image.jpg?h=c3919415&itok=F6purPF9,N,,2025-10-23 10:23:59.540115

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.","A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

“Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,” said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn’t follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

ICE arrests 105 people in southwest Idaho raid, U.S. Department of Homeland Security says

The comments come a day after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin credited ICE for the operation, where she said ICE arrested 105 people for immigration violations. The FBI previously announced five arrests of people linked to the alleged illegal horserace gambling operation in Wilder at La Catedral Arena.

“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation,” she said.

Idaho law enforcement, DHS at odds over which agency led operation

In a joint statement released Wednesday, Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said DHS’s claim that ICE led the law enforcement action “was completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts. It was also deeply misleading to the public.”

“The operation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Metro Violent Crime and Gang Task Force with support from multiple federal, state, and local partners,” Donahue and Ingram said in a written statement. “The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office and Caldwell Police Department, who are both longstanding members of the Metro task force, were on scene assisting with the criminal investigation. ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) were present for the identification and processing of individuals illegally present in the United States.”

Asked about the statement by the Canyon County sheriff and the Caldwell police chief, DHS spokesperson McLaughlin told the Idaho Capital Sun: “Our statement is correct so he must have misspoken.”

The local officials said they “generally limit our comments when it comes to active federal investigations.” But they said they felt it was “important to address the confusion caused by” DHS’s recent statement.

ICE, FBI deny zip tying children. ACLU of Idaho says answers still needed.

Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets.

The FBI and ICE have denied children were zip-tied.

McLaughlin told the Sun that “ICE didn’t zip tie, restrain or arrest any children.” FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker said in a statement Wednesday that “Reports suggesting children were zip-tied or hit with rubber bullets during the October 19 FBI-led operation in Wilder are completely false.”

ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Sun that answers are still needed.

“We are frustrated with the lack of transparency and obfuscation by the agencies involved. All agencies had been preparing this despicable event for a long time, so they should be able to answer questions and be accountable to taxpayers now. And we are demanding answers now,” she said in a statement. “Who was in charge of this effort? Who authorized such an egregious use of force for gambling? How many agencies were involved and what weapons were at their disposal? Who authorized zip tying children? We demand answers and accountability immediately.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4315-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 02:16:56.434860

The organization sent a letter to ICE officials Wednesday demanding that such detainees be released and that the agency conduct a review to ensure they are abiding by federal regulations. The ACLU said it has met with more than a dozen women over the past five months, including those who were pregnant or recently experienced a miscarriage, while held at ICE facilities. The women say they were shackled, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days, and given insufficient food and water.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant detainees.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its care, saying pregnant detainees get regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

In addition, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement Wednesday that such detentions are “exceedingly rare” — and that pregnant women currently account for less than 1% of the total number of ICE detainees in custody. The agency didn't provide additional figures related to detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing — data that Democrats have sought for months.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union cites accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while detained in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody -- including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

When asked about the letter, McLaughlin called it “another disgusting attempt to smear ICE."" She argued that the ACLU used “unsubstantiated” and “unverifiable claims.”

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of the women said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she'd been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and vaginal bleeding. During her time in detention, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU's letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrests and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody. They demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

“Proper care for pregnancy is a basic human right, regardless of whether you are incarcerated or not and regardless of your immigration status,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat. She signed onto a Democratic Women's Caucus letter to DHS officials in July sharing concerns about the “treatment of women” and demanding answers — including how many have given birth while detained.

Kamlager-Dove said she's working on legislation that would “severely restrict the use of restraints on pregnant, laboring and postpartum women who are in federal custody.”

ICE guidelines already say that agents “should not detain, arrest, or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws"" people “known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing,"" based on a policy sent to the AP by DHS. But the document does state that such people may be detained and held in custody under “exceptional circumstances” or if their release is prohibited by law.

The policy also prohibits using restraints on pregnant detainees, but here too there are exceptions — including if there is a serious threat that the detainee will hurt herself or others, or if “an immediate and credible risk"" of escape cannot be “reasonably minimized” through other methods.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who they said was in the US illegally, allegedly rammed law enforcement vehicles with his car while trying to flee an immigration arrest.

Officers fired shots and struck Mr Parias' elbow, and a US marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet, the DHS said. Both were hospitalised with non-life threatening injuries.

Mr Parias, who routinely documents immigration enforcement operations in the Los Angeles area on social media, was charged with assault on a federal officer.

Mr Parias, a 44-year-old Mexican national, has documented Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in south Los Angeles for months. He had previously been recognised by a city councilman for his commitment to keeping the community ""informed, empowered and protected"".

He was scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, but his hearing has been postponed to an undecided date.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokeswoman, said the incident showed ""the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest"".

She claimed law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in threats against them.

In a statement, the US Attorney's Office said Mr Parias was the subject of an administrative immigration arrest warrant and had avoided capture before.

Agents saw Mr Parias leave home in a grey Toyota Camry and drive down a street. Law enforcement officers used their vehicles to box in his car, hoping to prevent him from escaping.

The US Attorney's Office said that federal agents then approached the Camry and gave Mr Parias orders to exit the car and submit to arrest.

Mr Parias ""ignored those commands and drove the Camry both forward and back, hitting two of the law enforcement vehicles"".

He spun the Camry's tires, which spewed smoke and debris in to the air that struck some of the agents, and led the car to fishtail. Agents, worried for their safety, broke the driver's side window to subdue Mr Parias, the statement said.

""A vehicle is a deadly weapon,"" acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said.

LA City Councilmen Curren Price, whose office honoured Mr Parias for his community service, said he was deeply saddened by the incident and stood in solidarity with Mr Parias and his family.

""Richard is a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South Central Los Angeles,"" Price wrote on social media.

ICE raids have increased as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented immigration, with vows to conduct record-level deportations of migrants in the country illegally.

Southern California is home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants, many of whom have been forced into hiding.

Immigration raids in Los Angeles prompted backlash over the summer and led to protests.

The Coast Guard is focused on ensuring safe and secure operations in support of federal partners.

“Sending troops to San Francisco?” Gov.","SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — The Trump administration is sending more than 100 federal agents to San Francisco, KRON4.com has learned. The news, which was first reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, was confirmed by KRON4 network partner, NewsNation.

According to a NewsNation source, the agents could arrive as early as Thursday. The contingent of federal officers includes members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

They have been dispatched to Coast Guard Island in Alameda, according to NewsNation’s sources. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

KRON4 News reached out to the United States Coast Guard and received the following statement from a spokesperson:

“The U.S. Coast Guard is providing facility support to Customs & Border Protection as requested, in a supporting role. The Coast Guard is focused on ensuring safe and secure operations in support of federal partners. All questions about the operation should be directed to CBP, the lead agency.”

“At this time, I have not received any report of ICE agents being sent to Base Alameda,” they added.

The City of Alameda released a statement Wednesday saying that the Alameda Police Department is not part of the operation and does not enforce federal immigration laws.

The deployment follows weeks of President Donald Trump ratcheting up the rhetoric around sending the National Guard to San Francisco, which currently ranks 26th nationally in violent crime. Trump raised the prospect of federal intervention in SF in a White House news conference last week.

Over the weekend, the president doubled down, telling Fox News, “We’re going to San Francisco next.” During the Fox segment, Trump hinted that he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to the city.

On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the department would be going into San Francisco “at the direction of the president.”

San Francisco city leaders, including Mayor Daniel Lurie and District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, along with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have been adamant that federal troops are neither wanted, nor needed in the City by the Bay.

“Sending troops to San Francisco?” Gov. Newsom tweeted. “Do it and we’ll sue.”

“Our city attorney is equipped to take necessary legal action,” Mayor Lurie reiterated during a public announcement Wednesday.

“Sending the military will not help our city or our country,” he added.

KRON4 reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and received the following statement:

“As the Secretary said on Monday, DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists—in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco.

As the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on immigration, an increasing number of U.S. citizens are finding themselves caught up in the sweeping actions.

A recent investigation by ProPublica reveals that more than 170 American citizens have been detained by immigration agents during the first nine months of this push.

Our own Liz Landers recently spoke with the mother of one of these individuals.

Liz Landers:

A 15-year-old boy with disabilities was handcuffed outside of a Los Angeles high school in August after federal immigration agents mistakenly identified him as a suspect. The boy was waiting in a car with his mother while his sister registered for classes inside.

The family is suing the Trump administration, alleging racial profiling, false arrest and assault. Federal officials have denied any wrongdoing and say they were conducting a targeted operation.

For more on what happened that day and why the family is taking legal action, we are now joined by Andreina Mejia, the boy's mother.

Andreina, walk us through what happened that day. What happened when federal agents approached your car?

Andreina Mejia, Mother of Detained American Child: I was on the phone, and something told me to look up, when I just seen this white truck approaching my car, and it looked like coming directly to me, where I'm like, oh, my God, did they lose control? Like, he's going to hit my car.

And I just seen these two men get off from the front pointing their guns at me and my son, like, actually at our car. I had my window a little bit down. They just came one from my side, the other one from my son's side, and they just opened our doors. They took me out. They took my son out.

All I remember me telling my son is like: ""Don't make any movement. Just follow instructions,"" just because, in my mind, I'm like, OK, they're pointing guns. If they see my son trying to reach for something, I don't know if they're going to shoot.

So I was trying to maintain him calm. And after that, I'm just seeing that they pulled him out. And I'm like: ""What's going on?""

The guy's like; ""Oh, like, we're looking for somebody and your son fits that description.""

So, I’m like:

""I mean, who are you guys looking for?"" And they showed me a picture. And I'm like: ""That's not my son. Like, my son is with me at all times.""

So, after that, they let my son come towards me. As my son was approaching me,he started crying and just hugged me. And I didn't really appreciate the comment that the guy did where he just called my son: ""Oh, we confuse you with somebody else, but just look at the bright side. Like, you're going to have an exciting story to tell your friends when you go back to school.""

I just looked at him. And, as a mom, it hurt me, because I was just thinking, there's nothing exciting about getting guns pointed at you.

Liz Landers:

Walk me through what it was like to hear a law enforcement officer say to you and your child that you would have an exciting story to share after they had drawn their weapons towards you?

Andreina Mejia:

I was really upset just because, like I said, there's nothing exciting about that, and especially how can you be approaching somebody without first asking, oh, let me see an identification to see who you are?

I mean, you just can't be targeting people just because, oh, you look like that person or because you guys got the same color skin. Yes, my son is a bit darker than me, but especially a minor. I mean, I'm the mom. You could approach me and be like, oh, we're looking for somebody. What's your son's name? I would have gave it to you.

Liz Landers:

How did your son react? And you have said that he is a student with disabilities. How did that shape how he understands what happened that day?

Andreina Mejia:

Hold on. I just hate talking about it, because I get all the emotional.

Well, he completely doesn't understand. Like, the phase that he had of confusion, it was just like, I guess he was just trying to wrap his head on, like, what's going on? I mean, it's not an everyday thing that somebody just randomly gets guns pointed at them, like, especially when you're not doing anything.

I was just trying to explain it to him to the best of my ability, just because I know, if somebody were to ask him something, he won't really understand what you guys are asking him. He has this thing where he always looks at me to try to be like, OK, mom, explain it to me in a way where I know I'm going to understand.

Even though he's 15, his brain is pretty much kind of like a 8- or 9-year-old.

Liz Landers:

Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the ""News Hour"" that — quote — ""Agents were conducting a targeted operation on criminal illegal alien Cristian Alexander Vasquez-Alvarenga, a Salvadorian national and suspected MS-13 pledge with prior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity of Arleta.""

The administration here is denying wrongdoing and saying that this was simply a case of mistaken identity during a targeted operation. What is your response to that?

Andreina Mejia:

I mean, they're wrong for that because, number one, for my son being a special kid, where in their right mind do they think that he's going to be gang-affiliated?

Second, it's, like I said, my son doesn't need my side. And that's for the same reason, because my son does not look his age. He looks older. I don't want people to be thinking, no, no, he's not certain age. He's an older person. Maybe she's lying.

So for — when I heard that, that they were looking for this person and that he was apparently Salvadorian, I'm not — we're not Salvadorians. At this point, it's like, what now? Who's going to help my son deal with a situation where there's time still that it's hard for me as his mom to wake him up in the morning to go to school?

Sometimes, he doesn't want to go to school. Sometimes, he has good days. Sometimes, he has bad days. Sometimes, he says he can't sleep. Right now is a little bit more calmer, but in the beginning, when it was recent, I would be driving and just like making sure he was OK and, out of nowhere, he would just get emotional.

So I will pull over and I'm like: ""What's going on?""

And he's just like: ""Oh, now I don't feel safe, because now I feel that whenever we're in the street, I have to look at my surroundings.""

Liz Landers:

What message do you have for federal officials?

Andreina Mejia:

They just need to be more professional and not just target innocent people.

All this that they're doing is unacceptable. And just I see all these different videos, and it breaks my heart, just because I'm like, what world are we living in now? Like, even to me that I go out and, even though I'm born here, I'm even scared sometimes to go, because I'm like, what about them mistaking me by somebody that doesn't have papers, and I tell them I do, and they don't care, and they still try to grab me in a way where they could hurt me?

Liz Landers:

You have filed a lawsuit. What is next for you in this incident?

Andreina Mejia:

I just want justice, and I just want them to take accountability for what they did, because, like I said, before all this happened, I feel that my son was a bit different.

And now, with this whole situation, it's like I said. He has this good moment. He has this bad. And he just tells me like: ""No, I don't want to go to school."" And, oh, he's going to go to school. We're going to get through this. And me, as his mom and his protector, I mean, I'm always going to make sure that he's good.

Liz Landers:

“The NYPD had no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon,” the police department posted on X.
“@realDonaldTrump claims he’s targeting the “worst of the worst.” Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street,” Hochul said in a statement.","An immigration sweep targeted New York City vendors just days after a conservative influencer tagged Immigration and Customs Enforcement on social media to “check this corner out.”

Hundreds of angry New Yorkers clashed with federal agents Tuesday afternoon at the city’s famed Canal Street, an area which for years has been a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes and sunglasses as well as phones and other electronics.

Protesters attempted to block immigration agents from carrying out the operation when scenes turned ugly.

The day after the raid, which resulted in nine arrests of migrants and four protestors, signs were posted on light poles in the area. They warned migrants about he raids and told them to call for help from inside a “non-public” space such as a church, where agents need a judicial warrant to make arrests.

On Wednesday, Canal Street was quiet with few vendors when typically many are out selling knock-off items.

""I was like, whoa. You usually see them all, packed full, everywhere on the streets. Today, pretty quiet,"" tourist Aye Soe told ABC 7.

On Tuesday, Savanah Hernandez, a right-wing political commentator with Turning Point USA, appeared to take credit for the anti-immigration crackdown after alerting the Department of Homeland Security to activity in the area over the weekend.

“It does really seem like the admin is watching and responding to what’s being reported on X,” Hernandez said in response to another user who congratulated her.

Hernandez shared a video from the corner of Canal Street and Broadway on October 19.

“The entire sidewalk is filled with illegals who state they are from Senegal and I watched as they fled police,” Hernandez said. “Perhaps @ICEgov should go check this corner out.”

She followed up with another post Monday. “Day 1 of me asking the @DHSgov to go and clean up Canal street in NYC where hoards of illegals are brazenly selling fake goods in broad daylight,” she posted.

Hernandez replied to Customs and Border Patrol’s X account Tuesday morning and told the agency to “go check out Canal St in New York City.”

“There are easily 30-40 illegals there daily that are selling fake goods,” Hernandez wrote. “Would be an easy sweep and send a strong message to the sanctuary city of NY.”

Federal agents swooped on the area and made a number of arrests Tuesday afternoon.

Protesters surrounded masked officers and in one instance, attempted to block their vehicle from driving off as they shouted “ICE out of New York” and other chants.

Agents were seen pushing protesters to the ground, and threatening them with pepper spray, before detaining several of them.

As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Additional federal agents, armed in combat gear and carrying long guns, also arrived with a military tactical vehicle known as a BearCat and made additional arrests.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were carrying out an enforcement operation against sellers of “counterfeit goods” when “rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement.”

New York officials condemned the operation while the NYPD clarified it was not involved.

“The NYPD had no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon,” the police department posted on X.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul called out President Donald Trump as she condemned the use of pepper spray on New Yorkers.

“@realDonaldTrump claims he’s targeting the “worst of the worst.” Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street,” Hochul said in a statement. “You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers.”

New York Democratic Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said the tactics were “aggressive and reckless.”

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety,” Mamdani said. “It must stop.”

Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams said the city had no involvement in the action and was still gathering details.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/22/00/Immigration-Canal_Street_Sweep_29607.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-23 00:17:28.606900

On October 15, Hegseth and deputy Steve Feinberg sent a memo to Pentagon officials announcing a new policy mandating that any communications they have with Congress or state elected officials must first be approved by the Defense Department’s legislative affairs office. That office is currently led by Donald Trump appointee Dane Hughes.

Information such as mandated congressional reports, requests for information by lawmakers, drafting and technical assistance, and legislative correspondence must be approved by the office, the memo says. Previously, individual offices within the Pentagon managed their own communications with lawmakers.

Hegseth and Feinberg also ordered the legislative affairs office to compile a report of the Pentagon’s interactions with Congress to address “issues, inefficiencies or misalignments” within 90 days. It instructs the office to present proposals to “enhance compliance.”

The memo was issued on the same day that the vast majority of journalists covering the Pentagon walked out last week, after Hegseth implemented new, restrictive rules that put a major gag on the information journalists are allowed to access.

This has left the Pentagon without a dedicated set of journalists from major news outlets. Critics say the rules are disturbing, and a step toward government censorship.

The memo, first reported by Breaking Defense and confirmed with officials by The Associated Press, says that the move is necessary for the Department of Defense to “achieve our legislative goals.”

“This requires coordination and alignment of Department messaging when engaging with Congress to ensure consistency and support for the Department’s priorities to re-establish deterrence, rebuild our military, and revive the warrior ethos,” the memo says.

“Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Department of Defense] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,” Hegseth and Feinberg go on.

Top Pentagon Spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement that the move is a “pragmatic step” that is meant to “facilitate increased transparency.”

“This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information,” he said.

However, the move has already been criticized by those who say that it will make it harder for Congress to access necessary information.

“Congress decides who Congress will talk to, and the continued efforts of the secretary to wall off the department is not consistent with past tradition, and I frankly don’t think it’ll fly with the members or leaders of the committee,” House Armed Services Committee member Rep. George Whitesides (D-California) told Breaking Defense.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-22-hegseth-meeting.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 22:56:27.329773

Inspectors General OIGs, as established by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), exist within departments and agencies of the Executive Branch.
The IG’s responsibility to conduct oversight of Executive Branch departments and agencies and identify and report any waste, fraud or abuse within them appears to fit naturally alongside Congress’s investigative and oversight functions.
Practical Considerations for the IGs Placement While moving IGs to the Legislative Branch appears to be a potentially viable solution for protecting their ability to expose corruption and government waste, there are practical benefits to their present placement in the Executive Branch.
If Congress were to consider moving IGs into the Legislative Branch, Congress may need to reenvision or reduce some IG functions along those lines.","Almost immediately upon taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump unlawfully fired 17 inspectors general (IGs), and over the course of this year has taken actions to demote and replace at least three others, hindering these crucial officials’ efforts to serve as an important guardrail against government waste and corruption. In some cases President Trump has nominated replacements with questionable qualifications, overtly partisan backgrounds, or prior ties to the agency heads they would oversee. These actions effectively politicize and threaten IG independence and demonstrate a clear necessity for Congress to establish stronger protections to ensure that IGs are empowered to conduct government oversight free from interference, intimidation, and threat of retaliation. One way that Congress can do that is by moving the Offices of Inspector General (OIGs) into the legislative branch.

OIGs, as established by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), exist within departments and agencies of the Executive Branch. Although Congress gave the president the power to appoint and remove IGs, Senator Thomas Eagleton emphasized during a floor debate on the legislation that the “‘most important’ characteristic of the inspectors general” would be their independence.

For the nearly 50 years since, IGs have provided critical independent oversight that has improved the integrity of the United States government. Congress has used its oversight powers to highlight threats to IG independence and has repeatedly used its spending power to ensure agency cooperation with IG audits and investigations. For example, Congress successfully leveraged funding for the Department of Commerce General Counsel to compel the agency to provide the IG with access to records that it had threatened to withhold.

Still, the independence and protection of IGs has been an ongoing concern for Congress, motivating multiple legislative reforms intended to protect them from arbitrary removal. For instance, Congress passed the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, which established a requirement that Congress be notified in writing no later than 30 days before the removal or transfer of an IG, and provisions of the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which required the Executive to provide Congress with a detailed account of the justification for its removal of an IG and that the IG remain in place for 30 days while Congress considers that justification. Immediately after the first firings, Senators Grassley and Durbin wrote to Trump, noting that “Congress was not provided the legally required 30-day notice and case-specific reasons for removal, as required by law.” And in September, a district court found it “obvious” that Trump violated these laws when he fired IGs en masse in January, but stayed the case pending Supreme Court review and held that the court could not reinstate them.

Current Threats to IG Oversight and Independence

President Trump has cited his authority as president under Article II of the Constitution to justify numerous actions which appear to have effectively eroded the independence of IGs. During his first term in office, President Trump took at least 25 discrete actions encroaching on the independence of IGs, including firing two permanent IGs, removing three acting IGs without any clear justification, and asserting that he would prevent the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery from communicating with Congress about administration misconduct and obstruction without “presidential supervision.” Trump’s actions at that time drew bipartisan criticism from Members of Congress.

In his second term, Trump’s actions to remove IGs and eviscerate their ability to conduct effective independent oversight are far more unabashed. Notably, in June, Trump removed and replaced the Department of Education’s Acting Inspector General, René L. Rocque, less than two weeks after she reported to Congress that her office had “experienced unreasonable denials and repeated delays” from administration officials in response to requests for “access to documents, staff, and information,” thereby preventing her office “from discharging [its] statutory mission.”

To justify this removal, President Trump wrote to Congress:

“I have determined that the changed priorities of my Administration (as compared to the previous one) will be better reflected with new leadership in this Office.”

Congress specifically designed IGs to not be tied to a particular administration because they are supposed to provide oversight and accountability regardless of political party or who currently occupies the Oval Office. The IG Act is explicit that IGs are to be appointed “without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, [and] financial analysis.” Contrary to President Trump’s assertions, IGs are not intended to reflect, or carry out, the policy priorities of the current administration. Their function is to conduct oversight and investigations with purposeful detachment from administration priorities and goals.

In his letter, President Trump cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arguing that the Constitution gives the president “the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.” That case said that the president could remove the head of an agency – the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) – despite Congress legislating statutory protections stating that “the President may remove the Director only for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’”

Congress has considered proposals to restrict the president from removing IGs, except “for cause,” but the Supreme Court’s analyses in Seila Law along with a 2010 Supreme Court case, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, present complex questions as to how Congress could effectively implement “for cause” removal protections for IGs across government. A May 22 Supreme Court order issuing a stay in Trump v. Wilcox effectively overruled the seminal 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court recognized the ability of Congress to limit the removal of executive branch officials. Now, the Supreme Court seems poised to explicitly overrule that 90-year-old precedent. On September 22, the Supreme Court agreed to hear another case, Trump v. Slaughter, challenging Trump’s removal of a commissioner from the Federal Trade Commission. In the order granting an application for a stay and agreeing to hear that case, the Supreme Court directed the parties “to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled.”

Do IGs Belong in the Legislative Branch?

Regardless of one’s view of the Court’s embrace of the unitary executive theory in Seila Law, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference in the nature of the work that an agency head does compared to an IG. The IG’s responsibility to conduct oversight of Executive Branch departments and agencies and identify and report any waste, fraud or abuse within them appears to fit naturally alongside Congress’s investigative and oversight functions.

As the Supreme Court eloquently articulated in the 1927 case McGrain v. Daugherty:

A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change, and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it.

An essential function of the IG is to inform Congress of how the laws are being executed. As Republican Senator Chuck Grassley explained in Senate floor remarks in 2020 that more than 40 years after he voted in support of the 1978 Act establishing the OIGs: “IGs … help[] Congress watch over the people’s business and ensure the fidelity of agency actions…. In this way, these watchdogs serve an indispensable function in our system of checks and balances” between the Executive and Legislative branches.

Congress similarly serves an indispensable function as the body with the means to effect change and improvements and corrective action through legislation, including through laws making appropriations. It is for precisely that reason that the legislative branch already has, within it, bodies that perform an independent oversight and investigative function – the very same function IGs perform.

The GAO Example

Congress already possesses an oversight analogue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) performs an oversight function similar and complementary to the mission and work of the IGs across government, and resides within the federal Legislative Branch. Congress created the GAO, originally named the General Accounting Office, in 1921 through the Budget and Accounting Act (BAA).

At the time Congress passed the BAA, it shared present day concerns regarding the Executive auditing itself. The BAA thus transferred the auditing function and responsibility from the then-Comptroller of the Treasury and Assistant Comptroller of the Treasury, originally housed within the Treasury Department, to the GAO, which was established as “independent of the executive departments and under the control and direction” (emphasis added) of a newly created position – the Comptroller General of the United States. As the Supreme Court explained in the 1986 case, Bowsher v. Synar, “Congress created the office [of the Comptroller General] because it believed that it ‘needed an officer, responsible to it alone, to check upon the application of public funds in accordance with appropriations.’”

In the early days of the GAO, it faced resistance from the administration. In the 1930s, there were several attempts to abolish the GAO, weaken it, or to encroach upon its independence. In 1932, President Hoover even attempted to dismantle the agency through Executive Order – a plan that Hoover’s own Budget Director advised against. A congressional committee found that “to interfere with work specifically given by law to an agency specifically created to function independent of the executive branch and on behalf of Congress… would defeat the very purpose of existing law, as it would break down the means of obtaining a uniform accounting system throughout the Government.” In 1971, former Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats wrote of GAO’s role:

Objective information about our national programs and their effects is almost the lifeblood of our national legislature if it is to remain an effective force in our national government and responsive to the needs of the people. [GAO], as an agent of the Congress and accountable only to it, is one of these sources of information.

In an effort to protect the GAO’s, and the Comptroller General’s independence and ability to serve as a nonpartisan oversight arm of Congress, the BAA provided that the Comptroller General would be appointed for a fifteen year term of office, and “not be eligible for reappointment,” ensuring they would serve across administrations and insulating them from partisan political concerns as well as the policy priorities of any particular president. Furthermore, the law provided that the Comptroller General could only be removed for cause “by joint resolution of Congress after notice and hearing,” thereby protecting GAO from the president encroaching on the agency’s independence.

Despite his earlier writings about the importance of the government oversight function, as president, Woodrow Wilson vetoed the first version of BAA that passed Congress because he believed he should be able to fire the Comptroller General, and argued that the BAA’s removal provisions may be unconstitutional. However, when Warren G. Harding later became president, he signed the BAA into law.

In 1980, Congress passed the General Accounting Office Act and established the process that exists today, whereby a commission consisting of congressional leaders recommend nominees to the president for a vacant Comptroller General position. But under this structure, and despite the more than 30 Legislative Branch office and agency heads with varying approaches to how they are appointed, the Comptroller General is ultimately appointed by the president. Perhaps Congress wanted to avoid a confrontation as to whether the law ran afoul the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. In his June 4, 1920 statement accompanying his veto of the BAA after its initial passage, President Wilson argued that “the Congress is without constitutional powers to limit the appointing power and its incident, the power of removal” and that the Appointments Clause, Section 2 of Article II of the Constitution, provides that “all officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, shall be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.” President Wilson wrote, “Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.”

Under the Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, there are two types of officers – principal officers, which can only be appointed by the president with the Senate’s advice and consent, and inferior officers, whose “work is directed and supervised at some level.”

As explained by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), “Congress has periodically examined the procedures used to appoint these officers with the aim of protecting the prerogatives of, and ensuring accountability to, Congress within the framework of the advice and consent appointment process established in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.” Under that framework, Congress has some flexibility to prescribe, by statute, the method of appointment of inferior officers.

CRS has researched and analyzed the question of how IGs, as they currently serve under the law, fit within the appointments clause, and notes that “the unique functions and discretion provided to IGs under the IG Act do not appear to fit neatly into the typical Appointments Clause classifications, and as a result, whether IGs in fact exercise ‘significant authority’ is an open question that no court has addressed.” However, CRS notes that a U.S. District Court case in the District of Columbia, Jefferson v. Harris, “determined that Members of the Council of the Inspector General on Integrity and Efficiency’s Integrity Committee, which includes IGs, are not officers” of the United States.

Today, Congress and the American people again grapple with how to protect the auditing, oversight, and investigative work of the IGs across the federal government, while they are embedded within the Executive Branch. The solution may be for the current Congress to follow the example its predecessors set when creating the GAO, and passing legislation to move those IG offices into the Legislative Branch. Congress could consider creating a single coordinating agency to facilitate more effective and efficient systemization of oversight and investigations of Executive Branch activities, or allow GAO to play a coordinating role.

Practical Considerations for the IGs Placement

While moving IGs to the Legislative Branch appears to be a potentially viable solution for protecting their ability to expose corruption and government waste, there are practical benefits to their present placement in the Executive Branch. Most notably, operating within Executive Branch departments and agencies, IGs can have direct access to agency records and information as well have ready and direct access to the agency head under the IG Act. For example, IGs can directly access documents, files and information for audit and investigative purposes from agency cloud computing data systems without going through the back and forth of asking for records to be sent to investigators.

In a 1999 case, NASA v. FLRA, involving labor union representation, the Supreme Court analyzed the IG Act and explained the nature of the relationship between the IG and its respective department or agency. Specifically, the Supreme Court found that, as presently situated under the IG Act, an OIG employee is a “representative of the agency” in which they reside. However, the relationship between the OIG and the agency for which it conducts oversight is a product of the statute Congress passed and, thus, could be changed by Congress.

Continuing to consider GAO as an analog to the IGs, the Supreme Court, in Bowsher, examined the placement of the Comptroller General in the Legislative Branch, and the associated limitations of that office. The Court wrote that GAO “is ‘an instrumentality of the United States Government independent of the executive departments,’… [t]hus, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.”

As they stand now, IGs arguably perform some traditionally executive functions that may need to be reconsidered if they are to be moved within the Legislative Branch. For instance, many IGs have “law enforcement” powers, including seeking and executing search warrants, carrying firearms, and making arrests. GAO has none of those powers. It has no authority to make arrests, exact fines, or otherwise directly pursue criminal proceedings. Instead, GAO is, generally, limited to making and reporting findings to Congress, the president, or relevant agencies. If Congress were to consider moving IGs into the Legislative Branch, Congress may need to reenvision or reduce some IG functions along those lines.

***

Practically speaking, the IG Act, including the various IGs’ placement and status, afford those officials significant opportunities and tools to conduct effective oversight. Those opportunities and potential efficiencies must be balanced against the opportunity and temptation for the president and administration officials to stifle, obstruct, or seek to control or redirect that oversight for partisan, policy, or even nefarious reasons.

IGs are key players in the fight against corruption. They expose fraud in government contracting, enforce anti-bribery laws, and refer illicit finance schemes for prosecution. A Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Minority Staff Report found that the IGs fired by President Trump had produced “a collective monetary impact of over $50 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024 alone by identifying potential cost savings in federal programs… and achieving actual investigative recoveries…such as fines, settlements and restitution” and also identified as much as “$175 billion in potential savings that could be achieved if federal agencies implement the OIGs’ recommendations that remain open.”

Do the potential benefits of the IGs’ placement in the Executive Branch outweigh the costs? This is a question for Congress to consider, but the Trump administration’s sweeping attacks on federal oversight offices appears to weigh heavily toward congressional action to protect IG independence by moving those officials to the Legislative Branch. Protecting IGs is critical to continued transparency with regard to government programs, and vital to combatting waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2218864038.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 09:56:56.451306

The federal agents who raided Garcia’s worksites and detained him — even after he showed his REAL ID — had none of that.","Leo Garcia Venegas is a natural-born American citizen who just wants to work in peace. But the federal government won’t let him. He has been swept up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at work — not once, but twice — where he was assaulted, handcuffed and treated like a criminal by agents of the U.S. government.

Garcia is a construction worker in Baldwin County, Alabama. Every day, he goes to work and helps build the homes needed to support the region’s fast-growing population. And every day, he works in fear. Earlier this month, he partnered with my nonprofit law firm, the Institute for Justice, to file a lawsuit against ICE and several other federal agencies, senior officials and officers responsible for enforcing immigration laws.

It all goes back to early 2025. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump rallied federal agencies, including ICE, to start conducting mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. That effort has involved, in Border Czar Tom Homan’s words, “massively expand[ed]” “worksite enforcement operations.”

Masked agents burst in and started detaining everybody who looked Latino (they left a group of non-Latino workers alone).

Officers storm into the non-public areas of businesses, armed with guns, and often detain anybody who they think looks undocumented. Many of the people swept up in these raids are American citizens. These raids have hit the Alabama construction industry particularly hard. Officers have been raiding private worksites for months. Construction workers, including citizens, are afraid to go to work. Garcia’s experience shows why.

In May, he was working on a posted and fenced site, preparing to lay the foundation for a new home, when masked agents burst in and started detaining everybody who looked Latino (they left a group of non-Latino workers alone). When Garcia told them he was a citizen, the agents tackled and handcuffed him anyway. Even after inspecting his REAL ID — a credential issued only to citizens and lawful residents — the agents kept Garcia restrained for about an hour.

Then, in June, it happened again. Federal agents entered a nearly completed house in which Garcia was working, cornered him and ordered him to exit so they could check his status. Once again, Garcia produced his REAL ID. And once again, the agents refused to accept it. They marched him several blocks to a lineup with other workers they had detained — including another citizen and a lawfully present worker — only releasing him 20 minutes later.

Garcia was not charged with a crime after either raid. After the first raid, the federal government claimed that Garcia “physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands.” But Garcia was merely taking out his phone to record the altercation — when an ICE agent grabbed him. And the government has never attempted to justify Garcia’s second arrest.

The fact is, Garcia did nothing wrong. All he ever did was show up to work. And for that, he was deprived of his rights as a U.S. citizen. The government’s difficult relationship with the truth cannot change the reality of what it did to Garcia.

These terrifying raids show no sign of slowing down. Indeed, a recent post by Stephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor, suggests the floodgates are now open. According to Miller, the federal government holds the power to “ensur[e] the full and unrestricted enforcement of immigration law in all fifty states.”

That is embarrassingly wrong. The Constitution does not tolerate “unrestricted” power. Indeed, the whole point of the Constitution is to restrict government power. Look at the Fourth Amendment: It protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”

The bottom line is simple: There is no ICE exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Moreover, the Constitution does not tolerate an ends-justify-the-means approach. Regardless of how one might feel about current federal immigration enforcement, hopefully all Americans can agree that any policy issued by any administration must comply with the Constitution. Under Supreme Court precedent, here is what a constitutional policy looks like: If federal agents want to raid posted, fenced or enclosed property, they need a warrant. If they want to detain people, they need reasonable suspicion that those people are violating immigration or other laws. And if they want to arrest people, they need probable cause.

The federal agents who raided Garcia’s worksites and detained him — even after he showed his REAL ID — had none of that. So, Garcia is suing.

The lawsuit, which will seek class-action status, asks the U.S. district court in southern Alabama to enjoin ICE and its fellow immigration enforcement agencies from conducting any further warrantless construction site raids or suspicionless seizures of citizens and other lawfully present workers — all of which violate the Fourth Amendment and federal regulations that were adopted to limit immigration officers’ power.

The bottom line is simple: There is no ICE exception to the Fourth Amendment. Garcia has every right, as an American citizen, to work on private property without having to fear that armed, masked agents will storm the site without a warrant and detain him just for doing his job. As much as Mr. Miller might like to wish that right away, wishes are not law — the Constitution is.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251020-ice-arrest-zz-991a8a.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 00:17:41.747653

Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, where a judge on Monday ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial immigration raids in the Los Angeles area this summer.

In a response to CBS News' request for comment, a spokesperson for DHS said, ""DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens-including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists-in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.""

In a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create ""conditions for anxiety"" in American cities.

""He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place,"" Newsom said.

President Trump has recently floated the idea of dispatching federal agents to San Francisco.

""We're going to go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,"" Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired over the weekend.

On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said local residents would protest peacefully if the Trump administration uses ""un-American tactics to target immigrant communities"" in the area.

""This federal administration wants to divide us, but we know San Francisco is strongest when we come together to stand up for each other and our values,"" Lurie added.

The agents are reportedly from several agencies including Customs and Border Protection, which traditionally is deployed at the border but has been sent farther afield by President Donald Trump. News of the arrival of these agents came after Trump had threatened to send National Guard troops to San Francisco, saying he has “unquestioned power” to do so.

National Guard troops deployed to the Bay Area would not be able to make immigration arrests. They could, however, offer “cover” for CBP agents who are doing so. This has already taken place in other cities.

In Chicago, Texas National Guard Troops were instructed to protect ICE agents and buildings.

In Los Angeles, troops carrying shields and armed with rifles stood in front of federal buildings and accompanied ICE agents on raids. They escalated tensions by giving protesters a subject to face off with, Los Angeles Times reporter Rebecca Ellis said in an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting.

It’s possible members of the National Guard in San Francisco would be stationed around federal immigration buildings at 100 Montgomery or 630 Sansome St., where the bulk of immigration arrests in San Francisco have taken place.

Still, unlike ICE or CBP agents, which can largely operate with a free hand, legal experts said National Guard troops deployed to California cannot make arrests without a warrant. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops must be authorized by the governor to participate in law enforcement against civilians.

That is unlikely to happen locally. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been outspoken against Trump’s deployment.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE. It creates fear and anxiety in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the guard,” Newsom said in a video posted on X. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

A federal judge ruled in June that deploying the California National Guard to participate in civilian law enforcement without Newsom’s consent was illegal. By the end of July, all but 300 of the National Guard troops who had been deployed in Los Angeles were sent home.

Trump has intimated that he would invoke a different law, the Insurrection Act of 1807, to deploy troops to San Francisco. This would allow soldiers to enforce a federal court order, like a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, or suppress an “uprising.”

In most cities, however, National Guard troops are focused on more mundane tasks. In Washington, D.C., where Trump deployed the National Guard back in August, troops have been shoveling mulch, picking up trash, and patrolling train stations. They’ve also asked city leaders for other “beautification” projects to work on.

“We collected approximately 40-plus trash bags with several pieces of debris, some old tires and crates,” said Bernard Aguon, command chief warrant officer of the D.C. Army National Guard, in a statement to the U.S. Department of Defense. “Our goal here is really just to help the community by beautifying areas within the district.”

San Francisco, for its part, is already planning to take legal action if the guard is deployed here, and has joined a coalition of other jurisdictions urging the U.S. Supreme Court to keep the National Guard from Chicago and other cities.

“We don’t exactly know what the federal government is planning in San Francisco and across the Bay area, but we do know this federal administration has a playbook in cities across the country,” Mayor Daniel Lurie said on Wednesday. “I want to be very clear: We are prepared.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-0820-5.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 00:17:48.465827

The agency’s bilingual team stepped up as interpreters and support links for both the Glenn Valley Foods workers swept up in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push and an understaffed Lincoln County jail unfamiliar with the detainees’ languages and cultures.

Hope Esperanza quickly became known as an on-the-ground resource for families, attorneys and news updates related to Nebraska’s largest immigration raid since 2018. The organization’s response led to awards and recognitions from other advocacy groups.

Some of that notoriety has piqued interest in the nonprofit’s origins and the North Platte native behind the group.

Split between countries

TinaMaria Fernandez, 43, is herself the product of a family split by U.S. immigration policy. Her dad, from Mexico, met and married her mom while he was in North Platte working at a local horse-processing plant. Despite a lengthy attempt, his visa was not renewed and the young family lived apart.

“My mother stayed here by the wishes of my father, to raise me in the United States,” Fernandez said. “We’d go and visit my dad in Mexico.”

At one point, Fernandez said, her parents thought they had necessary paperwork in order and her mom and family members traveled south to get him. “They wouldn’t let my dad come back across.”

Eventually, she said, her dad urged his wife to move on. Each began new relationships. Fernandez has siblings and relatives on both sides of the border. To this day, she said, her parents talk sometimes by phone.

“There’s that love, you know, they always say that it’s two countries that separated us and separated our hearts and our family.”

Fernandez said her North Platte childhood was “not the greatest,” and while she wonders how life might have been different had her father been closer, she chooses to believe “everything happens for a reason.”

She said her own immigration-related experiences helps to better understand people she works with through Hope Esperanza, including the Glenn Valley and other federal detainees awaiting deportation at the Lincoln County facility.

“I see, I know the effects of it,” Fernandez said. “My heart goes out to them.”

Her team also has been contacted by McCook representatives seeking guidance on community-building in the town where a state prison is being transformed for ICE detention use. Advocacy groups will not have the same access to the McCook state-federal facility as they do in Lincoln County, Fernandez said. But she said programs akin to those offered by Hope Esperanza could make local immigrant populations feel supported.

Building momentum

One of the organizations that recently recognized Hope Esperanza and founder Fernandez noted that her education and jobs helped prepare her to run the North Platte agency, which is fueled by grants and philanthropic donors and has grown to a team of more than 20 people.

Fernandez earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Wyoming and a nursing degree from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She worked as a social worker for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Correctional Services and as a counselor for Lutheran Family Services.

While in nursing school, Fernandez said she was horrified by a particular family’s health care challenges she believed were exacerbated by language barriers. She saw children removed from Spanish-speaking households that likely could have stayed together had parents tapped available support services.

That spurred her to conduct a six-month needs assessment, focusing on the county’s Latino community, the area’s largest minority group. She contacted many of the roughly 90 nonprofits working in Lincoln County to understand why gaps existed. Hope Esperanza formed to help plug the gaps.

Then still a student, Fernandez started small, filling her SUV with food to deliver to families. Her team at one point made and sold enchiladas to help stave off a mom’s eviction.

Fernandez called it “God’s work” that the group’s nonprofit status and structure were newly in place when North Platte learned the region would become home to a Sustainable Beef LLC processing plant, one of the largest processing facilities in the nation.

“God was sending a whole lot more needs our way,” Fernandez said, referring to an incoming workforce that largely would be newcomers of different cultures whose first language is not English.

The rancher-owned plant reportedly will employ up to 850 workers and have a $1.5 billion community impact. Operations launched this spring, following years of preparation.

Hope Esperanza, meanwhile, has been expanding services (Esperanza means hope in Spanish). The operation offers food, clothing and furniture aid; transportation and employment coordination, health and youth programs, safety and cultural events. Integration and language access classes are geared toward newcomers to the city of about 23,000 people.

Ripples of raid four hours away

The group’s statewide notoriety grew after Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer got the call in June asking if his North Platte-based county jail could accept detainees that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested in the Omaha raid, four hours away.

Lincoln County had an established contract with the feds to house ICE detainees. But the 63 Glenn Valley workers increased the jail population by about 50%, the sheriff said, at a time when the facility was short-staffed. He said Hope Esperanza was a lifeline.

Kramer already had worked with Fernandez, and participated in bridge-building meetings the nonprofit holds with city and law enforcement officials.

Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of the ICE action, said he had never heard about Hope Esperanza before the June 10 Omaha raid. Last week, the annual Hispanic Heritage Awards organized by Garcia and his wife Yanira recognized the group for its response and outreach to the migrant detainees.

“What really impressed us was they were not only providing basic interpretation and translation services, but they were a moral support and a human heart caring for the women going through that difficulty and separation from their families,” Garcia said.

He was told that on one visit to the jail, Hope Esperanza representatives played Selena music and the women inmates danced.

“They had a human moment together to lift up their spirits … in a very difficult moment when they were detained, separated from their families,” Garcia said. “The fact we had Hope Esperanza there was a blessing for those women and for us as a community.”

Garcia and some other immigrant advocates reacted much differently to a recent proposal by the Douglas County sheriff and the then-state director of the League of United Latino American Citizens (LULAC).

Sheriff Aaron Hanson had sought to lease space in the Omaha-based county jail to the feds for ICE detention, framing the idea as both a profitable and humanitarian venture, partly because it would keep Omaha detainees closer to their families.

The prospect was shot down by a majority of the County Board. Garcia has said the increased ICE presence would lead to more fear and local arrests.

“There is a difference between being in favor of detention versus people on the ground helping individuals in these unfortunate circumstances,” Garcia said.

Nebraska Appleseed earlier this month also recognized Fernandez. The Lincoln-based group selected her for its “Roots of Justice Award” even before the raid, and cited ongoing efforts to connect young Latinos to their culture and new workers to community resources.

“She brings a group of diverse community members together on a regular basis to problem solve and plan for the community,” said Appleseed senior welcoming coordinator Christa Yoakum.

Ruby Méndez López said she was impressed by Fernandez’s varied roles, including as a mom and wife. “She’s heading this organization but also is a full-time nurse and does a million other things around North Platte.”

Elephant on her chest

Though the number of detainees from Omaha’s Glenn Valley raid has dwindled to a couple, the Hope Esperanza team said it still meets at least weekly with other migrants held by ICE in the Lincoln County jail.

Staff and volunteers also are working with an influx of newcomers due to the meatpacking plant, providing language access and other services. The nonprofit is trying to launch a health clinic for underserved populations.

Fernandez continues to work on a book that delves into her journey and identity shaped by immigration and separation. She already authored a children’s book about belonging, illustrated by her son Micah and titled “Nico’s New Home.”

She said she has yet to fully process events of the past year related to ramped up immigration enforcement but sometimes feels the weight of an “elephant” on her chest.

“I don’t see politics,” Fernandez said. “I see displaced families. I see separated families, kiddos going to bed at night without their parents. It’s a lot.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/118272477799200054-e1761167336386-1024x8891761180881.jpeg?h=874824da&itok=c8x2bASD,N,,2025-10-22 20:57:06.792857

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

“Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,” said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn’t follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.

Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.

Cary López Alvarado, of Hawthorne, California, was nine months pregnant when she was arrested by immigration officials alongside her husband, an immigrant from Guatemala. Alvarado was held overnight but was never sent to a detention facility: After taking her into custody, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) learned she was a U.S. citizen.

Immediately after her release, she began to experience sharp pains in her stomach, according to a claim she filed against the federal government. She gave birth a few days later.

Angie Rodriguez, an immigrant from Colombia, was taken into ICE custody following a routine check-in with immigration officials in July, and soon after found out she was pregnant. At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center where she was held, Rodriguez could hardly bring herself to eat the small meals that the detention facility served because of how they looked and smelled, and her only other option was buying processed food like instant noodles and chips.

Rodriguez went on to miscarry while in custody, according to a lawsuit she filed against the federal government.

Antonia Aguilar Maldonano, a mother of two from El Salvador, was arrested by ICE on her way to work and detained at the Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota for almost a month. Her youngest child is 22 months old and still nursing; he has acid reflux and an allergy to other forms of milk. The jail was not equipped to house someone who was nursing, said Gloria Contreras Edin, her lawyer: It did not have a breast pump when Aguilar Maldonado arrived, forcing her to use her hands to massage milk out until the facility was able to buy a pump.

Lawyers successfully argued for her release on bond — $10,000, paid for by members of her church — while the government makes the case that she be deported.

A Biden-era policy restricts ICE from arresting or detaining immigrants who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing, except in extreme circumstances. While President Donald Trump has not formally rescinded the policy, it’s clear from lawsuits, news reports and advocates for immigrants who are detained that it’s not being followed.

Quantifying the exact number of pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants in custody has become impossible: This March, Congress let lapse a requirement that the administration report twice a year on how many of these immigrants are being held in immigration facilities. Since the fall of 2019, Congress had required the Department of Homeland Security to publicly report the count every six months and include “detailed justification” for every single detained immigrant who was pregnant, postpartum or nursing.

ICE did not respond to The 19th’s request for this data.

While the agency said in a statement in August that pregnant immigrants are receiving sufficient care in custody, medical professionals say the conditions in these facilities can heighten the risk for complications. Limited food can impact nutrition at a vulnerable time; access to medical appointments is spotty and often not aligned with standards of care; and pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees also face the stress of arrest and separation from their families.

The impact of arrests and detention

In 2021, following public outcry against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies, the Biden administration directed ICE not to detain pregnant, postpartum or nursing people except in “exceptional circumstances"" — they are a national security threat or pose immediate harm to themselves or other people. Those who are detained are supposed to be held in facilities suited to appropriate health care. ICE-employed medical professionals are supposed to provide weekly updates on those detainees to relevant agency directors. The ICE Health Service Corps is also supposed to keep consistent records of all pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees, providing monthly updates to the organization’s leadership.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has not formally rescinded that policy, but administration officials argued in court that he had done so implicitly through a sweeping anti-immigration executive order that supercharged immigration enforcement. A federal judge refuted that argument, but on its website, ICE says the policy is “not reflective of current practice.”

“We're seeing more pregnant women detained again after not seeing much of that, at least not in ICE detention,” said Amanda Heffernan, a longtime nurse-midwife and professor of midwifery at Seattle University.

Rebecca Cassler, an attorney at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her organization’s pro bono program has seen an increase in cases of detained pregnant, postpartum and nursing people. She says no one outside ICE really knows how many, but it’s enough to make her “very concerned.”

Though the federal government has not made public how many pregnant people have been detained, Democratic lawmakers have published multiple investigations documenting known cases.

One report, published this summer by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, identified 14 credible cases of pregnant women being mistreated in detention facilities. The report included a description of pregnant women sleeping on cell floors, one detainee being told to “just drink water” when needing medical support, and another miscarrying alone after days of bleeding.

ICE has disputed the report. ""Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,"" ICE said in a statement on its website.

A September 18 letter signed by 29 Democratic senators and addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem directed federal officials to clarify just how many pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding people are being detained, how many have been deported and what health care is being made available to them. DHS has not acknowledged receipt, said a spokesperson for Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who organized the letter.

“We do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing,” the senators wrote.

The Women’s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group, is seeking records from Homeland Security pertaining to pregnant, postpartum or nursing individuals who have been detained. It recently launched its own independent tracker, encouraging health providers, lawyers and family members to submit information about pregnant people who have been detained. The commission said it’s too early to provide an accurate count from its tracker.

Zain Lakhani, a lawyer and director of migrant rights and justice for the commission, said credible reports of pregnant people being detained suggest a frequency higher than ICE’s policy would suggest.

“It would be shocking that we would be able to have this level of detained pregnant people under the guidance,” she said. “We are seeing just this shocking number of detained postpartum and pregnant women.”

Workers helping integrate deported immigrants in Honduras told researchers from the Women’s Refugee Commission that nursing women who were deported had not received enough food and water to continue lactating.

“They arrive with hardly any milk — or milk that looks like water — and this affects the babies’ weight,” one worker said, according to a report published by the organization.

The impact of arrests and detention

By the time Aguilar Maldonado left the jail, her breast milk had started to dry up, Contreras Edin said. She is particularly worried about the impact of detention on her children, who were not with her and now follow her wherever she goes, including to the bathroom. Her boyfriend has been deported; she is asking a judge to let her leave voluntarily — a process that has fewer legal penalties than being deported — so she and her children can follow him.

“Her children were traumatized and her youngest was especially traumatized,” Contreras Edin said. “That bond was broken during detention and that left a permanent impression on her children.”

There is no way to ethically research how detention specifically may affect pregnancy outcomes, including whether it could increase the possibility of miscarriage, said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who studies the reproductive health of incarcerated women. But evidence does show that physical and psychological strain — the kind people can suffer while detained — threatens the health of a pregnancy and can mean greater risk of preterm birth.

“I’m very concerned because of the conditions we’ve already heard about that could be increasing the risks of adverse outcomes,” Sufrin said. “I’m very concerned about the outcomes for these moms as well as for the outcomes for their babies.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the conditions or available accommodations for pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants.

Alvarado, who is seeking $1 million following her arrest, citing “the unconstitutional conduct, unlawful arrest, and the tortious conduct of Border Patrol and ICE agents,” said her daughter is healthy and growing. But she’s still dealing with the aftermath of her detention.

Footage of the arrest shows federal agents holding her hands behind her — despite guidance advising that officers generally not use physical restraints on pregnant people and that, if they do, they should keep a pregnant person’s hands in front.

Her husband has now been deported, and Alvarado has no income. She’s watching her savings dwindle and relying on her family to help care for her little girl. She said she was unsure if she’d have to pick up multiple jobs to make ends meet — and if so, who would be able to care for her infant. She remembers the terror she felt while in government custody.

“Every time I see a news or video, it does rewind in my head,” she said. “It does get me very emotional, seeing stuff like that.”

Victoria Petty, an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who is representing Rodriguez — the woman who suffered a miscarriage in detention — said that she first connected with her client’s husband in late August, about a month after his wife’s detention.

He had left Petty a voicemail and text explaining that his wife was pregnant in a detention center and that he was really worried about her. Days later, he called again. “He’s crying on the other line, and he's like, ‘She had a miscarriage. I don't know what to do. She's in the hospital. Help,’” Petty recalled.

Rodriguez described in court records being “unignorably hungry” inside the Bakersfield, California, detention facility and lacking prenatal health care and education for weeks after her pregnancy was confirmed. Eventually, she began to see brown discharge and was taken to an off-site hospital where, days later, health care providers confirmed she had miscarried.

Petty moved quickly to file a lawsuit claiming unconstitutional detention. Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.

“It was very scary. She was in pain. So after this really traumatic experience, and her going to the hospital and confirming that they did not see the fetus on the ultrasound — after all of that, they brought her back to the detention center and put her in medical isolation,” Petty said, adding that her client was distraught.

Petty said it’s hard to determine whether detention conditions caused or contributed to Rodriguez’ miscarriage, a very wanted first pregnancy. But, she said, it’s important to consider the stress of being suddenly detained in a van — her client is from Colombia; kidnappings and murders have left lasting scars on the Latin American nation — along with the strain and lack of food options in detention.

“These are the conditions that she was in when she was pregnant. And we cannot rule out that having been under that level of stress and fear and having that little care contributed to her pregnancy loss,” Petty said.

Heffernan, who has worked with several immigrants who were detained while pregnant, said she has seen pregnant immigrants get a few small accommodations: being placed in a lower bunk instead of the top bunk for sleep or getting extra milk with their meals and sometimes an extra sandwich or snack before bedtime.

Medical care, she said, can be “very haphazard and spotty,” with prenatal appointments often not happening on schedule.

“You do see people getting a prenatal visit here and there, but not in a timely fashion, and not according to the standard of care for people that are outside,” Heffernan said. “For instance, in a couple of people that I've been in contact with recently, one had been in detention for several months and had had no prenatal care at all. Another had had one visit.”

Pregnant immigrants are also more vulnerable to more severe cases of COVID-19, flu and other illnesses, which spread quickly in crowded places like detention centers.

There is an extensive list of best practices for detained pregnant and postpartum people, Sufrin said, including but not limited to regular access to comprehensive physical and mental health care, nutrition, the ability to exercise and adequate housing.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c2c79b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x945+0+128/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2Fa0%2F3fdc61284733bd03214f659f24b2%2Fice-detention-pregnancy-top.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:21:41.684690

AG James wants ICE actions documented, submitted by residents

New York Attorney General Letitia James is encouraging residents to submit videos or other documentation of federal immigration enforcement actions via her office's new online portal.

""Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,"" James. ""If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law. No one should be subject to unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

Police have raided the illegal street markets before, but John Yong, an attorney who has represented Canal Street vendors since the 1990s, said this time was different.

""The feds had never come into Canal Street before,"" Yong said.

Some people working at nearby businesses said they worry the threat of federal crackdowns will steer customers away from storefronts, but others said they are happy about the busts.

""Our business is very big affected now, because people no more come here,"" a gift shop worker said.

""Because, bad people do bad things, they should get rid of those people, right?"" added Jackie Chen, manager of Sang Sang Jewelry.

Protest of ICE planned for Wednesday

A protest organized by The People's Forum, a group that says it advocates for working class and marginalized communities, is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Wednesday in Foley Square.

""We will NOT tolerate ICE's terror in our communities,"" the group wrote on social media.

How Tuesday's operation was carried out draws ire of many

The federal operation provided dramatic visuals. Chopper 2 flew over the scene as DHS investigators drove military-style trucks through Lower Manhattan escorted by armed federal agents.

That, in part, prompted protesters to make their way to 26 Federal Plaza, where the nine men were taken. The demonstration was peaceful, but those in attendance were clearly unnerved about what they saw earlier in the day.

""The manner in which ICE is going into areas and just wreaking havoc, causing unsafe communities — it's very obvious that this isn't making anyone safer,"" one protester said.

""Immigrants are an inherent part of the country. They are not the problem in this country,"" another protester said.

Elected officials were equally angered.

""This is not immigration enforcement. This is lawless terror designed to incite violence to create a pretext for Donald Trump to send the military into New York City,"" Rep. Dan Goldman said Wednesday. ""They are doing it to terrorize New Yorkers, to terrorize our communities, to install fear in New Yorkers. It is unacceptable and it must stop.""

In a post on X on Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul said, ""[President Trump] claims he's targeting the 'worst of the worst.' Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street. You don't make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers.""

""New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws. While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement,"" Mayor Eric Adams said. ""Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.""

""There is no excuse for sending military-style vehicles and a national law enforcement response for street vendors,"" City Comptroller Brad Lander said.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/22/f4c8970a-1c91-4efa-8cf2-c9db1eeb1395/thumbnail/1200x630/5cef44cc2cefda2285fefb8ae5b335ba/dhaliwal-11p-pkg-canal-wcbsfib4-hi-res-still.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:21:28.320895

Roberto Mosquera del Peral was one of five men sent to the small kingdom in southern Africa in mid-July as part of the expanding U.S. deportation program to Africa, which has been criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who say deportees are being denied due process and exposed to rights abuses.

READ MORE: More African nations are receiving third-country immigrants deported by the U.S. Here are 5 things to know

Mosquera’s lawyer, Alma David, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that he had been on a hunger strike for a week, and there were serious concerns over his health.

“My client is arbitrarily detained, and now his life is on the line,” David said. “I urge the Eswatini Correctional Services to provide Mr. Mosquera’s family and me with an immediate update on his condition and to ensure that he is receiving adequate medical attention. I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini.”

An Eswatini government spokesperson referred the AP, which requested comment, to a correctional services official, who didn’t immediately respond to calls and messages.

Mosquera was among a group of five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen deported to Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by a king who is accused of clamping down on human rights. The Jamaican man was repatriated to his home country last month, but the others have been kept at the prison for more than three months, while an Eswatini-based lawyer has launched a case against the government demanding they be given access to legal counsel.

Civic groups in Eswatini have also taken authorities to court to challenge the legality of holding foreign nationals in prison without charge. Eswatini said that the men would be repatriated, but have given no timeframe for any other repatriations.

U.S. authorities said they want to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini under the same program.

The men sent to Eswatini were criminals convicted of serious offenses, including murder and rape, and were in the U.S. illegally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said. It said that Mosquera had been convicted of murder and other charges and was a gang member.

The men’s lawyers said they had all completed their criminal sentences in the U.S., and are now being held illegally in Eswatini, where they haven’t been charged with any offense.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has cast the third-country deportation program as a means to remove “illegal aliens” from American soil as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, saying they have a choice to self-deport or be sent to a country like Eswatini.

The Trump administration has sent deportees to at least three other African nations — South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana — since July under largely secretive agreements. It also has a deportation agreement with Uganda, although no deportations there have been announced.

New York-based Human Rights Watch said that it has seen documents that show that the U.S. is paying African nations millions of dollars to accept deportees. It said that the U.S. agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take up to 160 deportees and Rwanda $7.5 million to take up to 250 deportees.

Another 10 deportees were sent to Eswatini this month and are believed to be held at the same Matsapha Correctional Complex prison outside the administrative capital, Mbabane. Lawyers said that those men are from Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Cuba, Chad, Ethiopia and Congo.

Lawyers say the four men who arrived in Eswatini on a deportation flight in July haven’t been allowed to meet with an Eswatini lawyer representing them, and phone calls to their U.S.-based attorneys are monitored by prison guards. They have expressed concern that they know little about the conditions in which their clients are being held.

“I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini,” David said in her statement. “The fact that my client has been driven to such drastic action highlights that he and the other 13 men must be released from prison. The governments of the United States and Eswatini must take responsibility for the real human consequences of their deal.”

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction in August calling for winding down operations at the detention center, but a three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based appellate court in September issued a stay of the preliminary injunction as an appeal of Williams’ decision plays out.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed the lawsuit this summer and were joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. They allege violations of a federal law that requires an evaluation of potential environmental impacts before projects such as the detention facility can move forward.

The environmental groups on Oct. 10 urged the appeals court to reject pausing the appeal because of the government shutdown, saying an “indefinite stay” is improper.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s request, also filed Oct. 10, said its lawyers aren’t allowed to work during the shutdown.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the request said.

Wednesday’s order came a month after the three-judge panel agreed to the environmental groups’ request to speed up the case and directed oral arguments to be held in January.

The new order “means that the government is continuing to run this destructive facility while simultaneously arguing that it cannot defend these operations in court,” Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an email.

“This is a disappointing turn of events, but we’ll be standing at the ready when they’re finally ready to face us in court,” she added.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., attacked the Trump administration's immigration efforts on Wednesday, which he claimed were opposed by Americans.

Jeffries' comments came during his near-daily government shutdown press conference in response to a reporter asking an unrelated question about whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) needed scaling back.

""We've all been very outspoken as it relates to the out-of-control behavior unleashed on law-abiding immigrant communities by masked agents hiding their identity and far too often violating the rule of law, often directed at people who are American citizens,"" the top House Democrat answered.

""It's all unacceptable, and it's one of the reasons why the American people have turned on Donald Trump and Republicans with respect to their extreme immigration policies,"" he said.

He then demanded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be held ""accountable for the overreach and the extremism that they're being subjected to in terms of what the American people are experiencing.""

""And yet we're seeing none of that accountability coming from Republicans,"" Jeffries continued. ""That's unfortunate, but Democrats will continue to make the case to the American people that this is all abnormal. So much of it is unlawful, and it's got to stop.""

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in response, ""ICE officers are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults because of unhinged rhetoric from activists and Democrat politicians smearing heroic ICE officers. Anyone who assaults or otherwise harms law enforcement officers will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

Attacks on ICE have increased since Trump took office. A woman from North Texas was arrested this week in connection with a violent attack on an Alvarado ICE facility, according to CBS News.

FBI Director Kash Patel previously called the incident a ""planned and coordinated terrorist attack.""

Democrats have spent much of Trump's first year back in office criticizing the actions of ICE, in particular, homing in on accounts of American citizens being improperly detained by federal authorities.

The majority of Republicans have pushed back, arguing ICE has largely done the necessary work of cracking down on illegal immigration.

Two views

Here is what the videos show:

One video shows a large amounts of smoke coming from a sedan that is boxed between two law enforcement vehicles.

For 25 seconds, smoke continues to rise from the car, as the sound of an engine revs up and down repeatedly.

Then an agent shouts “Shoot him with a pepper ball!”

As the sound from the vehicle goes quiet, 11 shots ring out in rapid succession. The video does not show who fired the shots.

A second video shows the aftermath of the shooting.

Several law enforcement officials surround the sedan. They eventually open the door and appear to pull someone out. The person screams in pain. Officer urge people out of frame to “get back.”

The suspect is placed against a wall and handcuffed. Several officers surround him as he periodically screams out.

A group of firefighters eventually approach the man and render aid.

Suspect hospitalized

Parias remained in the hospital Wednesday, pushing back his arraignment on a charge of assaulting a federal officer to an undetermined date.

In a federal criminal complaint, authorities accused Parias, 44, of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in and tried to arrest him during an immigration enforcement operation.

Account of the feds

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a post on X that Parias rammed a Toyota Camry into the law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him, “spun the tires, spewing smoke and debris into the air, causing the car to fishtail and causing agents to worry for their safety.”

An agent then opened fire, wounding Parias and a deputy U.S. marshal, who authorities said was hit with a ricochet bullet. Both are expected to recover, Essayli said.

In an affidavit, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations said that ICE and the United States Marshals Service had set up surveillance on Tuesday in the neighborhood around a home located on the 400 block of 20th Street, where they believed Parias could be found.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0354556/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5383x2826+0+381/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2Fd4%2F2f7c87404a18b4c2876b370588e3%2F1527030-me-federal-agent-shot-21.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:21:31.620209

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area.","Social media was flooded Wednesday with rumors of federal agents being sent to Coast Guard Island in Alameda to prepare for massive immigration sweeps. Then the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a single, unnamed source “familiar with the operation,” that the Trump administration has deployed 100 federal agents, including Customs and Border Protection, to the Coast Guard Base in Alameda.

The New York Times confirmed the story after speaking with three people with direct knowledge of the operation, reporting today that Border Patrol agents are headed to the Bay Area as part of an immigration crackdown.

President Donald Trump’s recent threats to order the National Guard into San Francisco have had the whole region on edge, wondering if the Bay Area is about to experience the kind of chaos and violence that have accompanied similar actions in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and now Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

We contacted federal law enforcement agencies, local and state officials, police, members of congress, and others seeking solid information.

Here’s what we’ve learned.

Asked about whether the U.S Customs and Border Protection Agency is sending agents to the Coast Guard base in Alameda for an immigration operation, Jaime Ruiz, a CBP spokesperson emailed the following statement:

“As the Secretary said on Monday, DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists—in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.”

A Coast Guard spokesperson, Petty Officer Graves, told us earlier today that Coast Guard facilities in Alameda are providing support to Customs and Border Protection, and he referred to an “operation” that’s underway. But he would not comment on that operation and said to contact CBP for more information.

“There’s no report I have yet of ICE agents being here,” Graves said about the Coast Guard’s Alameda base.

A Coast Guard spokesperson told the SF Standard, “Base Alameda is preparing to support CBP agents starting tomorrow as a place of operations.”

State Senator Jesse Arreguín, who represents Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda, issued a statement earlier Wednesday confirming that a major immigration operation will soon begin.

“When similar deployments have occurred in other cities what we’ve seen are overly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that lead to protests and civil unrest. The President and his goons then point to the unrest they themselves created to justify their tactics and even send in the National Guard,” Arreguín said.

Arreguín urged Oakland and Bay Area residents to be cautious and peaceful if they plan to protest the Trump administration’s operation. “This administration has put their playbook on display and are seeking to create chaos in order to justify additional federal deployments. Don’t take the bait.”

The city of Alameda issued a statement clarifying that its police department “is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.”

A spokesperson for Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii referred a reporter to the city manager’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon. U.S. Congresswoman Lateefah Simon’s offices did not immediately respond to questions seeking more information about the potential federal operation.

Rumors of some kind of large-scale immigration crackdown appears to have been first reported by a Youtuber who goes by “Hawk” on Wednesday. In a video, Hawk claimed to have spoken to someone with “close ties to the Coast Guard,” saying that 1,500 agents would be arriving at the Alameda Coast Guard base on Thursday, Oct. 23. Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area. Those claims do not appear to be true at this time.

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area. The group Bay Resistance is hosting a Zoom training Wednesday at 6 p.m. where Bay Area residents can get training in rapid response, community safety, and legal observing and learn about a mobilization plan for the day federal agents arrive.

Meanwhile, in Santa Clara County the Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to raise physical barriers and lock gates to prevent federal immigration agents from using county property for surveillance and arrests. The county plans to put up signs to warn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away from those properties. The county is following Chicago’s lead to block immigration enforcement without a court order. Santa Clara County has already expanded a plan to coordinate a counter-response to ICE raids by offering legal aid, shelter, food, child care and other assistance to immigrants.

As a sanctuary city, Berkeley police and other city employees are mandated not to help ICE with an investigation, detention or arrest unless there is a valid, limited-in-scope court warrant signed by a district judge. The city also takes strides to limit the information it keeps about residents’ immigration status, and city employees are required to provide equal access to services regardless of immigration status. The Berkeley school district, UC Berkeley and Berkeley City College have similar policies.

Back in February, the National Park Service (NPS) eliminated the words “queer” and “transgender” from the Stonewall National Monument website.
The letter-writers added: We are deeply alarmed by the NPS’ recent changes to Stonewall National Monument.
Earlier this year, Miss Major spoke out against the Trump administration’s attempts to erase transgender history at Stonewall.
They keep continually trying to eradicate us,” Miss Major said in an interview with USA Today.","Dozens of Democratic members of Congress have signed an open letter addressed to the Trump administration, demanding that portions of LGBTQ history that were removed from the Stonewall National Monument be restored.

Back in February, the National Park Service (NPS) eliminated the words “queer” and “transgender” from the Stonewall National Monument website. The monument commemorates the Stonewall Uprising, a 1969 riot in New York City for gay liberation — led by transgender women of color — that laid the foundation for Pride celebrations today.

The decision to remove those references was reportedly made to comply with President Donald Trump’s anti-trans executive order, issued the previous month, which sought to “restore” references to supposed “biological truth” within the federal government — a false notion that rejects the widely accepted scientific fact that gender is not binary or solely determined by a person’s sexual organs.

Last week, 72 Democratic lawmakers in Congress signed an open letter demanding that references to transgender and queer people at the Stonewall National Monument be restored — including Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) and Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York), leaders within the Congressional Equality Caucus, as well as Rep. Dan Goldman (D-New York), who spearheaded the effort.

Their letter, addressed to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron, noted that the monument is meant to honor “the legacy of the Stonewall Rebellion and the critical role it played in the LGBTQIA+ civil rights movement.”

“This pivotal moment would not have happened without the courage of trans activists, particularly transgender women of color such as Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, who were on the front lines and fought for gay and transgender rights,” the letter stated.

The letter-writers added:

We are deeply alarmed by the NPS’ recent changes to Stonewall National Monument. … This erasure of transgender and queer Americans from the history of Stonewall—or from any part of our national narrative — is a blatant attack on the integrity of public history. The history of Stonewall cannot be told without the stories of transgender Americans.

The letter-writers then expressed concerns that the administration would alter the history behind other monuments, including those relating to Japanese internment camps during World War II, the U.S. genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the Americas, and the enslavement of Black people. Efforts to reshape historical narratives to conform to a political agenda “risk undermining public trust and the credibility of the Park Service,” they wrote.

The signers also said they were “especially troubled with the ongoing implementation of NPS’ June 9th memo that requires all NPS units to post signage to encourage the public to offer feedback on any information that they feel portrays American history and landscapes in a negative light.”

“The lack of transparency on how NPS plans to rewrite ‘negative’ content and incorporate visitor feedback is deeply concerning,” the letter-writers warned. “We must reject any attempts to gloss over or otherwise rewrite difficult chapters of our history.”

The letter from lawmakers came just days after Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a transgender activist and veteran of the Stonewall uprising, passed away at age 78.

Earlier this year, Miss Major spoke out against the Trump administration’s attempts to erase transgender history at Stonewall.

“It’s just terrible. They keep continually trying to eradicate us,” Miss Major said in an interview with USA Today.

“Being transgender is not the road to hell,” she went on, adding that those trying to erase history were “blinded” by people simply living their lives.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_1022-stonewall.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 01:56:36.605735

“Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,” James wrote in a statement announcing the portal.

“If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law.”

The form offers spaces to submit images and video footage of the raid, as well as a place to indicate location information. Before submitting, users must check a box that indicates that “the Attorney General may use any documents, photographs, or videos I provided in a public document, including in a legal proceeding or public report or statement.”

The Guardian has contacted James’s office for more information.

The Chinatown raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

Videos of Tuesday’s raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

Outrage over the ICE raid quickly spread – all three mayoral candidates condemned the raid, as did Governor Kathy Hochul.

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop,” mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani wrote on X.

New York City immigrant rights groups spoke out as well.

“ICE descended on Manhattan’s Chinatown with military-style vehicles, masked agents and riot gear to target street vendors trying to make a living. This operation had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with terrorizing immigrant families and communities,” said Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigrant Coalition.

ICE raids have been cropping up increasingly in New York and around the country this year.

A 16 October raid in midtown Manhattan was the first known raid on a migrant shelter of the current Trump administration.

Ruben Torres Maldonado was arrested by immigration officials in Niles, DHS and his family said.

His daughter Ofelia Torres, 16, took to social media to spread awareness about her father's detainment.

Ofelia is undergoing treatment for a rare and life-threatening cancer that she says has spread.

""On October 18, 2025, between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., he was detained by ICE at a Home Depot in Niles, Illinois,"" Ofelia said in a video shared to social media. ""My dad, Rubin Torres, has been the main parent who watches my brother while I stayed at the hospital.""

Congresswoman Delia Ramirez, Torres' attorney and other political leaders took a collective stand to call out the immigration enforcement.

They claim Torres Maldonado has been in the United States since 2003.

""He is a great man. He's a taxpayer, he's a wonderful dad, and I need his support. And yesterday, my daughter had a breakdown. She was crying for hours. She wasn't feeling well, and on top of that, she was just telling me how much she misses her dad,"" said Sandibell Hidalgo Herrera, Torres' partner.

The Department of Homeland Security commented on Torres Maldonado's arrest claiming he has a history of driving offenses, including driving without insurance and a valid ID, along with speeding.

Congresswoman Ramirez says Torres Maldonado will be immigration court on Thursday.

Assistant CHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued the following statement:

""On October 18, U.S. Border Patrol conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation that resulted in the arrest of Ruben Torres Maldanado, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico.

""His criminal history shows he has a history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding.

""During his arrest he did not comply with instructions from the officers and attempted to flee in his vehicle and backed into a government vehicle. He will remain in ICE custody pending removal.

""This is nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country.

Over 100 federal agents have been dispatched to the Bay Area.

Those agents are members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been sent to enact President Trump's anti-immigration crackdown.

There are multiple resources for undocumented immigrants to seek legal help, as well as to educate people on their rights if ICE agents show up at their door.

Over 100 federal immigration agents are headed to the Bay Area.

The San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday cited an anonymous source who said over 100 agents were sent to the Coast Guard Base Alameda and will begin arriving Thursday.

KTVU independently confirmed that information with an anonymous congressional source, as well as with U.S. Rep Lateefah Simon.

The City of Alameda released a statement that the Alameda Police Department will not be taking part in the federal government's operations, adding that APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants. The city also advised those who see ICE activity or who ""need assistance"" to call the Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership at 510-241-4011 for rapid response and immigration legal services.

""Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but we urge people to avoid direct interaction with federal law enforcement,"" the city said. ""The City of Alameda is committed to the values of dignity, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of ethnic or national origin, gender, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or immigration status.""

KTVU reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE, CBP, and Gov. Gavin Newsom and is awaiting a response.

The backstory:

President Donald Trump has made clear his intentions to carry out mass deportations and to end birthright citizenship, which has guaranteed that U.S.-born babies are citizens regardless of their parents’ status.

In addition, the Trump administration announced on earlier this year that it would allow federal immigration agencies to make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals, ending a policy that had been in effect since 2011.

Immigrant rights organizations, such as the California Immigrant Policy Center, have put together a resources guide to defend community members ""from threats and attacks"" under the Trump administration.

No matter who is president, everyone living in the United States has certain basic rights under the U.S. Constitution, immigrant rights groups say, and undocumented immigrants have these rights, too.

""Knowing your rights calms fears in some respect,"" said Bill Hing, director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at the University of San Francisco. ""Stay silent. You don't have to open your door for an ICE officer unless that officer has a warrant [signed by a judge.] But honestly, there is a lot of anxiety in the community. And I think that the Trump strategy is to instill fear. And unfortunately, that's happened.""

Hing suggested undocumented people seek the counsel of ""competent, honest"" legal counsel or an immigration consultant to see if there is indeed a pathway to lawful permanent resident status. Some of those lawyers can be found through the National Immigration Legal Services Directory.

What to do if ICE shows up at your door

What you can do:

Here are some tips if ICE shows up at your door:

The right to remain silent – it's OK to refuse to speak to ICE. Immigrant rights advocates say not to answer any questions including where you were born or how you entered the United States.

The National Immigration Law Center advises that people carry a know-your-rights card, also known as a ""red card, or ""tarjetas rojas,"" as well as any valid immigration document, and show them if an immigration officer stops you. Red cards in Spanish can be found at the bottom of this page, or you can order one here. Know-your-rights cards can be printed here.

The center also advises that you not open your door simply because ICE agents tell you to. ICE officials must have a warrant signed by a judge, not a deportation officer, to enter your home. To be valid, a warrant must have your correct name and address on it, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Ask the person at your door to slip the warrant under the door to see who it was signed by. If it was not signed by a judge, the Asian Law Caucus said to tell the officers you do not consent to a search and call your rapid response hotline. (*See numbers below)

Immigrants also have a right to speak to their lawyers, and advocates say not to sign any document before speaking to a lawyer. You can simply say, ""I need to speak to my attorney."" A list of lawyers can be found here.

Immigration advocates advise that parents tell ICE agents that they have children if they're worried about being arrested.

Create a safety plan such as memorizing the phone number of family and friends you can call if you're arrested, figure out who will watch your children if you're detained, and keep important documents, like birth certificates, in a safe place that family and friends can access if necessary. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center put together a step-by-step family preparedness plan.

Make sure your loved ones know how to find you in an ICE detention center by looking online. Be sure they know your alien registration number.

Do not carry documents about your country of origin.

Do not carry fake immigration documents or IDs.

Report and document raids and arrests. One hotline is the United We Dream’s hotline to report a raid: 1-844-363-1423. Or texts can be sent to 877877.

If ICE calls or sends a letter to reschedule a check-in, that can often mean they want to detain you. You can call the Asian Law Caucus at 415-896-1701 for legal advice and updates on whether raids are happening elsewhere.

If you feel your rights have been violated, write down everything you remember, including the officers' badges and patrol cars numbers, which agency the officers work for. Get contact information for witnesses. If you get injured, the ACLU reminds you to take pictures of your injuries and file a written complaint with the agency's internal affairs unit.

In addition, the California Immigrant Policy Center compiled a list of ""rapid response networks,"" which are community-based organizations that respond to emergencies such as immigration enforcement, throughout the state.

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area.","Social media was flooded today with rumors of federal agents being sent to Coast Guard Island in Alameda to prepare for massive immigration sweeps. Then the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a single, unnamed source “familiar with the operation,” that the Trump administration has deployed 100 federal agents, including Customs and Border Protection, to the Coast Guard Base in Alameda.

The New York Times confirmed the story after speaking with three people with direct knowledge of the operation, reporting today that Border Patrol agents are headed to the Bay Area as part of an immigration crackdown.

President Donald Trump’s recent threats to order the National Guard into San Francisco have had the whole region on edge, wondering if the Bay Area is about to experience the kind of chaos and violence that have accompanied similar actions in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and now Chicago and Portland, OR.

The Oaklandside has contacted federal law enforcement agencies, local and state officials, police, members of congress, and others seeking solid information.

Here’s what we’ve learned.

So far, there’s no official confirmation that a major immigration operation is about to unfold in the Bay Area. But this could soon change.

A Coast Guard spokesperson, Petty Officer Graves, told The Oaklandside earlier today that Coast Guard facilities in Alameda are providing support to Customs and Border Protection, and he referred to an “operation” that’s underway. But he would not comment on that operation and said to contact CBP for more information.

“There’s no report I have yet of ICE agents being here,” Graves said about the Coast Guard’s Alameda base.

Shortly after, the SF Standard reported that a Coast Guard spokesperson confirmed the deployment, saying, “Base Alameda is preparing to support CBP agents starting tomorrow as a place of operations.”

An ICE spokesperson declined to answer questions from The Oaklandside about what’s happening, and also referred us to CBP.

A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection acknowledged receiving questions from The Oaklandside but did not respond.

State Senator Jesse Arreguín, who represents Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda, issued a statement earlier today confirming that a major immigration operation will soon begin.

“When similar deployments have occurred in other cities what we’ve seen are overly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that lead to protests and civil unrest. The President and his goons then point to the unrest they themselves created to justify their tactics and even send in the National Guard,” Arreguín said.

Arreguín urged Oakland and Bay Area residents to be cautious and peaceful if they plan to protest the Trump administration’s operation. “This administration has put their playbook on display and are seeking to create chaos in order to justify additional federal deployments. Don’t take the bait.”

The city of Alameda issued a statement clarifying that its police department “is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.”

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee and U.S. Congresswoman Lateefah Simon’s offices did not immediately respond to questions from The Oaklandside seeking more information about the potential federal operation.

Rumors of some kind of large-scale immigration crackdown appears to have been first reported by a Youtuber who goes by “Hawk” on Wednesday. In a video, Hawk claimed to have spoken to someone with “close ties to the Coast Guard,” saying that 1,500 agents would be arriving at the Alameda Coast Guard base on Thursday, Oct. 23. Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area. Those claims do not appear to be true at this time.

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area. The group Bay Resistance is hosting a Zoom training tonight at 6 p.m. where Bay Area residents can get training in rapid response, community safety, and legal observing and learn about a mobilization plan for the day federal agents arrive.

In 2023, MALDEF filed a challenge to STCU’s policy in federal court, claiming it violated federal and state civil rights law.
However, a U.S. District Judge dismissed the federal claim and the case against the credit union.
The dealership later informed Ayala that STCU had refused the loan due to her DACA status.
Founded in 1934, the credit union serves over 274,000 members across 38 locations.","PASCO, Wash.– A Latino civil rights organization is challenging, for a second time, the discriminatory policies of a Spokane, Washington-based credit union for unlawfully denying DACA recipients financial services based on their citizenship or immigration status.

MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) and Edwardo Morfin, of the Kennewick-based Morfin Law Firm, filed a lawsuit in state court against Spokane Teachers Credit Union (STCU) on behalf of Ana Ayala, 28, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The lawsuit argues that the credit union’s policy violates Washington state civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on citizenship or immigration status. In 2023, MALDEF filed a challenge to STCU’s policy in federal court, claiming it violated federal and state civil rights law. However, a U.S. District Judge dismissed the federal claim and the case against the credit union. However, the district court did not rule on the state civil rights law claim. A year later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s decision. This time, attorneys argue that the credit union’s policy violates the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), which bars discrimination based on sex, race, color, citizenship, and immigration status.

“Institutions don’t get a pass for violating anti-discrimination law when they make it so clear that they discriminate that no one actually follows through on applying,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “Clearly discriminatory policies violate the law, full stop; we believe that courts will understand that state law bars discrimination, with no immunity for discrimination so notorious that targets of the discrimination refuse to apply.”

In August 2023, Ayala purchased a used car from a dealership. Some weeks later, the car dealership attempted to sell the loan to STCU. The dealership told Ayala that STCU requested additional information and documentation, including her Social Security number. As a DACA recipient, Ayala is authorized to work in the U.S. and has a work-only Social Security number. The dealership later informed Ayala that STCU had refused the loan due to her DACA status.

Internal communications between the dealer and STCU confirmed that the credit union received Ayala’s social security information but opted to deny the loan nevertheless, requiring proof of permanent residency or citizenship, according to the lawsuit. A letter sent to Ayala by STCU also stated that the reason for denying the loan was “incomplete identity information.” Another credit union purchased Ayala’s loan at a higher interest rate.

“Regardless of where or how the loan originated, STCU discriminated against Ayala when it categorically refused to consider accepting the loan because of her work-only Social Security number,” said Luis Lozada, MALDEF staff attorney. “Allowing this behavior will allow financial institutions to engage in discrimination and avoid liability by arguing that an applicant was never denied credit.”

STCU is a member-owned credit union that serves the state of Washington and North Idaho. Founded in 1934, the credit union serves over 274,000 members across 38 locations.

The lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Washington in Franklin County and seeks class certification.

“Just because this doesn’t seem to be a big deal to STCU, it’s a huge deal for people like me,” said Ayala. “I am here doing everything I can to make sure I’m perfect in the eyes of the law, and I still get discriminated against. I’m human and should be treated equally as everyone else. This is bigger than me not being approved for a car loan; this is about not discriminating against anyone, no matter your status. I hope STCU can find it in themselves to give people like me a chance, especially when we try our hardest to be perfect for this society.”

This is the 24th lawsuit filed by MALDEF since 2017 that challenges the policies of financial institutions that discriminate against DACA recipients.",https://www.maldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-MALDEF_Mark_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-22 18:02:01.715578

At a hearing on that request, Cobb asked if the case would be moot if there was a government lapse.
The lawsuit, filed in July, argued that the federal government had illegally denied members of Congress entry to ICE detention facilities after a flurry of high-profile clashes and denials of entry.
Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said ICE officials denied him entry Oct. 13 to do oversight of the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., just days after a video showed a violent detention of a 15-year-old constituent.
“Once again, the Trump Administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability,” Krishnamoorthi said in a news release.","The Trump administration has claimed the partial government shutdown also means the end of a requirement that Immigration and Customs Enforcement give congressional access to detention facilities for oversight visits.

The government made the argument in a legal clash with Democratic lawmakers, who had filed a lawsuit against ICE over access to real-time inspections of the facilities and new department guidance that requires at least seven days’ advance notice of a visit.

The lawmakers based that lawsuit on Section 527, a provision included in the fiscal 2024 spending law and applied to funding in the continuing resolution for fiscal 2025, which states that no funds can be used to prevent members or their staffs from entering immigration detention facilities for oversight.

But now the Trump administration says the provision expired on Oct. 1 along with the spending law, and ongoing spending is “not subject to the expired general provision known as Section 527,” according to a notice and declaration from ICE official Ralph Ferguson.

“With the expiration of the FY2025 Continuing Resolution, ICE is no longer using for detention operations (including the adoption and implementation of the Congressional visitation protocols at issue in this action) any funds that were appropriated subject to Section 527,” Ferguson states in the declaration.

The government’s stance that the section has expired, if applied more broadly, could extend to some of the dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of provisions in spending bills that define how the federal government can use funds, commonly known as “riders.”

The same appropriations law includes provisions such as how DHS can lease or renovate buildings, how money can be moved between accounts, and prohibiting alterations on the oath of citizenship and the spending of government funds on pornography.

The government filed the notice in the lawsuit as Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was deciding whether to grant a request for her to temporarily halt the new DHS guidance on lawmaker visits based on Section 527. At a hearing on that request, Cobb asked if the case would be moot if there was a government lapse.

Ferguson, in his declaration, said that while ICE is incurring obligations for detention in advance of a fiscal 2026 spending bill that reopens the government, that is not subject to the expired Section 527.

And he said certain ICE operations are being funding through money in the reconciliation package, “a distinct source of funding with defined amounts for specific purposes.”

The package signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 included $45 billion to ICE for expansion of detention capacity, which some critics said did not have adequate checks on how DHS used the funds.

While the Trump administration has made several moves during the shutdown that raised questions — such as diverted military appropriations to ensure paychecks for the troops went out on time — this appears to be the first time it has argued spending bill provisions are not in force during a shutdown.

David A. Super, a Georgetown Law professor who focuses on administrative and constitutional law, called the Trump administration’s argument “remarkably aggressive” and said it would mean “appropriations riders will cease to have a great deal of meaning in many important settings.”

Super said that normally the restriction would keep ICE from using any funds — or anything bought with those funds — from blocking congressional access.

It is “fairly unlikely” that denying entry to members of Congress would not use restricted funds, “because excluding someone requires you to use a computer that may have been bought with those funds, or put up a barrier that was bought with those funds, or threaten to arrest someone with a bullhorn that was bought with those funds,” Super said.

Super also said that in prior government shutdowns, the government has operated to largely keep the status quo, rather than assert broad new authority.

In response to the government filing, Cobb ordered both sides to file a report by Oct. 27 on the issue, giving a chance for the lawmakers to respond, as well as asking whether the legal challenge should be paused during the shutdown.

The lawsuit, filed in July, argued that the federal government had illegally denied members of Congress entry to ICE detention facilities after a flurry of high-profile clashes and denials of entry.

That included federal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., accusing her of interfering with federal law enforcement officers, for which she has denied wrongdoing.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said ICE officials denied him entry Oct. 13 to do oversight of the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., just days after a video showed a violent detention of a 15-year-old constituent.

Bay Area Advocates Head To Court To Halt Trump Administration’s Immigration Policies

In a series of recent class action lawsuits, Bay Area civil rights advocates are calling on the federal courts to halt what they call illegal Trump administration policies that are leading to the arrest of asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking and people attending immigration court hearings.

The three lawsuits filed in federal courts in California in recent weeks are part of a larger legal pushback by advocacy groups across the country challenging the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

At a time when Homeland Security officials tout arrests of “heinous” criminals they call the “worst of the worst,” the lawsuits put the focus on the ways U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted vulnerable people such as domestic violence survivors and those who’ve fled persecution, said UC Davis Law Professor Kevin Johnson. “These are serious constitutional and statutory claims … challenging the efforts of the Trump administration to tighten the immigration enforcement machinery around non-citizens,” he said.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data.
“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said.
As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks.
Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.","WASHINGTON — Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed new recruits into its training program before they have completed the agency’s vetting process, an unusual sequence of events as the agency rushes to hire federal immigration officers to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy, one current and two former Homeland Security Department officials told NBC News.

ICE officials only later discovered that some of these recruits failed drug testing, have disqualifying criminal backgrounds or don’t meet the physical or academic requirements to serve, the sources said.

Staff at ICE’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, recently discovered one recruit had previously been charged with strong arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, the current DHS official said. They’ve also found as recently as this month that some recruits going through the six-week training course had not submitted fingerprints for background checks, as ICE’s hiring process requires, the current and former DHS officials said.

Per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass a drug test and undergo a security vetting through ICE’s human resources office prior to showing up for the training course. The former officials said that process was more strictly adhered to before a hiring surge that began this summer. That process was meant to weed out disqualified candidates before they would be sent to training.

Since the surge began, the agency has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while in training for falling short of its hiring requirements, according to recently collected internal ICE data reviewed by NBC News.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data. Just under 10 recruits were dismissed for criminal charges, failing to pass drug tests or safety concerns that should have been flagged in a background check prior to arriving at training, the data indicated and the current and former DHS officials confirmed.

The officials said there is growing concern that in the Trump administration’s race to expand the number of ICE agents to 10,000 by the end of the year, the agency could miss red flags in the backgrounds of some new recruits and inadvertently hire them.

“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said. The official said many of the issues that have been flagged during training only surface because the recruits admitted they did not submit to fingerprinting or drug testing prior to arriving.

“What about the ones who don’t admit it?” the official said.

In a statement to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security said most of its new recruits are former law enforcement officers and former ICE officers who go through a different process.

“The figures you reference are not accurate and reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes,” said DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy. This population is expected to account for greater than 85% of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Atlantic reported this week on the struggle some ICE recruits have had with meeting the agency's physical fitness requirements. The broader scope of issues and specific data have not been previously reported.

ICE has been under pressure from the White House to increase hiring with the funding designated by Congress in the sweeping tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law on July 4. The agency has frequently lagged behind the White House’s arrest goal of 3,000 per day, which they have attributed to a lack of manpower.

As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks. The training was later shortened to six weeks, the DHS official said.

Recruits also are supposed to attest that they can pass ICE’s physical fitness test, which includes sit-ups, pull-ups, and running one-and-a-half miles in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

Darius Reeves, who recently left his position as ICE field office director in Baltimore, said he believes the agency’s Aug. 6 decision to waive age limits so that older people can join has led to more recruits failing the physical test.

“These new recruits are dropping like flies,” Reeves said in an interview after speaking with colleagues seeking to bring new hires into the agency. “And rightly so, it makes sense. We’re going to drop the age requirements, of course this was going to happen.”

Nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at FLETC over the past three months were later sent home because they could not pass the written exam, according to the data. The academic requirement includes an exam where officers are allowed to consult their textbooks and notes at the end of a legal course on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment, which outlines when officers can and cannot conduct searches and seizures.

A slightly smaller group was dismissed because they failed the physical fitness test or had medical challenges, though some of those sent home had made clear on their application that they could not meet ICE’s physical requirements but were sent to training anyway, the current and former DHS officials said.

Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.

The three sources said the agency’s human resources office is overwhelmed with more than 150,000 new applicants that have applied since ICE began offering $50,000 signing bonuses in August. The HR office is rushing to clear new recruits, which they believe is leading to mistakes.

“They are trying to push everyone through, and the vetting process is not what it should be,” said one of the former DHS officials with knowledge of the agency’s hiring.

The current DHS official likened the pressure on ICE’s human resources employees to clear recruits to “asking them to pull a rabbit out of a hat.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251021-ice-recruit-ch-1629-fb41af.jpg",N,,2025-10-22 17:17:12.481530

Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).","The Trump administration aspires to deport a million people in its first year of office. The president has also spoken of the more ambitious goal of deporting 15-20 million undocumented people overall, even if that category probably covers only 14 million folks. The discrepancy of a couple million people shouldn’t bother Trump. He’s happy to deport those with green cards, H-1B visas, and even American citizens.

Deporting a million people in a year is a heavy lift. The previous record, 409,849 people, was during the Obama administration, as part of the 1.5 million deportations he conducted in his first term. Trump, no doubt, wants to best Obama in this category, since he’s determined to outshine the former president in every respect, even the dubious ones.

Despite all the high-profile seizures by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the deals to dump Venezuelans to Salvadoran prisons, and the truly crazy efforts to send people to countries they’ve never even visited like Eswatini and South Sudan, the Trump administration has managed to deport only about 350,000 people through the end of August. That includes the 200,000 by ICE and the rest by Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard, plus some self-deportations. Another 60,000 are languishing in ICE detention centers. The government is currently monitoring about 180,000 families and individuals in its Alternatives to Detention program, which may end up becoming a Preparation for Deportation program.

Most of the people currently in detention—over 70 percent—have never committed any crime, which undermines the claim by the Trump administration that he’s going after the “bad hombres.”

Detention is pretty much a fast track to deportation. After all, detainees often don’t have access to lawyers. As The American Prospect reports, “ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.” One immigration lawyer told me that some of his clients have disappeared for several days in ICE detention—and these included people who were willing to self-deport.

Trump is not close to meeting his ambitious deportation goals. That’s no comfort to all the immigrants whose lives he has already upended.

ICE Is Not Nice

The scenes involving the round-up of refugees and migrants have been harrowing. Consider this description:

Buses backed up to apartment buildings and were filled with screaming, crying people. Hospital beds were emptied. A cancer patient operated on the previous day was carried away. One woman gave birth while police waited to haul off mother and baby. Younger children were permitted to be left behind, and many parents desperately accepted that choice in the hope that neighbors or orphanages would take them in.

Oh, I’m sorry, I got mixed up. That’s a description of the French police rounding up 13,000 Jewish refugees in 1942 at the behest of their Nazi overseers, as reported by David Wyman in his seminal book, The Abandonment of the Jews.

Here, by comparison, are three snapshots of recent ICE actions:

In Louisiana and Florida:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have in recent days deported the Cuban-born mother of a 1-year-old girl — separating them indefinitely — and three children ages 2, 4 and 7 who are U.S. citizens along with their Honduran-born mothers, their lawyers said Saturday.

In Chicago:

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them. Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

In New York:

On the morning of September 4, dozens of masked federal agents raided a snack bar factory in the small town of Cato, New York. They claimed there was a “violent felon” in the plant, but proceeded to siphon off and hold anyone who looked Latinx. At least 69 workers were initially detained, with 57 still in custody or deported, though some say that could be an undercount. There are multiple reports of aggression — knees on necks, blows to heads — used during the raid.

This is happening not just to the undocumented and those on the rock-strewn path to citizenship. Quite a few American citizens have also been caught up in the ICE dragnet. At least 170 have been detained, according to ProPublica:

Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched. About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Much of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy can be understood only by examining them through the lens of his obsession with deporting people and restricting immigration from non-white parts of the world. The question remains: how many laws will the Trump administration break and how many crimes will it commit in this effort to make America predominantly white again?

German citizens failed to stop the Nazis. Will Americans stand up and be counted?

Trump’s Immigration-Obsessed Foreign Policy

In exchange for a payment of about $5 million, the tiny country of Eswatini in southern Africa has agreed to receive up to 160 deportees from a variety of countries. Human rights groups in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, have challenged the arrangement in court. A U.S. District Court judge also blocked the removal of deportees to third countries back in April, but the Supreme Court lifted that ban in June.

The $5 million is only part of the sweetheart deal. In August, the Trump administration waived all tariffs on Eswatini goods entering the United States—in contrast to the 30 percent rate that South Africa will be paying. A number of countries hoping for tariff reductions or similarly favorable treatment from the Trump administration— Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kosovo, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan—have also accepted the transport of deportees.

Eswatini does have its limits. It refused to accept Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national that the Trump administration sent to a prison in El Salvador. Garcia was freed and sent back to the States, only to be arrested again by the U.S. government and charged with human trafficking. Afraid that Garcia will be released by court order, the Trump administration is scrambling to find some country that will take him. Garcia is living proof of the administration’s lies—contrary to what Trump has said, he is not a gang member or a human trafficker. No wonder Trump wants him out of the country.

El Salvador has been an enthusiastic backer of Trump’s deportation plans. The country received $5 million to house deportees like Garcia in its horrific prisons. In addition, the State Department recently gave the country its highest safety rating, ahead of France and Spain. Trump has also backed Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s bid to become the country’s leader for life. Finally, the country faces a mere 10 percent tariff on its goods, Trump’s lowest tier.

In one of the least savory parts of the arrangement with El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cut a deal with Bukele to return several members of the MS-13 gang who were cooperating with U.S. authorities. Bukele wanted them back because they had information about members of his administration who had cut their own deals with the country’s various gangs. It’s best to keep your enemies close, as the expression goes, particularly if you can put them in a dangerous high-security prison.

The immigration issue also affects relations with Venezuela, where the Trump administration has used the threat of Tren de Aragua, and the alleged inroads the gang has made in U.S. society, to step up its efforts to topple the government of Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has attempted to tilt immigration policy in favor of English speakers and white people more generally, even as the overall quotas for immigrants are radically reduced from 125,000 per year to 7,500. Among the proposals considered by the administration is one that would give preference to such groups as Europeans who support the radical right and white Afrikaners from South Africa. The overall purpose is a reduction in American diversity because, as one of the internal proposals argues, “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity.”

The administration has also radically increased the fee for a work permit—the H-1B visa—to $100,000. Although there are some exemptions to the new fee, it is clearly designed to restrict entrance to the United States to the wealthy.

Taken together, Trump has treated the “shithole” companies he identified in his first term—the poorer countries of the Global South—as dumping grounds for undesirable elements. And he has put a sign on America’s front door that reads: Wealthy, Christian, Right-Wing Whites Only.

Barack Obama wanted to create an administration that looked like America. Donald Trump wants to create an America that looks like his administration.

How Deportations Shape Domestic Policy

Trump knows a hot-button issue when he touches one, and immigration remains a great way to defeat Democrats who, however anti-immigration some of them have become, will never stoop to the race-baiting lows that Trump uses to wow his supporters. The invading “army” of migrants approaching the Mexico border, the fictitious pet-eaters of Springfield, OH, the “murderers” and “rapists” from points south responsible for all the crime in America: these mendacious memes propelled Trump to victory in 2024.

His immigration policies are no surprise: they were all laid out in detail in Project 2025: stopping refugee resettlement; ending Temporary Protect Status for Haitians, Venezuelans, and others; ending visas for foreign students. Trump has gone further. Even Project 2025 didn’t propose revoking birthright citizenship and ignoring the constitution.

Trump has put ICE raids at the center of his approach, but there has been pushback from Democratic-controlled cities and states. So, the president is sending in the National Guard to ensure greater access and mobility for ICE agents. The use of the U.S. military for domestic operations is unprecedented, of course, and several judges have ruled the president’s actions unconstitutional. Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress “rebellion,” which would allow him to use the military to impose civilian law (his government’s laws). It’s not quite martial law—which is the imposition of military laws on civilians—but it certainly aims in that direction (and the two may well be conflated in Trump’s mind).

ICE, meanwhile, has received a huge surge in funding—$170 billion in new money—at a time of cutbacks in virtually all non-military parts of the federal government. If ICE and associated agencies constituted a military, it would be the thirteenth largest one in the world, as Sarah Lazare and Lindsay Koshgarian point out. The militarization of the United States, at the expense of social welfare, is now directed not just at China or securing access to critical raw materials: it is directed at the U.S. population.

Trump is attacking diversity more generally, as the changes in federal immigration policy suggest. Because birthright citizenship has changed the demographics of the United States, its repeal has been a priority for white nationalists, and they have also cheered Trump’s moves in this direction. Meanwhile, the president is going after diversity in federal institutions, federal grantmaking, and across the U.S. educational system.

At the moment, lawyers and judges are the thin line that holds back the lawlessness of the Trump administration. A few civic groups like the Immigration Defense Project and Freedom for Immigrants are fighting the administration. But it will require a lot more public outcry to defend America’s disappeared and preserve diversity in this country.

As Bad as Nazis?

The Nazis were also obsessed with the diversity of German society in the 1930s. They ultimately decided not just to stigmatize and imprison Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and others. The Nazis killed them in huge numbers.

Trump and his white nationalist allies are currently at the stigmatize and deport stage. They’re content for the moment to let the killing take place elsewhere. The administration is not only erecting higher walls against refugees and immigrants—leading to more deaths among the desperate overseas—it is sending those who thought they’d already made it to safety to warzones (South Sudan), certain imprisonment (Afghanistan, Russia), and failed states (Haiti).

The U.S. business community is heavily reliant on immigrant labor, much of it undocumented, in agriculture, construction, and the food industry. But it has failed to stand up for its immigrant workforce. The international community is busy making deals with Trump, not censuring him. Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).

At a time when countries around the world are shrinking in population, the United States has remained strong because of all the people who have come here from abroad to work, to contribute to the tax base and Social Security, and, yes, to have babies. So, who will combine the necessary moral and practical arguments to convince the mass of Americans that the very survival of this country depends on immigrants?",https://fpif.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2640469337.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 17:00:39.560534

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.
Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees.
“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week.
But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted.","Customs and Border Protection border patrol agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers, Secret Service Special Agents, and Transportation Security Administration air marshals will continue to be paid during the ongoing shutdown, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to Fortune. Their pay is covered under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE an extra $75 billion in funding.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.

Not all essential workers have been so fortunate. Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees. Many are working 60 hours, six days a week, and some are taking on second “gig jobs,” such as serving at restaurants or driving for Uber or DoorDash, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week. “No one takes IOUs, and the air traffic controllers are having to feel that pressure as well.”

The decisions of who gets paid and who doesn’t during government shutdowns depends on department personnel sorting employees into respective groups of essential and non-essential, as well as appropriations for salaries that may or may not be impacted by the lapsed Congressional budget.

But this employee selection process is completely arbitrary and subjective, highlighting a failure of government shutdowns, which are ultimately more expensive than keeping the government operating, according to Linda Bilmes, a public finance expert and senior lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco estimated for each week the government is shut down, it would translate to a $7 billion economic hit and a 0.1% reduction in U.S. GDP growth, a result, in part, of delayed procurement of goods and a drag on demand.

“There is this overarching dysfunction of the entire process,” Bilmes told Fortune. “Every time you get into one of these situations—which has been on average four times a year for the last four to five years—there is an arbitrariness in who ends up being paid for their work, who ends up working, who ends up being furloughed.”

“The arbitrariness is almost inherent in this dysfunction—a feature as well as being a bug,” she added.

A ‘dysfunctional’ system

There have been 20 government “funding gaps” in the last 50 years, following a 1974 Congressional budget reform law in response to former President Richard Nixon’s impoundment attempts on funds Congress had already allocated. While the president had significant control over the budget for the better part of the 20th century, the 1974 reform put more power in Congress’ hands.

As a result of a series of fiscal and appropriations committees overseeing government budgets, the process of allocating and approving funds is convoluted, Bilmes said. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has a two-year budget, meaning their funding does not lapse when Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. The Patent and Trademark Office, conversely, is not funded through Congressionally appropriated money, but rather through patent fees, and likewise do not have employee pay impacted by the shutdown.

But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted. Government contractors are typically furloughed, but unlike many other federal workers, they are not guaranteed—and in many cases, not paid—backpay. These contractors are aware of a potential disruption in income because of the frequency of shutdowns and, as a result, pad their contracts.

Bilmes posited that in order to resolve the arbitrary payment disparities during shutdowns, there should be automatic resolutions, creating an automatic extension of the previous budget. This, however, would not be ideal because it could make less urgent conversations about planning, strategy, and addressing long-term problems that accompany new budget discussions, she said. An alternative would be to have the whole government run on a two-year budget to avoid the quarterly stop-and-go that has become the current precedent.

Otherwise, the process does not serve the American public, Bilmes conceded.

“In my view,” she said, “it’s like spending money on shooting ourselves in the foot and deciding which foot we want to shoot first.”",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2242203642-e1761154381846.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-10-22 17:17:16.189624

In a case before a federal judge in San José, Bay Area legal groups are seeking to block ICE from rearresting immigrants who had previously been granted conditional release, typically after border agents had determined they were not dangerous and not a flight risk, meaning they were expected to show up for their proceedings in immigration court.

Advocates say ICE has arrested and detained more than 100 immigrants in recent months as they attended mandatory court hearings and ICE supervision check-ins in Northern and Central California, even though they were abiding by the terms of their release and their circumstances had not changed.

Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, one of the groups filing the suit, said until things shifted abruptly in May, such rearrests were unheard of for ICE’s San Francisco field office.

“ICE’s new policy allows them to make arrests and throw people back into detention without any justification,” she said. “[It] has disrupted people’s lives, it’s torn families apart, and it’s fundamentally unfair and unreasoned.”

ICE officials did not respond to KQED’s request for comment, but the agency typically does not comment on pending litigation.

One of those arrested was Gabriela Vargas Plasencia, who was an engineering student in Peru before she fled death threats and came to the U.S. last year seeking asylum, according to her declaration to the court. She said she and her boyfriend were detained at the border, then released with instructions on attending immigration hearings.

They settled in Oakland, submitted their asylum applications and enrolled in English classes. Once she was granted a work permit, Vargas Plasencia said she found two jobs, at Target and FedEx, working 50 hours a week.

But at court on Sep. 4, she said, a government attorney asked the immigration judge to dismiss their cases. When the couple left the courtroom, Vargas Plasencia said agents in plain clothes grabbed them, took them to the basement and shackled them – all with no explanation. Hours later, they were driven to Bakersfield and locked up at the Mesa Verde Immigration Detention Center.

After lawyers intervened, a federal judge ordered Vargas Plasencia’s release. But in the meantime, she said, her car was towed and she was reprimanded for missing work. Her partner is still in custody. And she said she still has flashbacks to what she called “one of the most difficult and painful experiences I have ever endured.”

“Each time I have to check in with ICE, I feel anxiety and panic all over again,” Vargas Plasencia said in her declaration. “I have never committed any crime, in the United States or anywhere else. I only wish to continue my asylum case peacefully and to build a safe, stable life here; and for my partner to be released soon, as well.”

Bernwanger, the ACLU attorney, says rearresting people who are complying with the conditions of their release is an arbitrary exercise of power that violates the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable seizure.

“We should all be concerned,” she said. “Are we comfortable with a system in which people can just be grabbed off of the street and thrown into detention?”

Can ICE arrest immigrants at immigration courthouses?

While the lawsuit involving Vargas Plasencia centers on the question of why ICE can arrest someone, another recent case deals with the question of where those arrests can take place.

That lawsuit, filed last month by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, along with the ACLU and others, takes on Trump administration policies instructing ICE and the immigration courts that arresting people at courthouses, formerly off limits, is now acceptable.

Immigrant advocates say detaining people who are following the rules, and may, like Vargas Plasencia, have pending claims to asylum or other relief, will have a “chilling effect,” keeping them away from hearings and denying them access to justice. The administration has denied there’s any evidence for that.

“Conducting these arrests at courthouses, and conducting arrests of people without a justification when you’ve already released them, both of those policies are unlawful for different reasons,” said Bernwanger. “We are seeing ICE use them in coordination to absolutely terrorize people in our community who are just trying to do what the immigration system asks of them.”

The same judge, P. Casey Pitts, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, will hear both Bay Area cases. Pitts has set hearings in both cases for Dec. 9.

Can ICE arrest survivors of trafficking and domestic violence?

Meanwhile, a class action case filed in federal court in Los Angeles last week blasts ICE for arresting, and even deporting, immigrants applying for legal visas as survivors of human trafficking, domestic violence or other serious crimes.

Karen Hernandez is with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which is representing the immigrants. She said, under the Violence Against Women Act and other laws, these immigrants have permission to be in the U.S while their visas are pending.

“These are folks who have been granted legal protection by Congress,” she said. “The government is basically violating those legal protections.”

One of the named plaintiffs in the case, identified as Camila B., has lived in Los Angeles for more than two decades. In 2021, she was attacked at a bus stop and beaten unconscious, according to the complaint. She cooperated with police, helping them to arrest her attacker, and applied for a U Visa, which offers legal status to undocumented immigrants who’ve suffered serious crimes and assist law enforcement.

Because of the long backlog for applications, the government granted Camila, 46, temporary protection from deportation to her native Mexico while she awaited her visa. But on July 1, as part of ICE’s immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, officers surrounded her tamale stand and arrested her. She was held in detention until July 30, when a judge ordered her released on bond.

Many of the affected immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. But, beginning with the 1994 passage of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress repeatedly expanded protections for immigrant survivors of crime, encouraging them to seek safety and cooperate with law enforcement. Among the protections are special visas for victims of trafficking and other serious crimes that eventually lead to a green card. Congress also provided work authorization, and for years, immigration authorities had policies not to deport people who were in the process of applying for the visas.

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s reversal flies in the face of a federal law against “arbitrary and capricious” policy changes, and says the detentions violate people’s constitutionally guaranteed due process rights.

ICE and Homeland Security officials did not respond to KQED’s requests for comment about the case, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin has told other news outlets that every immigrant deported by ICE “has had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

Hernandez, with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said defending laws like the Violence Against Women Act is very personal to her. She said she was a 3-year-old when her own family moved to the U.S. from Mexico. But her childhood was marked by domestic violence, and it took years for her mother to get free.

“I grew up with a father who was very violent towards my mom,” she said. “And I remember talking to her about this lawsuit as we were working on it. And she just said, ‘If this would have been around when you and I were being harmed by your father, this would’ve protected us.’”

The extent to which the Trump administration is pushing the legal limits on immigration means more lawsuits can be expected, according to Johnson, the UC Davis law professor.

“This administration is just so dogged in its immigration enforcement efforts, we see something new and different almost every day,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary time. The human misery is off the charts.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/031523-ICE-Arrest-AP-CM-01-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:17:08.967404

On Wednesday, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News that New York City will see an ""increase in ICE arrests"" because there are ""so many criminal illegal"" immigrants.

""You will see us making those criminal arrests to make New York safe again. It's definitely intelligence driven, it's not random,"" Lyons said. ""We aren't pulling people off the street. There was a specific reason based on criminal intelligence and criminal activity that we showed up on Canal Street,""

On Canal Street Wednesday morning, there was an unusual sense of peace and tranquility on what is usually a hub of illegal commerce.

Empty sidewalks were free of the illegal street vendors hawking fake designer label purses and luxury watches.

If that was the mission of federal agents Tuesday afternoon, to clear the scene of vendors who often hail from West Africa, mission accomplished.

It was a chaotic scene in Chinatown on Tuesday when a swarm of masked immigration officers, ATF and Homeland Security agents, and other federal law enforcement all pushed, pulled, and detained the vendors who are a fixture on the sidewalks of Canal Street.

The show of force quickly generated a rather vocal response from ICE protesters who immediately started recording video and taking pictures of agents at work. Pushing and shoving soon followed.

In a statement, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the agents, ""Conducted a targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City focused on criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods.""

Jason Jackson, an elevator repairman who works in the area, said he wouldn't be surprised if social media videos taken by ICE supporters led federal agents to target this part of Manhattan.

""I definitely think that is how it went. Because this has been going on for a long time and just out of nowhere, they want to crack down on it,"" Jackson said.

Mayor Eric Adams, in an effort to distant himself and the city from what happened said in a statement in part that ""New Yorkers should know we have no involvement.""

Following the surprise crackdown, New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a portal for members of the public to submit photos and videos of ICE enforcement actions.

In a statement, James vowed to review the materials to determine if any laws were violated, including ""unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

""Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,"" James said. ""If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law. No one should be subject to unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

The state of Oregon is asking a federal judge to dismiss a Marion County lawsuit over immigration records, saying state law is clear that the county can’t share information about men on parole for local crimes with federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in Eugene U.S. District Court to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit.

The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law.

The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

In a statement Tuesday, Marion County disputed Rayfield’s argument that there is no conflict between state and federal laws.

“The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed,” Elzinga said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties.

In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dan-Rayfield-9_12_25-8-of-16-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:17:10.011543

LOS ANGELES — Federal officers shot a man in the elbow after he rammed his car into law enforcement vehicles while trying to evade arrest Tuesday morning in Los Angeles, authorities said.

A deputy U.S. Marshal assisting with the arrest was hit in the hand with a ricochet bullet, authorities said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fired defensive shots as the man rammed into their vehicles, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli identified the man as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, from Mexico and said he was charged with assault on a federal officer. Parias is due in court Wednesday, Essayli said in a statement. He is living in the country illegally, Essayli said.

Essayli said officers had an administrative immigration arrest warrant for Parias, who had “avoided capture before.” McLaughlin earlier said he had “previously escaped from custody.” It wasn’t immediately clear if he had previously been arrested.

Parias runs a TikTok account under the name Richard Noticias LA where he posts as a citizen journalist, including sharing videos and information about immigration enforcement activities.

During the traffic stop Tuesday, authorities boxed Parias in with their vehicles as they tried to arrest him, Essayli said. Parias then rammed into the vehicles in front of and behind him. An agent attempted to break the driver’s side window of the car, but that did not subdue Parias, Essayli said.

As Parias spun the tires, the back of the car began to fishtail, eventually prompting an agent to open fire, Essayli said.

“Vehicles are deadly weapons. Anyone who uses them against federal agents risks arrest, imprisonment, and life-threatening injuries,” Essayli wrote.

U.S. Marshals Service office spokesperson Tlaloc Olvera confirmed one of their officers sustained a non-life-threatening injury and was in stable condition.

“These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest,” McLaughlin said.

Los Angeles police said they were providing traffic control and were not involved directly in the federal operation.

Last month, an ICE officer fatally shot a suspect during an operation after the man drove his car at officers and dragged one of them.

ICE tracks attacks against its officers and has blamed activists for an increase in attacks, saying their rhetoric encourages people the agency is pursuing to resist arrest.

According to data provided by the agency, there were 172 reported assaults between Jan. 21 and Oct. 1 of this year. That’s compared to 15 reported assaults during the same period last year.

We’re talking about the government shutdown, of course. How did we get here, and what does it mean for the justice system? FindLaw breaks it down.

Shut Down for What?!

The short end of it is this: the current shutdown is the product of a protracted standoff between congressional Democrats and Republicans, which reached a breaking point at the end of last month.

The immediate cause was the failure to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Senate Democrats refused to advance a Republican-backed bill that would have eliminated Obamacare subsidies, resulting in a lapse in appropriations and triggering a government-wide shutdown on October 1. Executive branch agencies began furloughing workers and suspending services immediately.

The federal judiciary was able to maintain paid operations for several weeks by relying on reserve funds, court fees, and leftover balances from previous years. However, these stopgap measures were always temporary, and by October 17, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts announced that funding would be exhausted by Monday, October 20.

Judiciary Hits the Wall

The shutdown isn’t breaking news, so why is it newsworthy now? Well, for the first few weeks of the month, the federal judiciary was mostly spared the fate of other government branches thanks to legal fees. The fees are collected from litigants and defendants who use the courts. They help to pay court costs, but they only cover part of the courts’ expenses (the remainder comes from government appropriations). And they can only go so far.

After 20 days of shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees have been furloughed nationally, with another 33,000 federal court staff either performing limited tasks unpaid or placed on furlough. The impasse, driven by heated disagreement over medical care subsidies, has resulted in daily economic losses estimated by some economists at $15 billion. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reinforced on Friday that, “until the ongoing lapse in government funding is resolved, federal courts will maintain limited operations necessary to perform the judiciary’s constitutional functions.”

As the shutdown drags on, its effects on courts across the country are becoming increasingly severe. Federal courts (including appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts) are now forced to curtail non-essential functions and begin furloughing staff – for the first time since the mid-90s. That’s not great news on its own, but there’s an even bigger problem when you consider the governing law of the country.

Under the U.S. Constitution, judges of courts established under Article III (such as the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals, and District Courts) are guaranteed life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished while in office. This ensures judicial independence and continuity even when the government faces funding shortfalls. Therefore, judges must continue fulfilling their constitutional duties (hearing cases, issuing rulings, and maintaining essential judicial proceedings) regardless of whether Congress has passed a funding bill.

But there’s also another snag: the Anti-Deficiency Act. This law prohibits federal agencies and employees from obligating or spending government funds without congressional appropriations. It allows only narrowly defined ""excepted activities"" to continue during a shutdown.

So, how is Uncle Sam planning on reconciling these seemingly opposing laws?

Courts in Survival Mode

Put simply, the judiciary limped along as long as it could by relying on court fees — money paid by litigants to file cases, access court records, and so on — but those funds are only a stopgap. Once exhausted, the courts face the same constraints as the rest of government and have to sharply limit their operations to what’s required by the Constitution and core legal mandates. Against the backdrop of mounting partisan finger-pointing in Washington, this situation is exposing both structural vulnerabilities and the real-world consequences of a budget impasse on the justice system.

It looks like judges will continue to serve as required by the Constitution, but most court employees will only be permitted to perform ""excepted activities"" under the Anti-Deficiency Act. In the judiciary’s case, “excepted activities” include functions required by the Constitution (adjudicating cases and issuing judicial orders), but also work necessary for the “safety of human life or the protection of property,” and “activities otherwise authorized by law.”

That’s not very clear, is it? Here are examples of the kinds of activities that fall into these exceptions and will therefore remain ongoing: security operations; emergency detention hearings; maintaining critical infrastructure like electronic filing systems; essential criminal proceedings or urgent court filings that cannot be postponed without violating rights.

In short, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the broader judiciary shifts into “survival mode,” sustaining only the most crucial operations under strict legal limits. Most court employees (clerks, administrative staff, researchers, probation officers, and others) cannot work during a shutdown unless their tasks fall into one of those excepted categories. Those who do continue working must do so without pay until Congress restores funding. All other staff are being placed on furlough.

A ‘Funding Crisis’

Senate Judiciary Committee leaders warn that lapses in funding could soon mean “justice delayed—or even justice denied.” The shutdown's impact extends beyond just court staff: federal public defenders, who represent indigent criminal defendants, will not be paid during this period, nor will private lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act.

In fact, payments for private lawyers have already been delayed since July due to earlier budget shortfalls—a situation the judiciary has deemed a ""funding crisis."" Probation officers, judicial clerks, and administrative staff still working are set to receive their last paychecks on October 24 if appropriations do not resume.

The Justice Department has argued in filings that it cannot keep up with hundreds of lawsuits with reduced staff and resources. While that very well may be true, note that only about 11 percent of its workforce has been furloughed, compared with over 80 percent at agencies like Commerce.

Every Court for Itself?

Each individual court is responsible for determining how it will operate during this funding lapse. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a patchwork of responses nationwide.

Some courts have pledged to keep scheduled trials and grand jury sessions running for as long as possible using remaining funds. For example, Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall of the Northern District of Illinois warned that delays in timely justice are inevitable but assured that enough funding remains for now to continue critical proceedings. At the Supreme Court, the justices plan to keep hearing cases and issuing rulings while the building remains closed to the public. On Monday, the Court announced they will review a high-profile gun law case but that might just be because the Trump Administration urged them to take it up.

Despite all the operational constraints, litigation against the Trump administration continues apace. Judges overseeing lawsuits challenging administration policies have repeatedly denied government requests to suspend cases due to lack of resources. Some deadlines have, of course, been extended, and less urgent matters have been put on hold. But still, many high-profile cases (including those related to immigration enforcement and deployment of federal forces) are proceeding with only minimal interruption.

Trials and Tribulations Ahead

Looking ahead, lawyers and litigants should brace for significant uncertainty and delays. President Trump and House Republicans show no signs of conceding, blaming Democrats for obstructing federal courts and critical services.

With individual courts making their own operational decisions based on available staffing and resources, parties may find scheduled hearings postponed or rescheduled at short notice. Civil litigation involving federal agencies is particularly affected due to widespread furloughs among agency employees who serve as witnesses or provide necessary documentation.

Ultimately, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the judiciary is now fulfilling only its core functions and under strict legal restraints.

Former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge at Fort Snelling Ryan Wood said losing another immigration judge will push the limits of an already strained system.
“Those metrics have turned to immigration enforcement.” Fort Snelling currently has six immigration judges.","The Executive Office for Immigration Review fired Fort Snelling immigration judge Amy Zaske last month, immigration court sources confirmed to the Minnesota Daily.

In April, the court held the deportation trial of University of Minnesota international graduate student Doğukan Gunaydin, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for over a month.

Zaske’s firing comes during a time of nationwide dismissals of immigration judges by EOIR, which cites the executive branch’s authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. A spokesperson for EOIR declined to comment, saying the office does not comment on personnel matters.

Fort Snelling Immigration Court oversees immigration cases for Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota residents. The court had over 21,000 new cases filed in 2024 and is currently experiencing a backlog of 38,694 cases, with the number likely to increase before the end of the year.

Former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge at Fort Snelling Ryan Wood said losing another immigration judge will push the limits of an already strained system.

“The court system on January 19th, 2025, was operating at 125%, or more,” Wood said. “The staff, we were running a sprint pace at marathon lengths indefinitely.”

Wood also said the shortage of administrative staff is equally problematic for the case backlog.

“When you think of the amount of staff work it takes to manage a case docket of 40,000 cases, it’s a lot of people,” Wood said. “They are woefully understaffed, and I don’t know how they’re going to keep up with this.”

Along with staffing changes, the way immigration law has been enforced has changed substantially since President Donald Trump took office in January. The number of individuals criminally prosecuted for immigration violations reached around 6,885 in May, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, up from about 3,344 in February, Trump’s first full month in office.

At Fort Snelling, mounting pressure from the federal government to increase immigration enforcement has led to changes in judges’ decision-making. According to Amy Lange, project manager for The Advocates for Human Rights’ court observation project, the Department of Homeland Security has increased the number of motions to dismiss immigration cases, subjecting immigrants to potential detention and deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Lange says judges have repeatedly shifted stances on how to deal with motions for dismissal.

“There were two judges when this first started that weren’t automatically dismissing cases, then obviously there was a lot of pressure that came from above because then they were dismissing every case,” Lange said. “In the last week, we’ve seen two different judges deny a dismissal, and that’s new since early August.”

According to Lange, the administrative staff at the court has rapidly departed. She said that in some cases, staff were provided financial incentives to depart, and in other instances, staff members were fired.

Lange also echoed Wood’s concerns about court system funding and confirmed that former Immigration Judge Zaske’s cases had been reassigned.

“They’re reassigning her cases to other people,” Lange said. “People were showing up for afternoon appearances with Judge Carr, and those hearings had been rescheduled for June, but nobody knew.”

Wood said that Homeland Security Investigations’ and enforcement priorities have shifted under the Trump administration to emphasize immigration.

“They [prosecutors] have metrics; we want to see x number of worksite enforcement actions, x number of prosecutions for child exploitation,” Wood said. “Those metrics have turned to immigration enforcement.”

Fort Snelling currently has six immigration judges. To Wood, the onslaught of firings and pressure on immigration judges has a more discrete motivation of making a mental impact.

“We can’t see a lot of logic in the noise right now, other than that it’s putting fear in the judges,” Wood said. “You’re making close decisions on the bench, and that weighs. On the human level, it’s really tough.”",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctimmigrationjudge.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:01:15.372747

The emergency action, issued by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, immediately paused the issuance and renewal of CDLs for noncitizens while states undergo audits of their licensing systems.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said the rule aimed to address ""widespread noncompliance"" and a ""troubling series of fatal crashes involving foreign nationals.""

Attorneys with Public Citizen, the public-interest law firm who have been representing the plaintiffs, argued the rule was imposed without the required public notice or comment period.

MORE |

""It's possible for an agency to act quickly in a true emergency,"" said Cormac Early, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group. ""But this isn't one. DOT based this on just five news stories, without any data showing noncitizen drivers are more dangerous.""

Early said those incidents — which involved drivers who would not have qualified for CDLs under the new rule — do not amount to the kind of “true emergency” required for an interim final rule.

He added that the government failed to analyze how revoking licenses from thousands of legally employed immigrants could impact the economy and public safety.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals, challenged both the process and the substance of the rule, alleging it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and unfairly targeted immigrants who have a legal right to work in the U.S.

Among them is Jorge Rivera, a DACA recipient who has lived in the U.S. since childhood and has owned a trucking company in Cedar City.

Rivera's story gained national attention after he shared a video of himself being denied his CDL renewal at a Utah DMV.

""What do you do when you can't renew your license, and you suddenly have to look for another job?"" said Rivera. ""I'm self-employed, I own my own business, I'll have to hire someone to drive my truck.”

Rivera said his CDL, which is set to expire at the same time he has to reapply for his federal work permit, could be revoked by the end of November.

""You're going to take somebody like me off the road who has 11 years of experience and replace me with someone who just came out of school,"" said Rivera. ""How is that making the roads safer?""

State impact and oversight

According to the Utah Division of Driver License, the state has had 85,586 active CDL licenses and permits — roughly 1,000 of which are limited term, issued to noncitizens with legal work authorizations, including DACA recipients, asylum-seekers and refugees.

State officials said they track CDL-related accidents through the Highway Safety Office. If a crash requires sanctions against CDL privileges, those are reported through the division of court convictions or crash reports.

In order to obtain a commercial driver's license, drivers have to take a training course and pass both a written and driven exam. Some drivers, depending on the class of vehicle, may be required to pass additional tests.

If a driver has several moving violations, they may need to retest.

Rivera said he has followed these requirements consistently for his 11 years of driving.

""Every two years that I renew, they run my paperwork and every two years it passes,"" he said.

What comes next

Early said the plaintiffs are seeking to have the rule vacated, which would allow states to resume issuing and renewing CDLs for legal noncitizens as before.

The DOT maintains that the rule is temporary and aimed at protecting public safety while audits are completed. The agency said it will accept public comments and may modify the policy before finalizing it.

For Rivera, the case has been about more than his own livelihood.

“I’m not asking for special treatment — just to be able to keep working and providing for my family,” he said. “This isn’t just about me. It’s about everyone who’s been doing the right thing and is suddenly told they can’t.”

Public comments on the rule remain open on the Department of Transportation’s website.

The full text of the letter can be found here and below.

Dear Mr. Greer:

I am writing to request that you open an investigation concerning reports that political messaging has been disseminated through federal agency channels during the ongoing government shutdown. This includes reports of a request by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to airports that they air videos framing the cause of the federal shutdown in political terms. I believe that the request from DHS to airports, messaging included in federal government websites and communications disseminated to employees are in clear violation of the Hatch Act and federal restrictions on partisan activity by government employees. This is an inappropriate and wasteful use of taxpayer dollars for political gain that merits a full investigation.

Recent postings on official government websites and reported emails to employees promote a partisan political narrative regarding the causes of the shutdown—activity that federal law expressly prohibits when “directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.”

Again, the Hatch Act is clear: Federal employees must remain impartial in the performance of their duties, regardless of political climate or leadership. Federal employees, including those on California’s Central Coast, deserve clear guidance to ensure that directives do not compromise their integrity or the public’s trust.

It has been brought to my attention that the website for the Los Padres National Forest under the U.S. Department of Agriculture includes partisan messaging attempting to place blame on Congressional Democrats— another violation of the Hatch Act. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. There are multiple reports that several agencies have issued communications blaming one political party for the ongoing shutdown, using official government resources to amplify these claims. These statements—some of which appeared on agency websites and others distributed internally to staff—frame the shutdown as being “caused by Democrats” or “driven by the left,” language that raises significant Hatch Act concerns. Regardless of which party holds power, such messaging violates the foundational principle that federal agencies serve the American people, not partisan agendas.

These clear violations of federal law demand a prompt and thorough investigation. To ensure accountability and transparency, I respectfully request that the Office of Special Counsel:

Immediately open an investigation into the use of government communications channels for partisan purposes during the shutdown; and

Provide guidance on how your office plans to address these incidents and prevent future violations.

Preserving the impartiality of federal agencies and their employees is essential to ensuring the integrity of our democracy and sustaining the public’s trust in our institutions. I ask that you give this request your immediate attention. Please reach out to my office at (202) 225-3601 should you have any questions.",https://[lastname].house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:14.059566

Last Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration in the U.S. District for the District of Columbia over the President’s recently announced $100,000 fee on H-1B petitions. According to the Chamber, the fee violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and would impose prohibitive costs on businesses seeking to take advantage of the visa program.

President Donald Trump announced the new fee in a September 19 Proclamation entitled “Restriction of Entry on Certain Nonimmigrant Workers.” All H-1B visa petitions filed after September 21 are subject to the $100,000 fee, but previously issued visas will not be impacted. The Proclamation cited the continued abuse of the H-1B program to undercut American wages, and the resulting struggles facing college graduates in the job market, particularly STEM graduates. According to the Proclamation:

The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor. The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.

The Chamber of Commerce pushed back in its lawsuit. The complaint in the case claims that the proposed fee would exacerbate a “well-documented labor shortage” by making it more difficult to staff certain positions with H-1B visa holders, particularly in the STEM fields. The complaint goes on to argue that imposing the fee on H-1B petitions would hinder American manufacturing, innovation, and trade, and make the H-1B program prohibitively expensive for many companies. The Chamber of Commerce also contested the President’s authority to impose the fee on the H-1B program in a way that it regards as “flatly contrary to Congress’s directives” as laid out in the INA, namely statutes outlining the implementation of the H-1B program.

Trump administration officials were quick to respond. According to a statement from the White House: “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.” FAIR’s executive director and general counsel Dale Wilcox also supported the new H-1B fee, saying, “The new fee is significant enough to discourage employers who merely want to hire lower wage foreign workers, but not so prohibitive that it will prevent them from petitioning for workers whose skills are truly needed.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/H1B%20Visa%2C%20Money%2C%20Passports%2C%20Cracked%20American%20Flag.jpeg.webp?itok=ZaYc8XYL,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:17.123025

We filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to uncover any related directives, policies, or legal analyses.

The filings follow President Trump’s recent National Guard deployments to major cities, raising alarm that such tactics could extend to polling locations next year. Trump previously made similar threats ahead of the 2020 election, when he claimed he would send law enforcement officials to monitor polling sites. — a move experts warned could intimidate voters and potentially violate federal law.

“The presence of law enforcement or military personnel at polling places risks chilling voter participation and undermining public confidence in the integrity of our elections —– perhaps that is what President Trump is counting on,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “The possibility that this kind of government power might be used to threaten voters exercising their constitutional rights demands scrutiny. Rather than stoke fears of political intimidation, the administration should strengthen trust in our democracy and address the real crises affecting people’s lives.”

Deploying military personnel or immigration enforcement officials to polling places would not be Trump’s first use of federal power to influence the 2026 midterms. With a history of punishing states that refuse to do his bidding, he has publicly pressed states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm cycle, intervening directly in the redistricting process in states like Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina to lock in additional Republican seats rather than wait for the usual post-census period.

Additionally, Trump ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate ActBlue, the main online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates, while ignoring its GOP counterpart, WinRed. The DOJ has also demanded detailed voter registration data from states, threatening legal action against some Democratic-led states that have not complied. What’s more, Trump has also indicated he will sign an executive order outlawing voting machines and mail-in ballots, despite courts blocking his earlier executive actions that sought to impose proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration.",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Web-image-template-4.png,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:20.844315

One Judge Has a Plan to Make It Worse.,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/news/trumps-crackdown-on-portland-is-bad-enough-one-judge-has-a-plan-to-make-it-worse/,"In a concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson argued that the judiciary has no power at all to review (or halt) a president’s deployment of the National Guard to suppress alleged domestic unrest.
Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him.
The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted.
But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard.
Nelson’s theory would nullify Congress’ constitutional authority over the National Guard by letting the president summon it whenever he wants.","Two judges appointed by President Donald Trump allowed him to deploy the National Guard into Portland, Oregon, on Monday, granting the executive branch sweeping authority to suppress peaceful protests based on false claims of widespread violence. The 2–1 decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rested on a credulous reading of the record: The majority largely accepted the administration’s portrayal of Portland as a “war zone,” dismissing the district court’s extensive findings to the contrary. As dissenting Judge Susan Graber pointed out, Trump’s “illegal deployment of troops” rests on “false pretenses,” “fabrication,” and “propaganda”—all “political theater” that no court should dignify.

As bad as Monday’s decision was, it could have been far worse. In a concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson argued that the judiciary has no power at all to review (or halt) a president’s deployment of the National Guard to suppress alleged domestic unrest. In Nelson’s view, Trump enjoys absolute discretion to send troops into American cities for any reason he deems necessary, and no court may stand in his way. It may be tempting to dismiss this argument as Nelson’s audition for a Supreme Court seat. But it must be taken seriously, because it is precisely what the Trump administration is now asking SCOTUS to embrace. And it is wrong from top to bottom: As a matter of constitutional principle, statutory text, precedent, and history, there is no remotely plausible argument that courts cannot review a president’s domestic deployment of the National Guard. Indeed, the weight of evidence points in the opposite direction.

Before delving into why Nelson’s claim is wrong, consider its radical and disturbing consequences. Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him. He could send in the Guard to punish voters, protesters, and lawmakers who oppose his agenda—as he is doing in Portland and Chicago—responding to political disagreements with a militarized crackdown. He could flood Democratic cities with troops during an election to obstruct people going to the polls. He could dispatch soldiers to surround critical media outlets, sending the message that dissent will be met with force. The opportunities for repression are boundless, which is one reason why the Framers were so hostile to the idea of a standing army responsible for domestic security.

In light of these dire consequences, one might expect Nelson to mount a robust defense of his belief that Trump’s mobilization of the Guard “may not be reviewed by the federal courts.” But he devoted a sum total of fewer than six pages to this radical claim and spent most of them mischaracterizing Supreme Court precedent. The key case, to his mind, is 1827’s Martin v. Mott, a dispute over President James Madison’s authority to call up the states’ militias (the predecessors to our National Guard) during the War of 1812. In his unanimous opinion, Chief Justice Joseph Story held that Madison’s mobilization was lawful because the British invasion constituted a genuine emergency. The ruling included a sentence that the Trump administration has repeated ad nauseam: “We are all of opinion,” Story wrote, “that the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen, belongs exclusively to the President, and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.”

Plucked from context, these words seem to imply that the president alone may determine when there is an emergency that requires state militias, and courts may not second-guess his decision. That’s precisely what Nelson insisted on Monday. But as professor Steve Vladeck has explained, the sentence means something entirely different in the context of the opinion. Mott addressed a debate about whether the president could make the initial determination that an emergency exists, or whether officers lower in the military’s chain of command could do so instead. The Supreme Court, professors Joshua Braver and John Dehn have shown, was concerned about preserving the military chain of command, specifically during a foreign invasion; it wanted to ensure that the commander in chief’s military subordinates could not defy his decision in a crisis.

To that end, Mott announced that the president, rather than officers of inferior rank, could make the first call to deploy the militia in a national crisis. The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted. That mistake has been definitively debunked by Braver, Dehn, and a comprehensive account of the case by the Constitutional Accountability Center.

There is another reason why neither Mott nor any other 19th-century case that Nelson cites could possibly stand for the proposition that courts may not review the president’s declaration of an emergency: They involved a different statute than the one Trump now relies upon. Those cases interpreted the Militia Acts of 1795 and 1807, which broadly empowered the president to “call forth” the militia to counter an insurrection or rebellion “as he shall think proper.” These statutes gave immense deference to the president’s judgment and imposed few limitations. But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard. The modern statute allows the president to send in the troops only in the case of insurrection, rebellion, or an inability “with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Nelson ignored this significant revision of the statutory text. He wrote that the current statute “uses similar language” to its predecessors, disregarding Congress’ deletion of a clause that gave more deference to the president. But as Judge Graber pointed out in dissent, today’s statute includes careful limitations on the president’s discretion. And those limits create a “judicial responsibility” for courts to rebuff the president when he deploys the Guard “in a situation far divorced” from what Congress envisioned.

There is, Graber noted, a deeper principle that counsels judicial review here. The Constitution does not give the president control over the militia; it allows Congress to decide when the militia may be called up. Congress has decided when deployment is appropriate and instructed the president to send in troops in those circumstances alone. Nelson’s theory would nullify Congress’ constitutional authority over the National Guard by letting the president summon it whenever he wants. Without judicial review, after all, who could stop him? Congress might try to deny funding for his partisan deployments, but Trump has already asserted the right to redirect money appropriated for other purposes. Combined with his ability to unlawfully withhold federal funds—which SCOTUS recently greenlit—Trump now has a license to take money from programs he dislikes and repurpose it for his own military objectives.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-22 16:02:36.434701

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.
Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.
The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.
The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.","Local and state officials in New York are expressing outrage after dozens of federal agents carried out a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown on Tuesday.

Eyewitnesses accounts and video footage captured the chaotic scenes in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, where masked and armed federal agents were seen detaining several individuals near Canal Street, while crowds of New Yorkers gathered, protesting against the action. Military-style vehicles were also seen driving through the area.

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.

The raid drew swift condemnation from local and state leaders.

The New York police department (NYPD) quickly distanced itself from the operation, stating that the department had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Eric Adams, the mayor, reposted the NYPD’s statement and added: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, condemned the operation and hit out at Donald Trump.

Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.

“You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” she said.

Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, called the raid “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive” and said that federal immigration agencies “should target criminals for arrest and deportation – not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city”.

“This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer,” he added.

Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, said that federal agents deprived “vendors of due process and ripping them from their families – all because they tried to earn a living”. The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, described the raid on Tuesday as a “horrifying display of federal overreach and authoritarian tactics”, adding that “our communities deserve safety, dignity and due process – not fear and violence that tear families apart”.

He also told reporters that a few people were taken into custody for protesting and blocking Ice’s efforts.

A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that people in the crowd “were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties” and said that at least one protester was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal officer.

The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.

The Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, condemned the operation as a “aggressive and reckless raid on immigrant street vendors”, adding: “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop.”

Andrew Cuomo, the independent candidate and former New York governor, called the raid an “abuse of federal power by the Trump administration: more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety.

“This is not who we are, and it will never be NYC when I am mayor,” Cuomo said. “The Statue of Liberty stands in our harbor, not as a decoration, but as a declaration of our values and the promise of America.”

And in a statement to the Gothamist, a spokesperson for the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, said that the federal government should prioritize the deportation of “gang members, sex traffickers, and those involved in major crimes.

“[Sliwa] has also been clear that the backs of restaurants and other service industries should not be the focus of immigration enforcement, and that resources should target dangerous offenders, not working people,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39a4b9e75b9e3fd40331d8b4b1a3e942cf93102/383_0_3799_3039/master/3799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbae09c57f8f7d769ead6cb4ccb444ee",N,,2025-10-22 12:57:43.059555

Since he returned to office in January, President Trump’s administration has heavily cracked down on immigration. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a new $1,000 immigration fee for migrants paroled into the U.S.

The fee aims to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” DHS said. It would also bolster oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a previous statement.

Blumenthal, in an emailed statement, said ICE was “using police state tactics to terrorize communities across the country — unlawfully arresting at least 170 U.S. citizens in the process.”

The Hill has reached out ICE for comment.

(AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant women who have been detained in Trump's immigration crackdown.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended the care given to pregnant detainees, saying they are given regular prenatal visits and nutritional support. The agency did not immediately provide figures on the number of pregnant women in detention, as Democrats have demanded.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union gives accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while held in detention facilities in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody -- including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of those woman said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she'd been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and suffered from vaginal bleeding. During her time in the detention facility, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU's letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrest and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody and demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

Democratic lawmakers have also said information about the number of pregnant women in ICE custody has been difficult to ascertain.

DHS has said that pregnant detainees receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

“Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review,” the agency said in an August press release.

The data is clear that this policy is not a result of a focus on road safety, but instead an immigration incitement issue.
Perhaps this hypocrisy has more to do with playing politics with California than ensuring road safety across our nation.
However, the wholesale ban of immigrants with temporary immigration status turns the focus on eligibility instead of implementing tougher policies for road safety.
We can raise the bar for road safety, but should do so in a way that gives immigrants a chance to meet those standards.","U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently announced sweeping changes to significantly restrict the issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to immigrant workers with temporary work authorization.

The rule changes the federal minimum eligibility requirements — immigrants with pending asylum cases, for example, can no longer receive a commercial driver’s license with a work permit alone.

Duffy’s comments took particular aim at California, whose policies have been under strict scrutiny after a California trucker was involved in an accident in Florida, killing three. The driver was a Sikh, whose religious attire — such as his turban — drew bigoted and racist comments from across the country. It’s estimated that 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry, with an overwhelming majority of them being from California. The Florida turnpike crash was a turning point for Sikh truckers. Sikhs remain at the center of this issue, with many reporting harassment and racial abuse while driving across the country. The mistake of one man in Florida is being used to target the entire Sikh trucking community.

Historically, Sikhs have disproportionately been victims of hate crimes due to their outward religious symbols, such as their turbans and long beards. Many chose the trucking profession as it allowed them to maintain their religious preferences and also earn a living. For these hardworking immigrants, this was the American dream.

But now, asylum seekers from Sikh, Mexican and other communities with pending asylum cases will no longer be able to work as truckers. Those with an existing commercial driver’s license are no longer eligible for renewal. And with obsolete licenses, the livelihoods of thousands of workers have been upended.

The immigrants being affected by this policy change had lawfully issued employment authorization documents. In other words, these individuals followed proper procedure, bringing their asylum cases to the immigration courts and diligently showing up for every hearing and court date.

In many ways, the catalyst behind these new trucking policies stemmed from a xenaphobic “other-ing” of a community of truck drivers. To justify these policies, it was necessary to create and justify the idea that immigrant drivers were making American roads unsafe. The data, however, tells a different story.

California has a fatal crash rate for commercial drivers that is almost 40% lower than the national average. According to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which releases reports on state-level commercial motor vehicle fatal crashes, the 10 states with the highest commercial fatal crash rate are all Republican states. The 10 states with the highest crash rates are Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska and Mississippi. The FSMCA data is expansive, assessed through fatal crashes per 100 million total vehicle miles traveled.

The data is clear that this policy is not a result of a focus on road safety, but instead an immigration incitement issue.

Why target immigrant drivers, who work dangerous hours to support and contribute to the American economy? Perhaps this hypocrisy has more to do with playing politics with California than ensuring road safety across our nation. California has been a thorn in the side for the Trump administration, who perceive Gov. Gavin Newsom’s state as defying federal authority.

The abruptness of the policy is a problem in itself. Unlike many new rules which phase out certain policies, this overnight change allows no time for truckers to assess their options.

So what can we do? To start, tighter safety regulations are needed across the country. Tougher tests, increased language requirements and stricter policies are important to curbing road risks. However, the wholesale ban of immigrants with temporary immigration status turns the focus on eligibility instead of implementing tougher policies for road safety.

We can raise the bar for road safety, but should do so in a way that gives immigrants a chance to meet those standards. No one wants safer roads more than truckers, who spend their entire lives on them. However, reacting to a tragedy in Florida in this way isn’t wise policy-making — it’s politics.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/opn71u/picture311907879/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/FRS_EPZ_PUNJABI_TRUCKING_01.JPG,N,,2025-10-22 15:01:10.020539

October 22, 2025 10:00 am

WASHINGTON — A group of civil and human rights organizations today urged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to end the detention of pregnant people immediately and to investigate alarming reports of medical neglect and abuse in ICE facilities in Louisiana and Georgia.

In a letter sent to ICE leadership, the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South, and Sanctuary Now Abolition Project detailed the experiences of six women detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, and the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Several of the women were pregnant or had recently miscarried while in custody.

“Our interviews indicate that ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” advocates warned in their joint letter. “Notably, ICE has issued detainers and then detained several cases of pregnant individuals arising from domestic disputes. This practice endangers survivors of domestic violence, particularly pregnant individuals, who are more vulnerable to abuse and violence.”

Advocates interviewed more than a dozen women, and in their letter, also describe disturbing accounts of shackling and use of restraint during transport, solitary confinement, denial of prenatal vitamins, inadequate food, delayed or substandard medical care, and lack of interpretation during medical visits. One woman experienced a dangerous infection after a miscarriage due to ICE’s medical neglect.

Along with documenting abuses, the groups also urged ICE to:

Identify and release all pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals in its custody

Comply with its own directive prohibiting the detention of pregnant individuals except in extraordinary circumstances

Guarantee timely medical care consistent with community standards of care

Investigate failures of informed consent and language access for women seeking gynecological care

The groups argue that ICE’s practices continue to violate federal regulations and ICE’s own policies, putting pregnant and postpartum individuals at risk.

“I experienced so much pain and trauma while detained,” said Jenny, a mother who was detained in February 2025 at the Basile detention center while she was pregnant. Jenny is using a pseudonym to protect her privacy. “I am sharing my story for all the other women in detention, as well as the women who were deported. There were even women who lost their pregnancies. I want to make sure everyone knows what we had to go through. There are many women in detention who are facing this experience now and each of them needs help and support from advocates, members of Congress, and the community.”

What we know:

Giannoulias issued the warning after reports surfaced that ICE agents have been changing or flipping state-issued license plates while carrying out what he described as ""military-style deportation efforts"" in the Chicago area.

A video circulating on social media appears to show a federal agent telling someone, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

In response, Giannoulias said, ""Swapping out license plates or tampering with them to avoid or conceal detection is illegal, unsafe and will not be tolerated in Illinois. No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.""

What's next:

Giannoulias announced that his office has created a ""Plate Watch Hotline"" for residents to report suspected license plate tampering. Reports can be made by calling 312-814-1730 or emailing platewatch@ilsos.gov.

Under Illinois law, displaying a plate not authorized for a vehicle, or obscuring or modifying a plate can result in fines, possible jail time, and suspension or revocation of the vehicle’s registration.

Giannoulias also reminded drivers that all Illinois-registered vehicles must display two license plates, one on the front and back, and that vehicles from other states must comply with their own state’s requirements when driving in Illinois.

The backstory:

The warning from Giannoulias comes amid an increase in federal immigration enforcement efforts across the Chicago area under President Donald Trump.

Broadview’s ICE facility has become a focus of recent protests, some of which have grown tense over the past month or so.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security continues to defend its immigration enforcement tactics in court. A judge recently blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to the Chicago area to assist federal agents in the immigration crackdown.

House speaker responds to report that Trump is demanding $230m in reimbursement from justice department

Mike Johnson said that he hasn’t spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking $230m from his own justice department in damages over past federal investigations.

“I know that he believes he’s owed that reimbursement. What I heard yesterday was, if he receives it, he was going to consider giving it to charity,” he said.

As my colleague, Joseph Gedeon, reports, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically bars claims arising from discretionary or policy actions, meaning a president seeking compensation for law enforcement investigations into his own conduct would fall well outside the statute’s intended scope.

The No Kings alliance, the left-leaning groups behind the mass days of protest last Saturday and in June, is building a nationwide rapid response network that will call on supporters to take new actions each week.

Leaders of the organizations told the Guardian that there was energy for “some type of disruption”, and future actions could include targeted boycotts, campaigns at universities, more street protests, and electoral organizing in local communities.

After an estimated 7 million people took to the streets last weekend, tens of thousands joined a national call on Tuesday to hear what’s next for the growing movement. Leaders celebrated the broad turnout, saying it showed how much opposition to Trump there was in all corners of the US, and talked about how to sustain and grow a movement during an increasingly authoritarian moment for the country.

The next steps for this burgeoning resistance will show the durability of the movement and whether it can pressure Democrats or pillars of civil society to stand stronger against Trump, or whether it can force defections from Trump’s Republican allies to fracture his power.

Democrat Scott Wiener will run for the US House seat long held by Nancy Pelosi, the California state senator announced on Wednesday.

Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House, has represented San Francisco in Congress since 1987 and has not yet said whether she will seek re-election in 2026. But Democrats are increasingly facing calls for change with younger candidates who will offer new opposition to Donald Trump.

Wiener has served as a state lawmaker since 2016 and said he was seeking office to stand up to Trump as the president wages a “full-on war against immigrants and LGBTQ people” and the cost of living continues to increase.

“We need more than rhetoric and good intentions from Democrats. We need action. We need someone who will fight like hell for the most marginalized in our community – someone who will stand up for trans kids, undocumented immigrants even when it’s unpopular, even when it means getting personally attacked and threatened,” Wiener said in a statement. “We need leaders with spines, who don’t just put their finger in the air to see where the winds are blowing or what polls well.”

As a state lawmaker, Wiener, an attorney who attended Harvard law school, authored a recently passed bill banning federal and state law enforcement from wearing masks and has promoted legislation to address California’s housing crisis and expand climate action.

“I’m running for Congress to defend San Francisco, our values, our people and the constitution of the United States with everything I have,” Wiener said in a video announcing his candidacy. “I’ve stood up to violence and hate my entire life. Trump and his Maga extremists don’t scare me.”

Vance meets with families of Israeli hostages after press conference with Netanyahu

A short while ago, vice-president JD Vance met with families of Israeli hostages who returned alive and families members of deceased hostages who have not been returned.

Earlier, Vance met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who maintained that Israel has an “unmatched alliance” and partnership with the US.

“I was impressed with your clarity, with your incisiveness, with your solidarity for our common cause,” he said of Vance.

The vice-president said that the nations they would be sitting down to work on the Gaza peace plan. “We’re have a very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza,” he said.

When Vance was asked about the fragility of the current ceasefire he said “this thing takes monitoring, and it’s going to take a lot of work.”

Johnson kicked off the press conference continuing to blame Democrats for the shutdown. Both parties have traded endless barbs in the four weeks since government funding lapsed.

“As long as Democrats continue to act like unserious lawmakers, I’m just going to say this morning enough is enough,” he said.

The House speaker brought up the topic of Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which Democrats say is one of the key extensions they’re seeking in any stopgap funding bill. A reminder, Obamacare subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. For his part, Johnson maintained today that resolving this in a continuing resolution was “not possible”.

“Republicans cannot and will not solve it in a back room deal,” he added. “Issues of this magnitude deserve deep thought and deliberation.”

Man arrested after driving into security gate outside White House

A man who drove into a Secret Service vehicle gate outside the White House has been arrested.

US Secret Service said in a statement that the incident took place late Tuesday at “approximately 10.37pm”. The individual drove into the security gate located at 17th and E St NW, in Washington DC.

Ultimately the vehicle was assessed and deemed safe. They added that their “investigation into the cause of this collision is ongoing”.

Officials did not provide any extra details on the driver’s identity or possible motivation. The vehicle had a Maryland license place.

Democratic senator continues 14-hour floor speech, as government shutdown enters day 22

Democratic senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, has been speaking on the floor of the upper chamber for more than 14 hours.

Merkley said that his marathon speech, which began at 6.24pm ET on Tuesday, is to “ring the alarm bells” about how Donald Trump is “shredding the constitution”.

Throughout his time on the floor, which threatens to delay legislative business in the Senate as long as Merkley is still speaking, the lawmaker has run through the president’s first nine months back in the White House, chastising his tariff policies, the use of the justice department to target of his political adversaries, and his frequent attacks on journalists and the media.

Throughout the speech Merkley had several dark green placards behind him to illustrate his points. As of now, he’s standing in front of a sign which reads “AUTHORITARIANISM IS HERE”.

A reminder that Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, holds the record for the longest Senate floor speech – coming in at over 25 hours earlier this year.

New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.

Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.

“Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”

Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire – and if they flip one of those seats it will probably put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.

Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”

Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.

Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.

Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests”.

Mayor says Ice should not target undocumented people in New York City

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. We start with the news that the mayor of New York City has said that the city has had “no involvement” in the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids in Chinatown related to “selling counterfeit goods”.

Mayor Eric Adams shared a social media post from the New York police department (NYPD) after it distanced itself from the raids, saying that it had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Adams quote-tweeted the NYPD’s missive and emphasized:

New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.

While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement. Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.

Hundreds showed up to protests that broke out in New York City on Tuesday evening after Ice raids related to “selling counterfeit goods” were conducted in the Chinatown neighborhood earlier in the day and resulted in an unknown number of people being detained.

Hours after federal agents descended on lower Manhattan, demonstrators were seen assembling near the 26 Federal Plaza Immigration Building where they believed detainees were taken. Many shouted chants including “Ice out of New York” and “No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Videos of the raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

“Is this worth the paycheck? Selling your soul?” one woman can be heard shouting at agents.

The raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

It was unclear how many people were detained in the raid, but a witness told the New York Daily News that he saw at least seven individuals taken into custody.

But what happens when a California law claim is litigated in federal court?
In its 2003 decision in Batzel, the Ninth Circuit held that a district court’s denial of an anti-SLAPP motion under California law is immediately appealable, as it is in state court.
It’s also an open question how much longer this slimmed-down version of California’s anti-SLAPP law will apply in federal court.
Finally, when a federal court lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit involves California state law claims, an anti-SLAPP motion remains an option and offers the prospect of attorney’s fees to successful movants.","An en banc panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit further narrowed the protections available in federal court under California’s anti-SLAPP law, which provides an avenue for quickly disposing of meritless lawsuits that seek to chill First Amendment rights.

The ruling in Gopher Media LLC v. Melone extends a trend of Ninth Circuit decisions that have significantly limited the protections provided by California’s anti-SLAPP law and has three major implications for litigants:

Forum selection matters more than ever, with California state court offering significantly stronger anti-SLAPP protections than federal court.

The long-term viability of anti-SLAPP motions in federal court remains uncertain.

Anti-SLAPP motions remain available in Ninth Circuit federal courts, and the potential for substantial attorney’s fee awards still makes them a valuable tool for defendants facing suits targeting their speech.

The opinion in a lawsuit that arose from a dispute over parking spots outside a California pizzeria held that district court denials of anti-SLAPP motions aren’t immediately appealable in federal court, overruling the contrary 2003 decision in Batzel v. Smith.

Now, defendants filing anti-SLAPP motions in federal proceedings may have to wait longer to vindicate their rights.

Decades-Long Saga

Gopher Media is the latest installment in a story that began in 1992, when the California legislature enacted the state’s anti-SLAPP statute, which allows defendants in such cases to file a special motion to strike at the outset of litigation and provides procedural protections.

Because anti-SLAPP motions may be filed only to strike claims arising under state rather than federal law, most anti-SLAPP litigation takes place in state court. But what happens when a California law claim is litigated in federal court?

In 1999, the Ninth Circuit held the statute applies in that circumstance. It since has struggled with questions about how to reconcile its provisions with the details of federal court practice. The court has stripped away many of the protections of the anti-SLAPP law that apply in state court, reasoning that they conflict with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Gopher Media Implications

This decision continues the erosion. The only question presented in Gopher Media was about interlocutory appeals. In its 2003 decision in Batzel, the Ninth Circuit held that a district court’s denial of an anti-SLAPP motion under California law is immediately appealable, as it is in state court.

The real action in Gopher Media is reflected in the two dueling concurring opinions regarding the broader question of whether California’s anti-SLAPP law should continue to apply in federal court at all.

Judge Mark Bennett, joined by Judge Consuelo Callahan, argued it should. In their view, the anti-SLAPP motion provides defendants with a “substantive right” in the form of a “claim for attorneys’ fees for plaintiffs’ abuse of the judicial process,” and “no federal rule controls or directly collides with that right.”

In contrast, Judge Daniel Bress—joined by Judges Daniel Collins, Kenneth Lee, and Patrick Bumatay—would have held that California’s anti-SLAPP law doesn’t apply in federal court at all.

They pointed out that the Ninth Circuit’s case law has gradually whittled away most core aspects of the statute because they conflict with federal procedural rules. The attorney’s fees provision is “all that really remains” of the anti-SLAPP law in federal court and concluded it is ultimately “a procedural device” that can’t apply in federal court under the Erie doctrine.

In an odd coincidence of timing, the Federal Circuit held in an opinion published on Oct. 15—less than a week after Gopher Media—that denials of California anti-SLAPP motions are immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine. The opinion cites Batzel favorably and reflects no awareness than the en banc Ninth Circuit just overruled it, so the Federal Circuit may grant rehearing and reconsider its decision to align with Gopher Media.

Key Takeaways

California litigants and their attorneys should think carefully about whether state or federal court is a more favorable forum. With the demise of interlocutory appeals in federal court, anti-SLAPP movants have lost one more key benefit of the law, along with the discovery stay and the heightened pleading standard. Yet those protections will continue to apply in California state court.

While defendants often seek to remove cases from state court to federal court, that calculus may flip for defendants planning to file anti-SLAPP motions. And counsel for plaintiffs who anticipate a potential motion may prefer to file in federal court when they can, to deprive defendants of that choice.

It’s also an open question how much longer this slimmed-down version of California’s anti-SLAPP law will apply in federal court. The broader legal landscape has shifted in a way that generally disfavors anti-SLAPP motions in federal court.

Informed in part by intervening US Supreme Court decisions, other circuits have held that state anti-SLAPP statutes don’t apply in federal court. Several Ninth Circuit judges across the ideological spectrum have urged the en banc court to join those courts. They may yet prevail, or the Supreme Court may take up the issue at some point—particularly if the square conflict that now exists between the Ninth Circuit and the Federal Circuit regarding interlocutory appeals persists.

Finally, when a federal court lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit involves California state law claims, an anti-SLAPP motion remains an option and offers the prospect of attorney’s fees to successful movants. Those fees may be substantial.

In California state court, the discovery stay and interlocutory appeal often limit the fees that may be incurred before an anti-SLAPP motion is definitively resolved. But those provisions don’t apply in federal court.

This creates the potential for something of a high-stakes gamble for plaintiffs: Proceed with discovery and keep their case moving forward or await resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion first.

The case is Gopher Media LLC v. Melone, 9th Cir., 24-2626, 10/9/25.

In another dizzying plot point around President Donald Trump’s attempts to federalize the National Guard, three judges on the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a 2–1 decision on Monday that Trump has the authority to deploy the Guard in Portland.

The ruling represents another turning point in legal battles taking place across the country, from Chicago to Washington, DC, and Los Angeles—all of which have been involved in lawsuits related to Trump’s troop deployments.

While Oregon leaders continue to fight the Ninth Circuit’s decision, demanding a review by the full court, protesters have consistently shown up to the ICE facility in South Portland—driving the Trump administration’s ire and claims of a war-ravaged city under antifa siege.

But here’s the kicker: The ICE facility is just one block in a 145-square-mile city.

Hoan Huynh in Albany Park on Tuesday afternoon after blocking his vehicle in and holding phones up to the windows, according to a statement from his office.

“My staff is a little shaken up, but we’re OK,” Huynh told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Huynh had been informing local businesses of their rights regarding the use of their property by federal agents when he and his staffers were alerted to the presence of federal agents nearby, the statement said. He and the staffers drove to Montrose and Kimball avenues to warn others of the federal agents by honking and yelling when six agents in two vehicles blocked Huynh’s vehicle from the front and back.

Huynh said one of the agents pointed a weapon into the open passenger window and demanded they identify themselves as another agent threatened to break another window. He said he didn’t immediately take his phone out to record the incident fearing the agent would think he was reaching for a weapon and open fire.

In video taken by one of Huynh’s staffers that was shared with the Sun-Times, Huynh can be heard identifying himself and noting the agent had been pointing a weapon as several masked agents in tactical gear move away from Huynh’s car as the camera turns to capture them. An agent circles Huynh’s car, filming the occupants inside. When the lead car of agents, a charcoal gray Kia minivan, moves, Huynh’s staffer follows it north on Kimball Avenue and west onto Montrose Avenue before the video ends.

“I never would have imagined in 2025, we would be living in an authoritarian regime in the United States,” Huynh said. “Once my colleague pulled out his camera, the agent put away the gun. ... [But] if they can do this in broad daylight to an elected official, and point a gun at someone, imagine what’s happening behind closed doors.”

After following the vehicles for another minute, he said agents once again got out of their vehicles and blocked his car while putting their hands on their sidearms before driving away.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Huynh said the agent pulling a gun was intended to “silence” rapid responders and others trying to alert community members to the presence of federal agents, but he said it didn’t deter him and his staff from continuing to do so. He said his staff believes that at least four people were taken in the area Tuesday.

The incident involving Huynh comes the same day that 26th Ward Ald. Jessie Fuentes filed a federal tort claim after she was handcuffed by federal agents in a Humboldt Park hospital emergency room Oct. 3 while attempting to see a constituent whose leg was severely injured during an immigration raid.

Huynh, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Vietnam, noted that the state Legislature was working on legislation to ban federal agents from wearing masks in public and stop them from operating on school grounds, among other places. Earlier in the day, an employee with a Chicago Public Schools vendor was detained by federal agents outside a North Side school.

“We’re going to go down to Springfield next week,” Huynh said. “It’s horrific that they’re entering places where folks feel are safe places. ... [But] we have to stay strong, we cannot waver. Our job is to protect our neighbors.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/416bf2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6758x3858+0+325/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F14%2Fb9b46e8e46a18da985a4c6b0671c%2Fhoan-huynh.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 14:01:51.477749

Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.

Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls ""Democrat programs.""

Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.

As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.

Jump to state-specific impacts.

Why did the federal government shut down?

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.

Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.

NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.

In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.

Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.

Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?

The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday.

Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.

Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?

The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.

Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order

What about WIC and SNAP benefits?

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.

Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October.

That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, ""until further notice.""

— Jennifer Ludden, NPR

And what about school lunches?

Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.

""There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.""

According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.

USPS is 'open for business as usual'

""U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,"" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff

A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.

The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.

Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might

Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.

At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.

This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.

In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.

— Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.

National Parks are a mixed bag

Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support

WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.

Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.

Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue

Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.

But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.

In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.

Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted

Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. ""We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,"" McLaughlin said.

According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.

""More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,"" Noem posted on X on Thursday. ""By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a ""super check"" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.""

The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.

If you're flying soon …

Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered ""essential workers"" and have to stay on the job.

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.

Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.

Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose.

The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country

Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:

California

The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]

Colorado

Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but ""some services may be limited or unavailable,"" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]

In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]

Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]

Connecticut

Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]

Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU]

Georgia

For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]

Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]

Kansas

If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR]

Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR]

During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]

Louisiana

The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]

Minnesota

Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]

Missouri

Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]

The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]

New Hampshire

There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR]

The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR]

On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground."" [NPR]

Oregon

The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]

Pennsylvania

Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]

Tennessee

On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]

Texas

U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]

Utah

In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)

Washington

On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW]

The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB]

(KOIN) – KOIN 6 News has obtained footage of a blind man being violently detained by federal agents at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in South Portland.

These videos, each taken from different sides of the building on Saturday, show Quinn Haberl wearing a neon vest and sitting on the side of the driveway to the facility. Next to him is a thick blue line on the ground, which federal agents made to indicate when protesters are crossing onto the federal property — effectively allowing them to arrest people for trespassing.

That’s when the videos show several federal agents circling around Haberl before grabbing him by his limbs and carrying him into the ICE building before dropping him on his head.

They can then be seen dragging him past the gate with more agents getting involved, cuffing him as the man wiggles on the ground. One agent could be seen picking up Haberl’s white cane.

Two men who saw the incident unfold Saturday night said Haberl is a joy to be around — usually dancing and having a good time while protesting outside of ICE.

“It was heartbreaking to see him being dragged the way he was,” one of the men said. “The visceral reaction was to just not continue videotaping and get the angle, but I just couldn’t keep it out. I had to keep him in frame. I had to keep him in frame and it just hurt my heart.”

The other man, Sterling Anderson, said it was shocking to witness.

“You can see in the video where I’m very vocal, and then you can see my breath and my breath was taken away,” Anderson said. “It’s like, what threat does that man represent to, you know, agents of the state or property?”

KOIN 6 News reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which sent the following statement:

“This rioter was arrested after he blatantly disobeyed law enforcement orders to remain off federal property, obstructed law enforcement, and continued to block the driveway so vehicles could not enter or exit the ICE facility.”

Haberl spoke with KOIN 6 News over the phone. He said he is too emotional to speak as of Tuesday — too afraid even to leave his home. But he does want his story told.

Haberl said he is being charged with failure to comply. His friends set up a GoFundMe to help him with medical bills and legal support.

KOIN 6 News also reached out to the FBI for updated arrest data. The agency said they are no longer releasing daily arrest data and are switching to a weekly announcement.

Introduction

The first six months of the second Trump administration have been characterized by a haphazard yet comprehensive evisceration of basic government institutions. From the mass firing of federal workers to the effective shuttering of entire agencies, Trump and his billionaire allies have pillaged public-serving institutions while giving themselves cover by claiming to promote “efficiency” (Gangitano 2025; Shao and Wu 2025; Rubin 2025).

Some of the most critical targets of these attacks have been independent agencies. Unlike executive agencies, which are overseen by the White House and accountable to the president through a cabinet secretary that is part of the president’s administration, independent agencies are established by Congress to serve a specific public purpose. While housed within the executive branch, they are not subject to day-to-day control by the White House. These agencies are supposed to perform essential watchdog functions—protecting individuals like workers, consumers, and retirees from being abused by better-resourced and more powerful corporate actors. The United States Government Manual lists over 55 such permanent independent agencies in the federal government, including well-known entities like the Federal Reserve Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as lesser-known agencies like the Merit Systems Protection Board (Federal Register 2025).

These agencies have been among the earliest targets of Trump’s governmental dismantling. First, he has taken the historically unprecedented (and clearly unlawful) step of firing dozens of board members and commissioners before the expiration of their terms in office—not for any allegations of misconduct, but solely due to political disagreement or assertions of presidential prerogative (EPI 2025a; EPI 2025b; Peck 2025; EPI 2025c; Goldstein and Steel 2025). He has also issued multiple executive orders asserting new levers of control over independent agencies—giving the White House unprecedented control over these agencies’ regulations, enforcement decisions, and day-to-day operations (The White House 2025a, 2025b). More recently, President Trump has gone as far as publicly attacking and then firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a move that could have long-lasting economic implications (Rugaber and Weisser 2025). The Federal Reserve is perhaps the most well-known independent agency among the public; its mandates include promoting full employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, among others.

Many of these changes have largely flown under the public radar screen, but the implications for the U.S. public are significant. While many government agencies have enforcement authority that can serve as a check on corporate power, independent agencies are unique in their ability to hold powerful actors accountable, regardless of political influence. The structure of independent agencies also promotes stability and prioritizes expert decision-making on topics of critical national importance. From the Federal Reserve’s decisions about interest rates to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s evaluation of car seat safety, the work of independent agencies impacts working families’ lives every day. The public deserves to know that these agencies are working as Congress intended: to serve the people of the United States. The Trump administration’s actions are threatening the effectiveness of these agencies and putting people’s lives and well-being at risk.

This report will explore the structures and protections that characterize independent agencies and the multifaceted attacks that these agencies have experienced in recent months. We will then examine several case studies of key independent agencies that protect workers and consumers: the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National Credit Union Administration. We will explore why and how Congress designed them to be independent, the important role their independence has played in protecting the U.S. public, and how their functions will be compromised if brought under the direct control of the Trump White House.

As these case studies will show, the devastation of independent agencies by the Trump administration creates tremendous potential for abuses of power that could let wealthy corporations pad their profits at the expense of ordinary people’s lives and livelihoods. The systematic attack on independent agencies deserves more attention and opposition from Congress, both to defend its prerogative to create public watchdogs within the executive branch and to protect the people these important agencies were designed to serve.

The characteristics of independent agencies

The history of independent agencies dates back to the 1880s when Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates. Businesses were so reliant on the railroads that Congress decided it was important to minimize the potential for disruption by insulating the regulatory system from the vagaries of the political process (Inskeep 2025). Many additional independent agencies were created by Congress during the New Deal. It is commonly thought that these New Deal agencies were created to be independent because Congress wanted their decisionmaking to benefit from specialized expertise and—for several of these agencies—because they were tasked with performing adjudicative functions and, thus, were structured more like courts to preserve the integrity of the deliberative process and promote collaborative and consensus-based decisionmaking (Corrigan and Revesz 2017, 639).

Unlike executive departments—which are run by a single cabinet secretary who is a part of the president’s administration, tasked with advancing the president’s agenda in how they execute their statutory functions, and can be removed by the president at will—the design of independent agencies reflects a judgment made by Congress that they could not perform their essential functions properly if they were subject to presidential pressure. For example, early legislative proposals to house the Federal Communications Commission within the Department of Commerce were rejected out of fear that concentrating power over such important means of communication (at that time, the radio system) in the hands of a politically accountable cabinet secretary would create too much potential for political manipulation (Stella 2025).

While no two independent agencies look exactly alike, the common thread among these agencies is some level of independence from direct presidential control. Congress uses a variety of tools to insulate independent agencies from White House influence. Most importantly, these agencies generally have some ability to make policy decisions in service of the agency’s mission independent of substantive influence from the president.

Independent regulatory authority

One of the most important protections that most independent agencies have from White House influence is their historical ability to use their regulatory authority independently. For decades, traditional executive branch agencies have been required to submit all regulatory actions to the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis (OIRA) for substantive review and input (including interagency review by other executive agencies) and cannot move forward with regulatory actions without OIRA approval. There is abundant evidence that this process causes excessive delays and can hamstring the regulatory effectiveness of executive departments by reducing transparency and opening the door for political manipulation (Copeland 2013; Goodwin 2020). But, until recent executive orders by President Trump, independent agencies have been largely exempt from this review (Dudley 2025; OMB 2025). This exemption has helped to limit the influence of political actors—who are not experts in the substance of the agency’s work—on the regulatory process and has allowed independent agencies to act more nimbly to protect the public from imminent threats.

Independent enforcement and litigating authority

Since the 1960s, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has had centralized authority to engage in litigation on behalf of the United States government. Thus, while some traditional executive agencies continue to have a significant degree of freedom to pursue enforcement actions under the statutes they administer (DOL n.d.), many do not necessarily have final say about which cases they bring in court or which arguments they make, as such decisions are ultimately controlled by DOJ. However, Congress has given most independent agencies some level of independent litigating authority (though the extent of such control varies from agency to agency). This authority is essential to the watchdog functions of these agencies. It allows them to control their own enforcement agenda because they can independently initiate and litigate enforcement actions in court. It also ensures that agency leaders’ expertise about laws they administer is respected, because they control which legal arguments the agency makes. Finally, this authority preserves agencies’ ability to protect the public by promoting consistent and evenhanded interpretation of the law and ensuring that the meaning of the law is being dictated by experts, not politics.

Removal protections

To ensure that these agencies can truly exercise their regulatory and enforcement powers independent of White House influence, Congress has made a judgment that independent agency leadership should be protected from removal by the president in the absence of misconduct. Removal protections are a key component of agency independence because they ensure that agency leaders cannot be fired based on policy disagreements with the president or the leadership of other executive agencies. These protections also play a valuable role in ensuring that agency enforcement of the law is not influenced by partisanship or political favoritism. It is essential that watchdog agencies have the ability to evenhandedly enforce the law against anyone who threatens the public’s interests, regardless of whether the subject of the agency’s enforcement is a presidential friend or donor.

Multimember structure

Most (but not all) independent agencies are designed to be governed by a multimember group of commissioners or board members. These boards are designed with staggered terms that are usually longer than a single presidential administration. Congress has explicitly required that some agencies have bipartisan balance, while other agencies have developed to be bipartisan as a matter of practice even if not required by law (Datla and Revesz 2013). Some agency leaders are required by Congress to have particular backgrounds or expertise as well. These requirements are intended to foster expertise and continuity and to limit the influence of partisanship in agency operations. Longer terms allow agency leaders to gain expertise, while limiting the influence of any particular president over agency leadership (as typically a board will not entirely turn over during a single presidential administration). Staggered terms also provide stability in agency operations and enforcement of the law, facilitating institutional memory and preventing dramatic shifts when there are changes in the presidential administration. Bipartisanship and background requirements promote expert decision-making and ensure that agency decisions benefit from a variety of perspectives.

Independent control over congressional testimony, legislative proposals, and budget submissions

Finally, independent agencies benefit from being able to speak with their own voice. For example, in communicating with Congress, traditional executive agencies must coordinate with the White House and get approval of testimony and other formal communications. By contrast—while the details vary from agency to agency—many independent agencies communicate directly with Congress in providing information and responding to congressional oversight. Independent agencies often submit their own legislative proposals and comment on proposed legislation when requested by Congress without coordinating with the White House or other executive branch agencies. In addition, while independent agencies’ budget requests are included as part of the president’s budget request to Congress, many independent agencies control the content of those submissions, including descriptions of agency priorities and how funds will be allocated. These unfiltered channels of communication facilitate a relationship of trust between independent agencies and Congress, allowing Congress to objectively and carefully monitor whether these agencies are effectively performing their critical watchdog functions. Finally, while many federal agencies are tasked with conducting independent research and producing independent data, independent agencies have the ability to control their own research agendas and produce reliable findings and data that are trusted by outside parties and insulated from political influence.

The Trump administration’s broad attacks on agency independence

In the first few months of his administration, President Trump has taken dramatic steps to exert control over agencies that were intentionally designed by Congress to be insulated from the immediate control of the White House. Most notably, he has fired numerous independent agency heads and board/commission members without cause and has issued several executive orders seeking to fundamentally upend the relationship between independent agencies and the White House.

Firing independent agency leaders

As explained above, most independent agency leaders (at least those on multimember boards and commissions) are protected from removal unless they commit misconduct. Since the start of his administration, President Trump has fired numerous independent agency leaders, either citing no reason at all or explicitly citing policy disagreement, rather than misconduct, as the rationale for the dismissal (Cantor and Sobran 2025). Many of these communications emphasized the administration’s view that statutory “for-cause” removal restrictions do not preclude President Trump from firing independent agency commissioners because such protections are an unconstitutional restriction on the president’s executive authority under Article II of the Constitution.

These firings are blatantly unlawful. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United States 90 years ago, the Supreme Court established that it is consistent with the Constitution for Congress to establish independent agencies and commissions whose leaders can only be removed by the president for cause. Humphrey’s Executor rejected the president’s claim of authority—despite statutory removal protections—to terminate without cause a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The Court distinguished a prior decision affirming the president’s authority to terminate a postmaster from office by looking to Congress’s purpose in creating the FTC and the functions commissioners perform. The Court explained that the FTC was “created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the statute in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed, and to perform other specified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid,” in contrast to the postmaster, whose duties were restricted to “performance of executive functions” and who was “charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power.” The Court concluded that in light of these duties, the FTC “cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive” because “its duties are performed without executive leave, and, in the contemplation of the statute, must be free from executive control.” The same constitutional principles have been applied to uphold removal protections at other agencies performing “quasi-legislative” or “quasi-judicial” functions, not executive functions—insulating them from removal does not intrude on the president’s constitutional authority to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” because they are largely not performing purely executive functions.

Several fired members of independent agencies and commissions have now filed lawsuits challenging their removals as inconsistent with both their agencies’ authorizing statutes and the Supreme Court’s decision in Humphrey’s Executor (Newhouse 2025). The administration’s response to these lawsuits has made clear that President Trump’s goal is for the Supreme Court to revisit Humphrey’s Executor and ultimately rule that the president has unconstrained authority to fire all agency leaders in the executive branch, including those at independent agencies.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has strongly signaled that these removal protections may be deemed unconstitutional in the future, at least for agencies that exercise any level of “executive” authority. While it is unclear how broadly the Court’s ruling will sweep, eliminating these removal protections would jeopardize all facets of agency independence, as agency leaders would be reluctant to engage in regulatory or enforcement actions—or even day-to-day agency decision-making—without coordinating with the White House for fear of termination.

Implementing new levers of control over day-to-day agency operations

At the same time their leadership was being removed from office, these agencies were also targeted by a wave of new executive orders that undermine their independence in dramatic and unprecedented ways. The first such order, issued on February 18, was entitled “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” (The White House 2025a). The order purports to “improve the administration of the executive branch” and “increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people” by asserting unprecedented new presidential powers to control the day-to-day operations of independent agencies. These new powers would include:

giving the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the authority to control expenditure of the agency’s funds, including defunding “particular activities, functions, projects or objects”;

requiring all “agency heads” (including, it would seem, each individual member of bipartisan boards, whether Republican or Democrat) to employ a “White House Liaison” as a senior staffer in their offices;

requiring independent agency chairpersons to “regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council and the White House National Economic Council”; and

giving the director of the OMB the authority to establish and evaluate the “performance standards and management objectives” for independent agency heads.

This level of White House micromanagement undermines the basic structure and function of independent agencies. Congress designed these watchdog agencies to be independent so that they could make decisions—whether about how to prioritize agency objectives, how to most effectively enforce the law, or how to best allocate resources—free from political influence. Independent agencies are often tasked with making decisions that will serve the long-term public interest but may be politically unpopular in the short term. The Federal Reserve provides the most obvious example: It is charged with setting interest rates at a level that will balance the need for maximum employment with the need for stable prices. It is widely acknowledged that allowing an elected official like the president direct control over the Federal Reserve would result in excessive pressure for interest rate reductions that would provide the president with a short-term economic boost, but that would cause long-term inflationary pressure that is detrimental to the economy (Wessel 2025).

Independent agencies are also charged with evenhandedly enforcing the law without favoritism. Giving the White House the ability to pick and choose which prosecutions to fund or which agency objectives to prioritize is fundamentally incompatible with those goals, rendering independent agencies virtually indistinguishable from nonindependent ones, contrary to the clear intentions of Congress.

Usurping independent agency rulemaking authority

President Trump has also used executive orders to undermine independent agencies’ use of their rulemaking powers. These new orders seek to impose a variety of unprecedented constraints on agencies’ ability to use their independent regulatory authority:

Independent agencies are instructed to review all regulations in their jurisdiction and seek to repeal those deemed inconsistent with “Administration policy.” This substantive review and repeal process must be conducted “in coordination with their DOGE Team Leads and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget” (The White House 2025b).

Independent agencies must now “consult with their DOGE Team Leads and the Administrator of OIRA” before considering any potential new regulations.

Independent agencies are now required to submit all new regulatory actions to OMB for substantive review before publication (The White House 2025a);

Independent agencies must seek to immediately repeal any regulation that could be deemed in tension with newer Supreme Court precedents.

While policies differ from agency to agency, most independent agencies have historically had independent authority to consider and promulgate new regulations or repeal existing regulations based on their expert judgment, not directives from the White House (or mysterious White House-adjacent entities like DOGE). And they have controlled their own decisions about how to best comply with the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure that their regulatory efforts can survive judicial review. Such independent control of the regulatory process is a critical tool to ensure that watchdog agencies can prioritize protecting the public and serving their statutory missions over politics. In the few months since President Trump issued these orders, the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has already published a proposed rule to repeal greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-powered power plants, citing multiple executive orders by President Trump as the reason for its review of the standard.

Attacks on the independence of agency enforcement

The February 19 order also directly impacts independent agency enforcement of the law, including by:

giving the president and the U.S. attorney general the ability to override the agency’s own interpretation of the law(s) it administers; and

directing agency heads to consult with the director of the Office of Management and Budget and then “direct the termination of all . . . enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy (emphasis added).”

At most independent agencies, any requirement to coordinate enforcement actions with OMB or to terminate enforcement actions deemed inconsistent with “Administration policy” represents a tectonic shift in enforcement practices. Even traditional executive agencies often retain significant discretion about how they enforce the law and have the authority to initiate and direct their own enforcement actions (DOL 2025). Independent agencies, of course, have traditionally had far greater autonomous control of their enforcement activity. Indeed, these agencies are structured with insulation from political forces precisely so that they can fairly and evenhandedly enforce the law.

Giving the White House control over the enforcement process could effectively nullify important laws protecting the public if the president chooses to override or undermine enforcement efforts. Such interference would be deeply problematic even at traditional executive departments—it is even more untenable at agencies specifically designed by Congress to be insulated from political influence. The potential for political favoritism to influence the enforcement process allows these agencies to be used as tools for corruption and abuse of power, rather than forces for public good.

Case studies

In recent weeks, significant attention has rightly been given to the egregious firing of Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the implications it will have on our economy in both the short and long term. The following case studies highlight four other independent bodies, illustrating the potential consequences for working families when the autonomy of these agencies are compromised. Each of these agencies plays an essential watchdog role in protecting the public from being abused or cheated by more powerful corporate actors. It is clear that greater presidential interference in their operations could undermine their ability to serve the public.

The National Labor Relations Board

Congress established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 following decades of strife between management and labor. In the years prior to the Board’s creation, violent labor disputes were common and workers seeking to join unions and improve working conditions faced brutal repression by corporations, private militias, and police (Andrias 2024). Presidents deployed troops to crack down on labor protests and courts frequently stepped in to suppress labor activity (Taft and Ross 1969).

In response to this crisis of labor unrest, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA). The NLRA empowered workers, giving them a legal right to form and join unions and to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions. It also protected workers from retaliation for joining together and speaking up about unfair treatment. In service of these goals, the Act established the NLRB to serve as a neutral adjudicator of labor disputes.

While housed within the executive branch, the Board was created to be “an independent quasi-judicial body” that would adjudicate labor disputes as a court. The NLRB was designed with many of the classic characteristics of independent agencies. For example, board members are protected from removal by the president except for cause, and serve staggered terms of five years—longer than a single presidential administration.

The Board hears cases involving both allegations that an employer or union has committed an unfair labor practice (such as threatening a worker for discussing working conditions with colleagues or refusing to bargain with the workers’ union) and cases involving objections that arise during a union election. In hearing these cases, the NLRB acts very much like any other court. Board members are charged with adjudicating each case on its merits free from influence by personal interests or the political process. The Board’s decision-making procedure must provide parties with due process. The NLRB follows its own precedents and Board decisions can be overturned by federal courts of appeals if the agency fails to act consistently with precedent (unless a majority of the Board votes to revisit or overturn precedent in a case). The Board keeps its deliberations confidential and communications with parties or outside entities about pending cases are considered a violation of government and judicial ethics rules.

In addition to these core adjudicative functions, the NLRB also occasionally engages in rulemaking, either to establish agency procedures or to articulate general principles of substantive law. The Board has historically acted independently in these functions and not been subject to substantive regulatory review by the White House.

Throughout its 90-year history, the NLRB has played an essential role in safeguarding the well-being of working people across the country. Because the NLRA protects both the right to form and join a union and the right to engage in employment-related collective action by workers, it is a vital tool to address a myriad of concerns that workers face in the modern economy, including sexual and racial harassment, employee misclassification, and the impact of new technology, among others. In recent years, the NLRB has been extremely effective in serving its statutory goals. In fiscal year 2024, for example, the agency recovered $56.5 million in backpay and other compensation for workers whose rights were violated and secured reinstatement offers for more than 1200 workers who were unfairly terminated from their jobs for trying to unionize or speak out about their working conditions.

The agency has been able to fulfill its mission successfully because it can enforce the law comprehensively and evenhandedly. Independence is a necessary foundation for its success. The NLRB enforces the law—against both employers and unions—without regard for whether the employer or union in question might be a close ally of the president or a supporter of the president’s political party.

How the independence of the agency has been compromised

Since President Trump took office, the historically independent functioning of the NLRB has been severely compromised. On January 28, President Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox, a NLRB member serving in her second term on the Board, whose term was not scheduled to expire until 2028. The removal of Member Wilcox from office was the first time in history that an NLRB member was removed from office by the president. Her departure left the Board without a quorum to hear cases. If the Supreme Court ultimately affirms the president’s ability to terminate NLRB members without cause, the integrity of the Board’s adjudicative process will be severely compromised, as board members will be forced to make decisions with the looming threat of termination hanging over their deliberations. For the same reasons that the framers of the Constitution protected federal judges from termination without cause, Congress should similarly be able to protect board members who adjudicate cases so they can do their jobs fairly.

President Trump’s executive orders also significantly implicate the operations of the NLRB. To be sure, the new executive orders do not expressly give the White House authority to decide or override the outcome of individual cases before independent agencies like the NLRB. However, the unprecedented level of control that the White House is now asserting over agencies could certainly be used that way. Many of the levers of control in these orders—like the ability to fund or defund particular agency actions, the requirement that all board members employ a “White House liaison,” or the unprecedented declaration that independent agencies cannot take legal positions inconsistent with the White House—would potentially allow Trump to directly dictate the outcome of cases before the Board and the substance of federal labor law. This is hardly a farfetched concern. A recent Trump executive order attempts to do just that: It directly instructs the Board to address an unsettled issue of labor law—namely, whether student athletes are considered “employees” or not—in the context of an order that makes clear what Trump’s preferred resolution of this issue would be (The White House 2025e). Such presidential interference into the day-to-day decision-making of the NLRB is completely unprecedented and undermines the fairness and impartiality of the agency’s adjudicative process.

Workers rely on the NLRB to protect critical workplace rights. A worker who has been fired for talking to coworkers about unsafe working conditions or whose employer refuses to bargain with the workers’ chosen union needs somewhere to turn to put a stop to such unfair labor practices. Without any assurance that they will get a fair hearing at the NLRB in the future, workers will be forced to resort to other strategies to make their voices heard and neither workers nor employers will have a path to resolve their disputes and move forward.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

Following mass protests against Jim Crow segregation and a decades-long Civil Rights Movement, Congress established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Aiken, Salmon, and Hanges 2013). Title VII represents one of the cornerstones of our national promise of equal opportunity, protecting workers from discrimination on the job based on their race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, disability, pregnancy, or genetic information (Couch, Hersch, and Shinall 2025). If a worker experiences employment discrimination—such as unfair treatment in hiring, firing, promotions, job assignments, or on-the-job harassment—the EEOC is where they can turn to for help.

To fulfill this vital mission, the EEOC performs three main functions. First, for workers in the private sector, it oversees a thorough process to consider each charge of discrimination (EEOC 2025c). The EEOC will investigate charges; facilitate mediation and conciliation; and—if the agency finds cause to believe that discrimination has occurred, and conciliation fails—can opt to file a lawsuit to enforce the statute. While the EEOC commissioners do not directly adjudicate these cases, they must vote on whether the agency will go to court and pursue certain types of significant cases, especially those presenting novel or unsettled legal issues likely to generate public controversy (EEOC 2021).

Second, for complaints where a federal government agency is the employer, the EEOC performs a judicial role. Federal employees who file a discrimination complaint have the right to request a hearing with an administrative judge from the EEOC. If the complainant or the employing agency does not agree with the administrative judge’s decision, they can appeal to the EEOC, which hears and votes on the case as a panel of judges (EEOC 2025e).

Finally, the EEOC issues regulations, guidelines, and formal enforcement guidance, which must be approved by a majority of commissioners (EEOC 2025f, 2025g). The EEOC also issues resource documents, which do not require Commission approval (EEOC 2025h).

From the agency’s inception, Congress took steps to ensure the EEOC’s bipartisan and independent nature. No more than three of the Commission’s five members can be of the same political party and commissioners serve staggered terms of five years—longer than a single presidential administration. While Congress did not specifically provide “for-cause” removal protection for commissioners, the EEOC’s structural components qualify it as an independent agency whose commissioners are protected by Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor. Additionally, the statute contains a “holdover cause” enabling sitting commissioners to serve until their successors are appointed and qualified, with limits on the maximum length of the holdover period. Such holdover provisions are common in independent agencies; they provide continuity and preserve institutional knowledge, while avoiding the uncertainties associated with transitions in presidential administrations and the often lengthy Senate confirmation process.

The EEOC has been extremely effective in accomplishing its mission and its work yields a high return on investment. In 2024, using a $455 million budget, the EEOC secured almost $700 million in monetary relief for about 21,000 victims of employment discrimination and educated more than 268,000 individuals nationwide about employment discrimination and their workplace rights (EEOC 2025a). In the last few years, the Commission has undertaken a number of important initiatives through both rulemaking and litigation, including implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act’s protections to ensure that pregnant workers receive reasonable accommodations in the workplace; educating the public about the implications of artificial intelligence for workplace civil rights; issuing long-awaited guidance on workplace harassment; and historically advancing employment discrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community (EEOC 2024, 2025a).

How the independence of the agency has been compromised

On January 27, President Trump fired EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows and Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels before their terms were set to expire in 2028 and 2026, respectively. Their unprecedented removals left the EEOC without a three-member quorum and unable to vote on litigation recommendations or issue federal sector decisions, regulations, enforcement guidance, and other critical rulings.

The impact of Trump’s encroachment on the EEOC’s independence has already been felt. For example, the Commission recently dropped lawsuits it had filed on behalf of transgender workers. While agreeing that these workers are protected under civil rights laws, Commission Chair Andrea Lucas explained to Congress that she dropped the cases because her agency is not independent and must comply with President Trump’s orders targeting transgender and nonbinary people (Senate HELP 2025). In June, the EEOC also moved to drop a racial discrimination lawsuit relying on a well-established legal theory regarding the lawfulness of facially neutral policies that have a disproportionately negative impact on disadvantaged groups, again citing an executive order from President Trump (Olson and Savage 2025). According to former EEOC General Counsel David Lopez, dropping these lawsuits constitutes an “unprecedented abdication of [the agency’s] enforcement responsibilities” (Lopez 2025). By abandoning individual lawsuits in response to presidential directives that are contrary to well-established federal laws, the EEOC has effectively empowered the White House to define the contours of civil rights law, contrary to the will of Congress in establishing the EEOC.

Acting Chair Lucas has also undermined the agency’s decision-making process in response to presidential orders. Following Trump’s March 6 executive order, “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,” which directs the acting chair of the EEOC to investigate the practices of large law firms, Lucas demanded information from 20 prominent law firms about diversity fellowships and other programs (The White House 2025c; EEOC 2025b). In a letter to Acting Chair Lucas, eight former EEOC members explained that this demand for information exceeds Lucas’s authority as chair. No single member of the Commission has the authority to unilaterally change the EEOC’s long-standing position—reflected in the agency’s majority-approved strategic enforcement plan—regarding employers’ diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Such policy shifts have historically required a vote by the full Commission, consistent with the intent of Congress that the EEOC—like many other independent agencies—should engage in collaborative and deliberative decision-making.

The EEOC plays a critical role in ensuring that all workers in the U.S. can receive fair treatment and have an equal opportunity to succeed at work. To fully execute its mission, the EEOC must be able to interpret and enforce our civil rights laws free from political influence and presidential whims. The removal of EEOC commissioners who disagree with the president’s agenda, along with recent intrusions into the agency’s prosecutorial independence and deliberative process, is inconsistent with both the independent nature of the agency and the will of Congress, threatening the fundamental protections that everyone should enjoy in the workplace.

Consumer Product Safety Commission

Every day, hundreds of millions of consumers across the U.S. purchase new products that, if not properly designed and built, could inadvertently harm them and their families. In worst case scenarios, companies will recall faulty items from shelves, like when Samsung recalled a version of its Galaxy phone because it could overheat and catch fire; or when Infantino recalled an infant carrier due to faulty buckles that posed a fall hazard; or when Midea recalled specific window AC units because they led to mold growth and respiratory issues (CPSC 2016, 2020, 2025d). These, of course, are the very scenarios companies and consumers hope to never experience. Today, thanks in large part to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, consumers can purchase goods with a certain degree of confidence that what they are bringing into their homes won’t pose a risk to their health and safety. And when things do go wrong, consumers know that systems and processes are in place to remove dangerous goods from our stores.

Congress established the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as an independent agency in 1972, charged with protecting consumers from unreasonable risks of injuries (Carpenter 2018). The creation of the CPSC was the result of work under a bipartisan presidential commission examining the mechanisms available at the time to protect consumers. The Commission ultimately recommended Congress pass legislation to create the CPSC. Importantly, during hearings, Congress considered whether to place the CPSC within the then Department of Health, Education and Welfare, but ultimately decided to create an independent agency to insulate the agency’s work from political pressure (Page 1974). Congress empowered the CPSC with authorities to achieve four main objectives: first, conduct research into the injuries and illnesses associated with the use of consumer products; second, facilitate the development of and adherence to safety standards—both through formal rulemaking and engaging industries to adopt voluntary standards; third, aid consumers as they seek to understand and compare the safety risks of various products; and finally, protect consumers from unreasonable risks associated with the goods they purchase.

Today, the CPSC’s efforts cover an extremely broad set of consumer products—from children’s toys, to household appliances, cribs, and mattresses. Importantly, the CPSC authority covers products made both domestically and abroad. Beyond advancing research and standard-setting, the CPSC has numerous enforcement tools at its disposal, including conducting compliance inspections at factories, warehouses, or establishments where products are made or held. The CPSC also has the authority to obtain samples of products imported into the U.S. When the CPSC determines that a product that is already on the market poses a substantial hazard to consumers, it seeks remedial actions either by engaging companies directly to negotiate a corrective action agreement or pursuing administrative actions that culminate in a vote by the Commission and mandate for specific corrective actions. While recalling products is perhaps the most widely recognized corrective action of the CPSC, there are several actions that CPSC and companies can undertake, including: notifying the public of the hazard; modifying the product so that it is in compliance with safety standards; and providing refunds to consumers, among other actions.

The CPSC has many of the classic characteristics of independent agencies. It is led and overseen by five commissioners, one of which is designated as the chair. Commissioners are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate, serving seven-year terms. By statute, they can only be removed from office for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Congress has also stipulated that no more than three members of the Commission could be from the same political party.

How the independence of the agency has been undermined

Last year, consumers spent more than $6.2 trillion on consumer goods, many of which are regulated by the CPSC. Most products purchased every day are safe for consumers to use in large part thanks to the ongoing efforts by the CPSC to develop and update standards as new or improved products enter the market. Nonetheless, in this year alone, CPSC has issued numerous recalls, including in once instance bike helmets which failed to protect individuals and could result in head injury (CPSC 2025a). The purpose and independence of the CPSC is as crucial as ever to consumers’ health and safety. Alarmingly though, Trump has sought to politicize this little-known agency that plays an outsized role in the day-to-day lives of everyone in the U.S.

In May, Trump fired three members of the Commission who were nominated by President Biden and had not yet served their full terms: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr. (Quinn 2025). While a federal district court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals both found the firings unlawful and temporarily reinstated the commissioners, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s order and they were removed from office again (Quinn 2025; Howe 2025). The activities that unfolded at the Commission during the initial period that these three Commissioners were gone highlight the potential damage of politicizing this independent agency. On May 13, 2025, the remaining two commissioners voted to stop the Federal Register from publishing a proposed regulation establishing safety standards for Lithium-Ion batteries in micro mobility products, such as e-bikes and e-scooters (CPSC 2025c). The Commission had previously approved the adoption and publication of this proposed rule in April in response to its finding that over 220 people were injured or killed by such batteries between 2019 and 2023 (CPSC 2025b). While the district court’s reinstatement of the fired commissioners enabled them to (at least temporarily) correct the actions taken in their absence, the danger to consumers of a politicized CPSC was clear.

Now that the three commissioners have been removed again, the risk to consumers returns. For example, the chair of the Commission serves as the principal executive of the CPSC and has the authority to appoint, upon approval of the Commission, a number of positions with the CPSC, including an executive director; general counsel; and assistant executive directors of compliance and administrative litigation, health sciences, and engineering, among others. Now that the three commissioners have been removed again, the chair (with the approval of the remaining member) could potentially take significant personnel actions, such as replacing industry experts with political operatives.

When Congress created the CPSC it sought to create an independent agency that established and enforced safety standards that were driven by the independent expertise of the agency and without influence from conflicts of interest or political swings of power. Yet the Trump administration’s recent efforts to undermine the CPSC and politicize its actions not only runs counter to the intent of Congress but also puts the health and safety of U.S. families at risk.

National Credit Union Administration

For more than 115 years, credit unions have provided vital financial services to individuals, businesses, and communities across the United States (NCUA 2023). As nonprofit financial institutions that are membership-based, credit unions have long provided services—including low-interest car loans and mortgages—to individuals and communities that may be underserved by corporate banks. Today, more than 143 million people in the U.S. are members of a credit union (NCUA 2025c). This includes, for example: the Teachers Credit Union, which was founded more than 70 years ago by educators in New York; credit unions that serve rural areas like the Guadalupe Credit Union in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and credit unions like the State Employees Credit Union, which provides services to state employees in North Carolina, among others.

The first credit unions in the United States were established in the early 1900s and continued to grow in numbers as states—beginning with Massachusetts—passed laws to certify and regulate them (NCUA 2023). In 1934, following the financial crisis of the Great Depression, Congress passed the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), which created a uniform federal standard and process for certifying and regulating credit unions. Originally, Congress charged the Farm Credit Administration—an independent agency—to implement the FCUA (NCUA 1989). In the years following, the federal credit union system moved to a variety of federal agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). By 1970, Congress created a stand-alone independent agency—the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—headed by a single administrator. And then in just a few short years, Congress again amended the Act in 1978 to establish the structure that remains in place today (NCUA 2023). Most notably, Congress replaced the single administrator of the NCUA with a three-member board, capping a long series of actions to ensure the federal oversight of credit unions in the United States was entrusted to an independent agency and sufficiently insulated from swings in the political views of the executive branch. The NCUA’s independence allows it to make unbiased decisions based on sound financial principles to best serve the communities that credit unions support (ACU 2025).

Today, the NCUA charters and regulates credit unions, ensuring that members’ hard-earned money remains safe and that they can access the financial resources they need to pursue dreams like higher education and home ownership. By the beginning of 2025, there were more than 143 million members of federally insured credit unions across the United States. Combined, these members have nearly $2.4 trillion dollars invested in their credit unions (NCUA 2025c). The NCUA plays a vital role in ensuring that credit unions are stable institutions and that members’ deposits are adequately protected, most notably through the management of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Like the FDIC, this fund insures members’ deposits up to $250,000 (NCUA 2025b). The NCUA also enforces a range of regulations that aim to maintain the strength and stability of the credit union system. This includes, for example, regulations regarding the investment and deposit activities, capital adequacy, and mergers of credit unions, among other activities

Since 1979, a three-member board has led and managed the activities of the NCUA. The board is structured similarly to other independent agencies. Under the FCUA, board members are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate to serve a six-year term. The statute states that “[n]ot more than two members of the board shall be members of the same political party.” Importantly, when Congress restructured the NCUA so that it was led by the board, it removed all references in the statute to the leadership “serving at the pleasure of the President.” While many day-to-day functions of the agency, including examination and supervision of credit unions, are executed by agency staff, the board approves and carries out crucial functions of the agency. Specifically, the board sets policies and procedures for the agency; directs and approves its regulatory actions, including proposed and final rules; and serves as a final appeals board for agency actions against credit unions. Under the statute and regulations, the board meets every month and must have a quorum of a majority of board members to hold meetings.

How the agency’s independence has been undermined

In April, President Trump took unprecedented actions that undermined the NCUA’s overall independence and ability to function. Specifically, Trump fired two Democratic members of the board—Todd Harper and Tanya Otsuka—leaving a single board member. Harper and Otsuka have sued President Trump over their firing claiming that the actions violated both the Federal Credit Union Act as well as the Constitution. While a district court found they were unlawfully terminated, a court of appeals stayed the district court’s order and they remain unable to perform their duties. While this litigation is pending there is significant confusion and uncertainty about how the NCUA board can or will function.

As discussed above, the FCUA states that there must be a majority of board members to have a quorum and meet. Crucially, the statute does not explicitly contemplate a situation in which there are vacancies on the board, let alone only one member left. Indeed, the statute has holdover protections to ensure there aren’t vacancies on the board, allowing members to serve beyond their six-year term until a replacement member is approved.

The actions taken by Trump in the short term will likely hamper the ability of the NCUA to carry out important functions, including an annual rolling review of one-third of its regulations. This year the NCUA has identified 36 regulations which will be reviewed by the agency (NCUA 2025a). Additionally, fired board member Harper recently highlighted that there are a number of individual credit unions whose ratings by the NCUA indicate that the board should be engaging more closely in the review and potential regulatory actions against these entities, which combined hold $112 billions in assets (Mullen 2025). Without a full board in place to take necessary actions, these credit unions and their members may be at financial risk.

Conversely, if the single remaining board member attempts to move forward with typical board actions on his own, this would directly undermine the intent of Congress and the statute, i.e., ensuring that the agency and board are not influenced entirely by a single political party. These actions would also most likely be subject to legal challenges, creating additional uncertainty in the credit union market. Similarly, if courts eventually allow the firings of the Democratic board members to stand, this would be a significant departure from Congress’ clearly expressed intent to move the management of the NCUA away from a structure that is under the direct influence of the president.

Trump’s executive orders intruding on agency independence also pose challenges for the NCUA. For example, the new requirement that agencies submit proposed and final regulations to OMB for White House review and approval is particularly challenging for the NCUA, which reviews one-third of its regulations every year and issued 12 new proposed or final regulations in 2024 alone. At a minimum, extensive involvement by the White House will inevitably delay the regulatory process. More alarming is the prospect that the White House will demand substantive changes to regulations (whether new proposals or regulations already on the books) that undermine the NCUA’s independence or do not reflect the best judgments of its expert leaders, putting the communities that rely on affected credit unions at risk.

For the 143 million people who have their savings in a credit union, the uncertainty at the NCUA board at best may cause greater financial stress and uncertainty. For some, the administration’s actions may call into question the ability of the federal government to fairly and adequately regulate the financial institutions people have entrusted their savings with or secured loans from. Over time, undue political influence over the NCUA—either through changes in the board structure or overt influence of its regulatory process—could create instability in the credit union system and subsequently motivate members to move out of the system entirely, undermining the financial security of the many unique communities that credit unions serve.

Conclusion

For more than 100 years, the United States has relied on independent agencies to provide essential protections to workers, consumers, retirees, and the general public. Congress carefully and intentionally designed these agencies—like the Federal Reserve and the Environmental Protection Agency—to ensure they could fully realize their missions without being directly affected by political influence, presidential favoritism, or interest group politics. While the laws these agencies administer have been modified periodically through the years, Congress has not wavered from its commitment to preserve their independence. These agencies can serve the public effectively because they prioritize expertise, promote stable and consistent enforcement of the law, and make policy choices that elevate long-term public good over short-term political gain.

Preserving independence is about more than good governance: It’s about protecting the public. These agencies ensure that workers are able to join together with their co-workers to form a union and bargain for better wages and working conditions, apply for a job knowing that they are protected from discrimination, put their earnings in a local credit union, and purchase household goods without fear of them being unsafe.

Since taking office, President Trump has waged an unprecedented assault on independent agencies, in some cases firing board members and commissioners despite explicit legal prohibitions, politicizing agencies’ rulemaking processes, and—in many instances—bringing the functions of these agencies to all but a halt. These actions not only have immediate consequences for workers and the public—they also create tremendous potential for abuses of power over time that could let wealthy corporations pad their profits at the expense of ordinary people’s lives and livelihoods. The systematic attack on independent agencies deserves more attention and opposition from Congress, both to defend its prerogative to create public watchdogs within the executive branch and to protect the people these important agencies were designed to serve.

Notes

28 U.S.C. § 516 (2017).

Sometimes agencies only have independent authority to litigate in certain subject matter areas, while others have independent authority to litigate only until a matter gets to the Supreme Court (at which point the agency is represented by the solicitor general). Rarely, an agency will have independent litigating authority that encompasses even Supreme Court litigation—with the primary modern example being the Federal Trade Commission.

The precise statutory language establishing such removal protections can vary but typically says that appointed officials can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in office” or some similar standard and sometimes requires elements of due process before a removal can take place, such as notice and opportunity for a hearing.

See Table 4 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

The National Labor Relations Act, for example, does not contain any requirement that the National Labor Relations Board be comprised of bipartisan members, but historically a bipartisan balance has been maintained.

For example, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency must have extensive understanding of financial management, capital markets, mortgage securities, and housing finance. For further information, see Table 7 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

See Table 12 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

For example, Merit Systems Protection Board Chair Cathy Harris’s termination message cited no reason for her dismissal (Harris v. Bessent, D.C. Cir. R. 2025); Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Jocelyn Samuels’s termination message criticized her for “enacting or enforcing the Biden administration’s radical Title VII guidance” (Samuels v. Trump, D.D.C. 2025); and National Labor Relations Board Member Gwynne Wilcox termination message cited, among other things, “improperly cabin[ing] employers’ rights to speak on the subject of unionization” and supporting the Board’s joint-employer rule (Bruenig 2025).

While the Supreme Court subsequently narrowed the scope of Humphrey’s Executor’s reach to exclude independent agencies headed by only one official rather than a multimember body (see Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 2020) the Court subsequently reaffirmed that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law. See Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. (2021) explaining that Seila Law “did not revisit our prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal.”).

See Acting Solicitor General Harris’s February 2025 letter to Senator Dick Durbin (Harris 2025), indicating the Department of Justice’s intention to argue that Humphrey’s Executor should be overruled.

See The White House (2025d). The order strongly implies that any regulation whose legality was previously upheld under the deferential Chevron standard of judicial review applied by the federal courts before the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (U.S. 2024) should be considered for immediate repeal. (This directive is of dubious legality, as it instructs agencies not to use the notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act to repeal a substantive regulation. It also stands in significant tension with the Supreme Court’s explicit direction in Loper Bright that prior cases upholding agency action under the Chevron standard remain good law).

See Starbucks Corp. v. McKinney, 602 U.S. 339, 355 (2024) (Jackson, J., concurring) (describing federal courts’ “ignominious history”); see also Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U.S. 235, 250 (1970).

See Roosevelt (1935) noting these functions “should not be confused.”

The five-member commission is now comprised of only two members: Republican Chair Andrea Lucas and Democratic Commissioner Kalpana Kotagal. EEOC’s general counsel, Karla Gilbride, was also fired that same day. Former Commissioner Samuels has since filed a lawsuit.

The EEOC initiates most investigation in response to complaints filed by employees. Commissioners can file their own charge, but it would not be made public and would require the commissioner to provide evidence of discrimination under penalty of perjury. This is to prevent the Commission from seeking to intimidate employers through public pressure.

The organization has been warning for months about the catastrophic consequences that the deportations are having on their businesses.
ABIC is advocating for Congress to pass the Dignity Act, introduced by Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar.
Fifty-one percent of dairy industry workers are immigrants, as are 45% of meatpacking workers, and 29% of construction workers.
None of the proposals are close to being approved in Congress, but business leaders intend to continue their pressure to prevent business failures.","More than 100 business leaders from across the country have gathered in Washington, D.C. to ask members of Congress for help in the face of the Donald Trump administration’s mass deportations, which are leaving them without a workforce. On Wednesday, the executives will meet with several lawmakers to ask them, for the umpteenth time, to push through a reform that would facilitate work permits for undocumented immigrants, essential to the survival of their businesses but who are now failing to show up for work, either out of fear of being detained or because they have already been deported.

Under the slogan “Secure America’s Workforce,” the three-day mission was organized by the American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), a bipartisan coalition of more than 1,700 CEOs, business owners, and trade associations in 17 states. The organization has been warning for months about the catastrophic consequences that the deportations are having on their businesses. “Thanks to their efforts, lawmakers in Washington are hearing our message loud and clear: The U.S. economy cannot grow without legal avenues for the workers who power industries like construction, agriculture, hospitality, healthcare, and so on,” says Rebecca Shi, CEO of ABIC.

Eight million jobs

According to the coalition, there are eight million unfilled jobs across the country, which is increasing prices across the economy, from food to construction materials, and limiting access to everyday products and services for Americans.

ABIC is advocating for Congress to pass the Dignity Act, introduced by Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar.

The bill has been unsuccessfully introduced three times in Congress. The latest version, introduced in July, differs from the 2023 version in one important respect: it eliminates the path to citizenship. Instead, it offers “dignity” status, a permit to legally reside and work in the United States.

According to the proposal, to qualify for the permit, migrants must have been in the country for more than five years, have not committed any crimes, and pay a $7,000 fine for being undocumented. Additionally, as a penalty, the government will seize 1% of their wages for a period of seven years.

“This is a situation we need to change now,” Salazar declared Tuesday at a meeting with business leaders at a Washington, D.C., hotel, where she warned of the consequences the deportation campaign will have on the Republican Party in next year’s midterms. “We’re sending the wrong message that we don’t want those people here,” she stated. Salazar was applauded when she said that the current situation “is a mess” because employers are breaking the law by hiring undocumented immigrants, who, in turn, are in the country illegally. Salazar argued that they can’t do anything else because no one wants those jobs.

The fear of going to work and being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, along with the deportations already carried out, have emptied out farms, factories, and service sectors. The detention centers have not been filled with dangerous criminals, as Trump promised, but largely with workers who have spent many years building a life in the country.

The U.S. workforce shrank for three consecutive months in July, for the first time since 2010. The hardest hit sectors are those where workers are predominantly migrant. Fifty-one percent of dairy industry workers are immigrants, as are 45% of meatpacking workers, and 29% of construction workers.

Trump won the 2024 election thanks in part to the support he got from the Latino vote, which has historically been Democratic. For the first time in history, a majority of the Latino male electorate voted for the Republican candidate. The deportation campaign and the racial profiling used by immigration agents to carry out arrests, however, have eroded Hispanic support, and polls already show their discontent.

In next year’s midterm elections, the Republican Party is expected to suffer from Trump’s immigration policies. Salazar was born in the United States, but her parents are Cuban refugees, and her vision of immigration differs from the more extreme positions of the Republican Party, which supports the expulsion of all undocumented immigrants.

Rubén Gallego and the Democrats’ mistake

Similarly, Arizona’s Democratic Senator, Rubén Gallego, is distancing himself from his own party’s position. Gallego, born in the United States to immigrant parents (a Colombian mother and a Mexican father), also introduced his own immigration reform bill in May. The senator addressed business leaders who arrived in Washington yesterday to explain that the Democratic Party has a misconception that Latinos are liberal when it comes to open borders and immigration. Gallego asserted that those who live near the border with Mexico advocate for stricter control, and that Democrats have lost votes for believing otherwise. “My party was wrong because it was uncomfortable about hearing what those who live on the border were saying.” “Although Donald Trump had the most extreme position on the border, it was closer to that of the average voter than to the Democratic position,” he added.

One of the pillars of his proposal is to strengthen border control. The other pillar advocates granting citizenship to Dreamers, migrants who came to the United States as children, although he advocates taking it slowly when negotiating with Republicans.

In his opinion, his party’s “big mistake” has been calling for a complete overhaul of the current system. “We can’t bring 11 million people out of the shadows and give them a path to citizenship,” he asserts. In his state, Latinos make up more than a third of the workforce, and paid $700 million in taxes. Yet, it’s one of the states where ICE has most heavily targeted immigrants.

Gallego wants a more moderate approach, moving forward little by little on the immigration agenda to reach an agreement with the Trump administration. “We have to find a middle ground. Maybe we don’t have to grant them citizenship, but rather let them remain legally in the country, pay taxes, and avoid being deported,” he suggests as a way to negotiate with Republicans.

At the time of her abduction, she had over 93,000 followers on Facebook, where she would post criticism of abuses by the Myanmar junta following the February 2021 military coup.
It also stated that it had sought assistance from the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, to inform Myanmar junta authorities of the family’s disappearance.
Civil society supporting Myanmar nationals in Malaysia, including UNHCR-registered refugees, told Human Rights Watch of growing fears of arrest and forced returns.
The Myanmar junta has arrested an estimated 30,000 activists, journalists, humanitarian workers, and others since the coup, including thousands under the Counter-Terrorism Law.","(Bangkok) – The Malaysian government should press Myanmar’s junta for the immediate release of a refugee family abducted from Kuala Lumpur in July 2023, Human Rights Watch said today. More than two years after her disappearance, Myanmar junta authorities announced on October 17, 2025, that they were detaining Thuzar Maung, a Myanmar pro-democracy activist, along with her husband and three children.

The junta said that Thuzar Maung, 48, and her family members were arrested for “illegally reentering” Myanmar and that an arrest warrant had been issued for her under Myanmar’s counterterrorism law in January 2023. Malaysian authorities should urgently reopen their investigation into the abduction of Thuzar Maung and her family from their home in Kuala Lumpur, which may amount to transnational repression, a cross-border violation of human rights against a country’s nationals.

“The Malaysian authorities should publicly press Myanmar’s junta to free Thuzar Maung and her family and investigate how this prominent refugee ended up in Myanmar,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Malaysian government is failing to protect refugees at risk, including children, and the role of Myanmar’s junta and possibly other governments needs to be fully explored and brought to light.”

Thuzar Maung is a longtime advocate for democracy in Myanmar and for refugee and migrant rights in Malaysia. She fled Myanmar for Malaysia in 2015 to escape growing violence against Muslims. The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, recognized her and her family as refugees. At the time of her abduction, she had over 93,000 followers on Facebook, where she would post criticism of abuses by the Myanmar junta following the February 2021 military coup.

The junta reported that the Myittha Township Court in Mandalay Region had issued an arrest warrant for Thuzar Maung under the junta-amended section 52(a) of the Counter-Terrorism Law and section 512 of the Criminal Procedure Code for providing support to the opposition National Unity Government, which it has declared as a “terrorist organization.” Section 52(a) carries a prison sentence of three to seven years.

The announcement includes a photo allegedly of the five family members in custody with their eyes blacked out. It states that action will be taken “against those living abroad contacting terrorist groups, opposing the state, and providing financial support to terrorist groups.” No information was provided regarding the date of their arrest, any legal proceedings against the family, or where they are being held, meaning they remain forcibly disappeared.

On July 4, 2023, unidentified men abducted Thuzar Maung with her husband, Saw Than Tin Win, and her daughter and two sons from their home in Ampang Jaya, Kuala Lumpur. A friend on the phone with Thuzar Maung at the time heard her yell that unknown men were entering the house, before being disconnected. CCTV footage captured a car with fake license plates entering their gated community before the call and exiting three hours later, at which point all of the family’s phones had been turned off.

On July 21, 2023, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and other UN experts wrote to the Malaysian government, urging the authorities “to urgently advance an immediate, impartial, thorough, and transparent investigation of the alleged enforced disappearance” of the family. The working group expressed concern that Thuzar Maung had been targeted for her human rights activism and that the risk of forcible return “would put their personal safety, liberty, integrity and life in danger and expose her to the serious risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, summary execution, and lack of a fair trial.”

In September, the Malaysian government responded that the police investigation had found no physical evidence or witness testimony to suggest that the family was abducted or forcibly disappeared and that there was no record of their leaving the country. Instead, Malaysia detailed the family’s alleged history of leaving rental houses without notice. It also stated that it had sought assistance from the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, to inform Myanmar junta authorities of the family’s disappearance.

Since the 2021 coup, Malaysian authorities have summarily deported thousands of asylum seekers to Myanmar despite the risk to their lives and freedom, without assessing their asylum claims or other protection needs. Immigration raids and arrests have surged over the past year, with 34,000 between January and mid-May alone.

Malaysian authorities have forcibly returned foreign nationals, including asylum seekers and refugees, at the request of their home governments. Governments wrongfully designating nationals living abroad as “terrorists” reflect what UN experts said was their “profound concern regarding the reported rise in transnational repression” across Southeast Asia. Civil society supporting Myanmar nationals in Malaysia, including UNHCR-registered refugees, told Human Rights Watch of growing fears of arrest and forced returns.

The Myanmar junta has arrested an estimated 30,000 activists, journalists, humanitarian workers, and others since the coup, including thousands under the Counter-Terrorism Law. With millions of Myanmar nationals having fled the country, the junta has engaged in transnational repression to crack down on activists outside its borders, such as requesting deportations, revoking passports, and conducting digital surveillance.

Malaysia is this year’s chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the ASEAN summit and related events starting October 26 in Kuala Lumpur, ASEAN members and partners should urge Malaysia to reopen the investigation into Thuzar Maung’s disappearance and, more broadly, to end its abusive treatment of migrants and refugees. ASEAN as a bloc should ensure that regional instruments enshrine the rights of refugees, dissidents, activists, and other targets of transnational repression.

“ASEAN members and partners at the Kuala Lumpur summit should work together to bring an end to horrific crimes of transnational repression in the region,” Pearson said. “Refugees like Thuzar Maung and her family should be safe from harm, and Malaysia and other countries need to act to deter further efforts by the junta to abduct and disappear Myanmar refugees.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2023/07/202307asia_malaysia_thuzarmaung.jpg?h=ecd035fb&itok=zh0otq2U,N,,2025-10-22 10:16:50.389085

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the incident.
Los Angeles police officers were providing outer perimeter traffic control, the FBI said.
But activists and protesters have decried what they call heavy-handed policing in Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.
The incidents have also raised security concerns for ICE agents, attorneys, judges, and migrants, USA TODAY previously reported.","A man was shot in the elbow, and a deputy U.S. Marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet during an immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles on the morning of Oct. 21, the Department of Homeland Security said.

The shooting occurred in downtown Los Angeles during what the DHS described as a ""targeted traffic enforcement stop."" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS, said the U.S. Marshals Service was assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting a traffic stop of a man who had entered the country illegally.

McLaughlin, who noted that the investigation remains ongoing and information was preliminary, said federal immigration agents and the U.S. Marshals Service had pulled the man over using a ""standard law enforcement procedure."" The man then ""weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee,"" according to McLaughlin.

""Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,"" McLaughlin said in a statement on X.

The man was shot in the elbow while attempting to flee from the scene, and the deputy U.S. Marshal was injured by a ricochet bullet, McLaughlin said. Both the deputy marshal and the suspect were transported to the hospital.

The DHS did not provide further details on what procedure ICE agents used or when the man entered the United States, but McLaughlin said he had previously escaped from custody and had attempted to evade arrest before.

Federal, local agencies investigating incident

The U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement that its Central District of California office was involved in a ""line-of-duty shooting"" on Oct. 21, in which a deputy marshal sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The deputy marshal was in stable condition, according to the agency.

The agency said it will not release the identities of the deputy marshals involved in shooting incidents ""until the conclusion of all investigations surrounding the incident."" The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the incident.

The FBI said in a statement that its Evidence Response Team was processing the scene. It added that it was working with the U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security, and the LAPD.

FBI agents were not involved in the incident, according to the agency. Los Angeles police officers were providing outer perimeter traffic control, the FBI said.

Shooting comes amid tensions over federal immigration crackdown

The incident comes amid growing tensions in major U.S. cities over President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown. McLaughlin attributed the shooting to the ""conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.""

But activists and protesters have decried what they call heavy-handed policing in Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.

Los Angeles County has been at the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In June, Trump sent the National Guard and U.S. Marines into the city to protect federal buildings and protect ICE agents as they carried out raids, prompting widespread protests.

The protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district. The raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants, including at workplaces, traffic stops, and routine legal check-ins.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the leading critics of Trump's immigration crackdown, signed legislation in September that would prevent ICE officers from wearing masks to hide their identities. Critics of mask-wearing say it stifles accountability.

White House officials previously said ICE agents have experienced an increase in assaults. Over the summer, videos circulating on social media showed increasingly violent confrontations between masked federal agents and civilians seeking to document or prevent arrests.

Following recent ICE attacks, including a deadly shooting at a facility in Dallas in September, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to strengthen security at ICE facilities. The incidents have also raised security concerns for ICE agents, attorneys, judges, and migrants, USA TODAY previously reported.

As The New York Times’s Tony Romm reports, the Trump administration has “stretched its authority” to pay some workers, despite a lack of approval for the payments from Congress, which controls spending under the Constitution.
Legal scholars have questioned the White House’s drive to expand its power over spending, largely at the expense of Congress, but the Trump administration argues that the shutdown fundamentally alters the rules.
The general counsel of the White House budget office said that under normal circumstances, the executive branch cannot shift funds from one account to another, Romm reports.
Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, told Politico that he wants the White House to follow the established rules.","Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not receiving paychecks due to the government shutdown, but the White House has promised to pay some favored categories of employees such as servicemembers and immigration officials by shifting federal funds around in highly unorthodox — and potentially illegal — ways.

As The New York Times’s Tony Romm reports, the Trump administration has “stretched its authority” to pay some workers, despite a lack of approval for the payments from Congress, which controls spending under the Constitution.

To pay members of the military, Trump has tapped $8 billion from a special fund dedicated to research and development of weaponry while giving the Pentagon approval to use any leftover funds to meet payroll. To pay immigration agents and other law enforcement officials, the White House has turned to a $10 billion fund dedicated to border protection that was created by the massive tax and policy law last summer — though those paychecks have not yet been issued. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media last week that more than 70,000 federal agents will receive “super” paychecks on October 22 that cover all hours worked during the shutdown.

Legal scholars have questioned the White House’s drive to expand its power over spending, largely at the expense of Congress, but the Trump administration argues that the shutdown fundamentally alters the rules. The general counsel of the White House budget office said that under normal circumstances, the executive branch cannot shift funds from one account to another, Romm reports. But during the shutdown, the lapse in funding means that payment accounts no longer exist, the administration argues, giving the executive branch more leeway to use existing funds as it sees fit.

More broadly, the Trump administration and many of its conservative supporters argue that the executive branch should have far more power than it has claimed over the last few decades, including the right to freeze or redirect spending authorized by Congress.

Although pushback from Congress on the issue has been modest, some lawmakers are raising questions about Trump’s reprogramming of funds. “Look, I want the troops to be paid,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said, per Politico. “But, as usual, they find the most illegal way to do everything.”

Some Republicans are concerned, as well. Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, told Politico that he wants the White House to follow the established rules. While paying troops is “a desired outcome,” Moran said, “there’s a process that’s required — by Constitution and by law — for Congress to be not only consulted but engaged.”

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another appropriator, also called on the White House to play by the rules. “There’s a way we take care of this,” she said. “It’s called appropriations. It’s called reprogramming. And I don’t think that process is being respected.”",https://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/cdn/ff/RSBUk1de-XlZOCza_RRy9jLbVs2qzbWwMNB9EvJKIvs/1759217797/:relative:/themes/custom/tftng_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-22 10:56:48.091953

The shutdown’s funding squeeze is officially hampering the court system.

The creeping effects of the 21-day-old government shutdown are threatening court delays and shuttering some courthouses, all of which could lead to unpredictable disruptions in a number of cases against Trump administration policies, among others.

The federal judiciary on Monday ran out of funding to maintain the normal operations and work of roughly 30,000 staffers, two support agencies, 13 regional appeals courts and 94 district courts. Some courts are furloughing staff for the first time in three decades, requiring others to work without pay, and even operating under a limited, four-day-a-week schedule.

Beginning this week, the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama is no longer open on Fridays. Nor is the clerk’s office for the federal district court in Connecticut, which is currently fielding one of several lawsuits challenging the administration’s moves to revoke visas from some foreign students.

The courts, like federal agencies, can require “essential” employees, such as judges’ staff, to work without pay. Judges themselves cannot be furloughed or be required to work without pay, but some say they are worried that funding shortfalls will hobble ongoing casework.

The “dedicated public servants, who allow those who seek redress prompt access to Court, are now feeling the pain of their paychecks being suspended and facing difficult financial decisions to keep their families afloat because of the shutdown,” VIRGINIA KENDALL, Chief Judge of the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Friday. “I am concerned that the lack of appropriation will create delays in the Court’s ability to ensure timely justice.”

Kendall’s district and the Eastern District of Kentucky have paused civil cases involving the government, citing the effects of the shutdown within the executive branch, where attorneys are also either furloughed or working without pay. The Northern Illinois federal court is currently assessing a challenge to President DONALD TRUMP’s planned National Guard deployments.

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, said that it would run out of funding Oct. 18, but anticipates minimal disruptions for the time being, at least when it comes to the court’s business. The itineraries of tourists and civics nerds face a worse fate: The Supreme Court building “will be closed to the public until further notice,” but the court’s official business will continue normally, said PATRICIA McCABE, the court’s public information officer.

Historically, the judiciary has managed to operate normally during shutdowns by dipping into money collected via court fees and relying on “carryover” funds from previous fiscal years. That’s how the judiciary generally maintained operations throughout the longest government shutdown recorded: the 35-day closure during Trump’s first term.

But this time around, those funds only kept courts operating for about 20 days, after going several years without budget increases. And there’s still no clear path out of the impasse Democrats and Republicans have reached in budget negotiations.

Although a number of federal courts have affirmed that they will keep “essential” services running normally, that will become less feasible as the shutdown stretches on — and as courts continue to rely on skeleton crews working without pay.

Without a deal to reopen the government, we may soon see more of the same impacts on some courts that we saw during the 1996 and 2014 shutdowns: postponing deadlines en masse; rescheduling arguments because government attorneys were unable to attend; refusing to begin new civil jury trials; and operating on condensed criminal calendars.

POTUS PUZZLER

Which former president took up oil painting in his post-presidency?

(Answer at bottom.)

The Oval

THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE: Everyone’s gotten it before: You remind me of DARTH VADER.

But not everyone has received that compliment (?) from the president of the United States himself. “We have Darth Vader. You know Darth Vader, right?” Trump said at a lunch for Senate Republicans at the Rose Garden today. “Darth Vader is a man who … I think he’s sitting there. Is that Darth? Stand up, Darth.” Of course, he was talking about White House budget chief RUSS VOUGHT.

“They call him Darth Vader. I call him a fine man.”

ABOUT THOSE BLUE SLIPS: Also at the lunch, Trump pressured Republican senators to change a long-standing Senate practice related to how lawmakers vet U.S. attorney nominees, our ALEX GANGITANO reports. “You know, I have 10 U.S. attorneys who are phenomenal,” Trump said at the lunch. “And the problem is, they’re not going to ever be confirmed, I guess. I put them in, they’ll be there for three or four months, whatever it is, and then they have to leave.”

The practice Trump was bemoaning, called a “blue slip,” essentially allows senators to veto nominees to district courts and U.S. attorneys’ offices from their states by not returning a paper called a “blue slip.” This decades-old custom has been used by senators from both parties and was created to empower home-state senators to weigh in on judicial nominees that will hold sway over their constituents.

SEE YOU NEXT TIME: Trump’s second summit with Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN is off, our ELI STOKOLS and DIANA NEROZZI report. The White House said today that the planned meeting in Budapest Trump announced just last week after his two-hour phone call with Putin was no longer in the works after Secretary of State MARCO RUBIO spoke Monday with Russian Foreign Minister SERGEY LAVROV.

“Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call,” said a White House official granted anonymity to discuss the plans. “Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.”

Agenda Setting

BRING OUT THE BRINKS: Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him about $230 million in what he claims are damages related to various federal investigations that have probed him, according to people familiar with the matter. Those people, cited anonymously, added that any settlement might ultimately be approved by senior department officials who defended him or those in his orbit, NYT’s DEVLIN BARRETT and TYLER PAGER report.

Trump submitted complaints through an administrative claims process that often is the precursor to lawsuits. The first claim, lodged in late 2023, seeks damages for a number of purported violations of his rights, including those related to the FBI and special counsel investigation into Russian election tampering and possible connections to the 2016 Trump campaign. The second complaint, filed in the summer of 2024, accuses the FBI of violating Trump’s privacy by searching Mar-a-Lago in 2022 for classified documents.

“What a travesty,” said Pace University ethics professor BENNETT L. GERSHMAN. “The ethical conflict is just so basic and fundamental, you don’t need a law professor to explain it.”

QUESTIONS QUESTIONS: The Trump administration imposed a new annual $100 fee on asylum seekers earlier this summer. But more than three months later, immigrants and their attorneys say they can’t figure out whether they owe the money or how to pay the fee, our MYAH WARD reports. Immigration attorneys and advocates say it’s another example of how the administration’s efforts to curb legal pathways for immigrants have trapped people in a bureaucratic maze.

The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. The White House deferred to the agencies implementing the policy. But in a court filing late Monday in federal district court, DOJ lawyers defended the fees and said the agencies are moving to finalize the policy’s implementation.

THE INGRASSIA FALLOUT: Senate Majority Leader JOHN THUNE said Monday he hopes the White House withdraws PAUL INGRASSIA’s Office of Special Counsel nomination, after POLITICO reported on texts that showed him making racist remarks to fellow Republicans, our HAILEY FUCHS reports. “He’s not gonna pass,” the senator told reporters. Ingrassia is scheduled to testify on his nomination Thursday before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

At least three other Republicans are signaling they will oppose his confirmation: Sens. RICK SCOTT of Florida, RON JOHNSON of Wisconsin and JAMES LANKFORD of Oklahoma. “I’m not supporting him,” Scott said. “I can’t imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country. It’s wrong.”

“I have tons of questions for him,” Lankford said, adding he “can’t imagine supporting that.”

Musk Radar

HE’S BACK: A spat over the future of NASA under the Trump administration unfolded on social media today, with ELON MUSK panning Transportation Secretary SEAN DUFFY as having a “2 digit IQ” and advocating for his ally JARED ISAACMAN to run the space agency in a string of posts, our GREGORY SVIRNOVSKIY reports. “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?” Musk asked in a poll on X, referencing Duffy’s prior career as a professional lumberjack athlete.

One of the listed choices: “Noo, he need moar brainz!” (Isaacman had his chance at the post, but Trump pulled the nomination in May because, Trump said, he’d discovered Isaacman was a “blue-blooded Democrat.”)

WHO'S IN, WHO’S OUT

ARMY FILLS A SPOT: Trump has selected Defense Secretary PETE HEGSETH’s senior military assistant to be the Army’s second-most senior officer, shuttling a close aide to the Pentagon chief to an influential — and more senior — position in the ranks, our CONNOR O’BRIEN reports. Army Lt. Gen. CHRISTOPHER LaNEVE was nominated for the Army vice chief of staff position on Monday, according to a Senate notice, and would be promoted to the rank of four-star general if confirmed.

You guessed it: GEORGE W. BUSH. After leaving office in 2009, Bush took up oil painting at his Texas ranch. The former president displayed 64 full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by Bush of military members, which ran at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas.

In 2013, he also painted a 20 x 18” oil portrait of Putin.

Normally, the Court decides cases based on a thorough briefing and arguments that culminate in written decisions that clearly lay out the majority’s reasoning. This allows the public to evaluate the Court’s justifications and imposes discipline on the justices’ decision-making processes.

The shadow docket provides a fast-track process for the Court to hear emergency applications, which typically involve requests that the Court temporarily lift lower court orders. Historically, this process was used infrequently and limited to instances where an applicant faced serious irreparable harm, such as a death row inmate facing execution. Shadow docket cases usually involve limited briefing, no oral argument, and rulings with little or no analysis of the Court’s reasoning.

The Court is now using the shadow docket at an unprecedented rate for lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s most controversial actions. In its first 20 weeks, the second Trump administration made as many shadow docket applications — 19 — that the Biden administration made over four years, according to an analysis by Georgetown Professor Stephen Vladeck. The Obama and George W. Bush administrations combined made only 8 requests over 16 years.

The Trump administration has prevailed in the vast majority of its requests for emergency action, as the data below shows. These rulings have allowed administration policies to move forward after lower courts had found that the administration’s actions were likely illegal. While the Court’s shadow docket decisions are not a final ruling on the legal merits, there is still significant impact on the people affected while the case remains pending, which is why the lower courts had issued their orders in the first place. Among other things, the Court’s shadow docket rulings have led to mass firings of civil servants, the defunding of scientific research, and racial profiling in immigration sweeps.

The lack of reasoning in most shadow docket rulings also leaves lower courts with little guidance about how to address similar issues in other cases.

A clear pattern has emerged: The Court is using the shadow docket to quickly and dramatically expand executive power. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent, “Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars. Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”

This resource tracks cases on the Supreme Court’s shadow docket that relate to the administration’s policies and practices. It notes whether the Court has decided to rule in favor of the administration at least partially and whether the majority offered any reasoning for its decision. It also includes notable commentary from justices about the use of the shadow docket.

Since January 20, 2025, the Supreme Court has issued 22 decisions on the shadow docket concerning administration actions.

19 ruled for the administration at least partially

3 ruled against the administration

7 were not accompanied by any written explanation (most other rulings included only brief analysis, sometimes as short as a sentence)

Three shadow docket applications are currently pending.

Methodology: The cases below had applications that were filed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket starting January 20, 2025. Almost all of the emergency applications were brought by the Department of Justice. Only one case was brought by a group of people seeking to urgently halt government action. The source of the information is the Supreme Court’s website, as well as information collected by SCOTUSblog and Shadow Docket Watch. A spreadsheet of the data is available here.

Note: The assessment of whether the Court provided a written explanation includes cases where that explanation is scant but nonetheless still offers some modicum of a rationale. In other words, a “Yes” does not necessarily indicate a comprehensive explanation for the Court’s decision. Two applications were ultimately withdrawn by the government: Trump v.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “For a cautionary tale about lawmaking on the emergency docket, look no further than this newest iteration. By today’s order, an evenly divided Court neuters judicial review of grant terminations by sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.”

—Justice Jackson

“This Court often addresses requests for interim relief — sometimes pending a writ of certiorari . . . and sometimes after a writ of certiorari is granted. . . . And either way, when this Court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts. Of course, decisions regarding interim relief are not necessarily conclusive as to the merits because further litigation may follow. But regardless of a decision’s procedural posture, its reasoning — its ratio decidendi — carries precedent weight in future cases” (internal quotations and citations omitted).

Commentary about the shadow docket: “When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary’s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it. . . .

Issue: Whether lower court judges could issue nationwide injunctions that barred the federal government from enforcing its executive order ending birthright citizenship

Concurrences and dissents: Concurrence by Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Gorsuch. Concurrence by Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas. Concurrence by Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson. Justice Jackson dissented.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “By needlessly granting the Government’s emergency application to prohibit universal injunctions, the Court has cleared a path for the Executive to choose law-free action at this perilous moment for our Constitution — right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s constraints.”

A federal raid in New York City’s Chinatown targeting criminal activity tied to the alleged sale of counterfeit goods turned chaotic Friday as protesters clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, prompting city officials to say they had no role in the operation.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that ICE and federal partners conducted a ""targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation"" on Canal Street focused on criminal activity related to the sale of alleged counterfeit goods.

""During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties, including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,"" McLaughlin wrote in a statement. ""Already, one rioter has been arrested for assault on a federal officer.""

During a news conference Tuesday night, Murad Awawdeh, vice president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said between 15 and 40 vendors were arrested, and at least two locals were taken into custody for protesting and blocking their arrest efforts.

City officials quickly moved to distance themselves from the raid.

Mayor Eric Adams’ press secretary, Kayla Mamelak Altus, told Fox News that New York City ""never cooperates with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, in accordance with local laws,"" and had ""no involvement in this matter.""

""Mayor Adams has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue the American Dream should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,"" she said.

City officials said police were monitoring the situation near Canal Street and 26 Federal Plaza but had ""matters under control."" However, if circumstances were to escalate and an individual assaults or interferes with a legal law enforcement action, a source said Adams instructed the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to intervene.

The source added there have been numerous multi-agency enforcement actions on Canal Street this year, and any illegal activity should be addressed by the NYPD.

""We saw what looked like tanks in our streets,"" said Jumaane Williams, a New York City public advocate. ""We saw people who were armed and in tactical gear for vendors, which was planned. Many of you actually got advance notice that this was going to happen. They were targeting, in this case, Black vendors on Canal Street. That's what occurred… None of this is about public safety. It is about fear and chaos.""

He added that what gives him hope is that, in a few months, he believes ""we are going to have a mayor who actually cares about New Yorkers and who will be here joined with us.""

When ICE appeals, a federal rule kicks in that automatically blocks the person’s release on bond while the appeal is pending.
Filing a habeas corpus petition from immigration detention is extremely difficult.","Immigrants in detention and their loved ones and legal representatives are facing desperation and sheer exhaustion. Through a series of legal, policy and bureaucratic machinations, the Trump administration is ensuring there is almost no way out of immigration detention other than death or deportation.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has long held some people in detention without giving them a chance to ask for release on bond – a practice called “mandatory detention.” Earlier this year, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, which expanded mandatory detention. As of October 2025, ICE has made major policy changes to expand it even further, and the immigration appeals court at the Department of Justice has signed off. The result: ICE is arresting, detaining, and refusing to release far more people than before, including many vulnerable people who were rarely detained in the past. Read below how these policy changes are harming people and who is impacted.

How is ICE ensuring that people are locked up without due process?

Indiscriminate arrests and abandonment of charging discretion: The Supreme Court has long held that ICE can choose whether or not to arrest someone and begin a deportation case. Recent ICE policy guidance, however, now tells officers they must start a deportation case for anyone they arrest – whether at the border or inside the United States. ICE is also no longer following policies that limited enforcement against people with humanitarian and medical concerns, such as pregnant women and primary caregivers.

Declaring long-time U.S. residents ineligible for bond: In July, ICE issued a policy memo declaring that anyone who originally entered the United States without permission – no matter how long they’ve lived here – is not allowed to even ask for release from detention on bond. This goes against existing law, which says that people arrested and detained inside the United States by ICE should be able to ask for bond. On September 5th, the immigration appeals court in the Department of Justice agreed with ICE’s position in a case called Matter of Yajure Hurtado. But dozens of federal district courts have disagreed with ICE’s misguided interpretation of the law in response to individual legal challenges brought through habeas petitions.

Refusing to exercise discretion for those who remain eligible for release: Even with all these changes, some people in ICE detention – especially those who came to the U.S. with valid visas – can still ask for bond. In other cases, ICE still has the power to release someone through a process called parole. However, ICE has rolled out new policies that basically follow a “detain until deport” approach. This approach takes away local officers’ ability to decide whether someone should be released and requires approval from ICE headquarters. This makes officers less likely to decide to release, because they know their decisions will be reviewed and possibly blocked by headquarters.

Routinely appealing when an Immigration Judge determines a person should be released, keeping the person trapped in detention: In the rare cases where an Immigration Judge decides someone can be released on bond, ICE is regularly appealing the bond decision. When ICE appeals, a federal rule kicks in that automatically blocks the person’s release on bond while the appeal is pending. In other words, even if a person can pay their bond and be released, they will be stuck in detention during the appeal. By the time the appeal is finished, the person has often been deported or their case has ended in another way.

Can anyone get released from immigration detention?

Very few people can. For most, the only real option for release is to ask a federal court judge to step in through a habeas corpus petition. But this option is inaccessible for most.

Filing a habeas corpus petition from immigration detention is extremely difficult. It involves complex procedural and legal steps, and about 80% of people in detention do not have lawyers to help them. Many immigration lawyers are not trained in habeas work because it has not been a common part of their practice before. When someone does manage to file a habeas petition, ICE often engages in a cat and mouse game by moving the person to a different location, exhausting and demoralizing detained individuals already separated from their loved ones.

Who is getting stuck in detention?

ICE’s indiscriminate and sweeping use of detention has even stunned loyal Trump supporters, leaving no one safe from losing their freedom.

This year, ICE arrested and detained:

U.S. citizens

Minors

Green card holders and others with legal status (like Temporary Protected Status)

DACA recipients

Journalists

Veterans and their immigrant family members (including U.S. citizen veterans)

People whose cases have been terminated by a judge

People with disabilities — for whom ICE then denies basic accommodations

Medically vulnerable individuals, including those with brain tumors and cancer

Pregnant people and nursing mothers

Grandmothers while gardening

People with U.S. citizen children, triggering a child mental health crisis in the U.S.

Long-time residents

High school students going to volleyball practice, walking the dog, reporting to their immigration court hearings, and one just weeks from graduation.

Prolonged detention has devastating consequences.

We can’t lose sight of how serious it is when the government takes away someone’s liberty. Detention separates people from their children, loved ones, and livelihoods. It destabilizes communities and leaves families struggling to pay their bills. In some cases, detention is a death sentence: suicide attempts are common and at least 20 people have died in detention since Trump took office.

The Trump administration knows that detaining people in harsh conditions makes them more likely to give up their rights and agree to deportation, even if they have a strong legal case. One former ICE official has already said he expects “legitimate lawsuits” due to horrific conditions. Research shows that the stress and hopelessness of detention often causes people to abandon their fight to stay in the United States.

Take action

NILC urges Members of Congress to work closely with legal service providers and mutual aid organizations in their states and districts and to engage actively in supporting constituents facing unjust and prolonged detention. It is critical to bear witness, amplify the stories of those harmed, and keep pushing for people to be released. We cannot let ICE carry out these abuses.",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cropped-SEO-Image.png,N,,2025-10-22 00:16:58.372097

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and the Public Citizen Litigation Group filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge the new rule, calling it a threat to the livelihood of immigrants.

The rule changes from DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, now in effect, limit which non-citizens can get CDLs: 194,000 of approximately 200,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders, under the rule's terms, will have their CDLs revoked or lapse without renewal possibility in the next two years.

“Asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization are barred from holding commercial driver’s licenses based on their immigration status,” a press release on the AFT’s website elaborated.

The new lawsuit, ""Rivera Lujan v. FMCSA,"" takes its plaintiff's name from a DACA recipient and owner-operator. The suit “will challenge both the substance of the rule and FMCSA’s failure to follow rulemaking procedures required by law,"" according to the release.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Lujan in the release. Lujan has lived in the United States since he was two years old. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government,"" he continued.

Issuing the final rule, FMCSA detailed five deadly crashes involving non-domiciled CDL drivers as basis for an emergency action, declaring a final rule without first posting notice and going through comment periods on the Federal Register before implementation. FMCSA also cited national security concerns attached to having foreign CDL holders operating big trucks.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

The lawsuit also cites an asylum seeker who joined the suit as depending on truck driving to support his family. “I’ve endured tremendous hardship but have fought to rebuild my life through trucking. For me and so many others, this rule will be a tragedy, destroying years of sacrifice and honest work,” the asylum seeker said.

Overdrive reporting has found dozens of comments echoing those from non-domiciled CDL holders already filed to the federal register under the new rule.

DOT responded to those claims by saying the rule focused on ensuring the safety of America’s roads.

[Related: Non-domiciled drivers say DOT's new rule violates their civil rights]

“The rule on non-domiciled CDLs is about safety and the integrity of the CDL issuing process. It’s really that simple,"" a DOT spokesperson said. ""The rule ensures that anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle is properly identified, vetted, and licensed under U.S. law to protect the safety of everyone traveling on American roads.”

Non-domiciled CDL applicants do not provide three years' worth of motor vehicle records when applying for a CDLs. Furthermore, people who arrive undetected across the southern border do not undergo a criminal history check, and those people sometimes go on to seek asylum.

Harjinder Singh, the driver behind the triple-fatal Florida turnpike U-turn crash, was an asylum seeker who previously had a deportation order, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Overdrive readers, polled in June, expressed support for banning CDLs for non-citizens, with 64% in favor. Survey respondents cited safety and economic fairness concerns.

Under President Donald Trump, the executive branch has sought to mandate English language proficiency for truck drivers and its Department of Homeland Security has reported apprehending dozens of “illegal alien” drivers, or drivers who entered the country illegally. However, many people legally in the country also hold CDLs and visas, and therefore would have been vetted, as the comments under the new rule on the Federal Register show.

“The administration’s new rule prevents immigrants who are lawfully present in the country and authorized to work from supporting themselves and their families,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders.

The new rule, which impacts holders of all CDL classes, “disrupts essential services communities rely on,” Saunders continued. “Drivers who take our children to school, deliver food and medicine, and clean trash off the streets must have these commercial driver’s licenses, and denying them inflicts unnecessary pain on everyone their lives touch.”

DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, in the press conference announcing the new emergency rule, said that California had issued a Brazilian national a CDL with passenger and school bus endorsements that “was valid for months after his legal presence in America was expired.”

The AFT dismissed DOT’s justifications for the new rule.

“For the Trump administration, the cruelty is the point,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a spiteful and illegal rule issued with no justification except to hurt hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants with work authorization who only want to build a better life for themselves and their families. Many AFT members require a CDL to work as school bus drivers -- and right now we are seeing people turned away from training for these positions. Their American Dream will be dashed or deferred, all because of the pettiness of the president and his advisers.”

Tuesday’s Chinatown raid is not the first in the New York City area in recent weeks.
Notably, many Ice raids have come with documented violence.","Hundreds showed up to protests that broke out in New York City on Tuesday evening after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids related to “selling counterfeit goods” were conducted in the Chinatown neighborhood earlier in the day and resulted in an unknown number of people being detained.

Hours after federal agents descended on lower Manhattan, demonstrators were seen assembling near the 26 Federal Plaza Immigration Building where they believed detainees were taken. Many shouted chants including “Ice out of New York” and “No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Videos of the raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

“Is this worth the paycheck? Selling your soul?” one woman can be heard shouting at agents.

The raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

It was unclear how many people were detained in the raid, but a witness told the New York Daily News that he saw at least seven individuals taken into custody.

The Department of Homeland Security told the New York Times that the operation was “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, said the operation was led by the Ice agency, the FBI, US border patrol and others.

The Guardian has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment.

Murad Awawdeh, vice-president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, condemned the raid to reporters on Tuesday night and said that between 15 and 40 vendors were arrested. Awawdeh also noted that least two locals were taken into custody for protesting and blocking Ice’s efforts.

“You don’t see these scenes in democracy. You see them in fascist regimes,” Awawdeh told a crowd. “We need to continue to stand up and fight back.”

Local city council member Christopher Marte told the City that he too was alarmed by the agents’ conduct.

“The amount of weapons that they had on the street pointed at bystanders, something I’ve never seen in my life,” he said.

The NYPD distanced itself from the raids, tweeting that it had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal street this afternoon”. However, onlookers noted that NYPD riot cops appeared to arrest several people protesting the Ice raid.

Eric Adams, New York City’s mayor, quote-tweeted the NYPD’s missive and emphasized: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

“While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement. Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he wrote.

New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo shared similar notes of criticism, with Mamdani calling the raid “aggressive and reckless” and Cuomo calling it “more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety”.

Both men – and Kathy Hochul, New York governor – took aim at Donald Trump directly.

“[Donald Trump] claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst.’ Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street. You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” Hochul wrote.

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop,” wrote Mamdani.

“Today’s ICE raid in Chinatown was an abuse of federal power by the Trump administration,” wrote Cuomo.

New York City councilmember Shahana Hanif also condemned the Ice raids in a press conference, saying that politicians across the city and the state were resolutely opposed to Ice raids.

“We are against Ice’s blatantly violent tactics. Hordes of Ice agents showing up is unacceptable, immoral, unjust,” Hanif said.

Ice raids with masked agents and have become commonplace in immigrant enclaves across the country as have protests against them. Protests against Ice have brought federal crackdowns to cities including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.

Tuesday’s Chinatown raid is not the first in the New York City area in recent weeks. A 16 October raid in midtown Manhattan was the first known raid on a migrant shelter of the current Trump administration.

Notably, many Ice raids have come with documented violence. Ice has used extreme force in Chicago including pepper balling a priest, pepper-balling the inside of a journalist’s car, and body-slamming a US congressional candidate.

In New York, an Ice agent was “relieved of his duties” after body-slamming a woman to the ground in an immigration court house, but was reportedly back on the job shortly thereafter.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0e0565464beb2a2d54cc28859d85074bc10348/1221_0_1732_1386/master/1732.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9ca7e9548a24d498c57ee07bdcd0459d",N,,2025-10-21 23:21:31.903324

Without official documents, the attorneys said, Ms. L. families can’t show they have a right to be in the country if they’re stopped by law enforcement.","This story was originally published by KQED.

Seven years ago, the first Trump administration triggered global condemnation when news broke that it was forcibly separating children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico Border. The outcry led the administration to shutter the program, but thousands of families remained shattered.

The American Academy of Pediatrics called the policy “government-sanctioned child abuse.” Physicians who examined statements from many separated parents and children noted that most met the diagnostic criteria for major mental health disorders as a result of their experience at the border.

A class-action lawsuit followed, and the Biden administration later settled the case. In the settlement agreement, the federal government promised to repair some of the damage by reuniting the families in the U.S. and providing them with a path to asylum.

Now the second Trump administration is quietly abandoning that promise, putting thousands of once-separated families at risk of being split up a second time. At least four families have been deported already.

That’s according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the original lawsuit, known as Ms. L. v. ICE, on behalf of separated families. The ACLU filed a motion in federal court on Tuesday asking for the recently deported families to be returned to the U.S., alleging that at least one of the deportations violated an explicit court order.

It’s only one skirmish in a pitched battle that the ACLU and advocates across the country have been fighting since Trump was reelected. The organization said the settlement agreement is now in danger of unraveling.

Since April, the administration has chipped away at Ms. L. in a series of technical maneuvers that have profoundly impacted families covered by the settlement, according to ACLU filings. Most notably, the government pulled funding for services laid out in the agreement — like help navigating the complex immigration process, assistance with housing and medical costs, and mental health treatment. Defending its actions in court, government lawyers cited the president’s agenda to cut costs and purge contractors with diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

While the services were eventually restored, the families are still facing the consequences of the lapse, and the government has only continued to make things harder for them.

Despite orders from a judge to give Ms. L. class members more time to stay in the country legally while plodding through the asylum process, court filings say the administration has failed to demonstrate that it is doing so.

“It started off slowly, but now we’re seeing breach after breach” of the settlement agreement, said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney in the case. “The administration, while claiming the settlement is still in place, is trying to undermine it in various ways that will have the effect of allowing families to be reseparated and deported.”

It’s not unusual or improper for the government to renegotiate court-ordered settlement agreements, said David Super, an administrative law expert at Georgetown University who has litigated against both Democratic and Republican administrations. But, he said, it’s “extraordinary” for the government to change its policy before receiving permission from the court, as the DOJ has done in Ms. L. this year.

“When the government unilaterally stops complying, that’s not negotiation,” he said. “That’s contempt of court.”

The Department of Justice declined to answer questions about its challenges to the settlement agreement, saying it doesn’t comment on matters that are in litigation. But in hearings before Judge Dana M. Sabraw, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, DOJ attorneys have maintained that government agencies are “trying to meet their obligations under the settlement agreement,” and that the deportations are legal.

The California Newsroom also asked the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, how it avoids reseparating families that are entitled to protection under the Ms. L. agreement.

“ICE does not separate families,” an unnamed DHS spokesperson wrote in an email. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.”

Among those deported was a mother of five who was detained at a routine ICE check-in, along with her two youngest children, according to an ACLU court filing. The woman, whose family members had been separated during the first Trump presidency, had permission to stay in the United States under the terms of the settlement. She and the toddlers were deported to Honduras anyway, while the rest of their family was left behind in the U.S.

“My two youngest children cry for their father and siblings every day,” the woman, who was identified only by her initials, wrote in a declaration to the court. “It breaks my heart to see them in such pain.”

‘The sole purpose of causing them harm’

Upon approving the Ms. L. settlement agreement in December 2023, Sabraw called family separation “one of the most shameful chapters in the history of our country.”

For decades, the federal government rarely separated families at the border, often allowing them to stay in the country together while they pursued asylum. But soon after Trump took office in 2017, immigration officials began a coordinated effort to apprehend all adults who crossed without authorization, including those with children in tow. While adults were detained and deported, kids — some only a few months old — were placed in federal custody. They slept on the floors of makeshift detention centers and were later sent to other relatives or foster homes.

The Trump administration called the policy “zero tolerance.”

In its rush to scale up the campaign, the government lost track of which children belonged to which families. Anguished parents were kept in the dark about where immigration officials had taken their kids — and when they could see them again. Families remained separated for weeks, months, and in some cases even years. As many as 1,000 children, parents and guardians may still be separated today, according to the ACLU, which is struggling to locate and reunite them all.

Trump officials have said, both during and since “zero tolerance,” that the explicit purpose of family separation was to make the crossing so painful that it would discourage other families from trying.

The pain has lasted.

“These events caused by the government have integrated into the psyche,” said Alfonso Mercado, a psychologist in South Texas who has done clinical research and consulted as an expert witness in family separation cases at the border. The trauma, he added, makes it difficult for families to function as they struggle to move on with a new life in the U.S.

“We were intentionally tearing parents and kids from each other with the sole purpose of causing them harm,” said Sara Van Hofwegen of Acacia Center for Justice, the main contractor tasked with providing separated families with legal help. “Part of what the government did through Ms. L. was it promised to help people rebuild their lives and give them a small piece of redress for everything that they went through.”

In all, the Ms. L. settlement agreement applies to roughly 8,000 people, including close family members who were affected by the separation. California is home to the largest proportion — about 12% — of class members with known addresses, according to Acacia. The organization placed two of its eight contractors in California to manage the heavier caseload.

The vast majority of the families came to the U.S. seeking refuge from violence or persecution in their home countries, Van Hofwegen said. But before pursuing asylum cases, attorneys working with families through Acacia’s legal-services contract have helped them establish temporary immigration status and get permission to work, so they can support themselves and not worry about being deported during the asylum process, which can take years.

That work ground to a halt with little warning in April, when the Trump administration abruptly cut off funding for Acacia’s legal services.

Rolling back protections

Pulling the plug on the Acacia contract was only the first of a series of government steps that have made it more difficult for formerly separated families to stay in the U.S., according to the ACLU’s court filings and advocates who provide services to them.

In May, for example, the government stopped paying travel expenses for reuniting families. It also lets invoices pile up from an adjudicator who handles disputes about who qualifies for protections. Both services are required under the settlement agreement.

The next month, the DOJ let another contract lapse, this one with Oakland-based Seneca Family of Agencies, which provided mental health care, medical copays and general case management for separated families.

While the ACLU fought to get funding reinstated, some families couldn’t afford medications or access mental health care on their own. Some parents, who should have been flying to reunite with their children, were stuck in their home countries. One of the deported mothers searched for legal help to keep her family in the country, but none was available during the lapse of Acacia’s contract, according to the recent ACLU filing.

“One of the M.O.s of the Trump administration in this case has been to wait until there’s almost no time to fix things and then force us to rush into court,” said Gelernt, the ACLU attorney. “But while we’re litigating that issue, there’s this lapse in services.”

DOJ lawyers defended cutting off the Acacia contract by saying it would be cheaper for the agency to provide some legal services itself and let pro bono lawyers do the rest. The ACLU argued there aren’t enough private lawyers with the willingness and expertise to do that. The Justice Department also told the court that the government had only “temporarily paused” the travel and adjudication payments while officials reviewed the contracts for cost savings.

As for the checks the government stopped cutting to Seneca, the administration suggested the organization’s efforts to hire a diverse staff may have violated anti-discrimination laws, an allegation that Seneca rejected.

“We take pride in our compliance with civil rights and employment laws and have received no specific evidence of any violations,” Seneca wrote in a June statement. “Should such information emerge, we would welcome the opportunity to review and address it.”

In four separate orders throughout the summer, Sabraw found the government was in breach of the settlement agreement by withholding funding for services. After a series of failed attempts to push back, the DOJ finally reinstated the Acacia and Seneca contracts and paid for the other lapsed services.

Advocates say they welcome the reversal, but don’t expect the government to give up its fight against the settlement agreement.

“While we’re really grateful that our contract is reinstated and that people are getting services,” Acacia’s Van Hofwegen said, “we’re prepared for ongoing attempts to roll back protections for class members.”

‘In real jeopardy’

In fact, while Acacia and Seneca scramble to rebuild teams they were forced to lay off during the lapse in services, slog through their backlog of cases and attempt to reach families they’d turned away, the government has continued to undermine the settlement agreement and fight the court on multiple fronts.

Last month, it challenged Sabraw’s standing order that requires DHS to notify the ACLU within 24 hours if it detains anyone covered by the settlement agreement, and to provide a list of those already in ICE custody or required to check in with the agency. The DOJ told Sabraw that following the orders would be too “operationally challenging,” and in early September, it appealed them in the 9th Circuit. The case is not scheduled to be heard until December.

Meanwhile, the ACLU remains in the dark about how many Ms. L. families are at risk of being swept up by immigration enforcement.

“Everyone’s entitled to notice and everyone’s entitled to good faith in the exercise of their contractual rights,” Sabraw told DOJ lawyers during a July 17 hearing. “The fear, of course, is that the government is detaining and removing people, and to the extent they fall within the corners of the settlement agreement, it seems to me it would have an obligation, no matter how burdensome, to get it right.”

The DOJ also recently opened an entirely new objection to the settlement agreement, arguing that noncitizens applying for legal status — including Ms. L. families — should pay hundreds of dollars in fees per person and be required to reapply annually, as laid out in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July. Under the settlement agreement, applying should be free and status should last for three years at a time, according to an ACLU court filing.

In declarations filed with the court, legal services providers wrote that nearly 30 people protected by the settlement agreement have already been denied work authorization renewals over the fees, even though Sabraw has not yet ruled on whether they should have to pay. According to one example in the ACLU’s court filings, a family of 10 could not come up with the $2,475 to renew their papers. Several of them have lost their jobs because their work authorization expired during the lapse in legal services.

If the chaos continues, Van Hofwegen said, the added burden of renewing status more often will also tax legal-services providers, delay asylum applications and ultimately eat away at the support the settlement agreement is supposed to provide for separated families.

“It makes every piece of this legal process that’s supposed to exist for them harder and harder, with the goal of denying permanency in the U.S. to as many class members as possible,” she said.

Given the lapse in legal services, Sabraw recently extended deadlines for class members to apply for immigration documents and ordered the government to reinstate their legal status or work authorizations that expired during the stoppage.

But it’s unclear if the government has complied with that order, according to the filings. Attorneys advising class members say the administration has not responded to their requests for proof of the extension. Without official documents, the attorneys said, Ms. L. families can’t show they have a right to be in the country if they’re stopped by law enforcement.

Even if the administration eventually complies with the court’s orders, say advocates, formerly separated families can only be protected by the settlement agreement if the government is willing to honor it.

“All the work the court did and all the work the parties did over two years to reach this settlement is in real jeopardy,” Gelernt told the court during one of many hearings this summer. “We cannot leave these families drifting.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee3c40e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3424x1798+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F12%2Ff500597340eb80a63595596623ef%2Fap19050734920276.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 00:17:02.857270

Totaling $10 billion, and created to help “safeguard” the border, the funds received scant attention when Republicans in Congress adopted the mammoth law this summer. But the money has since taken on greater significance, as one of the obscure accounts that have enabled the White House to manage the fallout from the government shutdown.

Three weeks into the fiscal stalemate, the Trump administration has taken a series of unorthodox steps to reprogram billions of dollars in enacted spending, marking an escalation in its campaign to wrest control of the budget away from Congress.

The moves, which are highly unusual during a shutdown, have allowed the president to pay military service members, immigration agents and other federal law enforcement officials, even though lawmakers have not approved new money for their wages.

Normally, federal workers do not receive income until the shutdown concludes, creating hardship for millions of troops and civil servants, who are either furloughed or forced to keep working without pay. But the White House has stretched its authority in recent days to assist certain employees who are seen as central to Mr. Trump’s political agenda, including those who conduct deportations.

Video by local news outlets showed masked agents on foot and cuffing people in the afternoon along Canal Street, a popular tourist hub in the Chinatown neighborhood. It's unclear how many people were taken into custody.

Protests ensued in the area. Traffic halted as agents took people into custody while bystanders recorded events on their phones.

Video obtained by USA TODAY showed an armored Department of Homeland Security vehicle driving down Lafayette Street, from the direction of Canal, toward a Manhattan federal building, which houses immigration court and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding area. Protesters are seen screaming at marching agents as they shove people out of the way to make way for the vehicle.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies conducted a “targeted, intelligence-driven operation on Canal Street” that “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.”

Canal Street is a common area where people sell clothing, accessories and food on heavily congested sidewalks.

Agencies also included FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, IRS Criminal Investigations and Customs and Border Protection, she said.

“During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

At least one person was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a federal officer, she said, adding more details would soon be available on people arrested.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said he saw agents initially detaining African vendors on the street and putting them in unmarked vehicles. Agents refused to answer questions about who was being taken into custody, or whether agents had judicial warrants to arrest them, Awawdeh said.

Then, as advocates and bystanders began gathering, dozens of agents swarmed the area along with the military vehicle, he said. Agents used batons and mace on demonstrators.

“If they're trying to give us a warning shot, New Yorkers are ready to fight for one another, and peacefully fight for one another,” Awawdeh told USA TODAY in a phone call from the scene. “We're going to fight for our democracy, because that's what this is coming down to.”

New York City police said on social media it had no involvement in the federal operation. Mayor Eric Adams said New York City doesn’t cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with local laws, which are commonly called sanctuary policies.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said on social media.

In January, ICE conducted highly publicized raids in New York City. Agents have also detained people attending immigration court hearings or ICE check-ins in lower Manhattan.

If agencies choose to collaborate with federal agencies, that is wholly up to them.","A new University of Washington report released Tuesday shows federal agencies are accessing local police department cameras, and at least two local departments say they were unaware it was happening.

The report was released by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. It states that U.S. Border Patrol had unauthorized direct or indirect access to traffic cameras that capture drivers’ information throughout cities.

What they're saying:

""It should be a wakeup call for all us as Washingtonians about the vulnerability of the technology that is being used to scoop up our data,"" said Angelina Godoy director of the UW Center for Human Rights.

Law enforcement says the cameras, which are through the company Flock Safety, have led to numerous arrests of violent suspects and the recovery of stolen cars.

They are installed throughout cities and read license plates as cars drive by. The report from UW shows federal agencies could also access many of the local department’s cameras.

Local perspective:

""It’s very clear both on the immigrants’ rights front and the access to reproductive healthcare front, that Washington stands firmly in favor of peoples’ rights and yet, for Washingtonians’ data to be leaked to entities that don’t share those values is worrisome,"" said Godoy.

Godoy tells FOX 13 Seattle federal agents gained access to local data through three different ways:

Directly, by a department sharing access to federal agencies.

Through backdoor access to the networks of at least 10 Washington police departments who did not authorize the border patrol searches.

And indirectly, by a member of law enforcement doing searches for federal agencies. For example, the report says the Yakima County Sheriff's office made two searches with the reason listed as ""ice"".

The Response:

""We immediately paused all access to any outside agencies while we make sure we can determine where we can put guard rails in place with Flock and with all of our detectives and investigators to make sure this doesn’t happen again,"" said Deputy Chief Ryan Rutledge with the Renton Police Department.

Rutledge tells FOX 13 Seattle the Renton Police Department had no idea its cameras were vulnerable to unauthorized federal access.

Renton is now requiring any outside agency, including other local police departments, to submit a specific request to them to access their data.

The Auburn Police Department released a similar statement saying they are working to make changes.

Big picture view:

""It’s deeply revealing if their answer is, ‘we had no idea that our tools were being used in that way.’ Well, if you have the tool, you have the responsibility to ensure you are using it responsibly, ethically, and in compliance within state law,"" said Godoy.

In regard to the report, Governor Bob Ferguson told FOX 13 Seattle, ""My team is following up with the Office of the Attorney General on the assertions made in the report, and working to ensure local jurisdictions are complying with the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act.""

Flock Safety releases a statement in response to UW's report

The company behind the cameras, Flock Safety, provided this statement to FOX 13 Seattle:

We appreciate and value the attention that privacy advocates pay to Flock. Unfortunately, these activists published a report that is full of inaccuracies and misconceptions about our technologies and their use that we’d have been happy to clear up, had they reached out to us prior to publication.

Most importantly, there is no ""back door"" into Flock. Every Flock customer has complete control over their sharing relationships, and Flock never shares customer data without authorization. Much of this report consists of old claims and allegations that have been addressed and, in some cases, that have led to improvements in our products.

Local public safety agencies collaborate with federal agencies on a wide variety of serious crimes, including human and narcotics trafficking and multi-jurisdictional cases. If agencies choose to collaborate with federal agencies, that is wholly up to them. Flock never enrolls agencies in automatic data sharing, and sharing relationships can be revoked at any time.

We are extremely proud of the positive, community-enhancing impacts our products have had across Washington and the nation. From helping locate vehicles wanted in hit-and-runs, to identifying homicide suspects, and bringing justice to victims of kidnapping and abuse, Flock technology is making communities across Washington safer today. Activist detractors downplay and even ignore those positive impacts and outcomes; the communities that we help make safer do not.

Lawsuit Challenges FMCSA Emergency Rule

On Monday, October 20, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit against USDOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) over a rule increasing federal oversight of how states issue CDLs and CLPs to persons who are not from the United States.

The suit, titled Rivera Lujan v. FMSCA, was filed by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and drivers Jorge Rivera Lujan and Aleksei Semenovskii.

On September 29, 2025, the FMCSA issued an emergency interim final rule (IFR) to ensure that “non-citizens will not be eligible for a non-domiciled CDL unless they meet a much stricter set of rules, including an employment-based visa and undergoing a mandatory federal immigration status check using the SAVE system.”

The IFR “threatens the livelihoods of nearly 200,000 people” including asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization, according to an AFT news release announcing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that the actions taken against non-domiciled CDL and CLP holders by the IFR are illegal and that FMCSA failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures by issuing the IFR without notice or public comment period.

One of the plaintiffs, Rivera Lujan, is described in the news release as a DACA recipient and truck driver of 11 years who owns his own trucking company. He was reportedly denied a renewal of his CDL on September 30 due to the rule change, which went into effect immediately upon publication on September 29.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Rivera Lujan. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

“For the Trump administration, the cruelty is the point,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a spiteful and illegal rule issued with no justification except to hurt hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants with work authorization who only want to build a better life for themselves and their families. Many AFT members require a CDL to work as school bus drivers—and right now we are seeing people turned away from training for these positions. Their American Dream will be dashed or deferred, all because of the pettiness of the president and his advisers.”",https://cdllife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_1129432.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 22:21:20.294086

The lawmakers emphasized that numerous arrests of US citizens by ICE and other immigration agents have been violent.
""Masked, armed agents are snatching people on the street and refusing to identify themselves,"" said the lawmakers.
""US citizens are now afraid to speak Spanish in public and are carrying their passports everywhere they go.
This administration’s failure to investigate or even acknowledge that these indiscriminate immigration raids are canceling the rights of US citizens is dangerous.""","Days after new reporting revealed that at least 170 US citizens are among those who have been detained by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration, which Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called ""absolutely shocking,"" the Washington Democrat joined Rep. Jamie Raskin in demanding answers from top homeland security officials on the report.

Jayapal and Raskin (D-Md.) noted that they previously wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons in February, just weeks into President Donald Trump's second term, when the detention of US citizens ensnared in Trump's mass deportation operation was already raising alarm.

At that point, NBC News had reported on the detentions of US citizens including Native tribe members, which raised concerns about racial profiling—but in their Monday letter to Noem and Lyons, Jayapal and Raskin said the response they got in February was ""flippant and unserious,"" with the officials simply reiterating existing policies that prohibit ICE from detaining US citizens—""without providing any assurance"" that agents were ""actually following that policy.""

""This administration cannot hide behind a broad policy statement, as it continues to unlawfully detain US citizens as part of indiscriminate immigration raids,"" wrote Jayapal and Raskin.

The lawmakers emphasized that numerous arrests of US citizens by ICE and other immigration agents have been violent.

Raskin and Jayapal drew attention to four specific cases, including those of:

Rodrick Johnson, a 67-year-old man who was dragged out of his apartment in Chicago by immigration agents who zip-tied him after breaking down his door as part of a raid on his building, and then left tied up outside the building for nearly three hours;

George Retes, who was pepper-sprayed and detained for three days in a raid on a farm where he worked, with agents refusing to look at his ID and then denying him his right to see an attorney or make a phone call;

Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old man who was handcuffed by ICE officers and loaded into a van while he was handing out copies of his resume to businesses in Berwyn, Illinois; and

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, who was arrested twice during worksite raids in Alabama, even after showing agents his REAL ID that proved his US citizenship.

Other cases not mentioned in the letter include those of Job Garcia, a photographer who was tackled and held on the ground by ICE agents during a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles and then detained for more than 24 hours, and Debbie Brockman, a news producer in Chicago who was handcuffed by agents who accused her of throwing an object at them, and then hauled into an unmarked vehicle that crashed into another car as it sped away—only to be released later that day with no charges.

Raskin and Jayapal accused Noem and Lyons of overseeing a ""lawless 'detain first, ask questions later' approach to immigration

enforcement"" that is ""terrorizing communities across the country.""

""Masked, armed agents are snatching people on the street and refusing to identify themselves,"" said the lawmakers. ""US citizens are now afraid to speak Spanish in public and are carrying their passports everywhere they go. This administration’s failure to investigate or even acknowledge that these indiscriminate immigration raids are canceling the rights of US citizens is dangerous.""

Jayapal and Raskin demanded that Noem and Lyons provide an accounting of all the US citizens who have been detained with their identities, the length of time they were held, and their criminal records if they had any—which, according to an analysis by the CATO Institute in June, a majority of people arrested by ICE this year have not.

""We once again demand that you immediately provide a full accounting of all cases in which US citizens have been detained since January 20, 2025,"" said the Democrats, ""and explain any concrete steps your agencies are implementing to prevent such abuses from continuing.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61784213&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C470%2C0%2C470,N,,2025-10-21 21:00:33.764924

(AP) — A federal judge overseeing the Trump administration's prosecution of U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver on charges she assaulted and impeded immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center told the government to remove social media posts he called “prejudicial” to the congresswoman.

U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper on Tuesday heard pretrial arguments in the case brought by Republican President Donald Trump's U.S. Justice Department against the Democratic congresswoman representing Newark, the state's biggest city. Semper didn't issue a ruling from the bench but told the government's attorneys nine social media posts should be removed.

The posts, which came from the Department of Homeland Security's X account as well as the account for one of its spokespeople, referred to the May 9 visit by McIver and other members of Congress as “a reckless stunt by sanctuary politicians” and said the visit was not about oversight, a key point from the congresswoman and the other lawmakers who accompanied her to Newark's Delaney Hall Detention Facility in May.

“It's not factual,” Semper said. “The prejudicial nature of it is self-evident.”

A message seeking a response from Homeland Security was sent Tuesday.

McIver's attorneys have argued the department's posts could imperil her chances for a fair trial.

The judge also told the government to turn over additional video footage to McIver after her attorneys told the court they had not received footage they knew existed but wasn't turned over.

He also said he would take time to review a motion from McIver's attorneys to dismiss the case against her based on her right as a member of Congress to conduct oversight of the federal government.

McIver, a Democrat, was charged by interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, following the May 9 visit to Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the privately owned, 1,000-bed facility as a detention center.

She has pleaded not guilty.

“This process has not stopped me from doing my job,” McIver said outside the courthouse on Tuesday.

She was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.

Among those at McIver’s side Tuesday in court were Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez and Nellie Pou, along with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge that was later dropped and is suing Habba over what he called a malicious prosecution.

Habba's tenure as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey is being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case the day before McIver's appearance in court.

A nearly two-minute video clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows McIver at the facility inside a chain-link fence just before Baraka’s arrest on the other side of the barrier, where other people were protesting. McIver and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor.

The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police.”

It is not clear from police bodycam video if the contact was intentional, incidental or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene.

The government's complaint alleges that she “slammed” her forearm into an agent and then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.

The indictment also says she placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest and says again that she slammed her forearm into and grabbed an agent.

Watson Coleman and Menendez were with McIver at the detention center that day and have disputed the charges.

Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority.

McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.

Those factors include the length of detention, the likely duration of future detention, the conditions of detention, delays by the detainee and by the government, and the likelihood of a final order of removal.
The absence of a specific date when the proceedings will end does not show, for this purpose, that the proceedings are indefinite,” the filing reads.
Vizguerra’s lawyers argue that the Zadvydas decision shows that after six months, the government takes on the burden of justifying continued detention.","Lawyers for the federal government on Monday responded to Jeanette Vizguerra’s assertion that she has been detained for an unconstitutionally lengthy time, arguing that her detention meets due process standards because it will eventually end at the completion of court proceedings.

If Vizguerra’s habeas corpus petition is denied “she will be removed back to Mexico. Even if her request is ultimately granted, the government would remain authorized to find a different country to accept her. Either way, her proceedings will end,” the filing says.

Vizguerra has been in detention at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora since mid-March after being arrested outside of her workplace. The Denver activist and immigrant-rights advocate alleges she was targeted based on her protected free speech and that her deportation order from 2013 is not valid.

She has a pending habeas corpus case in federal court in Denver, which she asks to set her free or grant her a bond hearing while litigation related to her immigration status plays out.

In September, her lawyers filed an amended petition saying her six-month detention is unconstitutional. They argued that many judges rely on six factors when considering a noncitizen’s detention without a bond hearing, known as the Singh factors, after a 2019 immigration case. Those factors include the length of detention, the likely duration of future detention, the conditions of detention, delays by the detainee and by the government, and the likelihood of a final order of removal.

Federal lawyers say applying those standards would be irrelevant because they should only be considered in cases when a person is detained during removal proceedings, versus when a person is detained with a final order of removal.

“If noncitizens detained (with a final order of removal) can simply invoke the Singh factors after six months of detention, it would render the Supreme Court’s decision in Zadvydas a dead letter,” the filing reads.

Zadvydas v. Davis created a standard that certain lengthy detentions of detained immigrants satisfies “due process so long as there is a ‘significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,’” government lawyers wrote.

“There is a significant likelihood of her removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. The absence of a specific date when the proceedings will end does not show, for this purpose, that the proceedings are indefinite,” the filing reads.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — President Donald Trump keeps threatening to send National Guard troops to San Francisco next, blasting the California city as crime-ridden and saying its residents are clamoring for federal help.

But local and state leaders say that couldn’t be farther from the truth, noting overall crime is down and the city has started to turn around its downtrodden pandemic image. Residents and workers out downtown this week said they’re puzzled and concerned by Trump’s threat.

“This is a safe American city,” Mayor Daniel Lurie told The Associated Press last week. “We got this in San Francisco.”

The Republican president has referenced crime as his justification for possibly sending troops to the city of roughly 830,000. He’s deployed the Guard over crime concerns to Washington, D.C., where he has direct control of the National Guard, and Memphis, where the Republican governor supports their presence. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. He’s since said they’re needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well.

Residents and leaders in Portland were surprised by Trump’s attention when he described the city as besieged by violent protests. In reality, nightly protests were small and limited to the area outside a federal immigration building. While there were some arrests for violence, the demonstrations were far less intense than those that roiled the downtown in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.

In San Francisco, too, Trump seems to be relying on an outdated picture of a city often targeted by conservatives.

“The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump said Sunday on Fox News. “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”

His comments angered and baffled Kate Freudenberger, who works in retail.

“You’ve been walking around the city, it’s peaceful, there is no insurrection,” she said Tuesday morning, adding that immigration authorities have not been as active in San Francisco as in other cities, “so there’s really been nothing for us to coalesce around.”

Marc Benioff, the chief executive of San Francisco-based software giant Salesforce, caused a stir when he told the New York Times earlier this month that he’d welcome Guard troops to help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He has since apologized for his remarks, saying the conference was the “largest and safest” in its history and the Guard is not needed.

The city emerges from struggles

San Francisco is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, which emptied its downtown and brought renewed attention to street homelessness and open drug dealing. But signs indicate a city on the upswing. Artificial intelligence startups are snapping up office space, and home rental prices are rising. San Francisco saw a 21% increase from last year in office visits, according to location analytics platform Placer.ai, and public transit ridership is at its highest levels since the pandemic.

The Wall Street Journal this week declared the city was emerging from its “doom loop,” an article the mayor eagerly shared on social media.

Sidewalks are cleaner and tent encampments have largely disappeared from view. In the Tenderloin, one of the most troubled neighborhoods, teams of city and nonprofit workers on Monday helped school children cross the street, walked around picking up trash or counseled homeless people. It was a different image than during the pandemic, when hundreds of people camped on sidewalks.

Still, the Tenderloin is a problem spot for public drug use and dealing, as are the Mid-Market and Mission neighborhoods. But overall crime is down more than 26% this year compared to the same period last year, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Vehicle break-ins — which have vexed tourists and residents alike — are at a 22-year low, Lurie said.

Lurie, a centrist Democrat who has tried to avoid confrontations with Trump by ignoring many of the president’s comments, said Monday he’d welcome more federal help to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets. But sending in the Guard wouldn’t achieve that, he said.

“The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers—and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” Lurie said in a statement.

San Francisco voters in 2024 gave police the authority to use drones, surveillance cameras and other technology to fight crime. They also ousted politically progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin in a 2022 recall election and installed Brooke Jenkins, considered to be much tougher on crime than her predecessor. Lurie has pushed to hire and retain police officers, and entry-level police applications are up 40% over last year.

California leaders pledge to fight back

Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration has said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the California National Guard into Los Angeles against Newsom’s wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to “be in court within hours, if not minutes” if there is a federal deployment.

Lawsuits by Democratic officials in Chicago and Portland have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.

Libby Baxter, a retired nurse, said Trump has sent the National Guard to Democratic cities to create “chaos and unrest” and she fears the same could happen in San Francisco.

“I believe that that may happen if they come to San Francisco because we are a very tolerant community, but we don’t do well with somebody coming in and trying to dictate or take over certain parts of our city,” she said.",https://www.thereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Federal_Enforcement_San_Francisco_32147.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-22 12:58:19.430679

The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the high-profile case of Khalil v. Trump, a constitutional and immigration battle with far-reaching implications for free speech, executive power and the limits of federal immigration authority.

At the center of the case is Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and recent Columbia University graduate who was detained by immigration agents in March after helping organize pro-Palestine protests on campus.

After the hearing Tuesday, Khalil addressed supporters and media, expressing optimism despite the fact he continues to face deportation. He said the lawyers for the Trump administration were “defending the indefensible.”

“They’re trying to stop the federal court from looking at my case because they know they don’t have a case against me,” he said. “So we’ll keep fighting the legal fight until the end, and we are pretty confident that we’ll prevail at the end.”

His attorneys describe Khalil’s arrest as a politically motivated act of retaliation. A vocal leader during campus protests in spring 2024, Khalil was detained without warning, separated from his pregnant wife and flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he was held for 104 days.

The fight over jurisdiction

Shortly after his detention, Khalil’s legal team filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, based on the fact he lived in the district and was arrested there. The government responded the case should be heard in Louisiana, where he was ultimately being detained.

In the end, the petition was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey once it was confirmed that Khalil was held there before being moved to Louisiana.

At the center of the case is a clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act known as the “foreign policy ground,” which allows the secretary of state — currently Marco Rubio — to unilaterally declare that a noncitizen’s speech poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy. The Trump administration claims that justifies Khalil’s arrest and attempted deportation.

In June, however, U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz ruled otherwise, calling the move likely unconstitutional. He granted Khalil bail and barred the government from using the foreign policy justification to detain or remove him.

The administration appealed to the 3rd Circuit of Appeals, which hears cases originating in New Jersey, arguing that Fabiarz never had legal authority to hear Khalil’s case because Khalil was no longer in the state. At Tuesday’s hearing, Deputy U.S. Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign opened by challenging the judges’ jurisdiction.

“The District of New Jersey did not validly acquire jurisdiction,” Ensign told the panel, arguing that the petition should have been filed where Khalil was held in Louisiana. He called the entire process “improper” and said the bail order and injunction were legally defective.

The judges appeared skeptical, noting Khalil had a right to challenge his detention and that was made difficult by the fact the government misled his attorneys about where Khalil was being held.

“The district court there found that counsel for the government persistently and repeatedly misrepresented where Mr. Khalil was when he was in New Jersey and told his attorneys and his family that he was in New York,” Judge Arianna Freeman said to Ensign. “He was given misinformation and his attorneys followed that information to file in New York.”

First Amendment or foreign policy?

Khalil’s case has galvanized a broad coalition of civil liberties advocates who warn that the Trump administration is trying to rewrite the rules of free expression — starting with immigrants. His attorneys say this is part of a broader pattern of retaliatory prosecution. A related case in Boston uncovered internal Department of Homeland Security documents that flagged student activists for surveillance based on Palestine-related speech.

Brett Max Kaufman, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government’s use of immigration law to silence protected political speech sets a dangerous precedent.

“People in our government didn’t like the protected pro-Palestine speech of a lawful permanent resident,” Kaufman told the court. “So they detained him, sent him far away to Louisiana and began efforts to remove him from the country — while proudly warning others that they might be next.”

Bobby Hodgson, assistant legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, added that the facts of the case well demonstrate that it does not fall within the scope of the secretary of state’s power on a foreign policy grounds, which was not written to allow the government to suppress a viewpoint.

“I think that is the quintessential case where the right is the strongest and the protections are the strongest, and also where the government has the lowest interest in imposing its power in a viewpoint discriminatory way,” Hodgson said. “So when you balance those factors, I think everything weighs in favor of a First Amendment.”

What’s next?

Even after the injunction, the Trump administration has continued trying to remove Khalil through other means. After the “foreign policy” basis was blocked, the government introduced new allegations — claiming Khalil misrepresented facts in his green card application. His lawyers call the new charges “post hoc and pretextual,” and part of the same retaliatory campaign.

An immigration judge ruled against Khalil on these new grounds but his team appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

“Those charges are baseless and obviously as part and parcel of the broader project of retaliation,” said Baher Azmy, legal director at the Center of Constitutional Rights, who also worked on Khalil’s case. It all “stems from the same sort of rotten root, their desire to punish him for speaking out on behalf of Palestinian human rights,” he added.

The case has become a rallying point for advocates concerned with immigrant rights, campus free speech and unchecked executive power.

“The implications are much broader and they’re broader than people who are speaking up for Palestinian human rights,” said Ramzi Kassem, founder and co-director of Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility. “It’s a template that can be mobilized against any issue set that this administration disagrees with, whether it’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights or racial justice, this model could be applied to those issues.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mahmoud-khalil-philadelphia-federal-courthouse-el-102125-04.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 19:16:58.591941

Federal lawyers say applying those standards would be irrelevant because they should only be considered in cases when a person is detained during removal proceedings, versus when a person is detained with a final order of removal.
Vizguerra’s lawyers argue that the Zadvydas decision shows that after six months, the government takes on the burden of justifying continued detention.","Lawyers for the federal government on Monday responded to Jeanette Vizguerra’s assertion that she has been detained for an unconstitutionally lengthy time, arguing that her detention meets due process standards because it will eventually end at the completion of court proceedings.

If Vizguerra’s habeas corpus petition is denied “she will be removed back to Mexico. Even if her request is ultimately granted, the government would remain authorized to find a different country to accept her. Either way, her proceedings will end,” the filing says.

Vizguerra has been in detention at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora since mid-March after being arrested outside of her workplace. The Denver activist and immigrant-rights advocate alleges she was targeted based on her protected free speech and that her deportation order from 2013 is not valid.

She has a pending habeas corpus case in federal court in Denver, which she asks to set her free or grant her a bond hearing while litigation related to her immigration status plays out.

In September, her lawyers filed an amended petition saying her six-month detention is unconstitutional. They argued that many judges rely on six factors when considering a noncitizen’s detention without a bond hearing, known as the Singh factors, after a 2019 immigration case. Those factors include the length of detention, the likely duration of future detention, the conditions of detention, delays by the detainee and by the government, and the likelihood of a final order of removal.

Federal lawyers say applying those standards would be irrelevant because they should only be considered in cases when a person is detained during removal proceedings, versus when a person is detained with a final order of removal.

“If noncitizens detained (with a final order of removal) can simply invoke the Singh factors after six months of detention, it would render the Supreme Court’s decision in Zadvydas a dead letter,” the filing reads.

Zadvydas v. Davis created a standard that certain lengthy detentions of detained immigrants satisfies “due process so long as there is a ‘significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,’” government lawyers wrote.

“There is a significant likelihood of her removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. The absence of a specific date when the proceedings will end does not show, for this purpose, that the proceedings are indefinite,” the filing reads.

Vizguerra’s lawyers argue that the Zadvydas decision shows that after six months, the government takes on the burden of justifying continued detention.

The case continues as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportation efforts. According to an NBC News analysis, about 60,000 immigrants without permanent legal status were detained as of Sept. 25, with only about 30% of those with criminal convictions.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsc_0484-1024x6831753106890-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 19:17:11.037351

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states.
One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to attach conditions to federal disaster assistance grants that require recipients to comply with federal immigration law, hampering the ability of states and localities to prepare for disasters.

In January, Trump issued Executive Order 14159 calling for DHS to “undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum in February, directing sub-agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to scrutinize all federal financial assistance awards. The purpose was to identify funds allocated to sanctuary jurisdictions and to report on compliance within 30 days. By March, FEMA had added language to its grants requiring state and local recipients to confirm they’d help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing all federal funds administered by DHS.

The language contains six specific criteria.

Grant recipients must share information with DHS on the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of individuals.

Recipients cannot encourage or induce noncitizens to enter the country illegally.

Recipients must “honor requests for cooperation, such as participation in joint operations, sharing of information, or requests for short-term detention” of immigrants.

Recipients must provide federal immigration agents “access to detainees” in correctional facilities.

Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.

Both grant recipients and subgrant recipients, including aid organizations, are required to follow the criteria.

Finally, recipients are required to certify that none of the programs operated using federal funding can benefit illegal immigrants.

In May, 20 states and the District of Columbia, which have collectively received more than $23 billion in disaster aid since 2017, filed a lawsuit alleging DHS had no authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. The plaintiffs also claimed the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates federal agencies’ regulatory processes. By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants. Judge Smith also pointed out that DHS didn’t follow internal advice, overlooked how states would be affected, ignored public safety, and failed to consider alternative approaches, such as pausing targeted grants.

Despite Smith’s injunction, states are arguing that the language has not been removed from the grants. DHS is claiming that the language remains as a trigger clause in the event of the injunction being “stayed, vacated, or extinguished.” Meanwhile, the general hurdles the Trump administration has placed on aid are having real-life consequences for communities across the US facing disaster. These actions, which include the elimination of programs designed to fund mitigation projects, are leaving states and localities less prepared for when disaster inevitably strikes.

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states. It’s as if they’re actively discouraging states from accepting the funds. The problem with this approach is that it disregards the separation of powers; funds allocated by democratically elected representatives should be distributed to their constituents without additional, arbitrary, and politically motivated conditions. DHS’s efforts undermine national disaster preparedness and response efforts, leaving vulnerable populations at greater risk. For now, only the judiciary branch is standing up for the American people. It’s about time Congress started doing that as well. One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim. Congress also must assert its authority over government spending by censuring the president, challenging the executive branch’s overreach.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ETH_Fema_Funds.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:57:07.434749

According to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX, ICE operations ostensibly began near Canal Street between Church and Broadway.

An impromptu protest occurred as ICE officers attempted to make arrests on Canal Street, where migrants suspected of entering the country illegally often sell fake luxury goods.

Tensions rose between the protesters and ICE officers on Lafayette and Canal Street, with multiple people arrested, including one masked protester who was seen pushing federal officers.

And regardless of what your view is, it’s a difficult situation,” Kartalija said on “NewsNation Now” at the height of the clashes.

Two protesters threw themselves in front of oncoming vehicles, with one of them, a male, taken into custody. ICE officers used zip ties as a means of detaining individuals.

A female witness told NewsNation other protesters were being arrested for “simply standing and using their First Amendment right to protest.”

Some protesters were shouting “shame on you” even after ICE agents left the scene. New York police were the remaining authorities on the scene, who were being yelled at following ICE’s departure from the area.

“Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin said.

Federal officers opened fire on the man, who was shot in the elbow. The deputy marshal was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet, the DHS said. Both were taken to the hospital.

“These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest,” McLaughlin’s statement read.

The operation began at about 3 p.m. in the area of Centre and Canal Streets where ICE agents showed up to question street vendors.

Videos taken by amNewYork show a crowd of New Yorkers surrounding the federal agents as they carried out the enforcement action in Lower Manhattan. Within moments, ICE agents moved in to arrest some of the bystanders as well, prompting further fury from the gathering crowd.

New Yorkers pulled out their cellphones and began recording the ICE operation. Some onlookers shouted at the agents, calling the arrests “disgusting” and demanding they stop as they tackled one individual to the ground.

One person told the agents, “Does that feel good? I bet your mom and dad are so proud of you….You should be ashamed of yourself.”

ICE’s Chinatown raid turns chaotic

When the agents went to arrest a vendor, who appeared to be African, members of the crowd became incensed. Some became enraged to the point of yelling in ICE agents’ faces, comparing them to Nazis and calling them fascists.

As ICE agents went to their vehicles, New Yorkers ran into the streets. The agents then began pushing people and tackling some to the ground. That led to more enraged bystanders joining the mob and lashing out at the ICE agents.

The feds then pulled out batons and riot shields in an effort to get the crowd under control, striking some in the process.

The crowd followed ICE agents retreated back to 26 Federal Plaza, the site of many immigrant detentions in recent months, shouting “ICE out of New York.” The crowd was then met by more federal agents — some of whom were equipped with machine guns and looking ready for combat.

As the agents entered Federal Plaza, the NYPD arrived on the scene in riot gear to halt the advancing crowd. As of 5:20 p.m., many crowd members remained outside Federal Plaza.

“This doesn’t make anyone safer,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, told amNewYork. “It actually makes everyone a lot more unsafe when people don’t feel like they can go to the police or to law enforcement with their issues.”

Awawdeh said his organization is verifying the number of people detained and offering legal assistance to those affected. He criticized the operation as politically motivated and influenced by online calls from right-wing influencers urging ICE to act.

The operation came two days after Turning Point USA contributor Savannah Hernandez posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, urging ICE to “check out” the corner of Broadway and Canal Street.

In her post, which had more than 4.3 million views as of Tuesday, Hernandez claimed that “20 to 30 illegal immigrants” from Senegal were “operating a black market” and selling goods without licenses.

Council Member Christopher Marte, who represents the area, condemned the operation as “a horrifying display of federal overreach.”

“ICE has no place in New York City, especially not in the heart of Chinatown, terrorizing our immigrant neighbors with military vehicles and masked agents,” Marte said in a statement. “This kind of escalation is unnecessary, unacceptable, and antithetical to our city’s values as a sanctuary for all people.”

Marte said the challenges around street vending on Canal Street “are real and must be addressed,” but added that “federal agents storming our streets and targeting community members is not the solution.”

He criticized Mayor Eric Adams for “collaborating with federal immigration authorities” and deploying the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group alongside ICE agents, calling it “a clear violation of New York City’s sanctuary city laws.”

“Our communities deserve safety, dignity, and accountability, not fear, raids, and collaboration with agencies that have no place in our city,” Marte said.

An NYPD spokesperson told amNewYork that the department had no role in the federal operation carried out by ICE, and that officers were instead deployed to 26 Federal Plaza to monitor demonstrations and “keep the peace.”

The spokesperson said the deployment was similar to prior protest responses and emphasized that it was intended to allow people to exercise their First Amendment rights while ensuring public safety and protecting property.

Federal officials did not immediately comment on the incident.

City Hall spokesperson Kayla Mamelak said the Adams administration was aware of the federal law enforcement action on Canal Street, and was “gathering more details,” but that the NYPD had no role in the raid.

“We never cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, in accordance with local laws, and have no involvement in this matter,” Mamelak said. “Mayor Adams has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue the American Dream should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.”

A City Hall official said senior administration staff were on the ground monitoring protests at 26 Federal Plaza and that the NYPD had the situation under control. The official added that if circumstances escalate and someone interferes with a lawful enforcement action, Mayor Adams has instructed the NYPD to intervene.

But divergences between Miller, Grenell and Rubio were visible earlier in the Trump administration.
“Right now, Venezuela is not being treated as a foreign policy issue,” said Carrie Filipetti, who led Venezuela policy at the State Department under the first Trump administration.
Advocates for regime change in Venezuela have praised the strikes, which are seen as adding political pressure to Maduro and the elites that support his rule.
Asked about efforts by Maduro to negotiate with the White House on Friday, Trump expressed contempt towards the Venezuelan leader.","The seven U.S. military strikes in the international waters off Venezuela, which have killed dozens of people the U.S. accuses of participating in drug trafficking, represent the most provocative shows of force against the Maduro government to date.

“There was the conventional wisdom early in the administration that Marco Rubio was marginalized and that the State Department might not be in the driver’s seat. And that’s clearly not the case with regard to Venezuela policy,” said Benjamin Gedan, who worked on South America policy on the Obama administration National Security Council. “It’s been really surprising to see an increase in tensions with Venezuela and it’s really hard to explain that other than the influence of Marco Rubio.”

Miller and Rubio are now moving in lockstep on Venezuela, the three people said. They’re both “on the same page” about the U.S. government approaching the South American petrostate as akin to a transnational criminal group, said another one of the people familiar with discussions.

Together, they’ve managed to sideline a third group: those who want to preserve some access for oil majors to the petrostate’s vast energy reserves and generally normalize relations with Caracas. That group had pushed for diplomatic engagement with Caracas. Now many in that corner are resigned to the idea that Trump will hit Venezuela hard.

That leaves few voices in the administration who might argue against further escalation toward Venezuela in the coming months. The administration has already said it would consider striking cartels on Venezuelan soil, and Trump confirmed Thursday that he had authorized intelligence agencies to conduct covert operations in the country, ostensibly to further destabilize the Maduro regime.

One of the most high-profile members of the third camp is special envoy Richard Grenell, whom Trump told to halt diplomatic outreach to Caracas earlier this month.

“We seem to be at a point now where the misfit toys have been put in their place and the administration is moving full speed ahead,” the second person familiar with discussions said, listing Grenell and energy magnate Harry Sargeant III, who has connections with the Trump administration, as the misfit toys.

White House officials have repeatedly downplayed suggestions that much daylight has ever existed between the varying schools of thought within the administration and its orbit on Venezuela.

“With the support of his entire administration, President Trump is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

The White House maintains that it is Trump who is driving Venezuela policy, and none of the people POLITICO spoke to who were familiar with the discussions would go as far as to say that Rubio, who is also acting national security adviser, is the primary person setting the agenda. But certainly his philosophy is permeating policy decisions.

“We’d all like a magic wand when it comes to getting our way in foreign affairs; at this juncture, Marco Rubio may just have found his,” said former U.S. Ambassador to Panama John Feeley.

Grenell and Sargeant did not respond to requests for comment.

There’s long been consensus among the three camps that Maduro isn’t an easy counterpart for the U.S. to be dealing with. But divergences between Miller, Grenell and Rubio were visible earlier in the Trump administration. Grenell’s trip to Caracas in the early weeks of the administration — where he met with Maduro and secured the release of Americans in Venezuelan custody — elicited public expressions of displeasure from State Department officials at the time.

The split between Rubio and Miller has been less public. The first person familiar with the conversations in the administration over Venezuela emphasized that Miller “has always been consistent on security threats from the Maduro regime.” But Miller was seen as more supportive of Grenell’s early efforts, which led to the resumption of deportation flights from the U.S. to Venezuela.

Now the two men generally agree that treating Venezuela as a “criminal cartel structure” is the best course of action, even if it breaks the mold of how the United States has typically approached adversaries in Latin America, according to the second person familiar with the discussions.

“Right now, Venezuela is not being treated as a foreign policy issue,” said Carrie Filipetti, who led Venezuela policy at the State Department under the first Trump administration. “It’s being treated as a homeland security issue, and rightfully so.”

That has resulted in unified messaging from the White House — and the Venezuelan opposition — about how much of a threat Venezuela poses as a hub for global drug trafficking.

Asked about the administration’s Venezuela policy in an Oct. 5 Fox News interview, Rubio emphasized that the White House is taking action “against these traffickers of poison who are ultimately winding up in our streets, contributing to crime in our streets, not to mention the death of Americans.”

It’s unclear the extent to which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is involved in strategy for Venezuela. A defense official said Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Dan Caine have been involved in the planning of the strike campaign. Hegseth, per another defense official, is very involved in the internal debates on the deployment and planning, and is pushing for tangible results, including strikes and metrics, to be shown quickly.

In previous administrations, and even in the first months of Trump’s second term, the U.S. approach to Venezuela often involved backchanneling with Caracas and cycles of imposing and removing sanctions as a lever for change.

There is practically no sympathy for Maduro within the administration’s ranks and there is a broad recognition that the current government in Caracas isn’t aligned with U.S. interests, according to the first person and another one of the people familiar with the discussions. Even so, those who are aligned on the current approach to Venezuela have different long-term goals.

Where Rubio and others want to see Venezuela move towards a democratic government, ideally led by an opposition movement friendly to Washington, other factions have been seen as far more agnostic about the ultimate shape of a Venezuelan state.

In the first months of Trump’s second term, the administration also oscillated between revoking and extending a Treasury Department license allowing Chevron to drill in Venezuela. Rubio and his allies on Capitol Hill — Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Giménez and Maria Elvira Salazar — used their influence to push for the license’s revocation, arguing the drilling revenue propped up Maduro. Others in the administration, including Miller and Grenell, were seen as less concerned about the need to cancel the license, especially given their desire to continue working with Venezuela on deportation flights.

The license was revoked in March, though Chevron was granted a new license in the summer, as tensions with Caracas were rising.

It’s unclear how long the unity between the camps will last. Advocates for regime change in Venezuela have praised the strikes, which are seen as adding political pressure to Maduro and the elites that support his rule.

The strikes also establish more deterrence against the drug traffickers Miller has focused on. Yet hawks outside the White House — including Salazar and Gimenez — have continued their calls for supporting a democratic transition in Venezuela and forcing Maduro to cede power to the opposition, which international observers say rightfully won last year’s presidential election.

Those calls intensified after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

For now, there’s a clear focus in the administration on punishing Maduro and projecting U.S. strength. Asked about efforts by Maduro to negotiate with the White House on Friday, Trump expressed contempt towards the Venezuelan leader.

“He’s offered everything. You know why? He doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States,” Trump quipped.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F71%2F2e%2Ff3cdb25b40a4a3c7d710a4196a91%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2239438430,N,,2025-10-21 17:57:46.512257

“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation …,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement. “As part of the operation ICE law enforcement officers arrested 105 illegal aliens.

After FBI raid in southwest Idaho, advocates denounce ‘military-style’ tactics and detaining kids

FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker previously said ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division helped “process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation. Their presence was limited to that specific federal responsibility and was separate from the criminal gambling investigation being led by the FBI.”

Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets.

“The government came in full force, military-style, helicopters, drones and arrested and handcuffed, everyone … including children,” ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales told reporters at a news conference Monday. “No person, no Idahoan, no American should ever accept whenever a government does this to its own people.”

The FBI canceled a press conference scheduled Monday, saying law enforcement officials didn’t have more information to share publicly beyond a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The document details the investigation, but does not specify law enforcement’s tactics during the raid.

In a press release issued Tuesday afternoon, the Idaho governor’s office said about 400 people were in attendance on Sunday and that none of the 105 people in ICE custody are children.

“Illegal gambling operations involving animals often accompany drug trafficking, animal abuse, illegal weapons trafficking, and large sums of money that end up in the hands of cartel bosses. The State of Idaho provided support in the service of a warrant issued by a federal judge in connection with the illegal activities taking place in Wilder,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in the release.

The FBI led a “monthslong investigation in coordination with the Treasure Valley Metro Violence Crime and Gang Task Force and served a warrant, issued by a federal judge, at the Canyon County facility,” according to the governor’s office. “When serving a search warrant, it is common practice for law enforcement to detain others present while processing the scene to ensure the safety of both the civilians and officers present and to preserve evidence.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251019_190036-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:17:24.185138

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said agents were conducting a “targeted enforcement traffic stop” when the undocumented immigrant tried to evade arrest. According to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, the immigrant had “previously escaped from custody.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents opened fire at around 8:52 a.m. on E. 20th Street near Washington Boulevard when the suspect allegedly rammed a law enforcement vehicle with his car as he tried to run away.

“Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

WASHINGTON—Yesterday, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed a brief in the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc. The full court is considering a law in Texas called S.B.4, which protects Texas’s border with Mexico. Activist groups have sued to strike down the law, claiming it conflicts with federal immigration law.

In its brief supporting S.B.4, FAIR shows that the law is permissible under the Constitution as a war measure by the state of Texas. During the Biden Administration, Mexican cartels, which control the Mexican side of the border, ran massive numbers of foreign nationals from around the world, along with massive quantities of drugs and other contraband, into Texas and other states.

In response to this invasion by the cartels, Governor Greg Abbott declared war under Section 10 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that states, “without the Consent of Congress,” may “engage in War” if they have been “actually invaded.” In addition to enacting S.B.4, Texas has taken other steps to wage this war, including placing floating barriers in the Rio Grande and stringing razor wire to block invaders, and people who fund the cartels, from entering the state.

FAIR argues in its brief that the questions of whether Texas has been invaded and whether its chosen means of waging war are appropriate are both what are called “nonjusticiable political questions”—meaning they have no legal answers, and so courts should decline to decide them, but rather leave them to the political branches of state government. Then FAIR shows that Texas’s valid exercise of its constitutional power to repel an invasion overrides any conflicting federal laws for the duration of the conflict.

“Whether to go to war and how to wage it are not legal questions,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “The Constitution accordingly gives the power of deciding them to states, not to courts. We hope the court sees that Texas acted in good faith in invoking its war power, that its valid exercise of direct constitutional power cannot be overridden by acts of Congress, and upholds S.B.4.”

McIver’s defense attorneys said such messages could undermine the charges by showing agents were not afraid of McIver, a potential element in an assault case.","The alleged assaults occurred during a 68-second span in the midst of a three-hour tour of the Delaney Hall detention facility, when McIver, Watson Coleman and Menendez were part of a chaotic scrum as immigration agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on a trespassing charge that was later dropped.

Another judge called the Baraka prosecution embarrassing. Now the McIver case is another test of New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who is battling to preserve her post following a separate August court ruling that she is unlawfully serving in the job. An appeals court heard arguments about that case on Monday.

McIver attorney Paul Fishman argued McIver was prosecuted because she was a Democrat, meanwhile Trump pardoned hundreds of people who attacked police at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the Justice Department dropped numerous additional assault cases at Trump’s direction, despite video evidence of the attacks.

“She was charged with something she never would have been charged with if she was a Republican,” Fishman said.

But Semper repeatedly came back to the fact that neither Watson Coleman or Menendez were charged, even though they were in the same scrum as McIver. (Watson Coleman, Menendez and Rep. Nellie Pou were all in the courtroom Tuesday as spectators to support McIver.)

Semper then heard attorneys try to leverage complex and uncertain case law about congressional immunity. He cited case law that worried too much immunity could make members of Congress “super citizens” immune from the law, but he also entertained arguments about how prosecutors could try the case in front of a jury without showing them evidence that steps on her constitutional protections.

“It’s going to be about what the jury sees on those videos,” assistant U.S. Attorney Mark McCarren said, referring to videos of the scrum that the government alleges shows McIver assaulting two officers and impeding the arrest of Baraka.

But defense attorneys said to get those events, the jury needs to hear that McIver was there exercising her oversight authority and hear evidence that federal immigration agents tried to impede her work — work the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause protects from being used in court. Her attorneys have also cited the Supreme Court ruling last year that gave Trump immunity from criminal prosecution for some actions he took during his first presidential term while fighting to subvert the 2020 election.

“You can’t try the case the way the government pretends they can try it,” Fishman said.

McIver is accused in a three-count indictment of slamming a federal agent with her forearm, “forcibly” grabbing him and using her forearms to strike another agent. Allegations of physical violence by a sitting member of Congress are rare.

At one point, the hearing in front of the judge turned to perhaps the most famous case from history, the caning of Sen. Charles Sumner by Rep. Preston Brooks in 1856. Prosecutors argued that Brooks was prosecuted, suggesting congressional immunity doesn’t cover assaults. But defense attorneys said the case wasn’t analogous, in part because Brooks was a member of the House who had come into the Senate with a specific intent not related to his legislative activity.

Semper also told the government to look at taking down statements that Trump administration officials made about the case that have “absolutely no connection” to the indictment, including remarks suggesting she was trespassing or part of Antifa. Prosecutors said the government had taken down some but conceded other statements remained on social media.

That alone represents a rare concession by the Trump administration: Prosecutors said a half dozen statements had been taken down, while the defense team argued nine others remained online.

Semper said he wanted the government to be proactive in removing such posts and didn’t want to force the defense team to play “whack-a-mole.”

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in Eugene U.S. District Court to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit.

The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law.

The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties.

In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.

I hope not,'"" Tran told WJZ.
In May, Tran was detained and transported around the country until a federal judge ordered her release.
""It's fear all the time,"" Tran told WJZ.
Tran told WJZ she was ""blessed"" on Monday.","Melissa Tran, a mother of four from Hagerstown, Maryland, reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Baltimore for the first time since a judge ordered her release following months in custody.

Tran came to the United States legally as a refugee from Vietnam in 1993, but a conviction involving theft from her employer in 2001 left her vulnerable for deportation.

She had been checking in regularly with immigration officials for more than 20 years without issue until they held her last May.

Fear at the federal ICE building

An anxious Melissa Tran spoke to WJZ Investigates when she arrived for her check-in with ICE just after 8 a.m. Monday.

""I feel nervous, very nervous, because I don't know what's going to happen to me,"" she said.

Tran already had a difficult conversation with her family and told them she may not make it home.

""My children asked me if I would be detained, and I said, 'I don't know. I hope not,'"" Tran told WJZ.

She then went inside to join her lawyer with her future uncertain.

Journey from Vietnam

Tran came to the United States legally at age 11 as a refugee from Vietnam.

But decades ago, she said she stole money from an employer, under pressure from an abusive ex-boyfriend.

Tran paid back the debt and served her time. However, the conviction for that single, non-violent crime led to an order of removal.

Still, for more than 20 years, the government allowed her to stay and build her family in Hagerstown where she owns a business.

In May, Tran was detained and transported around the country until a federal judge ordered her release.

What happened Monday?

After several hours, Tran emerged from Baltimore's federal building with her lawyer with good news.

She would be allowed to return home.

""I'm glad I get to go home with my family today, but I don't know what's going to happen the next time,"" Tran said.

She said she continues to live in fear.

""It's fear all the time,"" Tran told WJZ.

There was one catch: ICE demanded she wear an ankle monitor.

Her lawyer, Bernard Semler, planned to fight that.

""She should be released under the same conditions prior to when she was detained, so it's our position with the ankle monitor is not the same conditions and would violate the order,"" Semler said.

Semler also reflected on the hours he spent inside the federal building where people lined up early to check in with ICE.

""When you're up there, and there's a long line of people, you can kind of see the fear in each one of their eyes,"" Semler said.

That is why he is thankful she walked out with him Monday, unlike what happened to Kilmar Abrego Garcia at the same office in August.

""We just tried to stay positive because in the end to not be detained, you've got to look at the glass half full,"" Semler said.

Tran told WJZ she was ""blessed"" on Monday.

She has a court hearing coming up soon.

Tran is not only fighting to stay in the United States but also deportation to a third country.

""I feel very happy that I will get to walk out because I was very scared when I was sitting there for over an hour. I was like, 'Uh-oh something is going to happen like last time,'"" Tran said.

Conditions at ICE facility in Baltimore

Following her release last week, Tran described how she was taken into custody for five days in Baltimore.

She said she was housed with nine women in unsanitary conditions.

""No shower, nothing. No personal hygiene. No toothbrush to brush your teeth,"" Tran described.

The women were kept in one room with an inflatable mattress and no blankets.

""I was in shock,"" Tran said.

She was then taken to Louisiana, Arizona and ended up in Tacoma, Washington.

She said she was always shackled on various buses and planes but relied on the many letters of support she received from friends in Maryland to keep her spirits up.

""When you're sitting there—and you don't know what's happening to you—and you think all these negative thoughts, it's the letters that I received from the people in the community saying you have to stay strong. We are fighting for you. We are praying for you. It gives me hope,"" Tran said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/20/8412db38-51d5-449b-a427-c5645d91e5ce/thumbnail/1200x630/64fc8ed96e6d82c9db6465532265deff/melissa-tran.png,N,,2025-10-21 16:17:30.653942

Citing records from the Federal Procurement Data System, Popular Information reports that the immigration force, which answers to Kristi Noem’s Department of Homeland Security, spent $71,515,762 on purchases of “small arms, ordnance and ordnance accessories manufacturing” between January 20 and October 18.

That compares to $9,715,843 in the equivalent period in 2024 under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, and an average annual spend of just $8.4 million in the current president’s first term between 2017 and 2021.

“Small arms” refers to armor, explosives, chemical weapons, pistols, and rifles while “ordnance and ordnance accessories manufacturing” denotes other materials like artillery, barrels, extractors, and mounts.

While the majority of the money has been spent on guns and armor for field agents, the outlay has also seen ICE purchase “guided missile warheads and explosive components,” according to Popular Information.

The Independent has contacted the White House, the DHS, and ICE for comment on the reasoning behind the drastically increased investment.

Despite the rapid uptick in investment, officials from the agency claimed that more money from Congress would be needed to expand the use of bodycams, the Associated Press reports.

The comments came from Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for ICE, at a hearing on Monday as he addressed complaints that ICE agents are using increasingly combative tactics.

Trump’s mission to bring about the “largest mass deportation program in history” by rounding up and removing undocumented immigrants in the United States illegally has seen ICE’s role greatly expanded and the agency flooded with federal funding.

It currently estimates that it has approximately 20,000 active agents but Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin recently said it has received “more than 175,000 applications” to join its ranks as a result of an ad blitz on platforms like Spotify, X, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn, with “more than 18,000 tentative job offers” issued.

McLaughlin added that the department’s “incentive processing,” such as signing-on bonuses, will continue during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which she blamed Democrats for.

Official data published at the end of September reported that there are currently 59,762 people being held in ICE detention centers.

The agency’s increased prominence has brought increased criticism over its methods, however. In June, its operations in downtown Los Angeles attracted mass protests, prompting Trump to activate the National Guard against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who warned it would escalate the existing tensions.

ICE has also attracted a deluge of unwanted headlines for the administration, including the recent revelation that it has arrested at least 20 children who are American citizens this year, two of whom had cancer.

Reports of operations involving armed agents “traumatizing” mothers and children and firing pepper balls at a priest attending a demonstration have not helped their publicity drive.

“What we’re seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,” Ed Yohnka of ACLU Illinois told NPR recently.

Yohnka has filed a lawsuit on behalf of protesters who believe that ICE’s tactics have violated their constitutional rights, stating: “All over the country, federal agents have shot, gassed, and detained individuals engaged in cherished and protected activities.”

The suit accuses ICE and other federal agencies of “the dangerous and indiscriminate use of near-lethal weapons such as tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper-balls, flash grenades, and other unwarranted and disproportionate tactics.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/30/3/07/GettyImages-2237820258.jpg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-21 17:17:57.951312

While the case had been in the federal appellate court, 63 tribal nations — again led by the Bay Mills Indian Community — filed a similar brief seeking to have the case return to state court.
The decision from the Sixth Circuit came down to a 30-day deadline to request the case move to federal court, which the court determined Enbridge missed.
“The Supreme Court should see through Enbridge’s transparent attempt at gamesmanship.” The Tribal Nations also argued that federal courts should not “encroach” on state court jurisdictions.
“The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals.” This story was updated with comment from Enbridge.","Updated at 4:32 p.m.

Ten Tribal Nations in Michigan have filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court urging them to reject an attempt by Canadian oil pipeline company Enbridge Energy to have a federal court settle a lawsuit first brought by Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019, asking instead to have the case remain in state court.

“For many years, Tribal Amici have called on the State to uphold its public-trust obligation to protect the Straits of Mackinac and the Great Lakes, including the fisheries, from these known dangers of the aging Straits Pipelines,” the Tribal Nations wrote in their brief. “Michigan’s suit against Enbridge is a long-overdue course correction.”

The brief cites the leak of a different pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 6B, into the Kalamazoo River in 2010, and the environmental harms that resulted from that.

Nessel is seeking to close the pair of pipelines that run through the Straits of Mackinac as the pipes were aging, looking to prevent a leak that could substantially contaminate the Great Lakes. While the suit was initially filed in state court, it has bounced between state and federal court in a question of who has jurisdiction.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals last year sent the case back to state court, which was a win for Nessel, but in June, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to take up the case on an appeal from Enbridge. While the case had been in the federal appellate court, 63 tribal nations — again led by the Bay Mills Indian Community — filed a similar brief seeking to have the case return to state court.

The decision from the Sixth Circuit came down to a 30-day deadline to request the case move to federal court, which the court determined Enbridge missed. The Supreme Court took up the case in June, and will decide whether Enbridge should be granted an exemption to that 30-day deadline.

“No part of Section 1446 allows a defendant to escape the 30-day deadline by asserting that it only recently discovered that a federal court might be more sympathetic to its arguments,” the amicus brief reads. “But at bottom, that is Enbridge’s explanation for what it attempted here.”

“Enbridge missed a court deadline by more than two years, without excuse, and now they want to change the rules,” Caroline Flynn, a lawyer at Earthjustice who is representing the Tribes, added in a press release. “The Supreme Court should see through Enbridge’s transparent attempt at gamesmanship.”

The Tribal Nations also argued that federal courts should not “encroach” on state court jurisdictions.

“If it were not for Enbridge’s procedural gamesmanship, the merits of this state public-trust dispute may well have been settled long ago — and the risks to Tribal Amici’s critical treaty-protected resources addressed,” the brief continues.

The Tribal Nations that joined the amicus brief are Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Hannahville Indian Community, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi Tribe (NHBP), Pokagon Band of Potawatomi, and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.

“The continued operation of Line 5 puts my Tribal Nation in grave danger,” said Whitney Gravelle, President of the Bay Mills Indian Community, in the press release accompanying the brief.

“We are encouraged the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the June 2024 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit remanding to state court the Michigan Attorney General’s lawsuit against Enbridge seeking to shut down Line 5,” Ryan Duffy, a spokesperson for Enbridge wrote to the Advance.

Duffy did not specifically comment on the amicus brief.

“The 6th Circuit’s remand decision is in conflict with decisions from two other federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, which both held that there can be exceptions to the 30-day limit,” he added. “The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals.”

“Homeless, incarcerated, or dead” While the Trump administration works overtime to criminalize all immigrant populations, disabled immigrants have been hit especially hard, though they rarely receive extensive media coverage.
A lack of showers and food and exposure to extreme temperatures inside detention centers can also exacerbate medical issues.
Democratic lawmakers who toured the facility over the summer said immigrants detained inside reported that they went 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear, or towels.
However, after speaking to immigrants detained at the facility recently, it appears that “many of the same problems persist,” Diaz said.","President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has led to an increase in raids carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), resulting in a myriad of human rights abuses—including the abuse and neglect of disabled immigrants in federal custody.

In June, the largest disability rights group in the nation, Disability Rights California (DRC), conducted a monitoring visit at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California’s San Bernardino County after receiving reports that disabled people were being held in unsafe conditions.

The facility is run by the GEO Group, one of the largest private prison companies in the U.S. and one that has experienced a financial boon from the Trump administration’s soaring detention numbers. There are at least 59,700 immigrants in detention centers nationwide—a historic high—and many of these facilities are run by GEO, a company long synonymous with neglect, abuse, and in-custody deaths.

On Sept. 22, 39-year-old Ismael Ayala-Uribe died while detained at Adelanto. The Mexican immigrant and former recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was detained at the facility for a little more than a month before his in-custody death from unknown causes. Ayala-Uribe, who was apprehended as part of a workplace raid at an Orange County, California, car wash, was the 14th person to die in ICE custody this year.

According to DRC, about 300 immigrants were detained at Adelanto just before the group’s June visit. A few weeks later, when members of the organization revisited the facility, that number skyrocketed to nearly 1,400. The dramatic increase led the already abhorrent conditions inside to further deteriorate, according to DRC’s report released in July.

“They Treat Us Like Dogs in Cages: Inside the Adelanto ICE Processing Center” details the conditions immigrants have experienced inside the facility, including inadequate access to medical treatment; exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses; inadequate access to food and water; inadequate access to clean clothes, with many remaining in soiled clothing for long periods of time; and minimal opportunities to contact family.

“Further intensifying these issues, many of the people DRC interviewed had never experienced incarceration and felt overwhelmed and terrified by their confinement in a locked, jail-like facility,” the report noted.

Neither ICE nor GEO Group responded to Prism’s request for comment.

“Homeless, incarcerated, or dead”

While the Trump administration works overtime to criminalize all immigrant populations, disabled immigrants have been hit especially hard, though they rarely receive extensive media coverage.

As Prism previously reported, deaf immigrants in Los Angeles were particularly vulnerable during the raids that roiled the region this summer. Also in California, a Deaf asylum-seeker from Mongolia who has been detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center since February never saw a judge or had the ability to communicate with anyone familiar with Mongolian Sign Language before being released in July.

More recently, the Houston Chronicle reported on the case of Emmanuel Gonzalez-Garcia. The 15-year-old autistic teen was reported missing by his mother on Oct. 4 after he wandered away from the corner where she sold fruit. After locating the teen, who has the cognitive ability of a 5-year-old, the Houston Police Department claimed that it could not locate a member of his family, so police instead contacted ICE. The teen is now in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency responsible for detaining immigrant minors who are unaccompanied by adults.

Like in Gonzalez-Garcia’s case, disabled people and their families often can’t access the financial, educational, legal, or informational resources they need. Richard Diaz, senior attorney with the investigations unit at DRC, told Prism in an email that there are many cases in which “a person’s disabilities are not identified or tracked, leaving them without proper accommodations in immigration court proceedings and in immigration detention.”

Recent changes to federal public benefits by the Trump administration now also bar undocumented immigrants and even some green card holders from using certain services important for their health and well-being, KFF reported. This includes the federal Health Center Program, which funds a network of community health centers that provide a range of medical, behavioral, and supportive services to patients regardless of their ability to pay.

Mia Ives-Rublee, the senior director of the Center for American Progress’ Disability Justice Initiative, told Prism in an email that “the mishandling of undocumented individuals will likely exacerbate” the issues faced by a population that is more likely to be disabled or chronically ill. Examples of these violations include medical devices such as wheelchairs or inhalers being stripped away and immigrants being forced to go without their medications for weeks. A lack of showers and food and exposure to extreme temperatures inside detention centers can also exacerbate medical issues.

In June, prior to the release of DRC’s report, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California also sounded the alarm on unsafe and unsanitary conditions inside Adelanto, the largest detention center in California. Democratic lawmakers who toured the facility over the summer said immigrants detained inside reported that they went 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear, or towels. Detention center employees even told the Los Angeles Times that the facility was unprepared to handle the recent surge in detained immigrants.

“It’s dangerous,” a longtime staffer told the publication, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We have no staffing for this and not enough experienced staff. They’re just cutting way too many corners, and it affects the safety of everybody in there.”

But immigrants outside of detention also face serious issues accessing health care due to fear of immigration enforcement.

Historically, hospital administrators have the power to “medically deport” undocumented immigrants in critical condition who are unable to pay for their care. In California, ICE is now regularly appearing inside medical facilities, creating a chilling effect and potentially forcing disabled or other chronically ill immigrants to miss necessary appointments. If deported, disabled people also face “a lack of community support or infrastructure to help address their disability or chronic illness,” Ives-Rublee said. Without support or care, “these individuals may end up homeless, incarcerated, or dead,” she told Prism.

Since DRC published its report, Diaz said the organization followed up with ICE, which agreed to implement “remedies” based on DRC’s advocacy. However, after speaking to immigrants detained at the facility recently, it appears that “many of the same problems persist,” Diaz said.

As organizations like DRC advocate on behalf of the people currently detained inside Adelanto, there are ways people can help their disabled undocumented neighbors on the outside.

Ives-Rublee suggested checking on community members, verifying their needs, and offering aid, especially to prevent them from having to go to areas where ICE is confirmed to be carrying out raids and other immigration enforcement. She stressed that disability is a “Western idea,” and individuals who qualify as disabled under U.S. law may not identify as disabled. “They may be eligible for certain protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Rehabilitation Act even if they don’t self-identify,” Ives-Rublee said, which is why black and white questions about whether someone is disabled may not provide a true sense of a neighbor’s specific needs.

After obtaining consent from an individual or their family, community members can help neighbors with grocery shopping or even accompany them to certain medical appointments. You can also serve as a point of contact if an undocumented neighbor fears they may be detained and will require legal representation. If they don’t have a lawyer, Ives-Rublee also suggested seeking out legal aid, especially through a disability rights group in your state that may be able to help get a person released.

DRC developed a disability accommodations card that can be used in conjunction with a know your rights card. These can be shared with undocumented neighbors in case they interact with immigration or law enforcement.

While ICE’s unjust and often unlawful treatment of immigrants and people with disabilities will continue as long as the federal immigration agency exists, concerned people nationwide can also continue to fight back on behalf of their neighbors.

(KOIN) – Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Marion County concerning the state’s sanctuary state laws.
The subpoenas led Marion County to file a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on whether the county has the authority to turn over the records of the alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.
“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield.
“The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law.
Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law.","PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Marion County concerning the state’s sanctuary state laws.

On Monday, Attorney General Rayfield filed the motion to dismiss in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon — arguing the state’s sanctuary laws are “straightforward.”

Marion County’s lawsuit goes back to Aug. 1, when the county received five subpoenas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, requesting the records of four alleged undocumented immigrants on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

According to court documents, ICE’s subpoenas ask the county to turn over information on the individuals such as home addresses, phone numbers, country of birth, name and address of employers along with “‘[d]ocuments sufficient to show the underlying criminal charge,'” including police reports, probable cause documents, booking photos and release agreements.

The subpoenas state that the production of “‘the indicated records is required in connection with an investigation or inquiry relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws,'” court documents say.

The subpoenas led Marion County to file a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on whether the county has the authority to turn over the records of the alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.

In Monday’s filing, Rayfield argued that Oregon’s sanctuary state laws are clear, stating, public bodies and law enforcement agencies in the state cannot release immigration information to federal officials in response to federal subpoenas unless a judicial order requires them to do so.

“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law. Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law. That’s been the law for nearly four decades, and it is a law that has coexisted peacefully under seven presidential administrations. There’s nothing confusing about that.”

Under Oregon’s sanctuary law – which was enacted in 1987 and reaffirmed by voters in 2021 – state and local officials cannot give out certain immigration information in response to subpoenas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, unless ICE obtains a judicial order requiring the subpoena, the Oregon Attorney General’s Office explained, noting this law ensures that a judge has an opportunity to review and determine if the subpoena meets legal requirements before state and local officials comply.

“Our system respects state sovereignty, federal authority, and public safety while keeping local resources focused on local priorities. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here,” said Attorney General Rayfield.

In a statement shared with KOIN 6 News, Marion County Counsel Steve Elzinga countered, “The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed.”

KOIN 6 News also reached out to Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, who is listed as a defendant in Marion County’s lawsuit. Kotek’s office said the governor cannot comment on pending litigation.

Marion County has seen support, with 34 Oregon sheriff’s offices signing a letter in support of the litigation and 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties signing a separate letter in support.

“Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them including vehicle rammings by illegal aliens,” she said.","A US Marshal and an illegal immigrant were shot Tuesday in Los Angeles when federal officers opened fire as the migrant “weaponized his vehicle” and tried to flee a traffic stop, officials said.

The suspect — who had reportedly escaped from custody on a previous occasion — allegedly rammed into federal vehicles, prompting agents to surround and box in the immigrant’s car, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Post.

“ICE law enforcement officers, assisted by U.S. Marshals, pulled the illegal alien over in a standard law enforcement procedure,” McLaughlin said.

“The illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” she said.

The illegal immigrant was shot in the elbow and the US Marshal was struck in the hand by a ricochet bullet, according to McLaughlin.

Both were rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Fox News.

McLaughlin, in her statement, accused lefty politicians like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of triggering similar anti-ICE violence through incendiary rhetoric.

“These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest. Resisting arrest puts the safety of illegal aliens, law enforcement, and the public at risk,” McLaughlin fumed.

McLaughlin also lambasted the disturbing uptick in attacks on federal immigration agents.

“Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them including vehicle rammings by illegal aliens,” she said.

“We are once again calling on sanctuary politicians, agitators, and the media to turn the temperature down and stop calling for violence and resistance against ICE law enforcement,” she said.

The shooting took place during an immigration operation involving a known gang member on East 20th Street, just south of Downtown LA, shortly before 9 a.m. local time, a DHS source told the Los Angeles Times.

McLaughlin pointed to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hosting a webinar including tips on how to defy ICE raids in February, as well as Gov. Newsom and Mayor Bass releasing guides and sanctuary laws providing advice to illegal aliens.

The LAPD did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Tuesday’s attack is the latest on ICE buildings and agents.

The Trump administration is expanding its ranks of health care providers who work in immigration detention centers around the country as deaths in custody mount and federal oversight is weakened by layoffs. The push by the Department of Homeland Security to hire more than 40 doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists and health administrators follows the revelation that nearly as many immigrants have died in custody so far this year than over the course of the Biden administration, according to government records.

After administration officials wrote in court filings that nearly 1,000 fired Health and Human Services employees were not subject to a Wednesday block, a federal judge held an emergency meeting to specify her intent to the contrary. The judge's initial temporary restraining order required federal agencies to temporarily halt reductions in force (RIFs) affecting workers represented by bargaining units that first filed on Sept. 30 to block any cuts attributed to the government shutdown. The administration, in filings, said that many of those to whom it had issued RIFs were unaffected by the order, as many departments and agencies had stopped recognizing those collective bargaining units over the summer in compliance with a March executive order.

The city first informed residents it expected ICE agents in Evanston in a Sept. 8 statement.

The agents’ presence is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Midway Blitz, a federal immigration crackdown targeting undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, first announced in September.

This page will be updated with credible reports of federal immigration enforcement in the city. Updates will be posted as activity is confirmed by official government sources at the local, state and federal levels as well as through verified alerts from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ICIRR operates a text alert system to inform community members on ICE sightings. According to ICIRR’s website, alerts are only issued when recent sightings are verified by an affiliated rapid response team.

Since the beginning of the year, the city has taken efforts to protect residents against federal agents, such as strengthening the Welcoming City ordinance. More recently, City Council voted to establish “ICE free zones” on city property, and Mayor Daniel Biss urged community members to “keep (their) neighbors safe.”

“In short: ICE is not welcome in Evanston,” Biss wrote in an Oct. 17 email to residents.

Community members and leaders have also taken action through community workshops, protests and nonprofit work. Many have encouraged reporting ICE activity by calling the ICIRR hotline at 855-435-7693.

This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

OCT. 21 — last updated 9:45 a.m.

At least four ICE agents were reported in Evanston on Tuesday morning, according to an ICIRR alert around 9:30 a.m. At least one person was detained, the alert read.

The agents were seen parked in the Home Depot parking lot and Salvation Army near south Oakton Street and Dawes Elementary School. They are wearing tan vests and driving a black Chevy SUV and a black Kia Carnival, according to the alert.

Agents were also spotted at the Home Depot in Lincolnwood, the alert read.

This follows an uptick in immigration enforcement throughout the city.

On Oct. 17, federal agents detained one person at an Oakton Street Home Depot around 10:35 a.m., according to an ICIRR text alert sent that day. The alert stated agents were seen driving a black Chevy SUV.

At least one person in Evanston was taken by federal immigration agents the morning of Oct.16, Biss wrote in an X post the same day.

An ICIRR text alert sent earlier that day said federal agents were spotted at Dodge Avenue and Oakton Street — adjacent to Dawes Elementary School — around 8:50 a.m. Agents were seen driving a black Chevy and a silver Hyundai Elantra, the alert read.

Residents previously saw ICE agents in the area by the Home Depot on Oakton Street on Oct. 12, causing American Youth Soccer Organization Evanston coaches to cancel its games at James Park across the street. In an X post the same day, Biss confirmed ICE took multiple community members.

The Department of Homeland Security also arrested an individual in Evanston near the intersection of Church Street and Brown Avenue on Sept. 10, according to a city statement later that week. The agents are not confirmed to be ICE agents, Evanston Police Department Cmdr. Scott Sophier said, but ICE is housed in DHS.

District Judge Jamel Semper was upstairs at the same time, hearing oral arguments from McIver's legal team.

Judge Semper this afternoon said he would issue a written opinion in response to the Congresswoman's argument to dismiss the case.

McIver pleaded not guilty in June to the three criminal charges stemming from an incident Delaney Hall in May, when McIver tried to protect Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Armed and masked ICE agents had thrown the mayor in handcuffs as he and a congressional team, including McIver, U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, and U.S. Rep. Rob Menendez sought information about detainees inside the immigration detention facility.

“The legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is — political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,” said Paul Fishman, former U.S. Attorney of New Jersey, who represents the congresswoman.

In the words of Amol Sinha, executive director of the NJ-ACLU: ""Vengeance, not governance.""

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Abdullahi Omar (D-MN), U.S. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Ca), U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-

TX), and U.S. Rep. Yvette Clark (D-NY) stood in front of the front steps of the federal building in support of their colleague.

""Our sister,"" they said.

Crockett pointedly noted that a Trump-pardoned Jan. 6 rioter faces felony charges for making a terroristic threat against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Christopher Moynihan today pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

FROM CNN: According to New York State Police, an anonymous source told the FBI that the man, Christopher Moynihan (pictured on Jan. 6th, 2021, left), had said on Friday that “in a few days, he would kill Congressman Jeffries in New York City for ‘the future,’” court records say.

As for McIver, surrounded by masked and armed agents as she tried to shield Baraka, ""She shouldn't even be on trial,"" civil rights leader Larry Hamm, founder of the People's Organization for Progress, declared. ""Donald Trump should be on trial.""

""LaMonica McIver is my congresswoman,"" Hamm told the crowd. ""I've lived in the 10th Congressional District all my life. LaMonica was arrested on May 9th. Why was she arrested? For doing her job. What was her job? Her job was to make sure there were no children in cages in Delaney Hall. Her job was to make sure our immigrant brothers and sisters were being treated like human beings in Delaney Hall. ...Immigrant rights are human rights. They think they have LaMonica McIver on trial? We're all on trial.""

Who should really be on trial, he asked.

""ICE should be on trial,"" said Hamm. ""The people who should be on trial are the people who are trying to build a fascist movement in this country. What we experiencing today is the kind of fascism that reminds me of McCarthyism.""

It equally bothers state Senator Joe Cryan (D-20), who grew up in Newark in the Vailsburg section, and

is a former law enforcement officer, and the son of a law enforcement officer.

""I had the honor of being Union County sheriff,"" said Cryan. ""When I watch people in masks, so afraid to do their job, I think to myself, 'How could this be in the United States of America?'""

Someone in the crowd yelled, ""ICE out of New Jersey!""

Cryan said, ""ICE out of New Jersey is absolutely right. When I watch that I'm absolutely horrified. This is your time. We've got our inspiration. Her name is LaMonica McIver.""

He added another observation.

""When I played basketball here, and if you watch [ICE reacting to McIver trying to defend herself and the mayor], watch it, and you say, 'How could this even be a foul? When I was playing three-on-three in Vailsburg if I called foul for that, I would get laughed at and told to man up.

""You and me together,"" Cryan told the crowd. ""It's time we man up.""

Arrested on May 9th outside Delaney Hall, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka addressed the crowd in support

of McIver, his longtime friend and ally and former student.

""We can't be the first generation to decide not to sacrifice for those who come after us,"" said the mayor. ""We have to lay it all on the line. All on the line. I don't know about you but we're willing to do that. LaMonica grew up in a community that taught her how to fight. She's been fighting all her life. Say something to her, you put your hands on her, you're going to have a fight.

""And now she's upstairs in a fight - and we want them to know there are lot of people downstairs in this fight for her. We're not going to sit idly by.""

The crowd roared its support, among them labor leader Ana Maria Hill of 32BJ SEIU, Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU NJ, Democratic State Party Chairman LeRoy Jones, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, Newark Councilman Larry Crump, Nedia Morsy of Make the Road NJ, and Sue Altman, state director for U.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ).

Where human rights defenders hold their governments to account without reprisal–and are bolstered by a multi-stakeholder, cross-regional alliance for human rights.","October 14, 2025 – Gotham Hall – New York, NY

Good evening and welcome. It’s electrifying to be here with so many friends, supporters, and allies in one room. Thank you for joining us, and special thanks to our Champion Supporters, Humanitas Media and Pyrra, our all-star Board, and welcome to our newest Board member – Mike Posner, who joined the Board today and whom some of you might have met before!

For those of you I haven’t had a chance to meet yet, Hello! I am Uzra Zeya, Human Rights First’s new President and CEO.

I took on this role of a lifetime last April, after having fought for decades to advance and defend universal human rights internationally as an American diplomat. From launching global partnerships to defend LGBTQI+ equality, to building a pipeline to relocate over 200,000 Afghans to the United States after the Taliban takeover, to rebuilding a decimated U.S. refugee admissions program to reach a 21st century resettlement peak, I’ve seen what’s possible when policymakers, civil society, and diverse stakeholders unite behind ambitious rights goals.

And I also know that, even in the best of times, the U.S. government needs robust civil society activism, embodied by this storied organization, to hold its feet to the fire to do the right thing.

But these are NOT the best of times. This is a moment when the authoritarian playbook I spent decades fighting overseas, has come home to our shores. And it’s on steroids.

You’ve seen it. Weaponization of government institutions to consolidate power, target perceived enemies, and enrich cronies. Vilification of the vulnerable – be it immigrants, trans people, people of color or persons with disabilities. Militarization of our cities, with New York looming large on the target list. Bullying and harassment of universities, law firms, and media companies, alongside targeting of rights advocates, the International Criminal Court, and philanthropic organizations – all for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.

Never has Human Rights First’s mission been more at risk, and never has it been more important. And the urgency of this moment is why tonight’s gathering is so important. Human Rights First is all-in for the fight, but we can’t do it alone or simply by preaching to the choir.

We know this, because everybody has human rights.

Let me say this another way: Human rights are for everybody.

So if we are going to rise to meet the moment–defeat authoritarianism, uphold the rule of law and protect the American way of life–we need EVERYBODY to be in the fight for human rights.

Inspired by this evening’s honorees, we are working to strengthen solidarity. To make sure that human rights advocacy is a big tent–where we welcome everybody who is willing to stand up for basic freedoms to join us in the fight.

And working with everyone in this room to make that a reality–well, that certainly is the opportunity of a lifetime.

So what does it mean to say that human rights are for everybody, and what does that look like?

At Human Rights First, we see three urgent, overlapping imperatives.

Defend the vulnerable.

Protect democracy.

Step up and lead on international human rights as the United States steps back.

And we’re doing all three by doubling down on our well-honed legal prowess, ability to unite unlikely allies, and bias towards innovation.

Defending the vulnerable:

Right now, in the United States, immigrants and refugees are bearing the brunt of the administration’s illegal power grab. Masked federal police have forced immigrants into unmarked vans. Arrested students for thought crimes. Separated families. Detained them in deplorable conditions, disappeared them, and flown them in shackles to dangerous destinations unknown to them.

It’s no time for business as usual. This is why we’re catalyzing a rapid response model that integrates our powerhouse refugee representation, policy advocacy, and litigation efforts with the cutting-edge work of our Innovation Lab.

We’re leaning in on strategic litigation, having more than quadrupled in-house capacity this year, thanks to the generosity of champions like Tracy Aanenson, Matthew Dontzin, and Tom Bernstein. We have taken the Trump administration to court to stop third country transfers without due process to war-torn countries like Libya and South Sudan and notorious torture centers like El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

We’ve sued to protect over a half million people granted humanitarian parole who face dire risks if forcibly returned to Haiti, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Venezuela, or Nicaragua.

We’ve documented abuses in U.S. immigration detention facilities. And we’ve accompanied members of Congress as they demand access to those facilities to exercise oversight.

And speaking of oversight, we’ve been so fortunate to take the baton from Tom Cartwright, one of tonight’s honorees, and continue his pioneering work tracking ICE deportation flights. HRF’s new ICE Flight Monitor brings transparency to hidden detention and enforcement operations. Tom’s example, as a retired finance exec who volunteered his time to build this methodology from scratch, reminds us of what is possible when everybody is for human rights and how it is up to each of us to protect our democracy.

So many of you in this room are also the human rights champions rising to meet this moment. With your help we continue to represent survivors of persecution. From enduring Kremlin chemical weapons attacks targeting their political activism, to facing death threats for whom they love or how they worship, to defying the will of MS-13 and other abusive thugs, our clients’ courage and resilience are inspirational. And with your help and in spite of the odds stacked against our clients, we continue to WIN these asylum cases at a success rate above 90%.

Later tonight, we will recognize our Marvin E. Frankel award winner and celebrate that lawyers are still standing beside refugees–even when cases are more challenging than before. When it feels risky.

When it’s needed more than ever.

But connecting with a lawyer is all the more difficult in today’s scorched earth environment. That’s where our Innovation Lab’s new app ReadyNow! comes in – by giving individuals at risk of ICE arrest ability to send emergency notifications with one click. Users have peace of mind to ensure their kids are picked up from school, loved ones know where they are, and that a lawyer can help them in the event the worst happens.

Defend democracy:

As I’ve seen elsewhere in the world, anti-immigrant overreach connects to a broader, ongoing assault on our democracy, as every would-be autocrat needs an enemy to scapegoat.

But in this country we still have the freedom to speak and assemble. And so, we successfully blocked the Trump administration from arresting and detaining a Columbia University student who followed her conscience to attend peaceful demonstrations.

We continue to partner with veterans who share our belief that service is about an oath to the Constitution–not to any one man. And we are recharging partnership with retired military leaders which secured bipartisan policy wins against torture over decade ago. This time it’s an even bigger battle, to protect against misuse of our military for anti-democratic ends, that requires an even bigger tent. This is where HRF’s ability to build broad-based coalitions with unlikely allies comes to the fore.

In partnership with our allies, we’re campaigning against efforts to punish and criminalize dissent. As part of that effort, our Innovation Lab created an AI-powered tool that tracks pending legislation nationwide that would infringe on people’s rights. Because in order to protect our freedoms, we need aware and engaged citizenry. And right now we’re at over 3200 regressive bills and counting in all 50 states.

Projecting international leadership on human rights:

Last month I was here in New York for the UN General Assembly. Frankly, our allies–and in fact the entire international system–are still reckoning with what it means to have the United States not only disavow, but actively undermine the rights-based order that our country did so much to bolster since World War II.

So we are rebooting our playbook. Our amped-up litigation prevented the Trump administration from punishing a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court working for justice for Darfur – a concrete step toward preserving the ability of that institution to act against impunity.

The lead litigator on that case, HRF Special Counsel Josh Colangelo, authored a memoir – a gift to all of you tonight – on his harrowing experience representing clients at Guantanamo. His is a cautionary tale on what happens when impunity is normalized in the name of security.

Rebooting our playbook and ending impunity also means not overrelying on one government to uphold the international human rights ecosystem. That’s why our powerful human rights accountability coalition of 340 organizations in 50 countries pivoted to rally the UK, Canada, EU and Australia to fill the vacuum left by retreating U.S. leadership.

That’s why we’re continuing to work with human rights defenders from Ukraine to Syria to elevate their struggles, enable their work, and help them secure new means of support.

It’s why we rallied 270 organizations worldwide to join us in urging UN member states to uphold human rights and humanitarian treaties under threat.

The odds against us may seem overwhelming, but I draw inspiration from tonight’s honorees who stood up to dictators and never wavered.

I am inspired by Evgenia and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who never stopped advocating for democracy in Russia despite Vladimir’s unjust imprisonment and multiple Kremlin attempts to poison him.

I am inspired by Richard Gere, who never ceased championing the rights of Tibetans, and spoke human rights truths to the Chinese Communist Party from the platform of the Academy Awards and paid a price for it. We might not all be movie stars, but standing strong for principles is within the power of all of us.

And finally, I am inspired by Cristosal, this year’s William D. Zabel awardee, named in honor of our Chair Emeritus, a fearless, lifelong champion for human rights and loyal benefactor to this organization. The same courage that young Bill showed in standing up to the KKK and segregationists in the 1950s and 60s is mirrored in Cristosal’s brave stance exposing rights abuses and pursuing justice for victims across Central America these last 25 years.

A few years ago it was possible to think that the task ahead of us was about returning to normalcy. Restoration.

That theory has clearly been disproven by the last 10 months, as well as the chapters of injustice that preceded it, from Guantanamo to Gaza. That’s not to say there haven’t been some positive developments as of late. We welcome the long overdue and breakthrough release of all living hostages and cessation of hostilities, as we reiterate the urgency of surging humanitarian aid, releasing all arbitrarily detained and hostage remains, and accountability for all crimes perpetrated since October 7, 2023.

But a return to a status quo that failed so many would not be desirable even if it were possible. If we are to build a future where everybody’s human rights are truly protected, our job is nothing less than reinvention.

Now, I can’t tell you exactly what that reinvention will look like. But here are some of the things I’ll be looking for:

The future we want to build will be one with a thriving multi-racial democracy where we debate differences vociferously but political violence, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, racism and all forms of hate are anathema.

Where Constitutional rights are protected no matter what you look like, whom you love or whether or not you have friends in high places.

Where human rights defenders hold their governments to account without reprisal–and are bolstered by a multi-stakeholder, cross-regional alliance for human rights.

Where the anti-immigrant tide is turned, refugees are welcomed, asylum systems are modernized and resourced, and immigration enforcement is humane and grounded in law.

Where international accountability dismantles double standards and builds guardrails to prevent tools designed to bring abusers to justice from being turned on advocates.

We may disagree about which routes to take to this destination, or how fast or far, but we can only get there together. In that spirit of solidarity, we are unveiling a branding refresh intended to uplift and bring forward more allies to step up for human rights.

So let’s get moving. Human rights are for everybody. And right now we urgently need everybody to be for human rights.

Thank you for being with us and helping us get there.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Title-Card-2.png,N,,2025-10-21 15:01:52.466801

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds.
Ensign challenged that finding at Tuesday’s hearing, but all three appeals court judges cast doubt on Ensign’s arguments.
Khalil’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Farbiarz had correctly blocked the Trump administration from using the foreign-policy provision.
Khalil’s lawyers have said they intend to appeal the deportation order.","Bibas, in particular, scoffed at an argument by a lawyer for the government that the lower-court judge, Michael Farbiarz, didn’t have jurisdiction over the case because Khalil’s lawyers hadn’t properly filed a petition for his release in the appropriate district. In the hours following his arrest on March 8, Khalil was moved several times over the course of a weekend, and his lawyers filed the petition in Manhattan based on inaccurate information provided by the government.

The government lawyer, Drew Ensign, suggested Khalil’s lawyers should have waited to file the petition.

“They’re dealing with a situation where, you know, immigrants have been spirited out of the country in a matter of a day or two,” Bibas said to Ensign. “Are they acting unreasonably?”

After Ensign began to answer, Bibas interrupted him, saying: “I’m asking, should we adopt a rule that allows the executive to remove someone from the country in 24 to 48 hours and say there’s no jurisdiction anywhere until the courts open on Monday, by which time he’s on a plane?”

Bibas continued: “If our rule says, wait until … the system is updated Monday morning, the executive might spirit the person out of the country over the weekend. Are you asking us to adopt a rule that says when there’s a lag in the database that’s all on their lawyers and then Monday morning — ‘Sayonara, sorry, he’s gone’?”

For more than three months earlier this year, Khalil was held in detention in Louisiana after the Trump administration arrested him, invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to deport any noncitizen — even a legal resident — if the secretary of State determines that the person’s continued presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds. Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.

Farbiarz also ruled that continuing to detain Khalil while his immigration case proceeded would have impeded his First Amendment rights. Ensign challenged that finding at Tuesday’s hearing, but all three appeals court judges cast doubt on Ensign’s arguments.

Khalil’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Farbiarz had correctly blocked the Trump administration from using the foreign-policy provision. One judge, Hardiman, asked “why shouldn’t the government have the power to remove people from the country that are harmful to the country?”

“I think the answer is, it has many means to do so, but it can’t be based on lawful, protected speech, political — particularly core political — speech,” said Bobby Hodgson, a lawyer for Khalil. “And I think to find otherwise, and to find that Mr. Khalil cannot make out a First Amendment claim.”

Hardiman asked if the argument would be the same if it wasn’t core political speech, but instead “material support for terrorism.”

“I think that is a different analysis, and reasonably so,” Hodgson replied. “I think this is the exceptional case where it is about core political speech.”

Last month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered Khalil deported to Syria or Algeria based on another rationale the Trump administration tacked on after Khalil’s arrest in Manhattan: failing to disclose certain information, including all his past employment and membership in organizations, on his green card application.

The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization that serves asylum seekers in the U.S., sued the Trump administration this month after hearing from thousands of members confused by the new asylum policy.
“We don’t want the annual asylum fee to be used to wrongfully dismiss peoples’ asylum cases, especially since asylum seekers may not know about this fee or have no mechanism to pay it,” said Conchita Cruz, co-founder and co-executive director at ASAP.
The agency began sending notices to asylum seekers on Oct. 1, instructing recipients to pay the fee within 30 days.
USCIS launched a portal to pay soon after, but a number of asylum seekers are still awaiting official notification and instructions for how to pay.","“It just feels like people are being cornered from every angle, and the lack of clarity just causes that much more fear and intimidation,” said Robin Nice, an immigration attorney in Boston. “It’s hard to know if it’s weaponized incompetence in how they’re rolling it out, or if it’s straight up malicious … but it’s really hard to advise clients.”

The fees, which are new, were part of the GOP’s domestic policy and tax law President Donald Trump signed on July 4, but the administration’s rollout has been plagued by mishaps: The two agencies collecting the fees initially released different instructions, and only one has offered a vehicle to pay the annual fee.

Payment notices to asylum seekers have been sporadic, and misinformation has run rampant on social media.

Some asylum seekers who have opted to pay the immigration courts $100 say there’s no way to know whether that’s the correct way to pay or whether the federal government will ask them to pay again, according to court filings, immigration attorneys and asylum seekers who spoke with POLITICO.

“I don’t think chaos and confusion is part of the point. The fee amounts themselves are designed to be prohibitive while being just under the line of impossible,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The new fees are just one component of the administration’s sweeping effort to permanently alter the immigration system. They come after the White House announced plans last month to overhaul H-1B visas, a move that briefly spurred panic inside corporations. The One Big Beautiful Bill also included a number of other new fees and fee increases for immigration benefits, including an initial $550 fee for asylum work permit applications.

The administration has also revoked Temporary Protected Status, a program that allows immigrants from countries facing humanitarian crises to remain in the U.S. and work legally, and terminated parole for millions of immigrants.

The new $100 fee for every year an asylum application is pending, which is in addition to a new $100 application fee, is in part, designed to deter mass migration and limit access to legal pathways Republicans say have long been abused and have contributed to a massive backlog in the immigration courts. It’s a similar rationale the administration gave for curtailing TPS and reforming the H-1B program.

The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. The White House deferred to the agencies implementing the policy. But in a court filing late Monday in federal district court, DOJ lawyers defended the fees and said the agencies are moving to finalize the policy’s implementation.

“Congress made clear that these new asylum fees were long overdue and necessary to recover the growing costs of adjudicating the millions of pending asylum applications,” the lawyers wrote.

The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization that serves asylum seekers in the U.S., sued the Trump administration this month after hearing from thousands of members confused by the new asylum policy. The organization filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the fees should not apply to those who had cases pending before the president signed the bill into law and that it’s a misread of the legislation.

“We don’t want the annual asylum fee to be used to wrongfully dismiss peoples’ asylum cases, especially since asylum seekers may not know about this fee or have no mechanism to pay it,” said Conchita Cruz, co-founder and co-executive director at ASAP.

Alba, an ASAP member, applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 after coming to the United States from Honduras. She has not received official notice from the agency about her fee, and as of Monday, is still unable to submit the $100, she said. POLITICO agreed to only use her first name because she fears retribution.

“We have had so much fear, so much anxiety,” said Alba, adding that she is worried she won’t have the cash on hand to pay when the government gives her official notice. “And then you have to be ready to pay at whatever moment [the government] tells you that you have to pay.”

Asylum seekers’ cases are handled by either USCIS or the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. Depending on the circumstances, immigrants sometimes begin their asylum process with one agency, and are later asked to apply with the other — adding another challenge to the Trump administration’s implementation.

USCIS’ initial instructions said the first payments would not be due until Sept. 30, at the earliest, for those who filed applications before October 2024. The agency began sending notices to asylum seekers on Oct. 1, instructing recipients to pay the fee within 30 days. USCIS launched a portal to pay soon after, but a number of asylum seekers are still awaiting official notification and instructions for how to pay.

EOIR, for its part, announced the first annual fees would affect those who applied for asylum a year or more prior to July 5, but it has yet to provide a mechanism to submit those payments. The website only has a place for immigrants to submit the $100 initial asylum fee.

Justice Department lawyers on Monday said that while EOIR and USCIS initially released differing instructions, EOIR has revised its position to reflect USCIS’ timeline and is “taking steps to finalize” its payment process. The agency, like USCIS, will send official notices to applicants once its payment mechanism is finalized, and asylum seekers will then have 30 days from the date of the notice to make the payment.

“There was no unreasonable delay here in EOIR’s implementation,” the filing said. “The record shows several steps were required to finalize EOIR’s process, including coordination with USCIS. Regardless, Plaintiff’s request is now moot.”

The government also argued that the law intended the fees to be retroactive, and said the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that its members will suffer irreparable harm — requesting that the court deny the request for a preliminary injunction.

But ASAP has received reports that some immigration judges at EOIR have already required applicants to have paid the application fee, and in one case, rejected an asylum application and ordered the person to be deported for non-payment, according to the organization’s Oct. 3 filing.

Other asylum seekers with pending cases before the courts, out of desperation, have submitted $100 toward the initial application fee to EOIR, leaving them unsure if the money will ultimately count as their annual fee — or if the government will soon request $100 more.

“A good number of clients have against our advice, frankly, have paid that initial fee with the idea that it should be applied for the annual fee,” Nice, the Boston attorney, said. “I’m skeptical that it’ll be interpreted that way.”

Jorge, another ASAP member whose last name is being withheld for fear of retribution, came to the U.S. in 2023 from Colombia and has an asylum case before EOIR. On Oct. 1, he saw posts on social media about the money being due and has repeatedly tried to pay through the USCIS portal. The website has crashed and denied his payments. He tried again on Monday, but the website says his fee isn’t due.

“I am willing to pay, and have been trying to pay, but it is necessary that the government give clear and precise instructions, because what I don’t want to do is pay $100 and then be told that I didn’t pay the right $100 or to lose those $100,” he said. “I’m so worried that they’re going to close my case and deport me if I don’t pay.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F12%2Fef%2Fb05600f5475cb642cfbf30b25c1e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2179739846,N,,2025-10-21 14:04:30.012698

Outside the barbed wire fence of Delaney Hall, people of diverse faiths and religious backgrounds remain present: praying, singing, and fighting for the rights of those locked inside.","Rev. Dr. Robin Tanner braced herself as Newark, New Jersey, police officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, some with their faces covered by masks or bandanas, approached.

Behind Tanner—who serves at the Beacon Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Summit, New Jersey—and the fifty or so other clergy members with her at the protest on May 12, 2025, loomed the hulking gray form of Delaney Hall, surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire. Delaney Hall is a for-profit ICE detention center run by the GEO Group, one of the two largest private prison operators in the United States, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The clergy, among them eight UU ministers, blocked the flow of traffic in and out of Delaney Hall, attempting to disrupt operations as much as possible. The group sang hymns and protest songs together, including the civil rights anthem, “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.”

Demonstrators who spoke with UU World described the conditions within Delaney Hall as not just immoral but illegal, saying that ICE has denied family visitation rights, prevented state officials and members of Congress from inspecting the facility, and not released the names of people being detained.

When the law enforcement officers and federal agents drew closer, Tanner recalls, they reached down to separate her from the others who were sitting in a row, arms linked in solidarity. Tanner and the rest of the clergy were pulled apart from each other and forcibly taken from the gate, she said.

While no clergy were arrested at the event, two activists were, according to The Jersey Vindicator. Protesters described the scene as frightening and stressful, and they feared they would be arrested as police rushed and surrounded them.

In the fight against the Trump administration’s agenda of mass incarceration and deportation of migrants, Delaney Hall is one of many flashpoints. These kinds of demonstrations joined or led by leaders from different religions are part of a broader faith-based resistance movement challenging ICE’s tactics. In some cases, as in Newark, the actions are met with force.

Despite the risks, Tanner said she felt called by her religious beliefs to oppose the detention center and its reported practices.

“This just can’t happen under our watch,” said Tanner. “They’re creating these detention facilities that are like concentration camps where basic human rights are being denied.”

When reached for comment by email, GEO Group referred UU World to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE. A DHS public affairs officer responded to UU World’s questions about the May 12 protest—which happened about five months before the magazine emailed for comment—and related issues, with a statement asserting that ICE “will not comment on articles or events that are more than six months old.”

“Allegations and politically driven claims about ICE’s Delaney Hall Detention Facility made six months ago or more do not accurately represent the current conditions at the facility,” according to the DHS statement. “ICE never purposely puts others in danger.”

Though the agency made no mention of the clergy members, it argued that “public safety is of the upmost concern and extreme individuals causing chaos, ensuing violence or obstructing operations outside of our gates will be thwarted.”

Newark Police Department emailed UU World a statement asserting that during the May protests, it provided “public safety services and crowd support” and dealt with mostly traffic incidents.

“Police response was aimed at ensuring the safety of protesters outside the facility, which is located along a high-traffic thoroughfare,” according to the police statement.

Tanner and other Unitarian Universalists expressed outrage at the federal government’s actions and described their resistance to ICE as a matter of moral, spiritual, and legal urgency.

“Our religion called us to this place, to expose this evil,” said Tanner.

Prophetic Witness at a Dangerous Scene

Some UUs at Delaney Hall described the protest as an act of necessary prophetic witness against ICE.

Rev. Anya Sammler-Michael, who serves at the UU Congregation of Montclair, New Jersey, said her UU faith drives her to “struggle against” the treatment of immigrants at the facility.

“We are witnessing incredible acts of hate being perpetuated by our government, across our nation and to the most vulnerable among us,” Sammler-Michael said.

Erol Delos Santos, a graduate of Union Theological Seminary who is preparing for the UU ministry, said he was inspired to protest ICE after witnessing the agency’s wave of arrests and deportations in other parts of the country, such as the arrest of legal U.S. resident and pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil.

“I felt like I had to do something,” said Delos Santos, who is a first-generation Filipino immigrant. “All it would take for ICE to arrest me is for me to not have ID with me that day.”

At the Delaney Hall protest in May, Delos Santos said, ICE agents trying to break the line of protesters grabbed and pushed him aside.

Delos Santos said he felt a moral and spiritual imperative to protest ICE, even at the risk of arrest and physical harm.

“Immigrants are the driving force of this country,” he said. “And it’s not fair to be able to lock people up for no reason.

A Pattern of Violence Against Protesters—and Members of Congress

Three days before the clergy protest, on May 9, another confrontation with ICE officers at Delaney Hall led to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

Baraka and three members of Congress, including New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, attempted to tour and inspect the detention center and were told to leave, according to NBC News.

“The situation devolved when ICE ran out of the gate and roughed up the congressional delegation,” said Tanner, who was there during Baraka’s arrest.

ICE agents were “being incredibly rough,” pushing and shoving the congressional delegation, and Tanner said she witnessed “an arm jab to the shoulder of one of the congresspeople.”

Federal prosecutors accused Baraka of trespassing. He was released that same evening. The charges against him were later dropped.

As of October 16, McIver faces charges of felony assault and having resisted and impeded law enforcement officers, which she says are baseless and politically motivated, reports the Associated Press. She has pleaded not guilty and faces up to seventeen years in prison if convicted.

Charlene Walker, executive director of Faith in New Jersey, a nonprofit that helped to coordinate the interfaith clergy protest, was present at both events. Walker, who attends the Beacon UU congregation, said police at the May 12 demonstration dragged her away from Delaney Hall by her leg.

“I feel like I should be more traumatized than I am,” said Walker. “But there’s something about standing in righteousness, in my faith, and saying that we can’t tolerate our neighbors being disappeared that I think has given all of us some level of strength.”

Regarding Baraka’s arrest, Walker said that ICE was intentional and aggressive in targeting the mayor and congresspeople.

“If they will put their hands on members of congress,” said Walker, “we have to ask the question: What are they doing behind closed doors where nobody can see?”

‘There is Something that Everyone, Every Single Person, Can Do’

Following the protest, Walker said the situation remains morally and legally dire.

Some lawyers have still been denied visits at times per a NJ.com report, and detainees reportedly have faced inhumane conditions such as hunger. In June, four detainees escaped Delaney Hall amid unrest caused by a lack of meals, according to ABC News.

Sammler-Michael emphasized the value of nonviolent resistance and partnership with other groups and faith communities.

Then ICE Arrested Her Father,Patrick Filbin,,,,,https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/21/a-chicago-high-schooler-had-just-returned-from-chemotherapy-then-ice-arrested-her-father/,"For almost a year, Ofelia Torres, a student at Lake View High School, has been receiving treatment for a rare and aggressive form of cancer.
Ruben Torres’ partner and Ofelia’s mom, Sandibell, is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since 1998.
Ruben Torres, 40, has no criminal record apart from minor traffic infractions, according to court records his attorney filed.
Valerie Wadycki, Ofelia’s in-home teacher for the past nine months, started a fundraiser to help pay for Ruben Torres’ legal fees.
“Later that day, he told me he was thinking that he felt like he made it in life,” Ofelia Torres said.","LAKEVIEW — When 16-year-old Ofelia Torres’ father called from the Broadview ICE facility to say he had been taken by four masked federal immigration agents, the teen’s mother was at home helping drain the small IV port that keeps Ofelia nourished and alive during Stage 4, while the teenager showed her cousins how the small medical contraption worked.

For almost a year, Ofelia Torres, a student at Lake View High School, has been receiving treatment for a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She had been home from the hospital for less than a day when the call came Saturday.

She’d just finished 39 days of treatment at Lurie Children’s Hospital, including another grueling round of chemotherapy. The night before her dad disappeared, she walked slowly through her backyard and lay in her own bed for the first time in weeks. The familiar smell of her house, the weight of her blankets, “felt like a dream,” she said.

When the call from an unknown number came in, the dream turned into a nightmare.

“In my head, I knew it,” she said. “I knew they got my dad.”

Ruben Torres, a house painter and self-employed contract worker who has lived in Chicago since 2003 with his partner of 20 years, was detained Saturday in suburban Niles by ICE agents, according to court documents.

Ruben Torres’ attorney, Kalman Resnick, filed an emergency motion asking a federal judge to order his release, arguing that his detention is unlawful and violates his constitutional right to due process.

On Saturday afternoon, Ruben Torres was coming out of a Home Depot at 8650 Dempster St. in Niles when federal agents called for him by name, family members said. Photos and video show signs of forced entry to Ruben Torres’ truck. The passenger-side window was cracked in multiple spots.

Ruben Torres’ partner and Ofelia’s mom, Sandibell, is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since 1998. She’s now taking care of their two children alone.

Ruben Torres, 40, has no criminal record apart from minor traffic infractions, according to court records his attorney filed. He’s been his family’s sole provider, working for the same boss for 20 years, while Sandibell cares for their children, Ofelia and 4-year-old Nathan.

Resnick’s filing argues that ICE is holding Ruben Torres under a new interpretation of immigration law rolled out by the Department of Homeland Security in July, which treats long-term residents who entered without inspection as “applicants for admission” subject to mandatory detention — a policy multiple courts around the country have found unlawful.

ICE has not filed formal charges with the immigration court, but Resnick believes the government intends to initiate removal proceedings on the grounds that Ruben Torres entered the United States without inspection. His case is assigned to the Chicago Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations.

A bond hearing for Ruben Torres is scheduled for Thursday morning.

“Absent relief, he faces the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his community and family, including his terminally ill daughter who may die in the interim,” according to Resnick’s petition.

The doctor overseeing Ofelia Torres’ care at Lurie Children’s Hospital wrote that her “ongoing complex medical care requires the support of both her parents during this very difficult time,” according to court documents.

Valerie Wadycki, Ofelia’s in-home teacher for the past nine months, started a fundraiser to help pay for Ruben Torres’ legal fees. It’s raised over $23,000 in less than two days.

Any funds that are collected that the family doesn’t need will be donated to other families impacted by ICE activity. That was Ofelia Torres’ idea.

“This is a testament to the kind of person her family raised,” Wadycki wrote.

Ofelia Torres decided to share her family’s story thanks to an unrelated nudge her dad gave her at the beginning of her cancer treatment. He thought she should document and share her journey to show people what she’s going through. He thinks vulnerability is a sign of strength, Ofelia Torres said.

“I didn’t want to because I was scared,” she said. “I was scared of what people would think of me.”

But now, things are different. Ofelia Torres didn’t feel like hiding anymore, she said. When she posted a video on social media explaining what happened to her dad, it was the first time even some family members had seen her without her long, dark hair.

“Now he’s in a vulnerable situation, and I feel like I have to step up,” she said. “This is partially a way I can fulfill that. I let everyone know my diagnosis. Most importantly, I let them know what they did to him and what type of person he is.”

Her dad is the “hardest working person” she’s ever met, Ofelia Torres said. He would go to work on three hours of sleep and wouldn’t complain a bit. He’ll often get work based on his reputation alone, she said.

The guys who work with Ruben Torres told Ofelia Torres her dad takes the extra effort to do his work the right way. And yet, he somehow always makes time for his family.

“He’s such a good dad,” Ofelia Torres said. “He’s such a present dad.”

Ofelia Torres got a car for her 15th birthday. After she took it for the ceremonial ride around the block, music blaring from the speakers, her dad was waiting for her on the front porch. He was staring at her when she walked up the sidewalk, but in a weird, dad kind of way, Ofelia said. She thought she had something on her face.

“Later that day, he told me he was thinking that he felt like he made it in life,” Ofelia Torres said. “That everything he had worked for, everything, all those hours he put in, everything he sacrificed, everything that he did was worth it, because his daughter was driving a car by herself.”

The thought of federal agents aggressively removing her dad from his own car ​​is too much to bear.

“To be aggressive with him and violent with him when all he’s wanted in life is to come to this country and work for his kids, it breaks my heart,” Ofelia Torres said. “That’s the case for so many other families, too, and it’s horrible.”

On the morning Ruben Torres was taken, Ofelia Torres had made herself a cup of coffee at home and gave her dad a hug before he left for work. She forgot to eat, so later that morning, she texted him and asked if it was OK to use his card to order breakfast.

Ruben Torres texted her back right away.

“Si,” he wrote.

“He never cares how much I spend on it; he just wants me to let him know ahead of time,” Ofelia said. “And I knew he would see $30 and ask, ‘How much McDonald’s did Nathan eat?’”

She laughed at the thought of the imaginary reaction he would have had, but never got the chance to give.

Her dad sounded calm on the phone, Ofelia said. Strong too.

Like father, like daughter.

The deal marks the latest effort by the Trump administration to limit asylum applications in the US and carry out a campaign of mass deportation.

The two countries signed the agreement on Monday, with Belize calling it an act “grounded in the commitment of states to cooperate under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees”.

In a statement posted on Facebook, its government press office wrote, “The Agreement reinforces Belize’s commitment to international law and humanitarian principles while ensuring strong national safeguards.”

The US State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, meanwhile, thanked Belize in a post on X.

The deal, it said, was “an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation’s asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together.”

“Safe third country” agreements are a controversial tactic used to restrict asylum applications: They identify countries asylum seekers can be safely removed to, regardless of whether that is their intended destination.

The details of Monday’s agreement are as yet unclear. But the Central American country indicated it would receive US asylum seekers in exchange for “financial and technical assistance to enhance Belize’s asylum and border management policies”.

Criticisms of third-party deportations

Since Trump returned to office for a second term in January, his administration has repeatedly lobbied third-party countries to accept deportations, though few such deals have been termed “safe third country” accords.

Nearly a dozen countries — including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Mexico, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda — have since agreed to receive US deportees with no existing ties to their nations.

Just this month, Guatemala received its first deportation flight from the US carrying third-country immigrants.

How safe some of those countries are has been a point of contention. Critics have pointed out that deportees could face abusive prison conditions or a lack of due process in countries like South Sudan, where the US State Department advises its citizens not to travel for fear of armed conflict.

Already, lawyers for five men deported to Eswatini have claimed they have been incarcerated and denied legal hearings.

“Safe third country” agreements, by contrast, are specifically for asylum seekers, and they are meant to assure the rights and wellbeing of those involved.

But critics have long argued that they fail to fully guarantee the safety of asylum seekers, some of whom are removed to countries near the ones they fled, where they could still be vulnerable to persecution.

Some human rights experts also believe “safe third country” agreements could be used to erode adherence to international humanitarian law, allowing wealthy countries like the US to shirk their legal responsibilities to asylum seekers.

In Monday’s statement, Belize sought to dispel any accusation that the Trump administration might be using the Central American nation as a “dumping ground” for migrants, as advocates in other third-party countries have alleged.

Belize claimed it retained “an absolute veto over transfers, with restrictions on nationalities, a cap on transferees, and comprehensive security screenings”.

“No person who is deemed to be a threat to the public safety or national security will be allowed to enter or stay in Belize,” it added.

The deal still needs approval from the Belize Senate.

A growing trend

For its part, the Trump administration has argued that deals with third-party countries are necessary in cases where migrants and asylum seekers are unable to return to their home countries.

In the case of asylum seekers, however, it would be a violation of US and international law to return them to countries where they might face persecution.

Still, in other cases, the US has argued that the deportees’ home countries have refused to accept them.

But recent events have cast doubt on that rationale. In September, for instance, one man deported from the US to Eswatini was sent back to his home country of Jamaica.

This month’s deportation flight to Guatemala also saw Honduran passengers returned to their home country.

Some countries, however, do have policies refusing to accept deportations from the US, even if those transfers involve their own citizens.

Venezuela, for instance, has intermittently refused deportation flights from the US, though in March it reversed course and began accepting them.

The South American had protested the deportation of its citizens from the US to El Salvador, where more than 200 people were sent to a maximum-security prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) that month.

In July, the Trump administration struck a deal that allowed the Venezuelans imprisoned in El Salvador to be returned to their home country, in exchange for the release of US citizens and political prisoners held in Venezuela.

But Venezuela-US relations have since soured once more, leaving the future of deportation flights to Caracas unclear.

As Belize faces the prospect of accepting asylum seekers who are unable to return to their home country, some politicians have already voiced strong opposition.

Tracy Taegar Panton, an opposition leader in Belize, questioned whether her country should even qualify as a “safe third country”.

“To be designated a ‘Safe Third Country,’ Belize must demonstrate that it can guarantee human rights protections and provide a high standard of care including access to housing, healthcare, legal representation, and social services for asylum seekers,” she wrote on social media.

“The reality, however, is stark. Our immigration and asylum systems are understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed.”

She added that the agreement was beyond the country’s capacity to fulfil.

“Belize cannot and must not be used as a dumping ground for individuals other countries refuse to accept,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-21T003140Z_1179933599_RC2QFHAZLUQP_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO-1761056409.jpg?resize=1829%2C1080,N,,2025-10-21 15:01:55.434710

If Trump has become a king, then Congress is the court jester who has allowed it to happen.
Under President George W. Bush, Congress passed the Patriot Act which transferred significant decision-making authority from the courts and Congress to the executive branch allowing surveillance, searches and detentions with minimal external review.

Following the lead of his predecessors, President Trump has pushed the limits of executive branch authority.","This past weekend, hundreds of thousands of people participated in “No Kings” rallies across the country, including here in West Virginia, to protest Trump administration policies. The overarching theme of the rallies was that President Trump has pushed the authority of the executive branch too far and by doing so has turned the presidency into the singular source of power in the government.

If Trump has become a king, then Congress is the court jester who has allowed it to happen.

Since the turn of the century, Congress has become a vestigial organ of the three equal branches of government, unable to perform the most basic duties. The federal government is shutdown and federal employees are either furloughed or working without a paycheck because members of congress are unable to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government for several weeks, let alone pass all 12 appropriations bills on time.

Republicans and Democrats the House of Representatives and the Senate have been willing participants in the expansion of executive branch authority and only raise alarm when a member of the opposite party is in the White House.

Under President George W. Bush, Congress passed the Patriot Act which transferred significant decision-making authority from the courts and Congress to the executive branch allowing surveillance, searches and detentions with minimal external review. The Bush administration also promoted Unitary Executive Theory which justified the President’s ability to interpret laws independently of Congress and the court.

President Barack Obama continued the trend of expanding presidential authority using executive action in 2012 to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The administration delayed key provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) despite statutory deadlines in the law itself. The administration unilaterally set new climate regulations, used executive orders to establish new restrictions on the Second Amendment and used signing statements challenging or interpreting congressional intent in appropriations and national security legislation.

Congress even conceded its power to approve treaties when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, allowing President Obama to lift sanctions on Iran and implement a new nuclear agreement without formal congressional approval.

The expansion continued under the Biden administration as the president used executive orders to reverse many of the policies of the first Trump presidency, bypassing Congress to set policy in key areas like civil rights, climate and public health. President Biden attempted to cancel vast amounts of federal student loan debt through executive action and sidestep Congress setting new immigration policy for asylum seekers, refugee caps and enforcement protocols.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress have taken turns over the last quarter century expressing their outrage or approval of the executive branch’s actions, depending on who is in the White House. Congress has allowed current and past presidents to assume increasing authority either through legislative action or by simply ignoring its responsibilities.

Following the lead of his predecessors, President Trump has pushed the limits of executive branch authority. He is not a king and a new president will be elected in 2028. It is up to Congress to restore balance and to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations rather than engage in political theatre that more closely resembles a satirical skit befitting the court jester, than actual governance.",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:57:14.450583

We urge the Inter-American Commission to investigate — the United States should not be held to a different standard than the rest of the international community.”","Following a July 24, 2025 public hearing held by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that examined widespread human rights and refugee law violations inflicted by the U.S. government, a coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations that participated in the hearing submitted a follow-up report to the Commission this week. The organizations include Al Otro Lado, Americans for Immigrant Justice, Amnesty International, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Hope Border Institute, Human Rights First, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, the International Refugee Assistance Project, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, RAICES, and Refugees International.

The report addresses questions raised by the Commissioners during the public hearing and includes recommendations for IACHR to investigate and document the mass human rights abuses committed by the United States. Since the hearing took place, the human rights situation in the United States has only deteriorated further. The report documents worsening abuses in the immigration context including:

Disappearances of immigrants who are unfindable in government custody for prolonged periods, causing severe anguish for families and making legal representation impossible. Recently, over 1,000 people reportedly disappeared from a single detention center.

Arbitrary detention in life-threatening conditions, including in dangerous ICE jails where at least 16 people have died from January to September 2025, with reports of delayed or denied medical care leading up to some of the deaths.

Skyrocketing illegal arrests, detention, deportation, and assaults against immigrants, including families with children, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and people with Temporary Protected Status.

Unbearable conditions, medical neglect, and abuses in immigration jails that inflict trauma on adults and children, with one fourteen-year-old child recounting: “[b]eing here has affected my little brother a lot. He doesn’t sleep well. He cries all night. Yesterday he had an attack where he would not stop crying from 7pm to 9pm and he was outside the room crying that he didn’t want to go back in and that he wanted to be free.”

Widespread separation of immigrant parents from their babies, toddlers, and children, with reports of families seeking asylum in the United States forced to choose between being separated from their children or returning to persecution; children placed in foster care after their parents are detained; and children dragged from their beds, zip-tied, and separated from parents.

Expulsions and deportations of people to third countries where they face arbitrary imprisonment, torture, return to danger in home countries, and other rights violations. The U.S. government has carried out some of these forced removals in violation of court orders and with little to no transparency around the terms of the agreements with third countries.

Mass violations of due process protections and refugee law resulting from the government’s systematic efforts to strip people of the right to an immigration hearing regardless of how long they have lived in the United States, and to shut down asylum processing for people fleeing to the United States-Mexico border.

Attempts to conceal abuses and block legal access, including reprisals against lawyers, advocates, journalists, and governmentofficials; the dismantling of oversight agencies; and the denial of statutorily-mandated access to detention centers for Members of Congress.

“The disappearances, mass arrests and detentions, abusive detention conditions, and other human rights violations occurring in the United States threaten all communities and undermine our Nation’s most fundamental values,” Sui Chung, Executive Director, Americans for Immigrant Justice. “We call on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the U.S. Government, and the public to shine light on these problems and take decisive action to end them. The time is now to confront these violations with transparency and urgency.”

“The Trump administration is terrorizing immigrants in the United States through mass disappearance and detention tactics that have caused family separation, increasingly concerning deaths in detention, and third country deportations to danger,” said Margaret Cargioli, directing attorney, policy and advocacy, at Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef). “We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, as well as to conduct site visits of detention facilities as people’s lives are at risk.”

“In less than a year, we have seen this administration strip noncitizens of due process rights, separate families, and deport people to countries they’ve never been to before,” said Maria Fernanda Palacios Herrera, Policy Counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP). “The international community must speak out against the widespread terror and violence inflicted upon asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrant communities by the Trump administration. We respectfully request the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights call on the United States government to cease these human rights violations immediately.”

“The cruelty inflicted on immigrants in the United States reverberates far beyond its borders,” said Taylor Koehler, Policy & Programs Staff Attorneyat theCenter for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL). “Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable. As a global community, we cannot allow that precedent to take hold. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to act with urgency and use every tool within its power to protect immigrants and uphold fundamental human rights in the United States.”

“The Trump administration’s policies are sowing fear and forcing people to make terrible decisions, violently uprooting community members, separating families, disappearing people to abusive detention conditions and to countries where they are in danger or that they don’t know,” said Yael Schacher, Director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “We ask that the IACHR help to stop these violations of human rights by documenting harm, demanding accountability, and promoting an alternative, humane approach to migrants and asylum seekers in countries throughout the Americas.”

“Over the course of the past 10 months, the administration has continued to escalate its attacks on immigrants throughout the United States, both living in our communities and in immigration detention,” said Laura St. John, Legal Director at the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Our clients are reporting extremely alarming conditions in detention centers, more people are at risk of being removed to third countries to which they have no ties, and immigration enforcement is terrorizing our communities. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to sound the alarm on danger and violence that immigrant communities in the United States are being subjected to and ask the Commission to demand that the U.S. government immediately halt all actions that violate the human rights of immigrants in the United States.”

“My colleagues and I know the truth behind the charade. The goal is the money. The strategy is shock and awe. The tactic is terror. The tactic is violence. The tactic is torture. Sadly, this administration no longer needs to work with Central American dictators to house innocent men in mega-prisons because there’s a burgeoning one here at Ft. Bliss,” said Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center.

“This year, we have witnessed people kidnapped from their communities, separated from their children, and arbitrarily detained in deplorable conditions,” said Yannick Gill, Senior Counsel at Human Rights First. “The escalating violations of U.S. and international law deny migrants and asylum seekers their rights under the law. We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government. We urge the United States to end its systematic attacks on immigrants, the dismantling of oversight mechanisms, and retaliation against advocates who seek to shine a light on its rights abuses.”

“The U.S. government is terrorizing people, destroying their physical and mental health in horrendous detention conditions, refusing to listen to their asylum claims, retaining their personal property including original ID documents, and then sending them to Mexico,” said Gretchen Kuhner, Director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI). “Once in Mexico they have no information, no documentation, and are either dumped in the streets near the Mexico-Guatemalan border or deported to their countries of origin. In just nine months, Mexico has received over 11,000 third country nationals from the U.S., many of whom have been separated from their families. We urge the IACHR to denounce these egregious human rights violations that have stripped people of their basic dignity.”

“The United States government continues to wield its outsized and unaccountable geo-political power to enact brutal, prevention-through-deterrence migration policies—where brutality towards certain people seeking lawful protections is the point—and to strong-arm other States in the Americas to do the same,” said Erik Crew, Staff Attorney at Haitian Bridge Alliance (HBA). “These policies continue to target those who should be protected by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the American Convention on Human Rights. We urge the Commission to investigate these escalating violations and hold accountable all States in the region whose bilateral agreements empower these attacks on international human rights, refugee protections, and basic human dignity.”

“As we continue to support migrant families on the U.S. side of the border looking for their relatives in immigration detention, attending to their urgent needs for pastoral and mental health care, and arranging care for their kids in the midst of the true fear of being separated, we also accompany others stranded in Mexico due to the closure of our border to those most vulnerable. This is not just a law enforcement campaign, it’s terror,” said Jesús de la Torre, Assistant Director for Global Migration at the Hope Border Institute. “We thank the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for listening to the testimonies of all the mothers, neighbors and friends who have been brutally impacted by these policies, and we encourage the Commission to keep shedding light on these systemic abuses. The borderlands know well that, in the persistent fight for human dignity, fear never has the last word. We stand committed to uphold our welcoming identity and will continue to organize to support policies that keep families together and help our communities thrive.”

“From Inauguration Day onward, the Trump administration has weaponized racist pretext as a means to further the president’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Javier Hidalgo, legal director at RAICES. “At RAICES, we are deeply troubled by the administration’s consistent opacity and lack of procedural safeguards, but we will not be swayed from our fight for due process and against the unlawful disappearance of people and families. Let us be clear, what we say to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, we also say to the world: fundamental humanitarian protections should never be up for debate.”

“The U.S. government has long treated immigrants with cruelty — abusive detention practices, family separation, and racial profiling are not new. What’s different now is the scale,” said Hollie Webb, Supervising Attorney for Al Otro Lado’s Border Rights Project. “The Trump administration has taken decades of abusive policies and turned them into a machinery of mass disappearance, deportation, and fear. These practices never should have been allowed to exist, and it’s because past abuses were ignored that this government can now act with total impunity. We urge the Inter-American Commission to investigate — the United States should not be held to a different standard than the rest of the international community.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/acf6ac_885405d6f8aa4a65bc54f0a9e839f951~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_940,h_705,al_c/acf6ac_885405d6f8aa4a65bc54f0a9e839f951~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-21 16:01:33.576674

The agency said Mejia first entered the U.S. illegally in 2015 and was released into the country during the Obama administration.

He was ordered to be removed by an immigration judge in December 2019 and was removed by ICE in 2020 during the first Trump administration, but illegally returned at a later date, officials said. Mejia is from Guatemala.

""Wilmer Fuentes Mejia is a criminal illegal alien from Guatemala who has a history of driving while intoxicated and was previously deported by ICE in 2020. A local DA allowed him to walk free after multiple DUIs only to then cause this fatal hit-and-run that killed an innocent 61-year-old man in North Carolina,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Richard Ferguson Jr. will get justice. ICE lodged a detainer for this criminal to ensure this menace and public safety threat isn't released back onto America’s streets.""
