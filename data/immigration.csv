But police officials have said those agreements enable officers to take part in law enforcement operations aimed at transnational crimes such as drug or human trafficking— and that they do not allow officers to join in immigration enforcement.
In the 2025 legislative session, Rhoads introduced a bill to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from collaborating with the federal government for immigration purposes except in limited cases.
Rhoads returned repeatedly to the question of whether ICE has been violating constitutionally guaranteed due process rights during arrests.
“I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.” On other fronts, too, there are efforts to draw lines related to immigration enforcement.","The table of immigration-related bills in the Hawaiʻi Legislature’s next session was at least partially set Monday, as advocates described measures they want to see introduced and painted a picture of legal rights being trampled under the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Among the bills that died last session that advocates will be pushing for again is one to address ICE’s ability to conduct enforcement actions in what have been dubbed “sensitive places,” such as schools, hospitals and churches.

“It’s not that we can keep the feds from coming in anywhere that they want to if they followed the proper procedure,” said Liza Ryan Gill, co-coordinator of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights. “But we can set protocols on making sure that they follow the proper procedure. So you can’t just bust in if you didn’t get your warrant signed by a judge.”

Another would prohibit local law enforcement officers from being deputized as immigration agents through agreements with the federal government. Under those 287(g) agreements — there are now about 1,200 nationwide, up from 135 in January — police officers can perform immigration-related enforcement such as questioning immigrants in custody about their immigration status, and arresting and turning them over to ICE.

The police departments in all four Hawaiʻi counties already have agreements with federal agencies including Homeland Security Investigations, a division of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE. But police officials have said those agreements enable officers to take part in law enforcement operations aimed at transnational crimes such as drug or human trafficking— and that they do not allow officers to join in immigration enforcement. Critics say the agreements are a slippery slope that make that all too possible.

The hearing at the state Senate Judiciary Committee was called by Sen. Karl Rhoads, the only lawmaker in attendance. He offered the advocates a friendly forum. In the 2025 legislative session, Rhoads introduced a bill to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from collaborating with the federal government for immigration purposes except in limited cases. It died at the committee level before getting a vote.

A former lawyer, he opened Monday’s meeting by saying some of the administration’s enforcement policies and actions “appear to me to be of dubious legality.”

More Than Just Criminals

The hearing was partly an opportunity to correct narratives that undocumented immigrants are all criminals who hurt the economy, said longtime Hawaiʻi civil rights activist Amy Agbayani. “Data do not support that,” she said, adding that one in five state ​​residents is foreign-born.

The Trump administration, while claiming to be going after hardened criminals, has targeted many others, including immigrants with legal residency status and people who turned out to be U.S. citizens, she and other advocates said.

ICE officers arrested 153 people in Hawaiʻi between January and July — a 273% increase from the same period in 2024, when there were 41 arrests, said Bettina Mok, executive director of The Legal Clinic, a nonprofit that provides legal, education and advocacy services to immigrants.

But 67% of people held by ICE at the federal detention center near the Honolulu airport have no criminal record, and “very few” have been charged with a violent crime, Mok said.

Rhoads returned repeatedly to the question of whether ICE has been violating constitutionally guaranteed due process rights during arrests.

He expressed disbelief when Mok described the case of a young man from Central America who was in Florida on a student visa and was arrested for speeding. He was turned over to ICE after police found out he was not actively enrolled in college, Mok said, and was transferred six or seven times among federal detention facilities before ending up in Hawaiʻi’s.

The student, Mok said, had never been told what he was being detained for.

“The lawyer in me is just like, ‘What?’” Rhoads said.

At another point, Rhoads asked for advocates to ignore his law degree and explain due process.

“Does that apply to everybody or is that just U.S. citizens? If you get picked up for whatever reasons do you always have the right to some sort of due process?”

“It should apply to everyone but what we have seen is that the same rights that should be afforded are not being given to immigrants or detained individuals,” said Stephanie Haro Sevilla, a fellow and immigrant advocate at the Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Hawaiʻi law school.

‘You’re Not Immune’

After the hearing, Rhoads told Civil Beat that he was concerned a lot of people “see the stuff on TV from the continent and they think, ‘Well, that doesn’t have anything to do with us here in Hawaii.’ And that’s not true. I want people to know that this kind of stuff is happening here, and that if there’s no due process, you’re not immune to it either.”

Gill of the Hawaiʻi Coalition for Immigrant Rights said based on preliminary discussions with legislators, she is confident the bills she and allies are backing — including one that would clarify the criteria under which immigrants who are crime victims can become eligible for residency — will get a hearing in the next session.

What happens next, she said, is up to legislators who should know by now that the president sees very few limits to his authority.

“I’m sympathetic to the idea that under the first Trump administration, it’s like, ‘OK, well if we don’t cross this particular line, then maybe X, Y, or Z won’t happen,’” Gill said. “What is so different about this, the second administration, is that none of that holds water anymore.”

It’s hard to forecast the prospects for immigration-related bills in the upcoming session, Rhoads said.

“There’s a big divide in the Legislature,” he said.

There are lawmakers who believe “laying low” is the best way to get through the Trump era, Rhoads said. “I believe if we’re going to beat him, we’ve got to fight now.”

On other fronts, too, there are efforts to draw lines related to immigration enforcement.

Response

It may be helpful to explain that under current constitutional arrangements in the United Kingdom (UK), asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office. This includes the provision of asylum accommodation and support to people seeking asylum who would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application. It also includes decisions relating to UK immigration policy, including the application of No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) conditions and other restrictions or conditions applied to people seeking asylum, visa holders and anyone who requires permission to enter or remain in the UK but does not have it. The Scottish Government has no control of these processes.

People who have entered the UK irregularly and have not made an asylum application would be undocumented and would be subject to immigration control, and under reserved immigration legislation and rules they would subject to NRPF.

In the UK, the term person seeking asylum, or asylum seeker, refers to someone who has lodged an application for international protection under the United Nations (UN) 1951 Refugee Convention or Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and is waiting for a decision from the UK Government. An asylum application is therefore a process to determine whether someone is recognised as a refugee. The UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are present in the UK.

Asylum is the process by which someone applies to the UK Government to have their refugee status recognised.

1. How many illegal migrants have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

We do not hold any information on illegal immigrants that have been housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness or Stirling in the past 3 years. People who require permission to enter or remain in the UK are restricted from accessing local authority housing or homeless services.

This is a formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

2. How many asylum seekers have been permanently housed in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, Perth, Inverness, Stirling and Edinburgh in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. We do not hold information about the total number of people seeking asylum provided with accommodation by the UK Government over the past three years in Scotland or in the cities you have specified in your request.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

The UK Government regularly publishes statistical data online which may be of interest in relation to your request. To note, many of the data tables report the number of people at the end of a quarter, not cumulative totals, and therefore the total number of people in the asylum system over a certain time period may not be able to be calculated. Table Asy_D11 includes the number of people in receipt of asylum accommodation and/or support and is available in the quarterly immigration system statistics data tables on the UK Government website: Immigration system statistics data tables - GOV.UK.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website.

Regional and local authority data, including a breakdown for Scotland, is available here: Regional and local authority data on immigration groups - GOV.UK.

3. How many have gone unchecked/unvetted by Police Scotland in the last 3 years?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government holds no information in relation to individuals known to have criminal convictions in their country of origin and also the nature of their crimes. No information is held with regards to recorded offences committed by those with no legal status since arriving in Scotland.

As such, I hereby provide you with formal notice under section 17(1) of FOISA that the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the UK Government website for published information which may be relevant to your request: Statistics on foreign national offenders and the immigration system - GOV.UK.

4. How much of Scottish taxpayer's money is being used to house, feed, maintain the lives of each individual asylum seeker and/or illegal immigrant?

While our aim is to provide information whenever possible, in this instance the Scottish Government does not have the information you have requested. The Scottish Government does not hold information on how much taxpayers money is used for each individual asylum seeker/illegal migrant.

The taxpayer cost is likely to vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual needs and eligibility of the individual and any time spent in the UK asylum system. As explained above, people seeking asylum and undocumented migrants (people who require leave to enter or remain in the UK but do not have it) are subject to No Recourse to Public Funds, this means that they cannot access certain public funds as defined under the UK Immigration Rules. This includes restriction from accessing local authority housing, most mainstream benefits like Universal Credit and emergency crisis payments from the Scottish Welfare Fund.

People seeking asylum may be provided with asylum accommodation and/or financial support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application from the UK Government. As provision of asylum accommodation and support is reserved, the Scottish Government does not hold information relating to the cost of this provision.

This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

You may however find it useful to consult the following link which sets out the Scottish Governments spending and tax plans for the year ahead: Scottish Budget 2025 to 2026 - gov.scot.

5. Were there public consultations with the people of Scotland to ask our permission to house them here? If so, please provide dates, locations of these meetings, minutes of these meetings including the voting ratio results of the public poll at these meetings.

As explained, the UK has international legal obligations to recognise refugees who are in the UK. This is because the UK is a founding signatory to the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees. The 1951 Convention was the culmination of international cooperation to assemble a set of guidelines, laws and conventions aimed at protecting everyone’s basic human rights and the treatment of people forced to flee conflict and persecution, following significant displacement during the first and second world wars in Europe. More information about the 1951 Convention can be found on the UNHCR website: The 1951 Refugee Convention | UNHCR UK.

The UK operates an asylum application system to determine whether people who have presented to the UK Government to be recognised as a refugee meet the definition of a refugee as set out in the 1951 Convention or require protection under any other relevant legislation or conventions to which the UK is a signatory. People seeking asylum can apply to the Home Secretary for asylum accommodation and/or support if they would otherwise be destitute while waiting for a decision on their asylum application.

The UK Government is responsible for UK asylum policy, legislation and rules. The Scottish Government does not hold information about whether any public consultations were undertaken by UK Governments since the 1951 Refugee Convention was signed. This is a section 17(1) notice that the Scottish Government does not hold the information you have requested.

It may be helpful to note that the dispersal of people seeking asylum to accommodation across the UK was introduced under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. For over two decades Glasgow was the only Scottish local authority to participate in dispersal, however in 2022 the UK Government introduced full dispersal policy which presumed asylum accommodation could be procured in any local authority across the UK, rather than only in those local authorities which had voluntarily agreed to participate.

Additionally, as asylum and immigration are reserved to the UK Parliament and handled by the Home Office, you may wish to contact the Home Office at foirequests@homeoffice.gov.uk to find out whether there is further information which they would be able to provide in relation to your request.

You may also find information which has already been published under previous information requests, as part of statistical releases, or otherwise made available on the UK Government website: Home Office - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)

Arrested immigrants sue Trump administration

What we know:

Since the immigration enforcement operation started on Dec. 1, the Trump administration said it has arrested some of ""the worst of the worst,"" a phrase it has used to describe those in the country illegally, with criminal histories.

According to federal court filings, 11 immigrants have sued the administration in federal court in Minnesota in December. Four of the lawsuits were filed by immigrants who were arrested since the ongoing enforcement operation launched.

Nearly all are challenging their detention, and at least three of them face deportation. Some said they are seeking asylum or are eligible for it. Another said he has a pending visa application. And another said he is in the country legally and is eligible for naturalization.

Abdul Dahir Ibrahim, who came to the United States from Somalia in 1995 and now lives in Shakopee, was ordered removed in 2004. He was arrested on Nov. 29, shortly before the immigration operation started.

In a social media post announcing his arrest, Homeland Security officials said he was ordered deported after asylum and fraud convictions in Canada.

The agency also included photos of Ibrahim with several Minnesota Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, among others. The connection between Ibrahim and the elected leaders beyond the photographs is not clear.

According to court records, Ibrahim was granted and then lost his immigration status and is awaiting a hearing on his most recent application to renew that status. Until then, he is subject to deportation, the records said.

Another man, Mahamed Cabdilaahi Awaale, immigrated to the United States from Somalia in 2022 after a member of his wife’s tribe stabbed him and killed his mother, court records said. He is seeking asylum.

“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities.
The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).","Last week, Mesa County filed a motion in federal court arguing that by preventing local law enforcement from sharing immigration information with federal law enforcement, the laws make it impossible for local law enforcement to conduct drug task force activities because the federal government maintains the national databases used in drug enforcement.

“As part of their law enforcement duties wholly unrelated to federal immigration enforcement, Plaintiffs regularly obtain and transmit information that is used to identify an individual for purposes of legitimate state and local law enforcement functions,” the document stated.

On Aug. 7, Mesa County filed a lawsuit in federal court against Polis and Weiser alleging a series of laws passed between 2021 and 2025 pertaining to disclosing personal information for the purposes federal immigration enforcement known as “Article 74” conflict with federal law and are unconstitutionally vague or otherwise unenforceable.

The lawsuit seeks an injunction against enforcing the Article 74 laws until they can be clarified.

Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell, Undersheriff Matt King and Captain Curtis Brammer are named as plaintiffs in the suit in their individual capacities.

The lawsuit was filed in response to a lawsuit from Weiser’s office against former Sheriff’s deputy Alexander Zwinck, which alleged Zwinck had violated Article 74 by providing information to federal immigration enforcement during a traffic stop that led to the detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of a college student from Utah who had lived in the United States for 12 years and had no criminal history.

On June 5, Zwinck stopped Caroline Dias Goncalves near Loma for following a semi-trailer too closely, according to body camera footage of the stop.

Zwinck shared a picture of Dias Goncalves’ driver’s license with a group chat called “GJ Highway Hitters” that included federal immigration enforcement, according to an investigation into the stop. After letting Dias Goncalves off with a warning, he provided the chat with a description of her vehicle and direction of travel.

Dias Goncalves was born in Brazil and moved to Utah at age seven. She has no criminal history but had a visa issue, according to an investigation into the stop.

In a statement, Rowell apologized to Dias Goncalves for his office’s role in the incident.

An administrative investigation by the Sheriff’s Office found that Zwinck had violated several Sheriff’s Office policies and Article 74 laws, and the deputy was disciplined with three weeks of unpaid leave. He later resigned from the Sheriff’s Office.

Weiser’s office dropped its lawsuit against Zwinck after he resigned from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office.

The county’s lawsuit against Polis and Weiser continues, however.

Polis and Weiser filed a motion on Oct. 30 asking for the county’s lawsuit to be dismissed, saying the county’s case lacks standing, and that the laws in question are not so vague to be voided in a legal challenge, and do not conflict with federal law as claimed in the county’s initial complaint.

“Nearly all the alleged harms are purported injuries to the operations of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, for which Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in their individual capacities. The remaining alleged harms involve speculation about hypothetical future enforcement actions. Emphasizing the lack of an actual case or controversy, Plaintiffs identify a list of hypothetical questions for which they seek advisory opinions. And all claims against the Governor are barred by sovereign immunity,” the motion to dismiss stated.

In a response filed Dec. 4, the county argued the lawsuit should not be dismissed, and should be allowed to proceed on its merits so the laws can be clarified.

“As drafted, the new law is both indefinite and vague, making it impossible for Plaintiffs to do their jobs,” the county’s response stated. “This flaw is especially important because Article 74 punishes those who ‘intentionally’ violate its provisions with a fine of up to $50,000.”

The response stated the laws punish actions local law enforcement officers take in the course of their regular duties not related to immigration enforcement, and gave the lawsuit against Zwinck as an example.

“Simply stated, Plaintiffs contend that performance of their duties could subject them to prosecution similar to the enforcement actions Defendants have already taken,” the response stated.

The response also said the enforcement of Article 74 laws has been arbitrary, as Weiser’s office sued Zwinck but not other officers who engaged in similar conduct. The “GJ Highway Hitters” group chat included officers from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office, Colorado State Patrol, Vail Police Department, Eagle County Sheriff’s Office, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).

The county’s filing stated, “as employees within Article 74’s scope facing a similar threat of litigation and enforcement, and with no other mechanism available to them to avoid prosecution, Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to obtain clarity and finality as to what conduct is or is not prohibited under the statutes, and whether they even pass constitutional muster.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/7d/c7d90487-e4cb-48d9-b002-dfaec67860a3/68ae1a61e5a89.image.jpg?crop=1344%2C706%2C0%2C194&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-09 06:57:20.817492

We began this year uncertain about what exactly would unfold, but certain of two things: the unparalleled power of the American people and the Democracy Forward community’s commitment to doing whatever it takes to harness that power to fight autocratic threats. As the Trump-Vance administration trampled on Constitutional rights, dismantled core protections, deployed the military in our communities, oversaw raids, and made it harder for Americans to make ends meet, the American people have met the moment. And, because of you, we have too.

When the president threatened lawyers and law firms, our Democracy Forward community was strong, ensuring that the American people are able to access the courts, represented by exceptional lawyers who are winning court orders at historic rates. We have been able to mount scaled responses to the Trump-Vance administration’s federal attacks — filing hundreds of legal actions and winning — while also continuing our mission-critical work in states and communities across the nation.

“In the United States there is no king.” These words appeared in the lawsuit we filed in the early weeks of this administration, challenging the president’s mission to rewrite history and stamp out free speech. The call has been repeated across the nation as millions have mobilized in the largest peaceful protests in U.S. history, determined to defend our rights. As powerful institutions have stepped back, the people have stepped forward. And, with your support, the people of this nation have been able to make their case heard both in the court of law and in the court of public opinion.

These pages provide a mere glimpse of the wins that you have supported and the impact our work has had for the American people this past year. They also show how we have used momentary setbacks to push forward, and how we are working to transform this historic crisis in our nation as a catalyst for generational change.

Uncertainty is still with us. But our work this year has made us all the more certain that the people can — and will — prevail. Courage is now the new currency — you have shown us that with your support.

We are made for this moment and we are ready for what’s next. We are so grateful to have you with us.

Bruna Ferreira, a longtime resident of Massachusetts, received a $1,500 bond on Monday from an immigration judge at a Louisiana detention centre. Ferreira was arrested by ICE agents last month while driving to pick up her 11-year-old son in New Hampshire. She was previously engaged to Leavitt’s brother, Michael.

Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said in a text message that “we argued that she wasn’t a danger or a flight risk,” and added: “The government stipulated to our argument and never once argued that she was a criminal illegal alien and waived appeal.”

The White House has sought to distance Leavitt from the case, saying in a statement that Ferreira had not spoken to the press secretary “in years”. Trump administration officials have not provided evidence for their claims about Ferreira’s history.

However, court filings, family photographs, and previous reporting indicate Ferreira lived with her son and shared custody with Michael Leavitt. In an interview with The Washington Post, Ferreira said she had chosen Karoline Leavitt to be her son’s godmother.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said in an email that Ferreira is a “criminal illegal alien” who had been detained for battery, an allegation Pomerleau denies. DHS also stated that Ferreira entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to leave the country in 1999.

“She will have periodic mandatory check-ins with ICE law enforcement to ensure she is abiding by the terms of her release,” the DHS spokesperson added.

A Trump administration official described Ferreira as an absentee parent who “has never lived with her son”. The official said the child has lived full-time with Michael Leavitt in New Hampshire since birth.

Ferreira said the White House’s characterisation of her as someone who had never lived with her child is “disgusting” and untrue.

According to the North Andover Eagle-Tribune, Ferreira and Michael Leavitt were engaged in 2014, when their son Mike Jr was eight months old.

Pomerleau disputes those accounts, insisting his client has shared custody. He said Ferreira came to the US as a toddler and later enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme, which grants protection from deportation to people brought to the country without authorisation as children. According to him, the 33-year-old has maintained legal status under DACA and is now seeking a green card.

Efforts by former President Donald Trump to end DACA during his first term were blocked by the US Supreme Court.

Karoline Leavitt has declined to comment on the case. The current press secretary rose to prominence as Donald Trump’s spokeswoman during his 2024 campaign and now serves as a key member of the White House. She has become one of the leading defenders of the administration’s aggressive crackdown on undocumented immigrants and has publicly supported stricter ICE operations.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/afp_690a5c3e0e6f-1762286654.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-09 05:58:17.431288

Apparent ICE Raid in Burnsville

What we know:

A woman who lives in the Burnsville home tells FOX 9 multiple Latino people who rent rooms were arrested by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities after being followed home from the store on Dec. 6.

A portion of the video shows one man being taken down in the driveway, and another woman running inside to her child.

We're told the four people taken into custody are now being held in immigration facilities out of state. That includes the parents of a seven-year-old boy.

What they're saying:

Former state senator and current congressional candidate Matt Little says he's troubled by what he saw in the video, and wants people to know their rights.

""They certainly have a right to a hearing, they certainly have a right to a lawyer, they have a right to contact the people in their lives who can help them out. You have all these rights, so make sure you are showing up and letting your neighbors know (that),"" said Little.

In the wake of the apparent raid, the city of Burnsville released a statement saying they are aware of the immigration enforcement operations happening in the city, and that their police department does not engage in enforcement and is not typically notified of their operations.

What we don't know:

FOX 9 is still working to confirm exactly who was arrested and why during the raid, but ICE and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) so far have not responded to requests for comment.

Burnville authorities have since clarified that department officers do not check people's immigration status.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-12-08-16h47m01s144.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-09 01:56:31.556913

""ICE was here,"" reads the large sign that accompanies an empty manger outside St. Susanna Church in Dedham, Massachusetts, referring to immigration raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""The Holy Family is safe in The Sanctuary of our Church,"" the sign adds. ""If you see ICE, please call LUCE,"" referring to an immigrant assistance network in Massachusetts.

Reported last week by local and national media, the Nativity scene at St. Susanna's prompted strong online reactions. ICE acting director Tod Lyons told Fox News Digital that the scene was ""abhorrent"" and that it added to a ""dangerous narrative"" that he said has resulted in a 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers.

Hundreds of people from across the country also flooded the parish Facebook group page with angry comments while parishioners defended the provocative manger display.

""It sure seems like it's hard to have a conversation with people,"" Fr. Stephen Josoma, the pastor of St. Susanna Church, told National Catholic Reporter. Josoma said the parish office received numerous calls where people started cursing as soon as he picked up the phone.

""It's not a conversation,"" Josoma said. ""You say 'Have a nice day' and hang up. You can't do much more than that.""

Josoma spoke with NCR a day before a spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese said that the parish manger scene should be removed and the manger restored ""to its proper sacred purpose.""

""The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,"" Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said in response to NCR's inquiry.

Donilon said in an email that the Catholic Church's canonical norms ""prohibit the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God's people,"" adding that those objects include images of the Christ Child, which Donilon said ""are to be used solely to foster faith and devotion.""

Donilon added that St. Susanna Church ""neither requested nor received permission"" from the archdiocese to ""depart from this canonical norm or to place a politically divisive display outside the church.""

In a prepared statement provided Dec. 8 to NCR, Josoma and members of St. Susanna's parish council said they were waiting for ""an opportunity of dialogue and clarity"" with Boston Archbishop Richard Henning before reaching any final decisions regarding the Nativity scene.

They defended the parish Nativity as ""faithful to the Gospel and Catholic teaching"" and a ""prophetic reflection that challenges the faithful to find new paths to bring the Good News announced that first Christmas to all of God's people.""

They also pointed out that the Vatican itself displays different themed Nativity scenes each year highlighting social issues to contemporary life.

""Some of these have also been controversial (like one focused on the plight of refugees in 2016) all moving beyond static traditional figures and designed to evoke emotion and dialogue,"" the statement said, adding that it was the parish's hope to similarly evoke dialogue around an issue that is at the heart of contemporary life.

""That some do not agree with our message does not render our display sacrilegious or is the cause of any 'scandal' to the faithful,"" the statement said.

St. Susana Church is one of several churches that have changed their traditional Nativity displays this year to highlight immigration concerns. One church in Illinois depicts Roman soldiers wearing ICE vests, the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph donning gas masks and the Christ Child’s hands bound with zip ties.

In his interview with NCR, Josoma said the Gospel is clear about treating immigrants with respect. He noted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' recent ""special message"" where the bishops expressed their solidarity with migrants amid the federal government's immigration crackdown.

""And we've had the privilege of assisting 10 refugee families to resettle in the area since 2018,"" said Josoma, who added that those families originated from Burundi, Afghanistan, Honduras, Guatemala and Myanmar.

Josoma said that his parish's Pax Christi Peace and Justice Group has used the parish manger scene in previous years to also highlight issues pertaining to migration, gun violence and climate change.

""Every year we try to hold up a mirror to the world and say, 'If the Incarnation took place this year, what would that look like?'"" said Josoma, who added that the idea is to reflect the celebration of Christmas and the Incarnation with the reality of ""the world around us.""

""We've done this since 2016. It came out of our parish Pax Christi group. It really strikes at people and it gets the conversation going,"" Josoma said.

In 2018, St. Susanna Church also attracted national attention when its Nativity scene depicted the Christ Child in a cage and the three Wise Men behind a wall. The scene was designed to protest the first Trump administration's policy of separating families at the border, Josoma said.

That earlier controversial Nativity scene was cited by C.J. Doyle, executive director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, in a prepared statement where he described this year's manger scene as ""another tawdry act of political grandstanding by a priest who believes that his parish church is his personal soapbox.""

Under its secretive deportation deal, the Albanese Government is attempting to permanently exile hundreds of people to Nauru on 30-year visas.
Frontline services report that at least 70% of their clients facing deportation to Nauru suffer from chronic health conditions, and approximately 90% live with a mental health condition.
Refugees previously sent to Nauru under Australia’s offshore processing regime received inadequate medical care and suffered violent attacks requiring urgent evacuation.
Prior to this, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees raised concerns that Australia’s deportation deal with Nauru is contrary to the Refugees Convention.","The High Court will today hear a challenge to the Albanese Government’s power to deport people to Nauru in TCXM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.

The Human Rights Law Centre has been granted leave to participate as amicus curiae (or ‘friend of the court’) to make submissions about the correct legal test that will apply in future to all deportations from Australia. We will argue that the government should not be able to deport people to a place where they would face death or serious harm.

Under its secretive deportation deal, the Albanese Government is attempting to permanently exile hundreds of people to Nauru on 30-year visas.

Many of the people facing deportation have life-threatening medical conditions that could not be treated in Nauru, including serious psychiatric conditions and physical disabilities. Frontline services report that at least 70% of their clients facing deportation to Nauru suffer from chronic health conditions, and approximately 90% live with a mental health condition.

In addition to medical neglect, people facing deportation to Nauru are at risk of violence and forcible return to the countries from which they fled – but there is currently no obligation on the Australian Government to consider these risks before deporting someone. Refugees previously sent to Nauru under Australia’s offshore processing regime received inadequate medical care and suffered violent attacks requiring urgent evacuation.

Two weeks ago, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre obtained a transcript from an interview with Nauruan President David Adeang that revealed that Nauru intends to return refugees to the countries from which they fled, a move that would breach international law. Prior to this, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees raised concerns that Australia’s deportation deal with Nauru is contrary to the Refugees Convention.

There have also been serious allegations of corruption by senior Nauruan officials resulting in a Senate inquiry into Australia’s offshore processing and resettlement arrangements that will report in June 2026.

Despite the ongoing investigations and legal challenge, the Albanese Government has already deported five people to Nauru.

Sanmati Verma, Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Deportation from Australia cannot be a death sentence.

“The Albanese Government knows that most of the people it is seeking to deport to Nauru have lifelong health conditions caused or exacerbated by the years they spent in indefinite immigration detention. It knows that refugees previously sent to Nauru have died from treatable conditions, because of a lack of basic medical care and disregard for the lives of refugees. That is why it has changed the law so it can avoid having to confront these consequences when deporting people.

“We must draw a line when it comes to the punishment of migrants and refugees – even, and especially, when our governments fail to.”

Simon Eccleshall, Head of Programs, Medecins Sans Frontieres, said:

“Australia’s policy of offshore processing is cruel, inhumane and degrading. It inflicts predictable, preventable suffering that violates basic human dignity and health. Offshore processing should be closed, not expanded.

“Based on our experience providing mental healthcare to asylum seekers and refugees in Nauru in 2018, offshore processing and indefinite detention is directly responsible for severe mental health harm – including high rates of self-harm, suicide attempts and deep psychological trauma.

“Medecins Sans Frontiers calls for the immediate evacuation of asylum seekers and refugees from Nauru, and an end to offshore processing altogether – including the Government’s new tactics to deport people to Nauru on 30-year visas.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor, Refugee Advice and Casework Service, said:

“Australia outsourcing our obligations has become endemic.

“This without question, is a complex group of people, complexity that is underscored by chronic health conditions and a significant deterioration of mental health, many with illnesses that will never be remedied. The fact remains Australia knows that Nauru does not have the capacity to care for the people it intends to send there, if it did, it would not be costing the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars to establish the infrastructure, that won’t go towards even making a dent towards the level of care required.

We don’t have to wonder what might happen, our recent history shows us exactly what will happen, and it will be tragic.

“Today’s challenge will have implications beyond one man, it will set the standard of the level of harm and suffering we are prepared to accept at the cost of our actions.”

Ogy Simic, Head of Refugee Leadership, Advocacy and Communication, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said:

“This case is about far more than one person. It is about the way we look at human rights and it’s about the government’s bloody-minded determination to continue signing contracts that seemingly funnel taxpayer money to bikie gangs, multinational corporations and corrupt officials. This government is so determined to prop up its cruel and failed policies that it will do anything – including handing blank cheques to bad actors.”

“In the last few weeks alone we have seen that despite allegations that the Albanese Government knew about corruption at the highest levels in Nauru, and yet it still proceeded to sign a new 2.5-billion-dollar deal to send just a handful of people into permanent exile. This has never been about safety or justice – it’s just been about politics and stoking fear for political gain.”",https://www.hrlc.org.au/app/uploads/2025/12/A4-Hi-Rez_2025_12_09HRLC-027-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 05:58:21.660682

In October, Mr. Trump raised the nominal tariff rate for Canadian products to 35 percent from 25 percent, and he has also threatened to raise Mexico’s tariff rate to 30 percent from 25 percent. If Mr. Trump follows through on his threat for an additional water tariff, tariffs on Mexican products could increase to a maximum of 35 percent — though most imported goods from Canada and Mexico have duty-free exemptions.

Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, saying that a yearslong drought had significantly hindered the country’s ability to provide the full amount of water the agreement called for. Ms. Sheinbaum’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rising temperatures and long droughts have made water more scarce, making the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable.

When Mr. Trump threatened in April to raise tariffs over the issue, Ms. Sheinbaum took a conciliatory stance: She immediately transferred some of Mexico’s water reserves and agreed to give the United States a larger share of the flow of water from the Rio Grande through October.

At the time, the Mexican borderlands were enduring extreme drought conditions, and the country’s water reserves were at historic lows. Now the drought has subsided, and a strong rainy season has replenished much of Mexico’s water reserves.

But Mexican farmers have pressed their government to oppose further concessions to the United States in what has been a yearslong dispute over the countries’ shared rivers. In 2020, tensions over water sharing exploded into violence, and Mexican farmers seized control of a dam in the border region in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the U.S.

Mexican farmers and their supporters have blockaded commercial shipping at the border in protest over water rights. In Juárez, farmers recently blocked some 7,000 trucks loaded with car parts and other goods from crossing into the United States, according to local officials.

For years, New York had allowed exemptions to school immunization requirements for students who held religious objections to vaccines or were unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons. But after a large measles outbreak that was concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County, New York State eliminated the religious exemptions in 2019.

In the years since, childhood vaccination rates against measles climbed in New York. But the change to the law was challenged by a lawsuit filed in Rochester by a number of Amish people and Amish schools on the grounds that it interfered with their right to practice their faith and impart their religious values to their children. At least two federal courts in New York rejected their arguments.

New York is one of only five states not to offer an exemption from school vaccine requirements for religious or personal reasons, and, in one of those states, West Virginia, the governor has sought to introduce them.

In its March ruling, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, noted that in the years before the 2019 change a growing number of parents were receiving religious exemptions from vaccines for their children, undermining disease control efforts.

At private and parochial schools, the percentage of students invoking religious exemptions had jumped from .54 percent to 1.53 percent, according to the court record. In Rockland County, an epicenter of the 2019 measles outbreak and home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, up to 20 percent of students had religious exemptions at some schools.

The religious exemptions “resulted in clusters of low vaccination rates and an inability to achieve herd immunity in certain communities,” the ruling said.

Epidemiologists estimate that at least 95 percent of a community needs to be vaccinated to protect a community from a measles outbreak.

Dr. Howard Zucker, a former New York State health commissioner, said that declining vaccination rates nationwide have led to a resurgence of measles. An outbreak in the Southwest this year has led to more measles cases nationally than in any year since 2000, when the virus was declared eliminated in the United States.

“The decision to eliminate the once exploited religion exemption for vaccinations in New York State was grounded in public health principles: protecting herd immunity and preventing outbreaks,” said Dr. Zucker, who had advocated eliminating religious exemptions for school immunization while health commissioner.

The removal of religious exemptions has been credited with increasing childhood vaccination rates against measles in New York. But some schools — including three Amish schools that challenged the change to the law — did not require proof of vaccination before enrolling children, according to health authorities. The state fined the three schools $118,000 in all, triggering the lawsuit.

“The Amish community in New York wants to be left alone to live out their faith just like they have for 200 years,” said Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal organization that defends religious freedom and represents the Amish men and schools in the Rochester suit.

The order from the Supreme Court did not direct the lower appeals court to reach a particular result, but lawyers at First Liberty found the development encouraging.

The Supreme Court order directed the Second Circuit to reconsider the case in light of a recent ruling on religious freedom involving a very different topic. The ruling that the Supreme Court cited, Mahmoud v. Taylor, decided in June, involved storybooks with L.G.B.T.Q. themes and whether parents with religious objections could have their children excused from classes where the books were discussed.

First Liberty has argued that the Supreme Court’s ruling in the storybooks case shows that the Second Circuit was too dismissive of the Amish parents’ claim about how the school vaccine requirements threatened their religious beliefs.

“We believe the Second Circuit should reach a different result, and it seems that the Supreme Court agrees,” said Hiram Sasser, the executive general counsel at First Liberty.

In a legal brief to the Supreme Court, the New York State Attorney General’s Office noted that New York first enacted a school vaccination requirement in 1860, against smallpox. For more than a century, New York’s laws did not contain a religious exemption.

The legal brief also mentioned “the long tradition recognizing the States’ wide latitude to enact neutral and generally applicable laws promoting public health, safety, and child welfare even in the face of competing claims of religious liberty.”

Judge Saris, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the Interior Department had not provided a “reasoned explanation” of its decision to stop approving wind projects, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, she said, the “agency defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.”

Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of wind power, issued the executive order on his first day back in office in January. At the time, states like Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had been planning to build more than a dozen large wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean to meet their renewable energy goals.

The order effectively put a stop to many of those efforts. At the moment, one offshore wind farm has been completed and five more are under construction in U.S. coastal waters. But developers have been unable to receive permits for additional wind farms, and some planned projects have been canceled altogether.

The directive also stymied wind farms on federal land. In particular, it prohibited the development of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a large wind farm in Idaho that the Biden administration had approved.

Led by New York, a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia challenged the executive order in court in May. They were joined by the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Albany, N.Y.

“As we look to build the electric grid that will power America’s future, wind energy is a key component,” Marguerite Wells, the executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said in a statement. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the decision was “a major victory for our state and the entire region” that would protect “thousands of good-paying jobs” supporting the offshore wind sector.

Asked about the ruling, Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the Biden administration had given offshore wind projects “unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.” She said that Mr. Trump’s executive order, had it remained in effect, would have spurred federal agencies to study whether offshore wind projects were raising energy costs for American families.

Matthew Nies, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on whether the agency would appeal the ruling.

But even if the decision withstands a challenge, it could have a limited impact, according to a research note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. That’s because the courts typically cannot compel federal agencies to approve new projects. Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In addition to the freeze on new permits for wind farms, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits that were issued by the Biden administration for wind farms off Maryland and Massachusetts. It has also attempted to halt construction of two wind farms that were already partly built, including Empire Wind off Long Island and Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Those efforts have also faced pushback from the courts: In September, a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that construction could restart at Revolution Wind, saying that the administration’s stop-work order threatened “irreparable harm” to its developer. (The Trump administration has also allowed work at Empire Wind to restart after negotiations with Ms. Hochul.)

Mr. Trump has disparaged wind power ever since he failed 14 years ago to stop an offshore wind farm visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient. He railed against renewable energy during his presidential campaign last year, when he also promised oil and gas executives that he would make policy changes that would help their industry, such as rolling back environmental rules.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.

Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

The measure would also restrict the arrests of people showing up for or leaving check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with some allowances.

“You cannot sandbag people who are trying to do this the right way,” said Representative Daniel Goldman, who represents parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn. He added, “These are nonviolent, noncriminal people, often escaping terrible conditions in their country, seeking refuge here.”

Migrants have been so afraid of being arrested at their appointments that the vast majority of them — 80 percent — have not been showing up, Mr. Goldman said at a news conference outside 26 Federal Plaza, the site of immigration courtrooms that has become the epicenter of migrant arrests in New York City. Many of those who are detained there are then taken to detention centers across the United States and quickly deported.

Their failure to show up is a violation of federal orders that compromises their path to living in the country legally.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security, denied Mr. Goldman’s assertion that people’s due process rights were being violated. She said that it was safer for federal agents to arrest immigrants in court, where they are screened for weapons, than out in the community.

“Rep. Goldman needs to stop defending violent criminal illegal aliens as he demonizes and dehumanizes American law enforcement,” Ms. McLaughlin wrote in an email. She added, “No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States.”

About half of all Americans support the broad idea of sending undocumented immigrants back to their home countries, according to polls from The New York Times and Siena University and Marquette Law School. Americans’ approval of Mr. Trump’s overall “handling of immigration” is about 45 percent, slightly higher than his overall job approval rating, which has been hovering in the low 40s, according to a review of polls conducted by The New York Times.

Mr. Goldman acknowledged that his bill faces long odds in the Republican-controlled Congress, but he said that Democrats were acting to resist President Trump’s expanding deportation crackdown not only through legislation but also by witnessing arrests and denouncing due process violations. Representative Adriano Espaillat, who also attended Monday’s news conference, said that he planned to show up to 26 Federal Plaza every week, and Mr. Goldman observed that agents had not arrested anyone in his presence.

Over the weekend, Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, released a minute-and-a-half-long video to teach residents about their rights when encountering ICE agents. In the video, Mr. Mamdani outlined legal protections available to residents, including their right to protest.

“New York will always welcome immigrants,” Mr. Mamdani says to the camera. “I will fight each and every day to protect, support and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters.”

Under the legislation introduced on Monday, any arrest carried out during a check-in would require the written authorization of a senior supervisory official citing its legal basis. The arrest would have to be reported to the Homeland Security inspector general within 30 days.

The legislation would also require federal regulators to submit a report to Congress on the department’s compliance. The report would include information regarding the number of arrests and attempted arrests made; the basis of such arrests; and steps taken by the agency to ensure compliance as well as any guidance or training provided to its employees.

An analysis of ICE data by The Times shows that most immigrants arrested in city crackdowns do not have a criminal record. Less than 30 percent of the people arrested in any of the operations had been convicted of a crime, and a very small share had been convicted of a violent crime. The most common nonviolent convictions were for driving under the influence and other traffic offenses.

In a social media post, Mr. Trump said the Commerce Department was finishing the details and would make similar opportunities available to other chip makers like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The president said a portion of the chip revenue would go to the U.S. government, a proposition that experts say could violate U.S. law.

The decision is a major win for Jensen Huang. Nvidia’s chief executive, who spent months lobbying the White House to ease its export restrictions.

The move is also a departure for Mr. Trump, whose administration initially promised to restrict sales of A.I. chips to China. The early position had support across much of Washington, and a looser policy that has become clear in recent months has drawn bipartisan complaints from Congress.

Last week, six senators, including Pete Ricketts, a Republican from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, introduced a bill that would limit the sale of A.I. chips to China.

The administration’s shift followed a campaign by Mr. Huang and David Sacks, its A.I. and crypto czar, who have pushed back on national security concerns regarding A.I. chips. They have argued that increasing Nvidia’s sales to China would make Chinese companies dependent on its technology and give it more money to develop future generations of chips.

Mr. Huang met with Mr. Trump at the White House last week, and Mr. Trump praised the executive afterward, saying, “He’s done an amazing job.”

John Rizzo, an Nvidia spokesman, said offering H200 chips to approved commercial customers that had been vetted by the Commerce Department would strike “a thoughtful balance that is great for America.”

“We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high-paying jobs and manufacturing in America,” he added.

The approval of the chip sales was reported earlier by Semafor.

Now the question is: Will China buy Nvidia’s latest offering? The administration wants to encourage Chinese companies to use Nvidia’s H200 chip, which it released last year, while limiting sales of the company’s latest generation of chips, known as Blackwell.

In July, the Trump administration dropped its restrictions on sales of a chip called the H20, which Nvidia developed specifically for China. But Beijing discouraged companies from buying the chip, with administrators warning that it could have “backdoor security risks.”

Nvidia could run into similar challenges when it begins selling the more powerful H200. After the first Trump administration and the Biden administration began limiting U.S. technology sales to China, Beijing increased its spending to become technologically self-reliant. Huawei, the country’s tech giant, has been improving its own A.I. chips.

This summer, Mr. Trump proposed the idea of the government’s taking a cut of A.I. chip sales to China. On Monday, he reiterated that, writing that “$25% will be paid to the United States of America” — a 10-percentage-point increase from what the company previously agreed to pay the U.S. government.

Government lawyers have been researching how to enact such a policy, given that U.S. law prohibits the charging of fees for export licenses. Mr. Huang said in a news conference in Washington in October that government officials were working on a new policy to collect the fees.

Neither U.S. nor Chinese officials have publicly acknowledged that the H200 chips were under discussion. But U.S. rules around the sale of technology to China have been a central issue in the countries’ relationship.

After Mr. Trump imposed double-digit tariffs on Chinese exports in April, Beijing restricted exports of rare-earth minerals essential to a variety of industries. The countries tentatively agreed to walk back those restrictions this spring, but the truce fell apart after the United States announced new restrictions on Chinese technology companies. Chinese officials argued that those measures violated the spirit of their agreement.

At a meeting in South Korea in October, Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the leader of China, restored that truce, with the United States promising to keep tariffs low and Beijing to provide steady exports of rare earths and resume its purchases of American soybeans. The agreement was also widely believed to include a de facto U.S. freeze on any new technology restrictions.

Since then, the countries have been working to keep the peace, and in a call with Mr. Xi in late November, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to visit China in April. On Friday, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, spoke with China’s vice premier about the steps the sides were taking to maintain the agreement.

But others in Washington have been critical of the administration’s warmer stance toward China. In a letter last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, expressed concern over the potential sale of the H200 chip.

“I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security,” she wrote.

For months, the top Republicans and Democrats on the congressional national security committees have tried without success to compel the Defense Department to share critical information about the attacks, which the Trump administration says are targeting narco-terrorists bringing drugs to the United States.

The legislation aims to force the Pentagon to be more forthcoming. It would withhold 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if he failed to give the congressional national security committees a copy of the execute orders behind the strikes, or to outline how he planned to facilitate future briefings about the operation with lawmakers in accordance with federal law.

The bill also would require that the Defense Department hand over to Congress “unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations” in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific.

Mr. Hegseth has posted edited footage of the strikes on social media, but has so far refused to share the full videos with lawmakers. Some senior members of Congress viewed video of the first strike on Sept. 2 in a classified briefing last week, but have not viewed unedited footage from any of the other 21 known strikes the Pentagon has carried out over the last three months.

Similarly, while the Pentagon has provided lawmakers with summaries of the orders behind the attacks, officials have not provided the actual orders, known as EXORDs, as requested by the House and Senate defense committees, according to a spokesman for Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The new demand and threat to withhold money from the secretary’s office reflected mounting concern among top lawmakers in both parties over the lack of transparency around the open-ended military campaign that has killed at least 87 people.

Mr. Reed said in a floor speech last week that Mr. Hegseth’s unwillingness to answer basic questions on the strikes and provide documents to Congress on the operations, as required by law, was troubling.

“This suggests they know this operation and the tortured legal rationale they use to justify it cannot withstand scrutiny,” he added.

Mr. Reed said that he and Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, had given Mr. Hegseth “more than enough time to respond in good faith to reasonable questions,” but that the defense secretary “has refused.”

The two senators had warned in October that the Pentagon was skirting Congress as it continued to ramp up the campaign against alleged drug traffickers at sea. They made public two letters sent to Mr. Hegseth demanding more information on the strikes, saying the secretary had failed to respond.

Federal law requires the Defense Department to send execute orders to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within 15 days of the defense secretary issuing the orders, but officials have failed to do so in the case of the boat strikes. The law also mandates that if the top Republicans or Democrats on the committees were to specifically request such an order, the department would have 30 days to comply, another timeline that the Trump administration has ignored.

The new requirements were added during final negotiations to reconcile the two chambers’ versions of the roughly $900 billion defense policy bill, which the House is expected to pass this week. The Senate is expected to approve it next week, sending it to the president’s desk.

The bill requires that the videos and other documents be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, meaning they would not be seen by the public, unless later declassified and released.

But calls from Democrats for the public release of the video of the Sept. 2 strike are mounting. The opening salvo in the administration’s strikes on traffickers at sea, the early September attack has faced heavy scrutiny partly because of a follow-up strike that killed two survivors.

While Mr. Trump has said he would have “no problem” with the release of the video, Mr. Hegseth over the weekend suggested he would not make it public.

The top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Adam Smith of Washington, who saw the footage last week in a classified briefing, told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, “It seems pretty clear they don’t want to release this video because they don’t want people to see it, because it’s very, very difficult to justify.”

“This bill would help prevent unaffordable increases in health insurance premium costs for many families by extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium tax credits for two years and putting a reasonable income cap on these subsidies to ensure they are going to the individuals who need them,” said Ms. Collins.

Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Crapo of Idaho, the Republican chairmen of the health and finance committees, respectively, have another approach under consideration that would send money for the premiums directly to consumers, rather than insurance companies.

It would funnel the funds through tax-free health savings accounts, an approach that Republicans have long embraced, with limited success. The legislation would also expand eligibility for high-deductible catastrophic plans and cut federal Medicaid funding to states that provide coverage to undocumented immigrants.

“Instead of 100 percent of this money going to insurance companies, who take 20 percent of it, we give 100 percent, almost, to the patient, to our fellow American, in an account that she controls and use as she wishes,” Mr. Cassidy said. “Let’s give power to the patient, not profit to the insurance company. Let’s make health care affordable again.”

A progressive health care group immediately decried the bill as an “utter joke.”

“Republicans are proving once again how unserious they are,” said Brad Woodhouse, president of the group, Protect Our Care.

Speaker Mike Johnson has also said that House Republicans may come forward with their own health care plan, and other Republican proposals could surface, as well. But so far, the party has yet to unify around any one plan.

Republicans are rushing to come up with a counter to the Democratic legislation, which would extend the subsidies at the center of the fight that shut down much of the government for 43 days. In agreeing to reopen the government, Democrats received a commitment from Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, to allow them to bring a proposal to the floor this month to extend the tax breaks currently slated to expire at the end of the year.

Lawmakers engaged in bipartisan talks to try to come up with a consensus plan that could attract the 60 votes required to overcome a Senate filibuster, but none emerged. A bipartisan group in the House last week proposed scaling back the subsidies and extending them for two years, but that proposal has little chance of being considered, given that it is opposed by most Republicans.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said last week that Democrats would now forge ahead with a three-year extension without any of the changes sought by Republicans to rein in costs.

“It’s going to be one of the most important votes we take,” Mr. Schumer said, “because it’s showing who is on the side of the American people and lowering their health care costs and who is on the side of the big special interests and is going to raise health care costs.”

The plan has deep Democratic support and could draw votes from a handful of Republicans. But most G.O.P. lawmakers, who have long railed against the Affordable Care Act, oppose it.

Democrats say the best solution at the moment is to ease the threat of premium increases by extending the tax breaks for three years while pursuing longer-term solutions. They say that the emerging Republican plans are inadequate and will lead to more Americans going without health care coverage.

Republicans say that they are worried about the impact of the rising premiums and are willing to entertain any extension tied to other changes in the program, but that Democrats have chosen to get behind legislation that they know will fail in an effort to create a winning political issue for the midterm elections. They also say that the problem was created by Democrats who beefed up subsidies for the Affordable Care Act during the pandemic and established a cutoff date on their own.

“I refuse to let the American people pay the price for the Democrats’ incompetence,” said Mr. Moreno, the Ohio Republican. “I am willing to work with anyone to finally bring down costs for all Americans, and hope my colleagues across the aisle will commit to doing the same.”

Democrats who emerged from a showing of the video described it showing the two men clinging to wreckage to avoid drowning, and that the images were shocking and would repulse the public. Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the two survivors “were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities,” when the follow-up strike took place.

Mr. Trump told reporters who asked about the video last week, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.”

But on Monday he denied ever endorsing its release and referred the issue to Mr. Hegseth. On Saturday, Mr. Hegseth told the Reagan National Defense Forum that he would not commit to making the video public.

“We’re reviewing the process, and we’ll see,” Mr. Hegseth said. “Whatever we were to decide to release, we’d have to be very responsible about reviewing that right now.”

The Pentagon has possessed the video since the mission took place in early September. It immediately released a video of the initial strike on the boat, which killed most of the crew and capsized the craft. But it did not initially make mention of the fact that it took more strikes to sink the boat, and that survivors had been seen.

The Pentagon’s story about where the boat was headed at the time has changed repeatedly, and the administration has refused to release the legal rationale, drafted at the Justice Department, justifying the strikes on the boats. The U.S. military has carried out 22 such strikes, killing at least 87 people.

Outside experts say that because drug-runners are not armed military forces, the strikes are illegally targeting civilians who should, instead, be subject to apprehension and arrest by the Coast Guard.

Visitors will instead get free entry on June 14, which is both Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday.

The changes follow previous moves by the Trump administration to take down materials mentioning slavery at national parks and come as part of a broader effort by the White House to erase or play down Black history at government sites.

The Interior Department, which oversees the park service, said in a news release that the changes reflected the administration’s “commitment to making national parks more accessible, more affordable and more efficient for the American people.”

Derrick Johnson, the chief executive of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a statement that removing dates recognizing Black history was part of an effort “to distract and divide us by undermining progress attributed to the Black community.”

Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, called the moves “extremely disappointing” and said the holidays “commemorate people and stories that are essential to understanding the history of our country.”

There will be 10 free entrance days at national parks in 2026 — including Memorial Day, Independence Day weekend and Veterans Day — up from six this year. Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States and became a federal holiday in 2021, was added as a free entrance day last year. Not all free days are federal holidays: Also being honored are the National Park Service’s 110th birthday (Aug. 25), Constitution Day (Sept. 17) and Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday (Oct. 27).

The park service will limit free entrance on those dates to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. “Nonresidents will pay the regular entrance fee and any applicable nonresident fees,” the agency’s website says. Previously, anyone could visit national parks at no charge on free entrance days.

The changes are part of the administration’s “America-first pricing” model announced in November. That initiative includes charging nonresidents $250 for an annual national parks pass (compared with $80 for U.S. citizens and permanent residents) and a fee of $100 per person for nonresidents without a parks pass at 11 of the nation’s most popular parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite.

A former personal lawyer to President Trump, Ms. Habba began leading the New Jersey office in March. In July, when her tenure was expected to end, the Justice Department kept her in place through a series of complex maneuvers that led to immediate legal challenges.

Last week, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that Ms. Habba had been serving unlawfully, a challenge to her authority that could place precedent-setting limits on President Trump’s power to choose his own top federal prosecutors.

The court affirmed an earlier ruling that said the Justice Department could not indefinitely extend the tenure of interim U.S. attorneys who were neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by district trial court judges — the two conventional ways for being appointed to the role permanently.

“As a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down,” Ms. Habba wrote, adding: “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”

Ms. Bondi said Monday that the court’s ruling had “made it untenable” for Ms. Habba to run her office effectively, “with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice.”

Ms. Bondi said that she would appeal the Third Circuit’s decision, and said that if it were reversed, Ms. Habba would return to lead the New Jersey office.

But it was not clear whether it would be possible to appeal the Third Circuit’s decision, given that Ms. Habba’s resignation would seem to have put the issue to rest. The Justice Department had also said it would appeal a similar ruling disqualifying the U.S. attorney in Eastern Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, and has yet to do so.

In her own post, Ms. Habba blasted judges in New Jersey who declined to extend her tenure, as well as the so-called blue slip tradition, which allowed New Jersey’s senators to block her permanent appointment to the role.

The judges instead appointed Ms. Habba’s top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to replace her. The Justice Department fired Ms. Grace, keeping Ms. Habba in the role.

Ms. Habba will not be replaced by any one U.S. attorney, but instead by three prosecutors who were already in the office: Philip Lamparello, Jordan Fox and Ari Fontecchio. They will divide the responsibilities of the U.S. attorney among them.

Mr. Lamparello will run the office’s criminal division; Ms. Fox will run its civil and appeals division; and Mr. Fontecchio will oversee administrative matters. Mr. Lamparello and Mr. Fontecchio worked closely with Ms. Habba, while Ms. Fox was a chief of staff to the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche.

Ms. Fox will maintain her role for Mr. Blanche, a Justice Department spokesman said. That dual role, as well as Mr. Lamparello’s and Mr. Fontecchio’s close ties to Ms. Habba, could help ensure that the New Jersey office remains under firm control from Washington. But the unconventional arrangement could lead to further challenges from defense lawyers, and it is unclear how judges will view the matter.

The state’s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, urged the White House to work with them to find a “qualified candidate” to lead the office for the next three years and to “give the Senate a full, fair opportunity to consider that nominee.”

“Today’s resignation of Alina Habba from her role as U.S. attorney for New Jersey brings to a close a troubling chapter and confirms what we have warned from the start,” they said in a statement, adding that her appointment “undermined the credibility of the office and eroded the public’s trust in the state’s chief federal prosecutor.”

Ms. Habba’s time leading the office was turbulent. Days after Mr. Trump announced on social media that he was appointing her to the prestigious post, she told a podcaster that she hoped to use her job in the traditionally nonpartisan office to help Republicans “turn New Jersey red.”

Less than two months later, her office had brought charges against two prominent New Jersey Democrats, Mayor Ras J. Baraka of Newark and Representative LaMonica McIver, after a May 9 clash with federal agents outside a migrant detention center.

She quickly dropped the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka. The episode elicited a harsh rebuke from a judge who suggested that the charges had been brought too hastily.

Mr. Baraka is suing Ms. Habba for malicious prosecution, and lawyers for Ms. McIver, who is charged with assault, have moved to have her case dismissed. They have argued that Mr. Baraka’s arrest was ordered by the deputy attorney general, and that the prosecution of Ms. McIver smacks of disparate treatment, particularly in light of the president’s leniency toward the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters.

Ruling against Ms. McIver, a judge has said that the case could proceed, although she is expected to appeal that decision.

Ms. McIver is accused of slamming her forearm into one immigration agent and trying to restrain another as she tried to block Mr. Baraka’s arrest. Her lawyers have countered that it was the federal agents who “precipitated and were responsible for creating several minutes of physical chaos.”

Ms. Habba had no experience in criminal law before being appointed in March to an interim, 120-day term as U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey.

Early on, she emphasized her close relationship with the White House and began traveling with a security team that included federal marshals. From late March through August, this security detail cost taxpayers $2.3 million, including more than $560,000 in costs associated with travel, according to information provide by the U.S. Marshals Service through a records request.

The Justice Department pushed to keep her in office after her interim term expired, but in August, a judge ruled that her authority had expired, thrusting the state’s already paralyzed federal court system deeper into disarray and further eroding office morale. Since January, dozens of seasoned prosecutors have left for new jobs.

“Because she is not currently qualified to exercise the functions and duties of the office in an acting capacity, she must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases,” the judge, Matthew W. Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, wrote.

Ms. Habba had refused to recuse herself. And many proceedings, including plea hearings and trials, were postponed as judges waited for additional guidance, wary that actions taken in cases involving Ms. Habba, or prosecutors she supervises, could be challenged by defense lawyers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08trump-news-promo7p/08trump-news-promo7p-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 23:56:48.349870

Speakers described the raids as part of intensifying enforcement tactics and urged Tucsonans to prepare and organize before future actions occur.

On Friday, federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other agencies raided several Taco Giro locations across town as part of a broader immigration and tax investigation. Protesters, journalists and community members gathered at the restaurant’s North Grande Avenue location.

Agents fired tear gas, pepper spray and pepper balls to disperse the crowd, which included Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who identified herself as a member of Congress and attempted to de-escalate the situation.

In a statement issued Friday evening, Grijalva said she and her staff were on their way to get lunch when they encountered the raid at Taco Giro, which she said has served the community for decades.

“It’s in the heart of our community — right next to a church and a preschool,” Grijalva said. “When I presented myself as a Member of Congress and asked for more information, my staff and I were pushed aside and pepper-sprayed by masked agents. While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?”

Grijalva went on to say that communities across the country are “being terrorized by a lawless agency” under the Trump administration, adding that residents “deserve to know whether these raids are targeting genuine public safety threats — or law-abiding neighbors who have called our communities home for decades.”

“No family in our community should live in fear, and I will not rest until we get clear answers and accountability,” Grijalva said.

Mayor Regina Romero issued her own statement Friday, saying she shared community members’ fears created by President Donald Trump’s “immoral and inhumane immigration policies.”

“Under the Trump administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like ‘police’ to purposefully confuse the public,” she said, adding that uniformed Tucson Police Department officers at the scene were there only to close the street and keep residents safe. “They were not involved in the use of force against community members. We are committed to having a safe city where everyone’s rights are respected and legally enforced at all times.”

An Instagram post began circulating Saturday morning inviting people to a community assembly at Menlo Park to discuss ways to support and defend community members from ICE.

Speakers said the gathering was meant to create space for difficult conversations about the fear and “terror” they believe federal enforcement is bringing to the community, and to begin deciding together how to organize against ICE.

They emphasized the need for neighborhood-level safety groups, shared information and empathy, noting that many people hesitate to speak out because of scarce information and fears of retaliation, including job loss.

“We’ve been doing community response for quite some time now, and it seems the ICE raids are amping up,” said a woman named Aurora. “It almost seemed kind of like a tactic. Like why hadn’t Arizona been targeted yet, knowing that we have such a big immigration and refugee population?”

Aurora said she believed the agencies had been testing the waters in other jurisdictions before executing raids in Tucson, pointing to the forthcoming federal detention center in Marana.

“They’re going to want to fill it,” she said. “We have to organize preemptively rather than responding when it’s already happened.”

A follow-up meeting is planned for Jan. 10.

The California Faculty Association (CFA) sued the California State University Board of Trustees in October, later adding Teamsters and United Auto Workers units at CSU as fellow plaintiffs.
The court ultimately did not issue a decision and will instead accept additional briefing from CSU, said university system spokesperson Jason Maymon.
In November, Cal State filed a brief opposing the unions’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which the unions have since revised.
An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.","California State University is caught between a federal government eager to investigate alleged antisemitism and employees concerned about privacy.

That dilemma has landed the nation’s largest four-year public university in Los Angeles County Superior Court, where labor unions representing employees around the 22-campus system are waiting to see if they can win the support of a Superior Court judge — or perhaps reach an agreement with CSU itself — to allay members’ fears of harassment and surveillance by the Trump administration.

Faculty members, a graduate teaching assistant, and a supervisor in a campus facilities department are among the employees who have filed declarations in state court, saying they are worried that Cal State will put their scholarships and well-being at risk by handing over personal information like cellphone numbers and email addresses to federal agencies. Their lawsuit seeking to require CSU to notify employees if it receives federal requests for such information in the future is being heard by Judge Stephen Goorvitch. The parties plan to hold a conference with the judge as soon as next week, a spokesperson for the faculty union said.

The nine sworn statements, filed by employees from San Bernardino to Humboldt County in early November, show the fallout after CSU revealed in September that it is the subject of a systemwide investigation into allegations of antisemitism and a hostile environment by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). EEOC has filed one complaint related to that investigation, but CSU anticipates others will follow.

Separately, Cal State alerted Cal State LA employees in September that it had complied with an EEOC subpoena related to a January complaint against the campus of roughly 22,000 students. The subpoena sought the contact information of all Cal State LA faculty and staff in connection with an investigation that also hinges on allegations of antisemitism.

The California Faculty Association (CFA) sued the California State University Board of Trustees in October, later adding Teamsters and United Auto Workers units at CSU as fellow plaintiffs. The unions said in court filings that prompt notification of future federal subpoenas would give employees the opportunity to object and attempt to intervene if they don’t want their information shared with the federal government.

The conflict between Cal State and the employee unions comes amid a sweeping campaign by the White House to crack down on colleges and universities that it accuses of fostering political views with which it disagrees, including protesting Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and supporting the rights of transgender students. The University of California system and the University of Pennsylvania are among the colleges facing EEOC investigations alleging a hostile work environment for Jewish employees.

Cal State says it has not received a subpoena related to the systemwide EEOC investigation and that there have not been any findings, settlement discussions or other federal actions in regard to it. The EEOC did not respond to a request seeking comment.

Judge Goorvitch on Friday was scheduled to weigh the unions’ request for a preliminary injunction. The court ultimately did not issue a decision and will instead accept additional briefing from CSU, said university system spokesperson Jason Maymon. A status conference on the matter is set for next week, CFA spokesperson Kenyon Farrow said.

A balancing act for Cal State

The systemwide EEOC investigation poses a subtle balancing act for Cal State, which has said it will cooperate in good faith with federal investigators while seeking to protect its employees’ privacy. “Fulfilling our legal obligations does not mean surrendering our rights or agreeing with the allegations,” the university system advises on a frequently asked questions webpage. “CSU is required by law to cooperate with an EEOC investigation, but cooperation does not mean that CSU accepts the allegations as true or automatically provides everything that is requested.”

At Cal State LA, the university system has said it filed a petition to modify the subpoena, narrowing its original scope to exclude home addresses and details about why employees left the university. But Cal State LA ultimately provided information, including employees’ names, genders, race and ethnicity, personal phone number, personal email and work sites.

In November, Cal State filed a brief opposing the unions’ motion for a preliminary injunction, which the unions have since revised. Attorneys for the university system argued that federal law preempts state privacy protections and that its disclosure of information to a federal agency was permitted under state law.

Employees cite ‘fear and intimidation’

Sworn statements by employees at Cal State LA depict what one described as an atmosphere of “fear and intimidation” on campus since employees learned that their personal contact information had been shared with the EEOC.

Philosophy master’s student Eric Phipps said that shortly after CSU alerted employees about the disclosures, his professor and classmates in a course related to gender “expressed fears that their participation in the course could cause them to be targeted by the federal government and that CSU would not protect them.”

Phipps, who works as an instructional student assistant, is now second-guessing whether to pursue a career in academia. “I feel that academic freedom is no longer guaranteed, and I am now hesitant to publish my thesis because of the political views expressed therein,” he wrote.

Faculty also worried that future federal requests would seek private emails with students and colleagues, or other information about their teaching, social media use and political activism.

Cal State LA professor Ericka Verba said she worries that if CSU were to provide the text of her emails to the federal government, she could face retaliation for her activism related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Verba, a member of Cal State LA’s Latin American Studies Program, said her emails also “contain sensitive information about students’ immigration status” that is not relevant to an antisemitism probe.

Concerns not limited to Cal State LA

Similar concerns have spread to employees at other CSU campuses, who said in court declarations that they are worried that future federal requests may seek information they consider confidential and personal.

Christopher Cox, a San Jose State University lecturer in sociology and interdisciplinary studies, wrote that his teaching specialties — including topics like colonization and international human rights — make him concerned “that I will be targeted for the courses that I teach at SJSU if my private information is subpoenaed by the EEOC or another federal agency.”

At Cal Poly Humboldt, a philosophy lecturer said he feared his views on political issues, including LGBTQ+ rights, would put him at risk. Loren Cannon, who has worked at the Humboldt campus since 2006, said he was concerned that CSU may in the future turn over information about his scholarship and teaching “that would subject me to additional scrutiny, harassment and even the termination of my position.”

Institutions of higher education have varied in how they respond to EEOC investigations into alleged discrimination against Jewish employees. The University of Pennsylvania sought to revoke an EEOC subpoena in its entirety, the federal agency said in a court filing. EEOC denied that effort and has asked a federal district court to force Penn to comply with a modified order. Meanwhile, Columbia University in New York City agreed to pay $21 million to settle an EEOC investigation.

The developer of ICEBlock, an iPhone app that anonymously tracks the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has sued the Trump administration for free speech violations after Apple removed the service from its app store under demands from the White House.

The suit, filed on Monday in federal court in Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally prosecute the app's developer and pressured Apple to make the app unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October.

Following Apple ejecting ICEBlock, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that ""we reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so.""

Lawyer Noam Biale, who filed the suit against the administration, said Bondi's remarks show the government illegally pressuring a private company to suppress free speech.

""We view that as an admission that she engaged in coercion in her official role as a government official to get Apple to remove this app,"" Biale said in an interview with NPR.

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.

When reached for comment, Apple also did not respond. The lawsuit, which does not name Apple, says the tech giant bowed in the face of political pressure.

""For what appears to be the first time in Apple's nearly fifty-year history, Apple removed a U.S.-based app in response to the U.S. government's demands,"" according to the suit.

Developer calls immigration crackdown 'abhorrent'

Joshua Aaron, the Austin, Texas-based developer of ICEBlock, said he launched the app as a way to empower those opposed to Trump's immigration crackdown.

""It was just the best idea I had to do everything I could to fight back against what was going on,"" Aaron said in an interview, describing Trump's immigration enforcement blitz as ""abhorrent.""

The app allows people to report an ICE agent sighting within a 5 mile radius, similar to how map apps, like Waze and Google and Apple Maps and others, alert drivers to police setting up speed traps. The ICE sighting alerts do not include photographs or videos and expire in four hours.

Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies. An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.

Aaron's lawsuit says Bondi is mischaracterizing the purpose of the app.

""Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,"" according to the lawsuit.

Attorney General Bondi, in a July interview with Fox News, suggested Aaron was under investigation and had committed a crime. ""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.

To legal experts, ICEBlock is latest ""jawboning"" example

To First Amendment advocates, the White House's pressure campaign targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what's known as ""jawboning,"" when government officials wield state power to suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice ""censorship by proxy.""

ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action and Bondi promising a crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are two other prominent instances.

""The use of a high-level government threat to force a private platform to suppress speech fundamentally undermines the public's right to access information about government activities,"" said Spence Purnell, a resident senior fellow at R Street, a center-right think tank. ""If high-level officials can successfully silence political opposition, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free expression in this country.""

Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the White House's campaign against ICEBlock shows the administration using what has become a familiar playbook: ""To use threats of adverse legal and financial consequences, sometimes vague sometimes not so vague, to pressure universities, media companies, law firms, you name it, into not speaking in the ways they like,"" she said.

One potential weak spot for the lawsuit, however, is a lack of direct evidence that Attorney General Bondi, or other administration officials, made threats against Apple to have the app removed, rather than merely convinced the tech company to do so.

""And government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they persuade private speech platforms to suppress speech because that speech poses a national security risk or is harmful in some other way,"" Lakier said. ""They only violate the First Amendment when they coerce or attempt to coerce the private platform to suppress the speech.""

Since Apple kicked ICEBlock out of its app store, it cannot be downloaded now, but those who had it on their phones before the ban can still use it. Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.

Aaron said he hopes the suit will lead to ICEBlock being restored to the iPhone app stores and for a clear message to be sent to the Trump administration that prosecuting him for his role in developing the app would be illegal.

Aaron said he and his legal team ""have been preparing for this fight,"" adding that ""we will take it as far as it needs to go to ensure this never happens again.""

Twelve FBI agents who were fired this year for taking a knee during racial justice protests in the heated summer of 2020 are suing the Bureau and its director, alleging unlawful retaliation.

The former special agents—who together have nearly 200 years of experience—once received awards for helping disrupt mass shootings, expose foreign spies and thwart cyber attacks.

But they say as elite federal law enforcement agents, they never received training on crowd control, nor did they have riot shields, gas masks, or helmets when they faced down volatile crowds in the streets of Washington, D.C., in June 2020.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on Monday, described the small group of FBI agents as vastly outnumbered and literally backed against the wall of the National Archives building as unrest swept the country over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Court papers said they kneeled not to reflect a left-wing political point of view, but rather to de-escalate a situation that threatened to spin out of control.

""Mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences, Plaintiffs knew that a split-second misjudgment by any of them could ignite an already-charged national climate and trigger further violence and unrest,"" said the lawsuit, filed by former Justice Department prosecutor Mary Dohrmann of the Washington Litigation Group.

Accused of 'lack of impartiality'

The Justice Department inspector general reviewed the incident in 2024 and found no misconduct. But the episode went viral on social media, attracting critics who cast the kneeling as a political act. Before he returned to the White House, President Trump also posted a negative story about the matter.

Soon after new FBI Director Kash Patel joined the Bureau this year, the lawsuit said he began targeting the agents involved in the episode for retaliation. Several of plaintiffs were yanked from supervisory roles at the FBI. Officials launched a new investigation. The matter was still pending when they were all fired in September, shortcutting typical procedures for FBI misconduct probes.

In their dismissal letters, Patel wrote: ""You have demonstrated unprofessional conduct and a lack of impartiality in carrying out duties, leading to the political weaponization of government.""

During his confirmation hearing, Patel told senators he would honor the internal review process. But the lawsuit accuses him of breaking that pledge for his own political purposes.

The abrupt departure of the fired agents disrupted important work, including evidence collection in Utah following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and efforts to support the Trump administration's executive order on ""Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,"" court papers said.

The case alleges violations of the agents' First Amendment rights to free association and their Fifth Amendment right to due process. They're asking to be reinstated to their jobs and for back pay.

The FBI declined to comment on pending litigation.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said ICE officers arrested Jesus Saucedo-Portillo while he was getting into his car on campus on Saturday afternoon.

RELATED: Augsburg University officials say ICE agents detained student without warrant, sparking campus concern

DHS officials said Saucedo-Portillo is a registered sex offender and has a prior arrest for driving while intoxicated.

A search of the Minnesota court records website and the national sex offender registry did not return any results for Saucedo-Portillo.

In an email to students and staff, Augsburg University’s provost said ICE agents in an unmarked car approached Saucedo-Portillo around 3 p.m. in Parking Lot B on campus.

The provost went on to say that campus security and an on-call administrator arrived, and the agents told them they did not have a judicial warrant.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused the administrator and campus security of attempting to obstruct the arrest and stated that ICE officials told university staff they had a warrant for Saucedo-Portillo’s arrest.

The full statement from Assistant Secretary McLaughlin is below.

“On December 6, ICE officers arrested Jesus Saucedo-Portillo, a criminal illegal alien while he was getting into his vehicle. He is a registered sex offender and has a previous arrest for driving while intoxicated.

“A university Administrator and campus security attempted to obstruct the arrest. Our officers told the school Administrator and campus security that ICE had a warrant for the illegal alien’s arrest. The school Administrator told ICE officers they were violating university policies. Our officers informed them that federal law supersedes any University policy and that if campus security would not stop blocking the law enforcement vehicle from exiting, they would be obstructing justice. The school administrator continued her efforts to block the vehicle from leaving and ordered campus security to stand in front of the vehicle. Our officers followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to clear the area and successfully arrested this criminal illegal alien.

“There is a growing trend of agitators and rioters obstructing the arrest of illegal aliens. Our officers are facing a more than 1050% increase in assaults against them as they arrest the worst of the worst including murderers, sexual predators, terrorists, and gang members.“

“It's outrageous and abhorrent, and the rhetoric alone is disgusting,” he told The Independent last month.","An immigration judge has ordered the release of the mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew after she was arrested by immigration agents last month and threatened with removal from the country.

Bruna Ferreira, who is originally from Brazil, was driving to pick up her 11-year-old son from school when she was suddenly surrounded by federal officers. Since then, the 33-year-old Brazilian mother has been detained inside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana.

An immigration judge ordered her release Monday on a $1,500 bond while she continues a legal battle against President Donald Trump’s administration, which has labeled her a “criminal illegal alien.”

“She will be released on that amount of bond once it is processed by ICE,” her attorney Todd Pomerleau told The Independent.

Immigration Judge Cynthia Goodman ordered her release on the lowest-dollar bond possible, according to Ferreira’s legal team. Pomerleau said they argued she wasn’t a flight risk while government lawyers “never once argued” in court that she was a “criminal illegal alien” and waived appeal, he told The Independent.

Her attorneys said that the Trump administration’s characterization of Ferreira is “unfair and untrue,” according to The Washington Post, which first reported the bond order.

Following her bond order, a spokesperson for Homeland Security once again labeled Ferreira a “criminal illegal alien” and stressed that she will continue to have “periodic mandatory check-ins with ICE law enforcement to ensure she is abiding by the terms of her release.”

“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to work to remove all aliens illegally present in the country as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson told The Independent.

The story of Ferreira’s November 12 arrest and detention is deeply familiar to hundreds of immigrant families embroiled in similar legal battles and deportation threats. The revelation of her ties to Leavitt, whose brother is the father of Ferreira’s child, has complicated the Trump administration’s fervent anti-immigration agenda.

“She’s somebody that has generated publicity because of her relationship to somebody who is part of the inner circle of the White House, but at the end of the day, that she’s just one of many thousands and thousands of people that are getting this treatment on a daily basis in this administration,” Jeffrey Rubin, whose firm is representing Ferreira, told The Independent last month.

Ferreira’s parents emigrated from Brazil and brought their young daughter with them in 1998 when she was roughly 6 years old. Her two younger siblings were born in the United States.

She received temporary legal protections under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the Obama-era program that has shielded tens of thousands of people who arrived in the country as children without legal status, and she was in the process of obtaining a green card, according to her legal team.

Ferreira, who lives in Massachusetts, does not appear to have had any criminal convictions, and she shares custody with her son, according to her lawyers.

In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Ferreira said she wanted Leavitt to be her son’s godmother.

“I made a mistake there, in trusting,” she said. “Why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

She was arrested for being in the United States without legal permission after overstaying a visa that expired when she was a child, according to her attorneys.

After her arrest, the White House claimed Ferreira had not spoken to Leavitt in years and that Ferreira had never lived with her son. Homeland Security also accused her of being arrested for “battery,” but her legal team cannot corroborate the administration’s allegations.

Ferreira was previously engaged to Michael Leavitt, Karoline’s brother, but they broke up more than 10 years ago, according to the family.

The Independent has requested comment from the White House.

Speaking to The Washington Post while in ICE custody, Ferreira said the administration’s claims are “disgusting” and false.

Before her arrest, she was managing a cleaning businesses, going to yoga class and spending time with her son, who has “everything a young boy needs,” she said.

Her arrest is among many in a “random and cruel mass deportation campaign” under an administration that has performed warrantless searches, arrested and deported immigrants without due process, and stripped legal protections for tens of thousands of people who were previously allowed to live and work in the country, according to Rubin.

Bruna Caroline Ferreira, the mother of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt’s nephew, was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 12 in Massachusetts as she was on her way to pick up her son — Leavitt’s nephew through her brother — from school.

The 33-year-old, who arrived from Brazil as a young child in 1998 with her parents, was accused by the Department of Homeland Security of overstaying her tourist visa and was taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Louisiana.

Ferreira shares an 11-year-old son with Leavitt’s older brother, Michael, and the two share joint custody of the child, Ferreira attorney Todd Pomerleau previously told USA TODAY. The couple was engaged about 12 years ago and eventually broke up.

According to Ferreira’s legal team, she was in the final stages of getting her green card, with the last interview scheduled for the spring.

Ferreira, who owns and operates a cleaning service business and online clothing, had been allowed to live and work in the country as a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program recipient under the Obama administration.

The woman's legal team previously told USA TODAY that Ferreira decided to pursue a green card after the first Trump administration sought to terminate the DACA program; legal challenges have made the process long-winding.

Ferreira’s attorneys said that the woman was arrested in Revere, Mass., outside Boston, as she was on her way in the afternoon to pick her son up from school in southern New Hampshire, which is about 35 minutes from where she lives. Attorneys described her as a highly involved mother who spent multiple days with her son every week.

Leavitt did not provide comments to USA TODAY but a source familiar with the dynamics between the two women said they haven't spoken to each other in years.

And a group of FBI agents who were under scrutiny for their roles in the investigation of the Capitol riot have also filed a lawsuit to challenge that investigation.","In a federal civil lawsuit filed in Washington Monday, a dozen former FBI agents are seeking to get their jobs back, claiming they were fired during the second Trump administration for their efforts in 2020 to head off a riot in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.

The former agents say they were unlawfully terminated by the Justice Department earlier this year for kneeling in 2020, as tensions were rising on the streets of Washington, D.C., soon after Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.

They allege FBI Director Kash Patel, Attorney General Pam Bondi, the FBI and the Justice Department terminated them based on a perception of the agents that they were ""not affiliated with President Trump.""

The lawsuit recounts the actions the former agents say they took on June 4, 2020, just over a week after Floyd was killed. That day, as they were patrolling the district, the agents ""were confronted by a mob that included hostile individuals alongside families with young children,"" the lawsuit said.

""The Special Agents closest to the mob were the first to kneel,"" the plaintiffs' suit said. ""Their intent was to prevent a dangerous situation in which confrontational or unwitting civilians might make physical contact with agents or even attempt to gain control.""

And the former agents also contend that they had not been issued ""sufficient equipment for responding to civil unrest such as riot shields, gas masks, helmets, or other tactical gear.""

The former agents are not publicly named in the lawsuit and are referred to as Jane and John Does.

""Plaintiffs had been informed that the purpose of the deployment was to show a visible law enforcement presence, and they wore vests marked 'FBI' and carried their firearms,"" the lawsuit said. ""But they were not properly prepared or instructed to conduct crowd control operations."" It continued, ""As a result of their tactical decision to kneel, the mass of people moved on without escalating to violence.""

Mary Dohrmann, an attorney representing the agents in the lawsuit, told CBS News, ""Internal FBI processes are being subverted in a way that makes us all less safe.""

An FBI spokesperson told CBS News the bureau does not comment on pending litigation, and the FBI did not comment when CBS News reported in September that agents had been fired for kneeling in 2020.

The civil case is filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The fired FBI agents include counterterrorism specialists and agents with more than 15 years' experience in combating criminals.

According to the lawsuit, ""Plaintiff Jane Doe 5 was informed that she was being removed at the direction of Defendant Patel from her position at FBI Headquarters as a Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI overseeing counterintelligence at the direction of Defendant Patel because she kneeled on June 4, 2020.""

Their civil case argues that Patel's statements show ""his actions in this case were motivated by partisan animus toward plaintiffs and not by a fair evaluation of the facts on June 4, 2020.""

The former agents cited Patel's book, ""Government Gangsters,"" in which he wrote that some government employees should ""be removed from their posts and replaced with people who won't undermine the president's agenda.""

The family had settled in New York City and Yuanxin had just started first grade at a public school in Astoria, Queens.","More than 200 people rallied Sunday in support of a Chinese father who is in immigration detention while his 6-year-old son is in being held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement following a routine immigration appointment in New York City.

Fei Zheng and his son, Yuanxin, showed up to the offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in New York City on Nov. 26 for a routine check-in, according to Jennie Spector, a community activist who coordinated two volunteers to accompany Zheng and Yuanxin to the appointment. The volunteers waited for Zheng and his son outside the ICE offices, since they’re not allowed inside check-ins.

“They never heard from him,” Spector told NBC News on Monday. “After a number of hours, we kind of assumed that they had been arrested.”

Zheng was taken to the Orange County Correctional Facility, where he remained in immigration custody as of Monday, and his son was transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds unaccompanied immigrant children, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

A child taken into ORR custody is placed with an ORR-approved guardian, similar to a foster family, or taken to an ORR facility. It is unclear exactly where ORR is holding the boy.

Spector, who receives calls from Zheng while he is in detention, said the father was able to briefly speak with his son over the weekend. That was his first time hearing his son’s voice since they were separated on Thanksgiving eve, Spector said.

“He was able to be put in touch with his son, but he doesn’t know exactly where he is or what kind of place he is living in,” Spector said. “No one has confirmed that to him.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News in an email that “ICE does not separate families,” but places minors and adults in custody as “consistent with past administrations immigration enforcement.”

According to McLaughlin, Zheng and Yuanxin are Chinese nationals who are living in the United States without authorization and “were given a lawful order of removal as a family unit.”

Mike Gao, an attorney for Zheng, previously told The New York Times that his client had refused to board an ICE flight to China in September because he feared government retribution there. Gao did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News.

“Mr. Zheng refused to board the plane and was acting so disruptive and aggressive that he endangered the child’s wellbeing,” McLaughlin said, adding that the father “had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully choose to not comply.”

“To be clear, refusing a judge’s deportation order is a crime. As a result, the child was placed with ORR Custody,” McLaughlin said.

Over 200 people, many of them members of Yuanxin’s school community, attended Sunday’s protest, according to Devora Fein, a leader of the western Queens chapter of Indivisible, a group that opposes the Trump administration’s immigration policies and which organized the rally.

They gathered at a playground in Astoria, where children and adults were seen holding signs that read: “Kids Aren’t Pawns” and “Kids Belong In School Not In Detention.”

“They wanted a place to come together to voice their outrage, to be among others who are feeling the same and want to send this message to Trump and ICE that this is unacceptable,” Fein told NBC News on Monday. “We cannot pull children into this horrible game.”

Community advocates reached out to Democratic Reps. Nydia Velazquez and Grace Meng, both of New York, as well as New York City Council Member Julie Won to request help locating Yuanxin and push federal authorities to reunite the boy with his father.

“We are pushing for answers and doing everything we can to support this family during this incredibly difficult time. Our offices have been in touch with the attorneys for Fei and Yuanxin and with the appropriate city and federal agencies,” Velazquez, Meng and Won said in a joint statement Friday. “At this time, though there are legal limits on what can be shared publicly.”

The Democratic lawmakers added: “Immigration proceedings should not end with a family being torn apart and a 6-year-old child separated from his parent. Families must never be used as leverage to force deportations. Situations like this traumatize immigrant communities and sow distrust of the government.”

According to the local news outlet The City, which first reported on the case, Zheng first attempted to cross the southern border with Yuanxin in April to seek asylum in the United States. They spent several weeks inside a family ICE detention center and were released on parole in early summer. They were arrested again at an August ICE check-in and returned to Dilley Immigration Processing Center, the family detention center where the two had previously been held.

Online records of the Executive Office for Immigration Review show Zheng and Yuanxin had an immigration court hearing on Sept. 8 while they remained detained. According to The City, a judge administratively closed their asylum case during that hearing, often considered a sign that DHS is not actively seeking the person’s deportation.

The father and son were then released on Oct. 24, Spector told NBC News. “They were given parole for a year, and then just a month into that they were arrested again,” she said. The family had settled in New York City and Yuanxin had just started first grade at a public school in Astoria, Queens.

One of Yuanxin’s teachers showed up to Sunday’s rally and delivered an impromptu message, Fein said. The teacher said the 6-year-old boy loves making puppets and playing with them and described him as “incredibly good at math for a first grader.”

“He has amazing handwriting both in English and Mandarin. He loves to sing and dance to our ‘Good Morning’ song during our morning meetings. He is great at making friends and he is an important part of our classroom community,” the woman said as she tearfully choked up. “Our class feels his absence every single day.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-Yuanxin-Zheng-vl-407p-b4c84d.jpg",N,,2025-12-08 23:57:18.436277

EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — Human rights groups, including the ACLU, Texas Civil Rights and Human Rights Watch, sent a letter on Monday, Dec. 8 to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to quit detaining migrants at Camp East Montana on Fort Bliss property.

The groups summarized in the letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

Camp East Montana opened on Fort Bliss property last summer.

Other alleged abuses included beatings, coercive threats to compel to deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other violations, the groups said.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has been critical of the migrant facility numerous times after talking to detainees there after it opened.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, the human rights groups said.

Numerous detained people told lawyers that officers have engaged in a widespread and “unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force,” the human rights groups said.

According to the human rights groups, one detained teenager, going by the pseudonym Samuel, told lawyers he was beaten by officers so badly that he suffered injuries across his body, lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital by ambulance.

The letter relays Samuel’s account that his right front tooth broke from the force of being slammed to the ground, and as Samuel attests, one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.”

Samuel went on to say that while he was feeling “dizzy” and was “fighting to remain conscious,” an officer laughed at Samuel for having a chipped tooth after being slammed to the ground and told Samuel he was “like a little girl.” Samuel said that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear is so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

In the letter, the groups also reiterate their calls to immediately halt deportations of people to third countries to which they have no ties.

Interviewees said that at Fort Bliss, the prospect of such removals has taken on a particularly abusive character, according to the human rights groups.

People detained attested that officers at Fort Bliss have beaten detained people and used the threat of violence, criminal charges, and imprisonment in attempts to coerce non-Mexican immigrants held at Fort Bliss to cross the border into the Mexican desert, the human rights groups said.

Isaac, a Cuban immigrant held at Fort Bliss, attested in a sworn declaration that officers told him that he was going to be deported to Mexico. Isaac told lawyers that, “the guards hit my head” and “slammed it against the wall approximately 10 times.”

He also said that officers grabbed and crushed his testicles between their fingers, and that soon after, officers handcuffed Isaac and approximately 20 other people, placed them on a bus, and drove them to the border, where they were told they could get off the bus and cross into Mexico. Isaac added that officers told them, “If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa.”

Isaac is also using a pseudonym to protect his identity.

The letter – which was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Mexico, ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, and Texas Civil Rights Project — also follows widespread media coverage detailing abusive conditions.

In September 2025, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Fort Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

The human rights groups say the “Trump administration hastily opened the sprawling tent camp in August 2025, despite warnings from members of Congress and advocates that the facility would be a humanitarian disaster. The facility is located on the military base formerly used to intern people of Japanese descent during World War II and currently holds over 2,700 people, making it the country’s largest immigration detention center.”

Ricardo also getting his U.S. citizenship would fulfill his dream.","Moises Ricardo has dreamed of becoming a U.S. citizens since he came from Cuba 17 years ago.

Ricardo said he fled Cuba, first arriving in Houston, Texas, to get away from an oppressive regime.

“I am grateful for all the good that this country has always provided to people,” Ricardo said through a translator in his Bristol home Monday.

He was set to take his citizenship examination on Nov. 12 but had to postpone that appointment because of emergency open heart surgery. His new test date was set for Jan. 6, 2026.

Ricardo, 59, then got a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services last week informing him that his appointment was canceled.

“It’s unimaginable how much a person can suffer, with things happening inside their body – in pain, in anxiety, in depression,” he said. “And then, as if that weren’t enough, receiving news like the one I received at that moment was something truly devastating.”

The USCIS letter did not give a reason for the cancellation.

NBC Connecticut reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but the agency did not provide a comment Monday.

USCIS did issue a Dec. 2 memo ordering a pause on all immigration for people from 19 countries, including applications for citizenship.

The memo came after an Afghan refugee allegedly shot two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., killing one.

“Recently, the United States has seen what a lack of screening, vetting, and prioritizing expedient adjudications can do to the American people,” the agency wrote in the policy memorandum.

The order pauses applications for people who entered the U.S. from one of the 19 countries on or after Jan. 20, 2021, but also allows for additional review for people who entered before that date.

Democrats, including Connecticut’s congressional delegation, continue to criticize the Trump administration’s immigration pause.

“We are a nation of immigrants,” Rep. John Larso (D-1st District) said in a statement. “(President) Donald Trump and (Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem’s extreme immigration application ban has nothing to do with national security – it is discrimination.”

Ricardo, meanwhile, hopes the immigration process will resume and he’s able to get a new appointment for his citizenship test.

He’s been in Connecticut for three years, now living with a son who also came from Cuba.

Ricardo is waiting for his citizenship so he can retire and collect social security once he’s eligible.

He’s worked as a truck driver and for a tree removal service.

Ricardo also getting his U.S. citizenship would fulfill his dream.

Slaughter, a case about President Donald Trump’s authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission.
Slaughter sued, and quickly won a federal court order blocking her firing.
And in September, his allies on the Supreme Court temporarily lifted the lower court’s order and let him fire Slaughter, federal law be damned.
“I really don’t understand why the agencies aren’t answering to Congress,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
For all their feigned concerns about democratic accountability, the only actor with governing authority is the Court.","The Supreme Court heard oral argument today in Trump v. Slaughter, a case about President Donald Trump’s authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC is the federal agency charged with protecting the public from unfair business practices. In order to defend the agency’s ability to do so without interference from the president, Congress passed a law in 1914 that explicitly says FTC Commissioners can only be fired for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Yet in March, Trump fired Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Slaughter anyway, declaring that their continued service would be “inconsistent” with his administration’s policies. In a statement, Bedoya took a guess as to what those policies entail: “The president wants the FTC to be a lapdog for his golfing buddies.”

Nearly a century ago, in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld statutory removal protections of independent agency officials as constitutional. Slaughter sued, and quickly won a federal court order blocking her firing. Nevertheless, Trump argued that for-cause removal restrictions are unconstitutional. And in September, his allies on the Supreme Court temporarily lifted the lower court’s order and let him fire Slaughter, federal law be damned.

During oral argument in Slaughter on Monday, the Republican justices left no doubt of their intentions to finish what they started. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, for instance, said “there’s been an eroding of Humphrey’s Executor over the years,” while Justice Neil Gorsuch contended that Humphrey’s was “poorly reasoned” from the start. “Humphrey’s Executor is just a dried husk of whatever people used to think it was,” said Chief Justice John Roberts.

The question is not whether the 90-year-old precedent in Humphrey’s Executor is going down, but how much of the administrative state’s ability to make decisions based on the public’s best interests rather than President Trump’s interests will go down with it. When the Republican justices invited the Trump administration to explain the purported dangers of independent agencies, Solicitor General D. John Sauer emphasized that “the president is answerable to the voters” but agencies “have no boss.” According to Sauer, the president “must have the power to control” administrative agencies, and “the one who has the power to remove is the person that they have to fear and obey.” The Republican justices accepted this explanation without pushback.

Throughout oral argument, the Trump administration and the Court’s conservatives treated administrative agencies as some kind of headless, out-of-control fourth branch of government, accountable to no one. The problem with this idea of wholly unconstrained agencies is that agencies are in fact subject to constraints—principally, from the lawmakers that created the agencies to begin with. “I really don’t understand why the agencies aren’t answering to Congress,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Congress established them and can eliminate them. Congress funds them and can stop.” The real problem is not about a lack of reins, but about who is holding the reins. The Republican justices are eager to make it the president—unless and until the president is a Democrat, of course.

Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the Trump administration that “unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,” he claimed that the Court has “taken great steps” to limit Congress making “broad delegations,” specifically through its invention of the “major questions doctrine.” Much like how the federal government came to the rescue of banks during the 2008 financial crisis by declaring them “too big to fail,” the Supreme Court has taken to effectively declaring some (generally liberal) executive actions too big to be legal. As Kavanaugh put it today, the major questions doctrine prevents the Court from “being casual about assuming that Congress has delegated major questions of political or economic significance.”

Kavanaugh’s invocation of the major questions doctrine reveals just how little the Court respects Congress and the presidency as co-equal branches of government. The Court’s Republicans are happy to completely disregard the express, codified will of Congress, allowing their preferred president to neutralize agencies’ regulatory functions by firing people willy-nilly. But when a different president appoints different people to those agencies—people who may actually be interested in using the state’s capacity to protect the public—then the Supreme Court retains the power to swoop back in, and use the major questions doctrine to strike their actions down.

Unfortunately for them, birthright citizenship is not some misty, novel concept or expansion of ill-defined rights.
At the same time, Trump’s executive order would affect everyone in America, not only immigrants.
That Trump was able to push the litigation as far as he has is, in itself, a victory for those who have long campaigned to undermine birthright citizenship.","Maybe, if the country is lucky, the Supreme Court has decided to hear the case of Trump v. Barbara because it wants to reiterate something that the Constitution, federal law, and its own previous rulings have already clearly said, just more loudly, so that even the President can hear it: virtually all babies born in America are American citizens. The case is Donald Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that threw out an executive order he issued in January, in which he declared that a large number of babies born here each year—estimates range to the hundreds of thousands—are not citizens. Why? Because he said so. When the Justices announced, on Friday, that they would hear him out, rather than simply turning the appeal down flat, they didn’t give an explanation. It takes four Justices out of the nine to grant cert (the technical term for taking a case), but their motives might be mixed. Some conservative Justices may want to let the President down easy, with a display of deference before ruling against him, and some liberals may want the opportunity to come down hard in defense of the babies. Maybe the Justices, who are not without vanity, just want to expound a bit. Perhaps they’ve already worked out some resounding phrases in their heads.

All those possibilities would be preferable to another one: that a critical mass of Justices has become convinced that there is a question about birthright citizenship, and that they are willing to upend our long-shared understanding of what it means to be born an American. With this Court, at this moment, it would be reckless to ignore that prospect. Ted Cruz and eight other Republican senators have submitted an amicus brief that largely supports Trump’s order; so have the attorneys general of twenty-four states. Even the more benign rationales for the Supreme Court taking the case carry with them the cost of leaving the impression that birthright citizenship is an unsettled matter. The wait for a ruling in Trump v. Barbara—which will likely come in June or July, after oral arguments this spring—will be one more destabilizing element in our already chaotic national scene.

Another case related to the executive order, Trump v. CASA, was decided by the Court in June, but that one did not address the substance of the order. Instead, it was about whether lower-court judges could use what are known as universal, or nationwide, injunctions to stop it from going into effect. The Court said that they could not. (Trump v. Barbara is a class-action suit, on behalf of babies born after the executive order; this, along with a case brought by Washington and other states, has allowed judges to put a hold on the order even without a universal injunction.) When CASA was argued, the executive order’s opponents suggested that the Administration might never appeal its various lower-court defeats, because it must know that it would lose—the order was so clearly unconstitutional. “If I were in your shoes, there is no way I’d approach the Supreme Court with this case,” Justice Elena Kagan said at the time to D. John Sauer, the Solicitor General, who argued that case for the Administration. But, when Justice Gorsuch asked Sauer if he would appeal if Trump lost in the lower courts, Sauer said, “Absolutely.” And he has. The question now is what, if anything, Trump thinks he can win.

The big prize for the White House, of course, would be an end to birthright citizenship, which many conservatives and opponents of immigration have come to deeply resent, with talk of “anchor babies” and demographic doom. Unfortunately for them, birthright citizenship is not some misty, novel concept or expansion of ill-defined rights. It is the hard promise, in plain language, of the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to previously enslaved Black Americans but was recognized from the beginning as having a broader effect. The citizenship clause reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

The opponents of birthright citizenship hang their arguments, such as they are, on the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” In 1898, which was only thirty years after the amendment was ratified, the Supreme Court ruled definitively on the meaning of that phrase in the case of Wong Kim Ark, a man born in California to Chinese immigrants who were precluded from becoming citizens by the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Court ruled that the only babies born in the U.S. but not “subject” to its jurisdiction in this sense were those born to “foreign sovereigns” or diplomats (for example, if a French ambassador happened to give birth in the U.S.); or those born on a foreign-government-owned ship within U.S. territorial borders; or those born to “enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory.” The “single additional exception,” the Court said, was the case of children born to certain Native American tribes, based on treaty relations that they then had with the federal government.

The Native American exception was, at the time, the most consequential, and had its own dark history. It was, however, for the most part done away with as a result of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. One fascinating aspect of Trump v. Barbara will be seeing what Justice Neil Gorsuch—a conservative who is also, somewhat idiosyncratically, an expert on and champion of tribal legal rights—makes of Wong Kim Ark’s legacy. In sum, Wong’s was a landmark case, not an obscure one, and the Court referred back to it in the decades that followed; its majority opinion in a 1957 case, for example, notes that a baby born to parents in the United States illegally “is, of course, an American citizen by birth.” Legislators shared that understanding of birthright citizenship when Congress incorporated the Fourteenth Amendment’s language into federal law, in 1940 and 1952.

Trump’s executive order represents a complete break with that history. It says that a baby is not a citizen if the mother has no legal status, or if her status is legal but only temporary (for example, if she is on a work or student visa), and if the father is not a citizen or legal permanent resident. Incredibly, the Administration, in its petition to the Supreme Court, argues not only that the order is legal but that the Court can uphold it without overruling the Wong Kim Ark precedent, which it claims has been “misread” for more than a hundred years.

In defense of this indefensible position, the Administration notes that Justice Horace Gray, who wrote the majority opinion in the case, mentioned a number of times that Wong Kim Ark’s parents were “resident” or “domiciled” in the United States. But, as the lawyers for the Barbara babies have argued, Gray went further, saying that anyone residing in the U.S. is clearly subject to its jurisdiction and, importantly, that those here just temporarily are subject to it, too. (Again, the narrow exceptions had to do with diplomats, invaders, and Native Americans.) If you are in the U.S. just temporarily, as a tourist or a student, say, you are still bound by American laws and the government’s authority.

Yet the Administration not only acts as if residency is a magic condition but offers a completely illogical and contradictory definition of what residency is. If parental residency is a requirement, then Trump’s lawyers are making a pretty good case for the citizenship of babies whose parents have lived established lives in this country for years or decades—whatever their legal status. But the Administration’s brief slips between the terms “resident” and “lawful permanent resident,” as if they meant the same thing. And if a parent acting unlawfully, perhaps by staying in the U.S. despite a deportation order, precludes a baby’s citizenship, why are the children of native-born criminals unquestionably citizens? (Actually, one might worry about how Trump would answer that question.)

For example, Sarah (as she is known in Court papers), a baby who is one of the parties in Trump v. Barbara, was born in Utah earlier this year to a mother from Taiwan who has lived in the United States for more than a decade and has a student visa. The idea that Sarah is not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is absurd on its face. Indeed, this Administration has argued that noncitizens are in some ways hyper-subject to its jurisdiction—that it has more of a right to monitor them and limit their freedoms than it does in the case of citizens.

Still, the focus on residency and legal status may point to a possible consolation prize for Trump in this litigation. He may not end birthright citizenship across the board, but perhaps he can turn the various, differently situated groups affected by his executive order against one another—with parents who are holders of H-1B visas arguing that they should not be grouped in with parents who have no legal status; people who arrived here as children saying that they are more clearly resident than students or people with temporary protected status; and everyone trying to avoid being connected to a country with a travel ban. There is enough division already without such quarrels.

At the same time, Trump’s executive order would affect everyone in America, not only immigrants. How is any baby supposed to prove the citizenship or legal status of its parents? In the months since the CASA decision, the Administration has put together some “guidance” to help answer that question; it’s an unhelpful mishmash of talk about hospitals collecting the parents’ Social Security numbers to check citizenship status (an imperfect system, particularly for green-card holders) when the babies are born and about the production of U.S. passports (which only about fifty per cent of Americans have). Ominously, there is a reference to resolving problems via a national 800 number that will connect parents to “updated Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology to route them to a self-service option.”

Another possibility is that the Supreme Court could definitively throw out the executive order—but do so in a way that leaves room for Congress, though not the President, to redefine the meaning of the citizenship clause. Or the Court could chip away at the edges, perhaps with some ambiguous language deploring so-called “birth tourism.” At this rate, the Administration’s next move might be to try denying citizenship to babies born in neighborhoods that it says are under occupation by foreign gangs. That Trump was able to push the litigation as far as he has is, in itself, a victory for those who have long campaigned to undermine birthright citizenship. With Trump v. Barbara, the Supreme Court has made itself a part of the fight. The Justices will now have to either stand by the American babies whom Trump wants the country to disown, or join him in abandoning them. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6936f382a7df430610883e1b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Sorkin-GettyImages-2244625931.jpg",N,,2025-12-08 18:58:49.031110

Eshun secured U.S. citizenship under a provision reserved for U.S. servicemembers that requires the servicemember to serve honorably for at least five years. After he naturalized, the U.S. Marine Corps court-martialed and dishonorably discharged Eshun for attempted sexual abuse of someone he believed to be fourteen years old.

“As alleged, this defendant betrayed the uniform, abused the trust of this nation, and targeted who he believed was a child,” said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. “Under strong leadership, this Department is using every lawful tool to protect the American people and to ensure that citizenship is not a shield for criminals who never deserved it in the first place. If you commit heinous crimes, you will be held accountable. This is how we make America safe again.”

“Today’s denaturalization against Nicholas Eshun, a court-martialed sex offender, demonstrates the United States’ commitment to using every tool available under the law to pursue those who obtain their U.S. citizenship unlawfully,” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Thanks to the intrepid investigators of NCIS, we now know the danger this man poses to this country. He is no longer serving as a Marine. There is no lawful basis for him to keep the citizenship he secured as one.”

Ten months after immigrating to the United States, Eshun enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in October 2011. In 2013, he naturalized under a statute that expedites U.S. citizenship for individuals serving in the U.S. armed forces. But two years later, while serving overseas, Eshun tarnished the honor of the Marine Corps by exchanging lewd messages with someone whom he believed to be a fourteen-year-old girl and by attempting to sexually abuse her. Eshun was, in fact, communicating with an undercover officer with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. His actions resulted in his court-martial and conviction. On May 16, 2016, the Marine Corps dishonorably discharged Eshun after 4 ½ years of service. Defendant is thus subject to denaturalization under 8 U.S.C. § 1440(c), a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that applies to servicemembers who naturalize through military service but who are dishonorably discharged without serving honorably for at least five years.

This case is being prosecuted by Deputy Chief Hans H. Chen of the Justice Department’s Office of Immigration Litigation, Affirmative Litigation Unit, with assistance from the U.S. Marine Corps Judge Advocate Division, U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland.",https://www.justice.gov/themes/custom/usdoj_uswds/images/metatag-image--press-release.png,N,,2025-12-08 18:58:52.920149

Recently, the ACLU released a harrowing letter documenting the neglect and abuse pregnant and postpartum women endure in ICE custody. Working alongside the National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, and other advocacy organizations, the ACLU interviewed women detained while pregnant and in October presented their accounts to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the joint coalition letter. The coalition urged ICE to immediately release all pregnant and postpartum people from detention. In response, ICE dismissed the findings. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin expressly stated the coalition letter relied on “anonymous, unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims.”

What the letter reported is chilling. Women described being shackled and placed in solitary confinement. They recounted delayed or substandard prenatal care and being denied basic necessities such as prenatal vitamins, adequate food, and clean water. Others underwent medical procedures without informed consent or access to translation services. Most disturbing of all, women who were actively miscarrying, an already physically painful and emotionally shattering experience, said they were ignored entirely by facility staff. Several later developed serious infections as a direct result of ICE’s medical neglect.

None of this is new. In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff released the Senate investigation ”The Abuse of Pregnant Women & Children in U.S. Immigration Detention,” which documented widespread mistreatment of individuals in DHS custody including physical and sexual abuse, and pervasive medical neglect of children. The investigation identified 14 credible reports of abuse involving pregnant women alone.

Their accounts echo what the American Civil Liberties Union has now brought forward: pregnant women forced to sleep on floors, denied medical care, and left to miscarry without assistance. One woman reportedly bled for days before finally being taken to a hospital, only to be left alone for more than 24 hours as she miscarried. Others were told to “just drink water” instead of receiving required medical exams, while some waited weeks for appointments that were ultimately canceled.

In response to Ossoff’s investigation, DHS released a statement claiming that “pregnant women [in their care] receive regular prenatal visits, mental-health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care,” and asserting that no woman has been forced to sleep on the floor.

But these denials cannot erase the consistent, detailed testimonies of multiple women.

None of this should be happening. ICE’s own policies make that clear. Under ICE Directive 11032.4, which remains in effect, pregnant and postpartum people are not supposed to be detained at all, and if ICE discovers someone is pregnant or postpartum after arrest, they are supposed to be released, unless an “exceptional circumstance” truly exists.

So what qualifies as “exceptional”? The directives define only a few narrow situations where detention is permitted: when a person poses a national security threat or presents an imminent risk of death, violence, or physical harm to someone else.

Are we really to believe that every pregnant woman reporting neglect—every woman forced to sleep on a floor, denied medical care, or left to miscarry—met these extreme criteria?

Currently the true number of pregnant and postpartum detention is largely unknown. The Women’s Refugee Commission states oversight has become nearly impossible due to curtailed access to facilities and the lapse of a congressional mandate requiring ICE to regularly report how many pregnant people it detains.

And even in the circumstances where putting these women into detention or keeping them in detention is legally permissible, ICE’s obligations are strict. The directives require enhanced monitoring of the individuals’ general health and well-being to ensure appropriate pre- and/or postnatal and other medical and mental health care. ICE also must ensure they are housed in facilities suitable for their medical and mental health needs.

In short, the law does not merely discourage the detention of pregnant people, it pretty much prohibits it without exceptional circumstances. When ICE detains them anyway and keeps them detained, and then fails to provide even the most basic care—as laid out in the ACLU report—it is violating not only humanitarian principles but its own written policies.

What’s more, ICE’s treatment of pregnant and postpartum women isn’t just a violation of its own directives—it’s unconstitutional. The Constitution protects all persons within U.S. borders, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. The Supreme Court has confirmed that undocumented people qualify as “persons” under the Fifth and 14th Amendments, and therefore receive constitutional protections such as due process and equal protection.

Together, these constitutional protections make one thing unmistakable: Women in DHS and ICE custody have a constitutional right to adequate medical care, to ensure their safety, and to be given humane treatment. And the government has a constitutional duty to provide it.

When the United States takes a pregnant woman into custody, it assumes full responsibility for her safety. Denying medical care is not a policy choice—it is a constitutional violation.

You do not need to be “pro-immigrant” to care that women in U.S. custody are left to miscarry on concrete floors, ignored while bleeding, or denied water and prenatal vitamins. This is not “free health care for immigrants.” It is the bare minimum of humane treatment required by law.

ICE is perpetrating clear and ongoing human-rights violations, enabled by this country’s indifference and hostility toward immigrants.

We once claimed to be a model for humane treatment. Yet today, ICE points guns at pregnant women before establishing any cause to detain them. We watch a man appear to suffer a seizure while holding his daughter as agents arrest his wife, then watch officials publicly accuse him of faking it.

ICE does not need new rules. It already has them: clear directives, constitutional duties. It simply refuses to follow them. This is not an isolated failure. It is a pattern, a system that has normalized cruelty. These are not bureaucratic errors or “oversights” that can be fixed with tighter procedures. They are acts of cruelty that meet the moral threshold of crimes against humanity. And they are happening right in front of us. ICE must immediately end the detention of pregnant and postpartum people and comply with its constitutional and moral responsibilities.

The real question is whether we are still capable of protecting what remains of the American conscience, or whether it has already been hollowed out in the name of politics.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b07a07f5-8e7e-4360-a107-ba45809218bf.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:46.948773

Ferreira, 33, had a relationship with Leavitt’s brother, 35-year-old Michael Leavitt.
They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11.

Bruna Ferreira, who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in November during a traffic stop in Massachusetts and was being held at a Louisiana detention center, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the White House’s statements that she had never lived with her son or spoken with Leavitt “in many years” were incorrect.

Ferreira, 33, had a relationship with Leavitt’s brother, 35-year-old Michael Leavitt. They had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, now aged 11.

She said she was offended by the White House’s characterizations, calling them “disgusting”. She said she takes her son to Dave & Buster’s, a food and video games chain; ferries him to school, cheers at sports games; and fills his bedroom with “everything a young boy needs”.

Ferreira told the Post that she also “moved mountains” to ensure her son could attend Karoline Leavitt’s wedding to real estate developer Nicholas Riccio in early January. Ferreira also said she approved her son to attend the White House Easter egg hunt in the spring.

“I asked Karoline to be godmother [to Michael Jr] over my only sister,” she told the Post. “I made a mistake there, in trusting.

“Why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

The differentiated accounts came as Ferreira was released on a $1,500 bond on Monday after immigration judge Cynthia Goodman ordered that she be freed on the lowest-dollar bail possible, according to her lawyers. Attorney Jason Thomas told the judge that the government’s characterization of his client was “both unfair and untrue”.

A lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not object to Ferreira’s release and said he agreed with her lawyers that she was not a danger to society or a flight risk, the Washington Post reported.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed Ferreira’s detention in November followed a prior arrest for battery. The DHS spokesperson said the tourist visa with which Ferreira gained entry into the US required her to leave on 6 June 1999.

Ferreira came to the US from Brazil with her family when she was six years old. DHS officials have not produced records relating to her alleged arrest for battery.

Ferreira’s lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, told the Post his client had no criminal record, with immigration authorities possibly alluding to an incident when she was summoned to juvenile court after a fight outside a Dunkin’ Donuts over $8 in 2008. Pomerleau said the case was dismissed and did not amount to criminality because Ferreira, then 16, was a juvenile.

She told the outlet that she had met the elder Michael Leavitt at a nightclub. They fell in love, got engaged, had a child, and lived together – but instead of marrying they broke up in 2015 and have since shared parenting responsibilities.

Ferreira has alleged in court documents that her son’s father had threatened in the past to try to get her deported. Leavitt, in a text exchange with the Post, denied seeking to have her deported.

“I had no involvement in her being picked up by ice,” he reportedly wrote on Wednesday to the outlet. “I have no control over that and had no involvement in that whatsoever.” He also said that he wanted their son “to have a relationship with his mother as I always have shown that”.

Ferreira told the Post that other potential deportees in the detention center had questioned her about her relationship with the White House press secretary, including asking: “Did she not like you?”

“Your guess is as good as mine,” Ferreira said she responded.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9f2cb1430b078e1e0fa2a57db9482e9729635e/0_45_854_683/master/854.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3ad52cbeaa77724e519078c88eb2ebb",N,,2025-12-08 17:56:36.251603

Typically, however, a mere breach of contract claim does not give rise to a Chapter 93A claim. In order to do so, a party must allege and ultimately prove more than a simple breach of contract. The conduct alleged must cross the line into an unfair and deceptive business practice where the breaching party attempts to secure benefits for themselves in disregard of known contractual arrangements.

The Massachusetts Appeals Court recently examined this long-standing principle in Filzer v. Pitsick LLC. During a zoning litigation dispute in Massachusetts Land Court, a developer and the owners and abutters of the properties at issue entered into a settlement agreement that agreed to “compromise their differences without further litigation.” Among other things, the agreement required the developer to pay the abutters an agreed upon fee; pursue, with the abutters’ support, a special permit to reconfigure the property at issue; record restrictive covenants and perform restoration work; and ultimately dismiss the ongoing Land Court action once the other conditions in the agreement were met. The parties did not disclose the settlement agreement to the Land Court. The Land Court subsequently issued a decision prior to completion of the terms in the agreement, and as a result, the developer took the position that the rulings rendered the settlement “null and void.”

The abutters then brought this action for breach of the settlement agreement and violation of Chapter 93A. The Appeals Court affirmed the finding that the developer violated Chapter 93A when it attempted to leverage a better deal for themselves against the owners and abutters disregarding the terms of the settlement agreement. In finding the developer acted unfairly, the Court focused on the developer’s refusal to provide written assurances that it would honor the settlement agreement, its attempts to renegotiate a better deal after the Land Court ruling, its declaration that the settlement agreement was void without following the procedures outlined in the agreement, and its refusal to allow its lender to disburse the agreed upon settlement payment. The Court found this conduct crossed the line from a mere contract dispute into one where the developer used improper leverage as a wedge to gain an advantage over the owners and abutters.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-12/Massachusetts%20MA%20Flag%20Gavel%20Litigation%20Court%20State-95720414.jpg.webp?itok=_plxhcHD,N,,2025-12-08 17:57:02.532776

His right front tooth broke, and he said one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” He added that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear was so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

Samuel’s is just one of dozens of accounts of abuse from the immigration detention site at the Fort Bliss military base in El Paso, Texas. These accounts reveal an unfolding humanitarian crisis at the military base — one which may spread across the country as the Trump administration expands detention dangerously, recklessly and with unprecedented speed.

Human rights organizations, including the ACLU, sent a letter Monday to U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) detailing accounts of violent assaults and sexual abuse by officers. It also reveals details of other forms of intimidation used to pressure detained immigrants into self-deporting or agreeing to removal to third countries where they have no ties. The findings are based on interviews with more than 45 people currently held at Fort Bliss, and the letter includes 16 signed declarations by people detained at the facility.

ICE began detaining people at Fort Bliss three months ago, while the site was still an active construction zone. Fort Bliss is the largest detention facility in the country, holding roughly 3,000 people, just a few thousand shy of its planned maximum capacity. Immigrants are housed in tent structures in the extreme El Paso heat. This tent camp, built on a former Japanese internment camp, marked the Trump administration's novel approach to expanding the immigration detention system in its second term. Fort Bliss is the administration’s first detention facility at a military base, but likely not the last. With a $1.2 billion price tag, the facility marks a pivotal point in the Trump administration’s effort to use the U.S. military, in this case its bases, as a central tool of immigration enforcement.

Detained Immigrants Describe Alarming Conditions at Fort Bliss

Since its opening, media reports and stories from people detained affirm the conditions, rights violations, and deliberate opacity the ACLU warned would follow the opening of this site. Recent reporting reveals alarming conditions at Fort Bliss. The site has already racked up 60 violations of federal detention standards within its first 50 days of operation.

Each pod holds 60–70 people who report chronic food shortages, with meals sufficient for only about 50 individuals. People are forced to ration food, skip meals, or take turns eating — and when food is available, it is often spoiled or partially frozen, causing widespread vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid weight loss. Basic hygiene supplies are scarce: pods receive only a handful of rolls of toilet paper, and people go days without soap, clean clothing, or access to functioning showers. Detainees describe tents and bathrooms flooded with foul water mixed with urine and feces, creating squalid and unsafe living conditions.

Access to medical care is equally alarming. Individuals with serious conditions report going days or weeks without prescribed medication or having medical requests ignored until someone collapses. They are named here using pseudonyms to protect their identities. Josefina, who has diabetes, describes receiving insulin at erratic intervals that cause dangerous spikes and crashes in her blood sugar. Fernando went 15 days without his prescribed blood pressure medication. Others, including Ignacio, who previously suffered a stroke, report blurry vision and other clear warning signs while officers fail to provide timely care. Detainees consistently say that staff do not respond to medical requests for days and that people must faint or bleed before receiving attention.

Extreme and unlawful use of force is also prominent at Fort Bliss. Several detained individuals have described violent assaults by officers, including sexual abuse. Ignacio, Samuel, and others report officers crushing their testicles during beatings — a tactic used while people were already restrained or after they refused coerced removal to Mexico. Abel, Benjamin, and Eduardo also reported being slammed, stomped on, or beaten when they expressed fear of being sent to Mexico or when they simply requested their medication. These are not isolated incidents; they reflect a pattern of brutality that violates even ICE’s minimal standards.

Access to counsel and legal services is similarly inadequate. When Fort Bliss opened, it relied almost entirely on tablets for visitation and attorney communication, offering no privacy for confidential legal calls. The facility has since modified its protocols, but legal service providers are now allowed to meet with only ten detainees per day — an impossible limitation for a population of roughly 3,000. Many still lack working PINs to call attorneys, and the so-called law library contains no legal materials.

These rights violations — layered on top of hazardous conditions such as leaking water, unstable infrastructure, filthy tents, and ongoing construction — paint a grim picture.

Fort Bliss Signals the Dangerous Future of Immigration Detention Under Trump

If this is the state of a brand-new, billion-dollar facility within its first 90 days, the outlook for the next wave of military-base detention centers is dire. As detention sites open every few weeks nationwide, the ACLU anticipates that Fort Dix in New Jersey will be the next military site the Trump administration will use for mass immigration detention. There have also been reports of ICE scouting a Coast Guard base in New York for immigration detention.

What we are witnessing at Fort Bliss is not an anomaly; it is a warning. The conditions at Fort Bliss reflect a broader pattern of ICE evading oversight and accountability. The facility is a failed experiment that exposes the dangers of rapidly expanding detention, minimal safeguards, limited transparency, and virtually no oversight.

Despite clear congressional authority to conduct announced or unannounced visits to ICE facilities, ICE continues to enforce a policy that requires congressional offices to give them a seven-day notice ahead of detention visits and routinely denies them access to Fort Bliss and other sites. During the recent government shutdown, ICE even classified its congressional relations staff as “non-essential” and furloughed them. As a result, ICE detention facilities turned into information blackout sites with no direct channels to learn about what was happening inside.

The grim reality unfolding at Fort Bliss should serve as a stark warning: the Trump administration’s mass detention surge is not just unsustainable, but fundamentally dangerous. What is happening at Fort Bliss today foreshadows the humanitarian crises that will follow at every new facility opened under this unchecked strategy. Unless policymakers, courts, and the public intervene now, Fort Bliss will not be an outlier; it will be remembered as the template. Congress must hold the Trump administration accountable and ensure ICE immediately halt detention at Fort Bliss, and cease expanding the use of military resources for immigration detention and enforcement.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/fort-bliss-welcome-sign-f.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:50.699449

Birthright Citizenship is currently guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment, and provides that persons born on U.S. soil are, with very limited exceptions[1], U.S. citizens.
Children born in the U.S. to parents without lawful status or those with lawful statuses including H-1B, TN, F-1, etc.
The EO would also impact children born through Artificial Reproductive Technologies (ART), as the definition of mother/father is limited to immediate biological progenitors.
[1] Exception is made for children of certain Foreign Diplomatic staff, which, while born on U.S. soil, are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction.","On Dec. 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the legality of the Administration’s Birthright Citizenship Executive Order, issued on January 20, 2025. Birthright Citizenship is currently guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment, and provides that persons born on U.S. soil are, with very limited exceptions[1], U.S. citizens.

The Birthright Citizenship Executive Order was signed as a “Day One” Executive Order on Jan. 20, 2025, as part of the Administration’s stated efforts to “protect the meaning and value of American citizenship.” The EO would prohibit conferring U.S. citizenship to children born on U.S. soil, whose mother is either unlawfully present in the U.S. or in the U.S. lawfully but in temporary status, and whose father is neither a U.S. Citizen nor a lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth. In short, under the EO, a child born on U.S. soil must have at least one parent who is a U.S. Citizen or lawful permanent resident to be granted U.S. Citizenship at birth. Children born in the U.S. to parents without lawful status or those with lawful statuses including H-1B, TN, F-1, etc. would no longer automatically be U.S. citizens. The EO would also impact children born through Artificial Reproductive Technologies (ART), as the definition of mother/father is limited to immediate biological progenitors.

The new policy was to take effect as of Feb. 20, 2025, but implementation has been enjoined since Jan. 23, 2025, after multiple lawsuits were brought to court. While the Supreme Court previously reviewed, and ruled against, the legality of nationwide (or “universal”) injunctions issued by federal courts, the Court has agreed to review the legality of the Executive Order, under the U.S. Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment, and subsequent Wong Kim Ark[2] decision that “affirm[ed] the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.”

While an exact date has not yet been scheduled, the Court has indicated that it would fast-track review and could hear oral arguments as early as Spring 2026, for a decision by the time it goes to recess (late June/early July 2026).

The case, Trump v. Slaughter, arose from President Trump's attempt to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. A 1935 Supreme Court ruling known as Humphrey's Executor upheld limits established by Congress that enabled the president to remove members of commissions like the FTC only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.

The Trump administration argues those limits violate the separation of powers. The FTC wields executive power, so the president should have the authority to fire its members for any reason, it says. Slaughter's attorneys argue the removal protections fall within Congress' power to determine the structure of the government, and say the administration's position would allow the president to upend many other longstanding independent agencies and commissions that have been established by Congress.

During oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Monday, the three liberal justices defended the removal protections and warned that a decision in Mr. Trump's favor could cause chaos across the government. The court's conservatives, meanwhile, expressed skepticism with the argument that Congress could limit the president's ability to remove officials from the FTC and other independent agencies, opening the door to a ruling in the administration's favor.

Oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter

Solicitor General D. John Sauer presented the case for the administration. He urged the justices to overturn the decision in Humphrey's Executor, saying it encroaches on the president's removal authority under Article II of the Constitution.

""Humphrey's must be overruled. It has become a decaying husk with bold and particularly dangerous pretensions. It was grievously wrong when it was decided,"" Sauer said. ""It continues to generate confusion in the lower courts, and it continues to tempt Congress to erect, at the heart of our government, a headless fourth branch, insulated from political accountability and democratic control.""

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, were skeptical of Sauer's argument.

""You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,"" Sotomayor said.

She warned that a decision invalidating removal limits for members of the FTC could also put at risk the independence of other federal entities, such as the U.S. Tax Court and broader protections for the civil service. Slaughter's lawyers have warned that a ruling expanding presidential power over multi-member agencies could undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, though the Supreme Court has indicated that it views the central bank differently.

Kagan zeroed in on the impacts of a decision overturning Humphrey's Executor, raising the prospect that a ruling striking down the precedent could be used to target protections for officials across the government: ""The question is, where does this lead? Where does it take you to, given what your primary rationale is? Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century … Logic has consequences. Once you use a particular kind of argument to justify one thing, you can't turn your back on that kind of argument if it also justifies another thing in the exact same way.""

She noted that independent agencies also wield legislative and judicial powers and warned that expanding the president's control over them would put ""massive uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president"" and leave the nation with a leader who then has ""control over everything, including over much of the lawmaking in this country.""

Jackson said that Sauer is ""asking us to infer"" that the removal protections are unconstitutional based on the structure of the Constitution, ""and I don't know why we'd make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.""

The court's conservatives were more receptive to the Trump administration's arguments.

""I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,"" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.

Justice Neil Gorsuch acknowledged that ""a lot of legislative power has moved into these agencies,"" but said that ""if they're now going to be controlled by the president, it seems to me all the more imperative to do something about it.""

Attorney Amit Agarwal presented Slaughter's case, and argued that the removal protections have a long tradition in American history. He said that Congress has a role in limiting how officials on independent commissions like the FTC can be removed.

""Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,"" Agarwal said.

Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas tested the boundaries of Agarwal's position, asking him whether Congress could transform Cabinet-level executive departments into multi-member commissions and limit the president's ability to fire their leaders. Agarwal said the Constitution would largely prohibit such a move, since Congress cannot limit the president's authority over officials who are wielding his ""conclusive and preclusive"" powers, which would apply to most departments.

Justice Samuel Alito was similarly skeptical of Agarwal's argument, saying that ""I don't know that you can make the argument that the logic of [Sauer's] argument is going to cause these allegedly revolutionary results without being prepared to explain more concretely than you have the limits of your own argument.""

Agarwal added later: ""We have a 111-year-old statute that was enacted by the people's elected representatives. It was signed into law by a president of the United States. It was unanimously affirmed by this court. And it's been followed by every single president since 1935 until the present. We don't need an abstract theory to tell us that the FTC Act is OK. It's the other side that needs to give you a really compelling theory to explain why, in our view, 200-plus years of precedent and history need to be abandoned.""

Gorsuch continued to probe Agarwal's position, hinting that he thought the line Agarwal was trying to draw to limit the president's power to remove officials was unwieldy: ""How are we supposed to decide which powers are exclusive? … What powers are going to fall in and what are going to fall out? Are we going to have just as much litigation over that as anything else we might do in this case?""

The background of Trump v. Slaughter

The case is the culmination of a yearslong weakening of that New Deal-era ruling in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In a string of recent decisions, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have chipped away at that precedent. Most recently, the high court invalidated removal protections for leaders of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2020 and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2021.

But the Slaughter case now gives the Supreme Court the opportunity to overturn that 90-year-old precedent entirely.

Since he returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the bounds of presidential power and moved to oust a host of Democratic-appointed members of independent boards and commissions, including Slaughter.

Appointed to the FTC by Mr. Trump in his first term and reappointed by former President Joe Biden, Slaughter received an email in March with a message from the president informing her that her ""continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration's priorities.""

Slaughter, like many other agency leaders fired by Mr. Trump, filed a lawsuit arguing that her firing was illegal. When Congress established the FTC in 1914, it said commissioners could be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Her lawyers argue that Mr. Trump violated that law and Supreme Court precedent with the firing of Slaughter and a second commissioner, Alvaro M. Bedoya.

A federal district court sided with Slaughter and ordered her to be reinstated to her job at the FTC. But soon after, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a temporary order allowing her removal. Weeks later, the appeals court said Slaughter should be reinstated to her role at the FTC once again.

The Supreme Court agreed in late September to hear the case and allowed Mr. Trump to fire Slaughter while it considers the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the FTC.

The Trump administration argued in filings that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and therefore grants him ""illimitable"" authority over officers who wield that power on his behalf. Removal protections for members of independent agencies leave the president ""saddled with subordinate officers"" who prevent him from ensuring that the laws are faithfully executed, Sauer wrote.

While Congress' power to structure the executive branch allows it to establish and organize departments under the president, it does not allow lawmakers ""to establish a Fourth Branch that siphons executive power away from the chief executive's control,"" Sauer wrote.

Congress has created more than two dozen independent agencies with removal protections that seek to shield their members from political pressure.

In its 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court recognized an exception to the president's removal power and said Congress could impose removal restrictions for multimember agencies with quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, like the FTC.

But the Trump administration argued that since 1935, the FTC has accumulated executive powers. Today, the commission executes more than 80 federal laws and regulates a broad range of matters, from meat products to contact lenses to credit cards, Sauer wrote in his filing.

More than 200 Democrats in Congress argued that multimember boards that are protected from at-will removal represent a longstanding compromise between the legislative and executive branches that should not be upset by the judicial branch. They wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that over the past 100 years, 15 different presidents from both parties have signed bills into law that created independent agencies.

Still, Mr. Trump has already seen some success at the Supreme Court in his bid to assert more control over these bodies. The high court's conservative majority has allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission without cause while legal challenges to their removals moved forward.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/08/b79febee-3c14-432f-b07c-6d3f3e192433/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4175b7735f257e8fb424563dc96bb14d/gettyimages-2250109930.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:24.710880

Dec 8 (Reuters) - The developer of the most popular app used to share information about sightings of federal immigration agents sued the Trump administration on Monday, alleging free speech violations after Apple removed ICEBlock from its online store.

The lawsuit was filed in ​federal court by Joshua Aaron, the developer of the ICEBlock app that had over 1 million users before it was removed by Apple ‌in October following pressure from the Trump administration, a rare instance of a tech company removing an app based on a complaint from the U.S. federal government.

Aaron named Attorney General Pam Bondi, ‌Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Director Todd Lyons among other administration officials as defendants.

ICE agents have regularly raided businesses and other places to arrest migrants, even detaining them following immigration court hearings as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

People who oppose Trump's immigration agenda or who say they want to keep immigrants and others safe have used apps and other means to track and document ICE activities and warn people who might be at risk of being detained.

Aaron said he ⁠thinks the Trump administration is not just attacking his free ‌speech rights, but those of all citizens when it goes after apps like ICEBlock, and that he hoped his lawsuit helps stop the administration ""from eroding the Constitution.""

""When we see our government doing something wrong, it's our duty as citizens of this ‍nation to hold them accountable, and that is exactly what we're doing with this lawsuit,"" Aaron said.

The Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Aaron's suit. Apple, which is not named as a defendant, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

APPLE CITED ​LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION

When it removed the app from its store, Apple said it took action based on information from law enforcement about safety risks. The ‌Justice Department confirmed that it had contacted Apple to pull the app, and Bondi said in a statement at the time that ICEBlock was designed to put ICE agents at risk, which the developer strongly disputes.

The app, which is still functioning for people who downloaded it before its removal from app stores, allows users to report publicly observable activity of federal immigration agents and their locations. Aaron, in his lawsuit, argues that the function is similar to what mapping apps like Waze and others do when they allow users to report the locations of police.

The lawsuit says Aaron submitted the app to Apple for approval and that ⁠it had been available through the company's app store since April of this year ​before being removed.

Legal experts have told Reuters that surveillance of immigration agents is largely protected under ​the U.S. Constitution - as long people don't interfere with the agents' work or encourage others to do so. Courts have long held that recording law enforcement activities in public areas is legal.

The suit cites a message Apple sent to Aaron that said ""information provided ‍to Apple by law enforcement"" showed ⁠that his app violated the company's guidelines ""because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.""

Aaron told Reuters earlier this year that his app in no way encouraged violence against federal agents and ⁠rejected accusations that it allowed users to dox those federal agents by noting his app does not allow users to upload any photos or videos.

Instead, the app serves as an ""early warning system"" ‌that was based on what was happening in public spaces, Aaron said, adding, ""you can't limit what everybody can see with their own ‌eyes.""

Clarke have strongly condemned the Trump administration’s immediate, indefinite “administrative hold” on all processing of immigration paperwork by immigrants from 19 countries, including Haiti, that it placed under a travel ban in June 2025.
All 19 countries, which have either partial or full travel restrictions, have been deemed of concern to the administration.
“The actions are despicable and do nothing more than push our immigrant neighbors into the margins,” Awawdeh added.
“We saw it with the Muslim Ban, a policy rooted not in national security but in xenophobia and fearmongering.
“But instead of holding federal agents accountable for their aggressive tactics, the NYPD instead helped facilitate ICE’s campaign of terror.","Caribbean immigration advocates and Caribbean-American Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke have strongly condemned the Trump administration’s immediate, indefinite “administrative hold” on all processing of immigration paperwork by immigrants from 19 countries, including Haiti, that it placed under a travel ban in June 2025.

Besides Haiti, the other 18 non-European countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iran, Laos, Libya, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.

All 19 countries, which have either partial or full travel restrictions, have been deemed of concern to the administration.

The New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC), an umbrella policy and advocacy organization that represents over 200 immigrant and refugee rights groups throughout New York, said the pause suspends green card applications and US citizenship requests, prevents refugees and some others from getting or renewing work authorization, and stops individuals from getting protection for torture and persecution by indefinitely pausing asylum applications.

“Every individual from each country will need an individual review of their case file to move forward,” NYIC President and CEO Murad Awawdeh told Caribbean Life on Wednesday, Dec. 3, stating that the “administrative hold” also halts the completion of citizenship ceremonies for legal US permanent residents from those 19 countries, delaying their path to becoming naturalized American citizens.

“An indefinite pause is a ban, plain and simple,” he added. “The Trump administration is using the recent shooting in DC (Washington) as a pretext for a dangerous escalation of its attacks on immigrants that are rooted in racism and xenophobia.”

Awawdeh said many of the immigrants affected by these policy changes have already undergone extensive vetting, “often taking years, after having arrived in America seeking security, stability, and the opportunity to rebuild their lives.

“Their futures are now in chaos,” he lamented. “People at every stage of the immigration process are already having their lives disrupted, including those who are just one ceremony away from becoming US citizens.

“The actions are despicable and do nothing more than push our immigrant neighbors into the margins,” Awawdeh added. “We urge members of Congress to condemn the Trump administration’s actions and call on the Trump administration to reverse course.”

Congresswoman Clarke, a daughter of Jamaican immigrants who represents the 9th Congressional District in Brooklyn, also told Caribbean Life that the administration’s decision to freeze green-card and naturalization applications for people from the 19 countries is “an outrageous and discriminatory overreach that undermines our values and endangers the lives and futures of countless families.

“Instead of responding to a single, tragic incident with facts and restraint, the administration has chosen once again to scapegoat immigrants — especially those from predominantly Black, brown, Muslim, and other marginalized nations,” said Clarke, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus.

“We have seen this before,” she added. “We saw it with the Muslim Ban, a policy rooted not in national security but in xenophobia and fearmongering.

“Today’s action is a continuation of that same shameful agenda,” Clarke continued. “This policy will trigger fear and despair among immigrants who have already endured years of vetting, only now to be told their hopes of citizenship and full participation in this country are suddenly on hold.”

The congresswoman noted that due process, individualized review, and evidence-based policy are “the cornerstones of a credible national security strategy — not political opportunism.

“Punishing entire populations for the actions of one person is not only unjust — it is un-American,” Clarke said. “Immigrants from nations across Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East and beyond are part of the very fabric of American life — contributing immeasurably to our economy, neighborhoods, and our country’s vitality. They deserve fairness, dignity, and a government that treats them as human beings rather than political pawns.

“I stand firmly with immigrant families, asylum seekers, and all those who came to America in search of liberty and opportunity,” she added, urging the Trump administration to “reverse this reckless and unjust suspension immediately.

“I will continue fighting alongside my colleagues to ensure that our laws reflect our values — not fear, bias, or political manipulation,” Clarke added. “Immigration should not be weaponized. Citizenship should not be suspended based on birth or nationality. Our nation is better than this.”

On Dec 2, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted a policy memorandum in which it directed its personnel to “place a hold on all Forms I-589 (Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal), regardless of the alien’s country of nationality, pending a comprehensive review.”

It also directed its personnel to “place a hold on pending benefit requests for aliens from countries listed in Presidential Proclamation (PP) 10949, Restricting the Entry of Foreign Nationals To Protect the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, pending a comprehensive review, regardless of entry date; and conduct a comprehensive re-review of approved benefit requests for aliens from countries listed in PP 10949 who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021.”

USCIS said the memorandum “mandates that all aliens meeting these criteria undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility.

“An individualized, case-by-case review and assessment will be done of all relevant information and facts,” it added, stating that it will also conduct “a comprehensive review of all relevant policies, procedures, and operational guidance for compliance, accuracy and needed improvements during this time.

“This guidance outlines the adjudicative hold, procedural requirements, and processes for the rereview, interview, or re-interview of affected aliens,” continued USCIS, stating that “personnel are instructed to prioritize national security and public safety concerns and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations during the adjudication process.”

USCIS noted that, on Jan. 20, 2025, Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14161, titled Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorist and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, which “aims to safeguard US citizens from aliens who may seek to commit terrorist acts, pose threats to national security, promote hateful ideologies, or exploit immigration laws for malicious purposes.

“EO 14161 underscores the importance of vigilance during the visa issuance process to ensure that individuals approved for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans or compromise US national interests,” USCIS said.

“Recently, the United States has seen what a lack of screening, vetting, and prioritizing expedient adjudications can do to the American people,” it added, noting that an Afghan national, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, “planned a terrorist attack in the United States on Election Day 2024.”

USCIS said Tawhedi pled guilty in federal court to conspiring and attempting to provide material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

In another instance, USCIS said an Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is “suspected of planning and executing a terrorist attack in Washington, DC against two National Guard members, one who was killed and another who remains critically injured.

“In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the memo said. It also said “USCIS may, when appropriate, extend this review and re-interview process to aliens who entered the United States outside of this timeframe.”

Tanya Greene, US director for Human Rights Watch, said, “Nothing meaningfully links these 19 countries except the administration’s opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born.

“This sweeping change is not about safety; it is about scapegoating entire nationalities for the actions of one individual,” she said. “This policy will tear families apart, endanger people fleeing persecution and further damage US credibility on human rights.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center also said in a statement that the Trump administration is “using the tragic shooting of two national guard members to scapegoat and roll out yet another ban on Black and brown migrants.

“Where there is grief and heartbreak, the Trump administration sees opportunity — i.e, the opportunity to unveil more racist and anti-immigrant policies.

“Neither of these policies are responsive to the tragic events of last week,” it added. “These actions will put countless individuals and families in limbo and jeopardize their right to due process and protection under US and international law.”

Awawdeh said the Trump administration’s latest announcements are “part of an ongoing campaign to attack immigrants’ legal status and dismantle lawful pathways to safety.

“These cruel actions reflect a strategy to put increasing numbers of people on a direct path toward deportation, no matter the cost to our families, communities, or economy,” he said.

In a White House Proclamation, on June 4, 2025, Trump said he was “restricting the entry of foreign nationals to protect the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats.”

At the time, Trump said he had “determined to fully restrict and limit the entry” of nationals from 12 countries including Haiti, Afghanistan, Burma, Iran and Libya, and primarily from African countries – Chad, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

The US president also said he had “determined to partially restrict and limit the entry of nationals” from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

At the same time, the administration has been unrelenting in deporting undocumented, and often documented, Caribbean and other immigrants.

On Sunday, NYIC, elected officials, member organizations, allies and immigrant New Yorkers rallied and held a press conference at a federally-owned parking garage in lower Manhattan.

The day before, several immigrants were arrested amid a protest outside the entrance of the parking garage, where dozens of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared to be gathering for an immigration raid nearby.

Awawdeh said the protest led to scuffles with NYPD officers.

He said, while police officers are barred from colluding with ICE in New York City, due to sanctuary protections, “they continue to provide ‘crowd management’ assistance to federal agents – which led to increased tensions with protesters.

“Hundreds of New Yorkers gathered today to stop ICE from attacking our neighbors,” Awawdeh said. “Instead of protecting the residents of our city, the NYPD violently confronted and arrested protesters. New York is a sanctuary city, and the NYPD has no business collaborating with ICE.

“The violence that occurred today could have been avoided had ICE agents not escalated tensions,” he added. “But instead of holding federal agents accountable for their aggressive tactics, the NYPD instead helped facilitate ICE’s campaign of terror. ICE must stop wreaking havoc across New York — separating families and harming our communities.

“The NYPD must immediately release the New Yorkers who they arrested, and stop all collaboration with ICE,” Awawdeh continued. “Our police force should be using its resources to improve public safety for all New Yorkers.”

Natalia Aristizabal, deputy director of the immigration group Make the Road New York, said that “the NYPD’s response, to escalate tensions, violence, and make arrests, all to clear the way for ICE, runs counter to the spirit of the laws and culture of our city.

“The NYPD must release all New Yorkers arrested and stop facilitating ICE’s actions,” she added. “New Yorkers will not back down in defense of our neighbors, our communities, and our rights, on Canal Street (in lower Manhattan), in Corona (Queens), or on any block in our city.”",https://www.caribbeanlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7449.jpg?quality=51&w=1200&p=q,N,,2025-12-08 19:57:32.853641

But strikingly absent from today’s argument was any interest from the conservative Justices in probing what the Constitution’s history and original meaning say about independent agencies.

The Constitution was originally ambiguous about the scope of presidential authority to fire federal officers—as extensive scholarship and an abundance of amicus briefs in this case have shown—and that’s why the issue has been debated since literally the beginning of the nation. Yet during today’s argument, both the Solicitor General and Justice Amy Coney Barrett—the only conservative Justice to ask about history—wrongly suggested that early precedents barred Congress from limiting the President’s firing authority. As our amicus brief shows, that simply is not true.

When the Constitution’s meaning about the respective powers of Congress and the President is this indeterminate, both Founding-era history and the Supreme Court’s own precedents make clear that the unelected judiciary should not interfere with the choices that those branches themselves—the people’s elected representatives—have made for the past 150 years.

Congresses and presidents have jointly created independent commissions like the FTC for more than half of the nation’s history. The executive branch, whose prerogatives the Trump administration now purports to vindicate, has not only acquiesced in this historical practice, but has actively helped to shape it: for more than a century, one president after another has helped create these agencies, modify them, fund them, and appoint their leaders.

As counsel for Commissioner Slaughter said in response to Justice Barrett today at oral argument, such acquiesced-to, long-established practices—including practices that began after the Founding Era—settle the meaning of the separation of powers. The Supreme Court has recognized in many cases that this is precisely what the Framers envisioned.

Immigration Judge Cynthia Goodman on Monday ordered the release of Bruna Ferreira, 33, from the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Todd Pomerleau, an attorney for Ferreira, said. The facility is about 80 miles from Baton Rouge and more than 1,500 miles from where Ferreira was arrested.

Bond was set at $1,500, the lowest amount allowed under the law, according to Pomerleau.

In court Monday, Ferreira’s attorneys argued “she’s not a danger, she’s not a flight risk,” Pomerleau said.

The lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security did not fight the defense argument and waived appeal, according to Pomerleau.

CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.

Ferreira was arrested while driving to pick up her 11-year-old son from New Hampshire, Pomerleau told CNN. Ferreira was previously engaged to the boy’s father, Michael Leavitt, and the two share custody, Pomerleau said.

Michael Leavitt is the brother of Karoline Leavitt.

Pomerleau said he didn’t know exactly when Ferreira would be released, as it depended on ICE receiving the judge’s order and her family paying the bond.

Then she will return to Massachusetts and her case will be transferred back to Boston immigration court.

It’s all part of what Pomerleau called the “unconstitutional merry-go-round.”

Another of Ferreira’s attorneys said she just wants to be with her son.

“She has established her entire life here in the United States since she has been a child,” attorney Jeffrey Rubin said. “She looks forward to reuniting with her son and getting back to her life as a hard-working business owner.”

A DHS spokesperson previously told CNN that Ferreira was in the US illegally after overstaying a tourist visa that required her to leave the country in June 1999. Ferreira is “a criminal illegal alien from Brazil,” DHS said.

Pomerleau said the DHS statement is inaccurate.

Ferreira’s attorney said she was a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which grants temporary protection from deportation for those brought to the US as children, but was unable to renew her status a few years ago during President Donald Trump’s efforts to end the program during his first administration and is currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Trump, which are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.

A timely CIT filing is the most conservative and reliable way to maintain one’s position while the legal landscape continues to evolve.
Whether to file a protective CIT action depends on several factors that should be imminently considered.","In recent weeks, dozens of importers have filed protective lawsuits in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) to preserve potential refund rights related to the tariffs at issue in Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, which are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court. These lawsuits protect an importer’s right to refunds of those tariffs if the Supreme Court determines that they should be returned.

As discussed in Holland & Knight alerts published on Nov. 7 and Nov. 25, 2025, the Supreme Court recently heard argument on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., authorizes the president to impose tariffs. The Court’s forthcoming ruling could affect the lawfulness of duties already paid and mechanisms available for recovering them.

Given the stakes and procedural uncertainty, importers should evaluate now whether a protective CIT filing is necessary to safeguard their rights.

Many companies are acting because the current posture is, by any measure, unusual. It remains unclear how the Supreme Court's ruling will apply to past entries of goods or what procedural avenues will exist after the decision. Waiting may inadvertently limit importers’ options. A timely CIT filing is the most conservative and reliable way to maintain one’s position while the legal landscape continues to evolve.

Key Concern

A primary concern is entry liquidation, which constitutes U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) final computation of duties owed. Once an entry liquidates, the ability to adjust or recover duties becomes constrained. Given the real possibility that duties may be refundable if the Supreme Court rules against the government, importers should not allow entries to liquidate without considering whether affirmative action is required. A CIT lawsuit provides a mechanism to seek suspension of liquidation and prevents entries from reaching a point where refund claims could become significantly more difficult – or foreclosed altogether.

In addition, there remain open questions regarding administrative remedies and protests that address the legality of the tariffs themselves. It is not yet clear that issues tied to presidential authority under IEEPA would fall within the scope of traditional, protestable CBP decisions. If these issues are ultimately deemed non-protestable, relying solely on protests could leave importers without a viable refund remedy. Filing in the CIT before liquidation is final offers a prudent safeguard against this scenario.

A protective filing also provides procedural advantages should refunds become available. If the Supreme Court’s decision leads to judicial or administrative refund mechanisms, importers with pending CIT cases will already have jurisdiction, timeliness and preservation-of-rights arguments firmly in place. They may also receive earlier clarity regarding legal issues and administrative requirements and avoid future bottlenecks associated with large-scale post-decision refund claims.

For many companies, a protective CIT action is proving to be a cost-effective risk-management strategy. The burden of initiating litigation is modest relative to the financial exposure involved – especially if a later ruling opens the door to significant refunds but procedural obstacles prevent recovery. A filing now may also reduce downstream legal costs associated with attempting to reopen liquidated entries or contest adverse administrative determinations.

Conclusion

Given the financial implications and the rapid increase in filings, importers should review their circumstances immediately. Whether to file a protective CIT action depends on several factors that should be imminently considered.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14849_2738.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:59:11.082500

Viard",,,,,https://www.aei.org/economics/trump-administration-proposes-misguided-approach-to-the-public-charge-rule/,"To that end, Congress has enacted a law, commonly referred to as the public charge rule, that bars immigration by any person who, in the “opinion” of the government, “is likely at any time to become a public charge.” Unfortunately, the Trump administration recently proposed to implement the rule in a harmful and unnecessarily stringent manner.
Under 1999 field guidance, a green card application was denied under the public charge rule only if the applicant was viewed as likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government.
Under the proposal, the public charge rule would be implemented in a manner at least as stringent as the 2019 regulation.
Benefits were foregone by refugees and asylees (whom Congress has exempted from the public charge rule), green card holders, and US-citizen children of non-citizens.
It estimates that hundreds of thousands of non-citizens would forego claiming Medicaid, food stamps, and other benefits, often due to “misunderstanding” by those not actually subject to the public charge rule.","Congress has long sought to prevent potential immigrants from imposing undue fiscal burdens on American taxpayers. To that end, Congress has enacted a law, commonly referred to as the public charge rule, that bars immigration by any person who, in the “opinion” of the government, “is likely at any time to become a public charge.” Unfortunately, the Trump administration recently proposed to implement the rule in a harmful and unnecessarily stringent manner.

The administration’s proposal would primarily impact non-citizens who apply for green cards (through a process called adjustment of status) while in the US on temporary visas. Green cards provide permanent residence and a pathway to citizenship.

Under 1999 field guidance, a green card application was denied under the public charge rule only if the applicant was viewed as likely to become “primarily dependent” on the government. Primary dependence was defined as long-term institutionalization at government expense or reliance on public cash assistance for income maintenance.

In 2019, the first Trump administration adopted a regulation that introduced a much more stringent approach. An application was denied if the applicant was viewed as likely to receive any of a wide range of cash or non-cash government benefits for a number of months in any future three-year period.

In 2022, the Biden administration replaced the 2019 regulation with a regulation that effectively restores the 1999 approach. The 2022 regulation is still in effect.

The Trump administration’s recent proposal (open for public comment through December 19) would repeal the 2022 regulation. Under the proposal, the public charge rule would be implemented in a manner at least as stringent as the 2019 regulation. Unfortunately, confusion about the proposal’s treatment of past benefit receipt would cause many people to unnecessarily disenroll from, or refrain from enrolling in, benefit programs.

The proposal, like the 2019 regulation, would treat past benefit receipt as predictive of future benefit receipt. Accordingly, a green card application could be denied if the applicant previously received government benefits.

The proposal’s treatment of past benefit receipt would have little effect if everyone correctly understood it. Because non-citizens with temporary visas are ineligible for nearly all government benefits, they rarely receive benefits that could adversely affect a green card application under the proposal. Indeed, the administration notes that not a single application was denied due to the 2019 regulation.

While that regulation was in force, however, many people who were not actually subject to the regulation refrained from participating in benefit programs because they mistakenly feared that receiving benefits would have adverse immigration effects. Benefits were foregone by refugees and asylees (whom Congress has exempted from the public charge rule), green card holders, and US-citizen children of non-citizens.

The administration acknowledges that a similar chilling effect would occur under its new proposal. It estimates that hundreds of thousands of non-citizens would forego claiming Medicaid, food stamps, and other benefits, often due to “misunderstanding” by those not actually subject to the public charge rule. It concedes that the failure to claim benefits might lead to worse health outcomes, higher prevalence of communicable diseases, increased poverty, housing instability, and lower educational attainment.

The proposal’s stringent approach is unnecessary. As Pia M. Orrenius, Madeline Zavodny, and I noted in a recent AEI report, the economic literature has found a generally favorable net fiscal impact of immigration.

Even immigrants who appear at first glance to pose a fiscal burden may actually provide a net fiscal contribution due to indirect and long-term effects. For example, a 2017 National Academy of Sciences study found that, although the average low-skilled immigrant imposed a lifetime net fiscal burden, the burden was outweighed by a net fiscal contribution from the immigrant’s descendants. Orrenius, Zavodny, and I also observed that the entry of immigrant workers boosts business investment, which generates additional tax revenue. We further noted that Congress must eventually adopt tax increases and spending cuts to address the long-term fiscal gap, which will increase the net fiscal contribution of all future Americans, including immigrants and their descendants.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AEIdeas-Viard-120825.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:39.834326

Last Thursday, Viktoriia Bulavina, a Ukrainian refugee, and her husband, Viktor Korol, came to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for what was supposed to be Bulavina's green card appointment.

But Korol left without her because she was detained by immigration officials. Now, he's trying to figure out a way to get her released and back home.

Bulavina arrived in the U.S. in 2022 as a refugee, with a humanitarian parole, fleeing from the war in Ukraine.

“Airplanes were dropping bombs, and missiles, and she’s there, they said, for a week in a basement, and then they fled to the other part of Ukraine,” Korol said.

She has been by her husband’s side while he was battling cancer.

“She was there for me when I was in the hospital and then the chemo,” Korol said.

In October 2023, Bulavina filed for and was granted Temporary Protective Status. In January, three months before her TPS status was set to expire, she applied for a renewal, Korol said.

According to her attorney, the online portal said a decision on that extension would have been made within two weeks. In March, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services scheduled Bulavina for a green card interview on December 4.

“Both attorney and me, we were talking to the ICE people, explaining to them her status, you know, that it is a perfect status. That she has TPS, she filed for an extension, and waiting for the extension. I repeated it a couple of times, but they were saying ... her status was expired, so they will detain her,” Korol said.

NBC 7 reached out to USCIS and ICE for information regarding Bulavina's detention and is awaiting a response.

Right now, Bulavina is being held at the Otay Mesa Immigration Detention Center, Korol said. Her husband says she has spent the last few days with little to no sleep.

“She said [they have a] very harsh and inhumane attitude. Basically, you don’t have anything, you don’t have a phone, you don’t have spare clothes, she basically didn’t sleep for three days,” he said.

On Sunday, he visited her at the detention facility. Now, he’s doing everything in his power, working with their immigration attorney, to get Bulavina out as soon as possible.

“This is a complete and utter injustice that is happening to my wife, which is frustrating. It cannot happen in the United States. I’m coming from the USSR, I can understand that I can understand that random stuff and inhumane stuff can happen in those regimes, but this is totally out of whack for where we are and how we feel here,” Korol said.

He also hopes she can get a hearing with a judge to get her case resolved.

In a press release Friday, Bulavina's attorney said in part, “This is a woman who did everything right…There is no justification for detaining her and tearing her away from her family.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/12/Ukrainian-woman-detained-e1765221893923.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-08 18:58:13.032790

has been led by only Republicans since March, after Mr. Trump fired a second Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya.
There were echoes on Monday of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in another major case involving Mr. Trump.
The Supreme Court in January will hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed’s board.
“A lot of these independent agencies, Congress creates them to protect the little guy.”","Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is almost always in the majority in significant cases, said the F.T.C. that opinion shielded 90 years ago looked nothing like the modern commission. Over time, he said, the commission has come to exercise significantly more executive power, an authority the Constitution generally reserves for the president. He referred to the 1935 precedent as “just a dried husk of whatever people used to think it was.”

Even as they appeared receptive to the Trump administration’s maximalist position, several key justices seemed intent on making sure the court’s eventual decision in this case did not threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve. The justices will hear a separate case dealing with Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire a Fed governor in January.

The court’s three liberal justices warned of the far-reaching consequences for the structure of the modern government if the majority sided with the Trump administration in the Federal Trade Commission matter.

A decision in the president’s favor, they said, would call into question the constitutionality of job protections extended to leaders of more than two dozen other bipartisan commissions and boards. Congress intended to protect these agencies from partisan pressures and charged them with protecting consumers, workers and the environment.

Justice Elena Kagan said such a ruling would “put massive, uncontrolled, unchecked power in the hands of the president.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the administration’s lawyer that “you’re asking us to destroy the structure of government” and to “take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a — the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

In response, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said that “the sky will not fall” if the justices give the president this new power. “In fact, our entire government will move toward accountability to the people,” he said.

Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has fired government watchdogs, leaders of independent agencies and rank-and-file federal workers, drawing multiple legal challenges.

The Supreme Court has generally allowed the firings to take effect through temporary emergency orders. Monday’s case presents the first opportunity for the court to issue a conclusive ruling on the underlying legal questions of Mr. Trump’s firings.

Next month, the justices will separately consider whether the president has the power to fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor. The justices have allowed Ms. Cook to remain in her post for now, signaling that the central bank may be uniquely insulated from presidential interference because of its history.

At issue on Monday was Mr. Trump’s firing in March of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democratic member of the F.T.C., who attended the argument and listened intently from the courtroom. Mr. Trump said he was removing her because she did not align with his agenda, despite a law that says the president can remove commissioners only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Ms. Slaughter promptly sued.

Her lawyer, Amit Agarwal of Protect Democracy, told the justices on Monday that presidents of both parties had long accepted that F.T.C. commissioners could not be removed without good cause in part to ensure regulatory stability.

“Folks in power today may not be in power tomorrow, and you want a structure that will be able to withstand the test of time,” Mr. Agarwal said. He added, “Presidents have understood and appreciated the vital interests of the American people can be served by having constraints on the exercise of power.”

Congress intentionally created such bipartisan commissions — made up of experts who could not be fired by the president without cause — to ensure that policy decisions would be made free from politics.

The F.T.C., created in 1914, protects consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power. It is led by five commissioners who serve staggered seven-year terms; no more than three can be members of the same party.

The F.T.C. has been led by only Republicans since March, after Mr. Trump fired a second Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya. After initially challenging his firing, Mr. Bedoya resigned, citing financial pressures.

A district court judge said in July that Ms. Slaughter’s firing was illegal, and in early September, a divided court panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstated her. The panel pointed to the job protections upheld by the 1935 decision that also involved a fired F.T.C. commissioner.

In that decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., the Supreme Court unanimously upheld removal restrictions for government officials on multimember boards. The justices in that case said President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not remove a member of the F.T.C. merely because of political differences.

But in the last 15 years, the court has repeatedly narrowed that decision to give the president more control over executive officials.

The court found in 2020 that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional because it did not allow the president to fire its single director without cause. The court allowed the job protections to remain for multimember bodies like the F.T.C.

But in its emergency orders issued this year, the conservative majority has let the president temporarily remove leaders of agencies led by such multimember boards, including the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

As a result, Mr. Sauer told the justices that the precedent at issue “stands as an indefensible outlier” and must be overruled. “It continues to tempt Congress to erect at the heart of our government a headless fourth branch insulated from political accountability and democratic control,” he said.

Throughout the lively two-hour argument, the justices appeared divided along ideological lines with questions that underscored their starkly different visions of the president’s powers and the role and history of independent agencies.

Liberal justices pointed to recent historical scholarship showing that Congress has long had the power to devise such agencies and fill them with nonpartisan experts.

“Congress is saying expertise matters,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said. “So having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything, is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States.”

Conservative justices in turn expressed concern about independent agencies exercising vast power over individuals and billion-dollar industries without being accountable to the president, who has authority over the executive branch.

“I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said.

But it was unclear exactly how the court’s eventual decision would affect agencies beyond the F.T.C. Several justices, including Neil M. Gorsuch and Chief Justice Roberts, were critical of the reasoning in the 1935 decision, which dealt specifically with the trade commission. But, the chief justice said, that does not mean that “the other agencies fall with it as well.”

Still, if the administration prevails, Mr. Agarwal said, “everything is on the chopping block” — warning that would include the independence of the Federal Reserve.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. pushed back on claims that the Trump administration’s legal arguments would lead to “revolutionary results.” Justice Kavanaugh more than once suggested that the court would carve out an exception to preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve based on the central bank’s history.

There were echoes on Monday of the Supreme Court’s ruling last year in another major case involving Mr. Trump. The conservative majority’s decision in Trump v. United States gave the president immunity from prosecution for his official actions. But the administration relied on it throughout the argument to bolster its expansive view of presidential power.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked the solicitor general whether there were any limits on the president’s authority to fire leaders of multimember commissions even for arbitrary reasons.

Mr. Sauer responded by invoking the immunity decision.

“No,” he said. “This court in Trump against United States held that the president’s power to remove officers wielding the executive power is conclusive and preclusive.”

Abbie VanSickle and Aishvarya Kavi contributed reporting.

The past and future of such agencies were the central topic at Monday’s Supreme Court argument about whether President Trump has the power to fire a leader of the Federal Trade Commission. The court’s decision will have profound consequences not only for that agency, but also for dozens of other bipartisan commissions and boards created by Congress.

Some are well-known bodies like the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates plane crashes, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the nation’s top securities regulator.

Others are relatively obscure but can wield significant powers. Take the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. The tiny Transportation Department agency draws little notice outside the shipping and maritime industries, but it maintains a key North American trade route that $26 billion a year in cargo traverses.

A brief filed in the Supreme Court case lists 50 boards and commissions that could be affected by the court’s decision. They have one thing in common: Congress mandated that they be run by bipartisan leadership groups.

Those boards typically have an uneven number of members, with staggered terms, all appointed by the president — but the various laws that created them often specify that no more than a bare majority of members can come from the same political party. The intention is to insulate the groups from partisan pressures and to encourage negotiation and consensus building.

And Congress frequently adds an additional safeguard by mandating that leaders can be removed by the president only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” That’s the provision the Supreme Court seems poised to overturn.

In March, President Trump fired the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission. His administration claims that the Constitution forbids Congress to limit the president’s ability to run the executive branch.

If the Supreme Court upholds the firings, he will still have to replace the two ousted commissioners with appointees who are not Republicans — or leave the spots vacant — but Mr. Trump will be free to select leaders more aligned with his own views.

That potential change, which would upend a legal precedent that has stood for more than 90 years, alarms critics who fear it would undermine the independence and stability Congress sought to give to agencies with bipartisan leadership.

“Removal protections help ensure that presidential influence is exercised in a more consistent manner than it would be through removal and replacement of the entire board at will,” a coalition of 33 former board members of independent federal agencies wrote in a brief filed to the Supreme Court, adding, “The structure of independent agency boards tends to dampen radical shifts.”

Bipartisan leadership boards are especially prevalent at regulatory agencies with significant power over financial affairs and safety issues.

“Why would you want the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be independent? Well, you don’t want the president firing people for their politics,” said Victoria Nourse, the director of Georgetown Law’s Center on Congress and Democracy. “You want them to be deciding cases based on the physics and their expertise.”

Advocates of multimember commissions argue that those groups operate more deliberatively, especially those stocked with a mix of Democrats and Republicans, than agencies led by a sole director. Forcing officials with diverse views to work collaboratively, the thinking goes, ensures that minority perspectives will be part of the discussion as decisions are made. And it can push regulatory bodies toward compromise positions that temper partisan extremes.

“Every chair in these commissions wants a unanimous decision whenever she or he can,” said Allison Herren Lee, a former S.E.C. commissioner. “It doesn’t always happen, but they try, and that negotiating process almost always produces a better, more balanced rule or decision.”

Ms. Lee, a Democrat, was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2019 and served as the acting chair for the first few months of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s term. “There are always times when the majority just steamrolls, but that’s not the norm,” she said. “And it’s always understood that can be a risky approach to take, because minority commissioners do have tools at their disposal to respond both in the moment and with future issues that arise.”

Those kinds of checks and balances appealed to federal lawmakers stretching as far back as Alexander Hamilton, who proposed the structure the first Congress adopted for the Sinking Fund Commission. He saw it as a way of insulating the commission from political pressure, according to a 2020 article by Christine Kexel Chabot in The Notre Dame Law Review.

The group’s five members included some, like the vice president, who could not be removed at will by the president. And Hamilton himself, then the Treasury secretary, served on the inaugural Sinking Fund Commission alongside Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, his bitter political rival. (The commission disbanded in the 1830s, after the war debt was resolved and the Treasury secretary assumed more direct control of the nation’s spending.)

Rachelle Chong, a Republican, spent three years as a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission during President Bill Clinton’s administration. She sees the removal protections afforded to commissioners as a vital safeguard not only for those officials and their work, but also for the politicians they ultimately serve.

“We can make hard decisions and take the heat for it, whereas the elected politicians can say: ‘Well, I didn’t do it. Those guys did it, and they’re the independent agency,’” she said.

Both Ms. Chong and Ms. Lee — who each signed the former board members’ Supreme Court brief — fear for the stability of regulatory bodies, and the industries they oversee, if those removal protections vanish.

The Federal Reserve is the most prominent and powerful example of an independent agency led by a bipartisan board. The Supreme Court in January will hear arguments on Mr. Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Fed’s board.

But the court’s decision in Monday’s case will affect the boards of many agencies that shape aspects of Americans’ daily lives. They include the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which investigates products that cause injuries and deaths; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; the Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s antitrust watchdog; the National Labor Relations Board and other worker-protection agencies; the Postal Service; and the federal commissions that oversee campaign finance laws, international trade and nuclear safety.

“I think people should be worried,” said Ms. Nourse, the Georgetown Law scholar. “A lot of these independent agencies, Congress creates them to protect the little guy.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/live-blog-20251208-trump-supreme-court-presidential-power-header-bthf/live-blog-20251208-trump-supreme-court-presidential-power-header-bthf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:51.653252

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.
Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies.
""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.
Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.","The developer of ICEBlock, an iPhone app that anonymously tracks the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has sued the Trump administration for free speech violations after Apple removed the service from its app store under demands from the White House.

The suit, filed on Monday in federal court in Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally prosecute the app's developer and pressured Apple to make the app unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October.

Following Apple ejecting ICEBlock, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that ""we reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so.""

Lawyer Noam Biale, who filed the suit against the administration, said Bondi's remarks show the government illegally pressuring a private company to suppress free speech.

""We view that as an admission that she engaged in coercion in her official role as a government official to get Apple to remove this app,"" Biale said in an interview with NPR.

The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.

When reached for comment, Apple also did not respond. The lawsuit, which does not name Apple, says the tech giant bowed in the face of political pressure.

""For what appears to be the first time in Apple's nearly fifty-year history, Apple removed a U.S.-based app in response to the U.S. government's demands,"" according to the suit.

Developer calls immigration crackdown 'abhorrent'

Joshua Aaron, the Austin, Texas-based developer of ICEBlock, said he launched the app as a way to empower those opposed to Trump's immigration crackdown.

""It was just the best idea I had to do everything I could to fight back against what was going on,"" Aaron said in an interview, describing Trump's immigration enforcement blitz as ""abhorrent.""

The app allows people to report an ICE agent sighting within a 5 mile radius, similar to how map apps, like Waze and Google and Apple Maps and others, alert drivers to police setting up speed traps. The ICE sighting alerts do not include photographs or videos and expire in four hours.

Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies. An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.

Aaron's lawsuit says Bondi is mischaracterizing the purpose of the app.

""Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,"" according to the lawsuit.

Attorney General Bondi, in a July interview with Fox News, suggested Aaron was under investigation and had committed a crime. ""We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,"" Bondi said.

To legal experts, ICEBlock is latest ""jawboning"" example

To First Amendment advocates, the White House's pressure campaign targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what's known as ""jawboning,"" when government officials wield state power to suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice ""censorship by proxy.""

ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action and Bondi promising a crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are two other prominent instances.

""The use of a high-level government threat to force a private platform to suppress speech fundamentally undermines the public's right to access information about government activities,"" said Spence Purnell, a resident senior fellow at R Street, a center-right think tank. ""If high-level officials can successfully silence political opposition, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free expression in this country.""

Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the White House's campaign against ICEBlock shows the administration using what has become a familiar playbook: ""To use threats of adverse legal and financial consequences, sometimes vague sometimes not so vague, to pressure universities, media companies, law firms, you name it, into not speaking in the ways they like,"" she said.

One potential weak spot for the lawsuit, however, is a lack of direct evidence that Attorney General Bondi, or other administration officials, made threats against Apple to have the app removed, rather than merely convinced the tech company to do so.

""And government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they persuade private speech platforms to suppress speech because that speech poses a national security risk or is harmful in some other way,"" Lakier said. ""They only violate the First Amendment when they coerce or attempt to coerce the private platform to suppress the speech.""

Since Apple kicked ICEBlock out of its app store, it cannot be downloaded now, but those who had it on their phones before the ban can still use it. Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.

Aaron said he hopes the suit will lead to ICEBlock being restored to the iPhone app stores and for a clear message to be sent to the Trump administration that prosecuting him for his role in developing the app would be illegal.

Aaron said he and his legal team ""have been preparing for this fight,"" adding that ""we will take it as far as it needs to go to ensure this never happens again.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1290x726+0+229/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8b%2F87%2Fa4dd5c35457fa5839bf36613d6e1%2Ficeblock-photo.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:32.727605

Loren AliKhan, a Washington-based US district judge, in July blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter, rejecting his administration’s argument that the tenure protections unlawfully encroached on presidential power.","The US supreme court on Monday appeared poised to back the Trump administration’s argument that the president should be able to fire independent board members that for almost a century have been protected from presidential interference.

The court heard arguments concerning the legality of Donald Trump’s firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and appeared to be split down partisan lines in favor of a historic expansion of executive power, with the conservatives – including the sometimes swing vote of Justice Amy Coney Barrett – seeming to side with the administration.

The justice department has appealed a lower court’s decision that the Republican president exceeded his authority when he moved to dismiss Rebecca Slaughter, the Democratic FTC member, in March before her term was set to expire.

John Yoo, who served as a justice department lawyer under George W Bush, told Reuters the case presents “one of the most important questions over the last century on the workings of the federal government”. He added: “The future of the independence of the administrative state is at issue.”

The case gives the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, an opportunity to overturn a New Deal-era supreme court precedent in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v United States that has shielded the heads of independent agencies from removal since 1935.

D John Sauer, the solicitor general, repeatedly argued that independent agencies like the FTC are a “headless fourth branch” with limited government oversight and that, in general, “independent agencies are not accountable to the people”. He argued that the key 90-year precedent, Humphrey’s Executor, “must be overruled”, describing the ruling as a “decaying husk with bold, and particularly dangerous pretensions”.

Regarding the 1935 precedent ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts said that historic precedent has “nothing to do with what the FTC looks like today”. That decision, he said, “was addressing an agency that had very little, if any executive power”.

The liberal justices, meanwhile, appeared sympathetic to Slaughter’s lawyer warning that “there are real-world risks that are palpable” in allowing a president the power to fire leaders of independent agencies. Doing so meant that “everything is on the chopping block”, Amit Agarwal said.

Sounding the alarm, liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor said that independent agencies have existed throughout US history. “You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” she said.

Justice Elena Kagan warned that the court should not ignore “the real-world realities” of what its decisions do. “The result of what you want is that the president is going to have massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power,” she told Sauer. “What you are left with is a president ... with control over everything.”

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also expressed doubt that more presidential firing power is better for democracy and emphasized that centering so much power under presidential control would undermine issues that Congress decided should be handled by nonpartisan experts in independent agencies.

“Having a president come in and fire all the scientists, and the doctors, and the economists and the PhDs, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,” she said.

A 1914 law passed by Congress permits a president to remove FTC commissioners only for cause – such as inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office – but not for policy differences. Similar protections cover officials at more than two dozen other independent agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board.

The conservative justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern to Sauer about threatening the independence of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank.

Kavanaugh asked Sauer: “How would you distinguish the Federal Reserve from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission?” In another case involving presidential powers, the court will hear arguments on 21 January in Trump’s attempt to remove Lisa Cook, the Federal Reserve governor, a move without precedent that challenges the central bank’s independence.

Justice department lawyers representing Trump have advanced arguments embracing the “unitary executive” theory. This conservative legal doctrine sees the president as possessing sole authority over the executive branch, including the power to fire and replace heads of independent agencies at will, despite legal protections for these positions.

Slaughter was one of two Democratic commissioners who Trump moved to fire in March from the consumer protection and antitrust agency before her term expires in 2029. The firings drew criticism from Democratic senators and antimonopoly groups concerned that the move was designed to eliminate opposition within the agency to big corporations.

Loren AliKhan, a Washington-based US district judge, in July blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter, rejecting his administration’s argument that the tenure protections unlawfully encroached on presidential power. The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit in September in a 2-1 decision kept AliKhan’s ruling in place.

But the supreme court later in September allowed Trump’s ouster of Slaughter to go into effect – an action that drew dissents from its three liberal justices – while agreeing to hear arguments in the case.

The supreme court is expected to rule by the end of June.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cd2c23300e3ba73484df981e3719c181c4ce27/402_0_3633_2907/master/3633.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=28799b39fbd68573313a27af6e8130bf",N,,2025-12-08 15:58:53.749283

These ongoing efforts are now grouped under our Immigrant Rights Observatory project. Over the years, our reports have documented both serious concern for the rights of migrants in our state, as well as areas of significant progress in protection of immigrant rights. In recent months, however, threats to the rights of immigrant Washingtonians have increased severely, to the point where egregious violations including enforced disappearance and refoulement are now taking place in our state. Over the next year, we hope to strengthen both our methodologies and our partnerships with impacted communities and frontline advocates to better document and denounce these mounting abuses.

Gross Human Rights Abuses Against Migrants in Washington State

In August this year, we published a report documenting the cases of 14 individuals and two families who have been subjected to enforced disappearance by the U.S. government, including seven Venezuelans illegally expelled to the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador; and six people sent to military detention at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, prior to their deportations. UWCHR researchers compiled information across multiple sources to document these individuals’ ties to Washington state and the circumstances surrounding their disappearance and deportation. In addition to specific cases of enforced disappearance, our research raises concerns of a much larger universe of deportations occurring daily without real due process, under conditions which may constitute refoulement, or the practice of sending a person in government custody to a place where they are likely to face grave danger.

We also documented the role of local institutions in facilitating these deportations: from Boeing Field and Sea-Tac Airport, which provide the infrastructure through which deportations occur daily; to the state Department of Corrections, which collaborates in the detention of Washingtonians completing prison sentences; and the Washington State Investment Board, which invests public funds in businesses that profit from the brutalization of our neighbors. The goal of this research is to make all Washingtonians witness to what is happening on our watch, in the hopes that we might come together in new ways to stop these abuses.

Human Rights Conditions in Immigration Detention

Over the last year, we published two reports as part of our ongoing research regarding human rights conditions at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. The concerns raised by these reports have only deepened as the detained population at the facility has increased in recent months.

The first of these reports, “‘TPD Doesn’t Respond Here’: Patterns of Neglect in Tacoma Police Department’s Response to Reports of Crimes at the Northwest Detention Center,” reviewed ten years of reports of abuse and assault at the detention facility, documenting systematic failure by local law enforcement in its response to reports of crimes at the facility, especially when detained people were the victims. We presented these findings to Tacoma stakeholders including city and TPD officials upon release of the report. Unfortunately, ongoing research suggests that, despite assurances, detained people continue to have little recourse to report crimes in Tacoma.

The second report, “Compliance Theater: The NWDC’s Unenforced Contract,” examined the provisions on ICE’s contract with the GEO Group for operation of the detention facility. Our research found no evidence that ICE has ever exercised its authority to sanction GEO Group under the terms of the contract, even in cases of documented failures to uphold contract provisions. In addition, when UWCHR researchers submitted a series of FOIA requests for documentation mandated under the contract, ICE responded in multiple cases that the required documents did not exist, including reports relating to sexual assault and use of force at the facility. These findings are particularly alarming given the fact that the contract between ICE and GEO Group for the facility expired in September 2025 and is likely to be renewed for an extended period.

UWCHR continued to monitor compliance with state immigrant rights laws including the Keep Washington Working Act and Courts Open to All Act, which have come under threat as the federal government pressures local and state governments for collaboration with immigration enforcement.

The Supreme Court today appeared poised to side with Trump and allow him to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, a provocative move aimed at upending the long-standing concept of independent federal agencies.

In a significant case on the structure of the federal government, the conservative-majority court heard oral arguments on whether Trump had the authority to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter notwithstanding a law enacted by Congress to insulate the agency from political pressures.

The 1914 law that set up the FTC says members can be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has already signaled, with strong opposition from the three liberal justices, that Trump is likely to win the case by allowing Slaughter, a Democrat, to be removed from office while the litigation continues.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer delivered a brief rebuttal before the court adjourned.

He rejected the idea that the administration's position would ""change the structure of our government"" and warned, on the contrary, that a certain interpretation of the independence of some federal agencies could result in the conversion of others into ""multimember agency commissions outside the government’s control.""

If the justices construe the president's powers narrowly, Sauer said, ""then we have a situation where Congress could erect virtual, reconstruct, virtually the entire executive branch outside the president’s control. And that is not even a republican form of government. But that is the logic of the position that’s being advanced here. That is the parade of horrible as the court ought to consider.""

At the end of his rebuttal, Sauer urged the Supreme Court to ""restore the separation of powers to our government.""

Supreme Court arguments this morning in Rebecca Slaughter's challenge to her firing by Trump from the Federal Trade Commission could lead to a dramatic change to long-held Supreme Court precedent and give the executive branch significantly greater authority over federal agencies.

This has been, as we call it in the business, a “hot bench”: Every justice asked several questions of both sides, and the justices were at times stepping over one another in trying to get their questions in. (Lots of “Go ahead."" “Please.” “No, go ahead.”)

The three ideologically liberal justices provided perhaps the strongest commentary of the day during questioning.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.

“Once you’re down this road, it’s a little bit hard to see how you stop,” Justice Elena Kagan added.

“Having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s and replacing them with loyalists and people who don’t know anything is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.

Amit Agarwal, the lawyer representing fired Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, argued that the administration's argument to allow the president to fire members of independent agencies would upend precedent.

""Petitioners are asking you to abandon precedent after precedent after precedent,"" Agarwal said. ""A lot of precedents would go south if their constitutional theory is correct, and a whole lot of history, and dozens of institutions that have been around for a long time that have withstood the test of time, that embody a distillation of human wisdom and experience, all of those would go south.""

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pressed Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is arguing on behalf of the administration, on the ramifications of independent federal agencies reporting to the president rather than Congress.

""Congress established them and can eliminate them,"" she said. ""Congress funds them and can stop, so to the extent that we're concerned that there's some sort of entity that is out of control and has no control, I guess I don't understand that argument.""

Later, Jackson explained that she believed independent agencies exist ""because Congress has decided that some issues, some matters, some areas, should be handled in this way by nonpartisan experts.""

Jackson, one of the court's liberal justices, added that she understood the creation of independent agencies to be because ""Congress is saying that expertise matters with respect to aspects of the economy and transportation and the various independent agencies that we have.""

""So having a president come in and fire all the scientists and the doctors and the economists and the Ph.D.s, and replacing them with loyalists and people who don't know anything, is actually not in the best interest of the citizens of the United States,"" she said.

Sauer emphasized in his response that the Constitution ""forbids Congress from shaving away the president's control.""

Trump lashed out at Paramount, which owns CBS News, over a ""60 Minutes"" interview with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, reigniting an old beef with the show and potentially complicating Paramount's already messy fight to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.

""My real problem with the show"" wasn't Green, R-Ga., the president posted on Truth Social, ""it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well, far worse things can happen.""

The president's post came while Paramount CEO David Ellison, whose father is major Trump donor Larry Ellison, was being interviewed on CNBC to defend his company's hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Paramount lost a bidding war for the company to Netflix, which agreed to buy Warner Bros.' studios and HBO streaming assets, but Ellison isn't deterred.

Trump's dissatisfaction with Paramount could upend the regulatory process. Paramount and many critics within Hollywood have said a Netflix takeover of Warner Bros. would be anti-competitive. Trump himself said he could see an issue with Netflix gaining so much market share. But he also praised Netflix and co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who has reportedly cultivated a relationship with the president.

""I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week,"" Trump added.

NBC News reported in mid-November that the administration had drafted an order that would challenge states' ability to regulate AI technology. The draft order would instruct the attorney general to create an AI task force to target state legislation, a person familiar with the matter said.

Former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred announced this morning that he is ending his Senate campaign in Texas and running for the House, shaking up the primary just hours before filing deadline.

Allred’s announcement that he is instead running for the redrawn 33rd Congressional District in North Texas comes as Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett has been openly weighing a Senate run. She is announcing her decision later this afternoon.

“In the past few days, I’ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,” Allred said in a statement. “That’s why I’ve made the difficult decision to end my campaign for the U.S. Senate.”

Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., will face a primary challenge from progressive state Sen. Julie Gonzales, who announced her Senate bid today.

Gonzales is the first major primary challenger to try to unseat Hickenlooper.

In her announcement video, Gonzales framed Hickenlooper as a longtime politician and criticized the “establishment.”

“I know we’re not fooled by his so-called ‘common sense approach, 'cause there is no sense in voting for Donald Trump’s nominees or parading across the country to tell us we don’t want universal health care when millions of families are struggling to make ends meet every month,” she said in the video. “This ‘go along to get along’ politics is robbing us blind.”

A spokesperson for Hickenlooper's campaign told NBC News in a statement that the senator ""is focused on delivering for Colorado"" and pointed to his efforts opposing the administration and working to lower costs.

""Republicans know their only hope of flipping Colorado hinges on dividing us,"" the spokesperson said. ""John Hickenlooper has spent his time as Mayor, as Governor and as U.S. Senator uniting us, and now fighting against the illegal chaos and outright corruption that has come to define MAGA and our President. Senator Hickenlooper looks forward to a healthy and unifying primary.""

Hickenlooper won his first Senate term in 2020, flipping the seat blue. He previously served as Colorado governor.

In a high-profile interview, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., bashed Trump, accusing her onetime political ally-turned-foe of inciting death threats against her and her son and failing to live up to his campaign pledge to focus on improving the lives of Americans.

“For an ‘America First’ president, the No. 1 focus should have been domestic policy, and it wasn’t. And so, of course, I was critical, because those were my campaign promises,” Greene said in an interview that aired last night on CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” “Once we fix everything here, then fine, we’ll talk to the rest of the world.”

Later, CBS News’ Lesley Stahl asked Greene: “Are you MAGA?”

“I am America First. ... MAGA is President Trump’s phrase. That’s his political policies,” Greene said, referring to Trump’s signature motto, “Make America Great Again.” “I call myself America First.”

Trump has said he is “disappointed” with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he said had not read the latest plan to end Russia’s war.

Trump’s criticism adds to mounting U.S. pressure on Kyiv as Zelenskyy prepared to meet today with top European leaders, amid fears on the continent that Washington was pushing a deal that was favorable to Russia.

Trump’s team held talks with Ukrainian officials in Miami after flying to the Kremlin with a revised version of the peace proposal, but the push from Washington has so far failed to find a breakthrough. The Kremlin has not publicly supported a plan and has stuck to its hard-line demands.

The Supreme Court today weighs whether to drive the final nail into the coffin of the long-standing concept of independent federal agencies that operate at arm’s length from the president.

In a significant case on the structure of the federal government, the conservative-majority court is hearing arguments on whether Trump had the authority to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission regardless of a law enacted by Congress to insulate the agency from political pressures.

The court has already signaled, with strong opposition from the three liberal justices, that Trump is likely to win the case by allowing the Democratic-appointed commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, to be removed from office while the litigation continues.

READ: The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents","WASHINGTON (AP) — The maker of an iPhone app that flagged sightings of U.S. immigration agents sued the Trump administration for free speech violations on Monday, alleging that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi used her “state power” to force Apple to remove the app.

Apple in October removed ICEBlock and other apps from its app store after Bondi said they put Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at risk by enabling people to track ICE activity in their neighborhoods.

The lawsuit from ICEBlock app maker Joshua Aaron argued that the government's actions violated the First Amendment.

The lawsuit also asks a federal judge to protect the Texas-based software developer from prosecution, alleging “unlawful threats made by Attorney General Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and White House Border Czar Tom Homan to criminally investigate and prosecute Aaron for his role in developing ICEBlock.”

The Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICEBlock was the most widely used of the ICE-tracking apps in Apple’s app store until Bondi said in October that her office reached out to Apple “demanding that they remove ICEBlock” and claiming that it “is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.”

Apple soon complied, sending an email to Aaron that said it would block further downloads of the app because new information “provided to Apple by law enforcement” showed the app broke the app store rules.

According to the email, which Aaron shared with The Associated Press in October, Apple said the app violated the company’s policies “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.”

An example of the latter comes from Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). The senator wrote the Trump administration a letter expressing concern over H-1B. So far so good.

But the senator says in his letter that “we must ensure such programs are not used to undercut or replace U.S. employees.”

Say what?

When Congress makes it explicitly legal to replace Americans with H-1B workers, Congress has to expect that employers will replace Americans with H-1B workers. Congress designed the H-1B program to replace Americans with cheap, foreign workers. The adverse effects of the H-1B program that we are seeing are exactly what Congress intended when it created H-1B.

Some of the questions in the Senator’s letter are troubling.

4. How will you ensure companies make good faith efforts to fulfill all H-1B requirements, including those requiring prioritization of U.S. workers over H-1B employees?

No such requirement effectively exists. Congress enacted a sham requirement that basically applies to no one and is designed to be unenforceable.

5. The press release announcing Project Firewall states the Secretary of Labor will personally certify the initiation of investigations. How will you ensure this personal certification requirement does not needlessly add red tape, enable corruption or pay-to-play, or hamper the visa program’s overall objectives?

Congress created the requirement that the Secretary of Labor personally certify investigations. Congress was trying to make sure such investigations did not happen.

Trump’s Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the court should overturn a 1935 decision that upheld independent agencies.
If the president is free to fire the leaders of independent agencies, they said, the longstanding civil service laws could be struck down as well.
But the six conservatives said they were concerned that these agencies were exercising “executive power” that is reserved to the president.
It was not clear, however, whether the court will rule broadly to cover all independent agencies or focus narrowly on the FTC and other similar commissions.","The Supreme Court’s conservatives sound ready to overrule Congress and give President Trump more power to fire officials at independent agencies and commissions.

The justices heard arguments Monday on whether Trump could fire Rebecca Slaughter, one of two Democratic appointees on the five-member Federal Trade Commission.

The case poses a clash between Congress’ power to structure the government versus the president’s “executive power.”

A ruling for Trump portends a historic shift in the federal government — away from bipartisan experts and toward more partisan control by the president.

Trump’s Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the court should overturn a 1935 decision that upheld independent agencies. The decision “was grievously wrong when it was decided. It must be overruled,” he told the court.

The court’s three liberals strongly argued against what they called a “radical change” in American government.

If the president is free to fire the leaders of independent agencies, they said, the longstanding civil service laws could be struck down as well.

It would put “massive, uncontrolled and unchecked power in the hands of the president,” said Justice Elena Kagan.

But the six conservatives said they were concerned that these agencies were exercising “executive power” that is reserved to the president.

It was not clear, however, whether the court will rule broadly to cover all independent agencies or focus narrowly on the FTC and other similar commissions.

For most of American history, Congress has created independent boards and commissions to carry out specific missions, each led by a board of experts who were appointed with a fixed term.

But the court’s current conservative majority has contended these commissions and boards are unconstitutional if their officials cannot be fired at will by a new president.

Past presidents had signed those measures into law, and a unanimous Supreme Court upheld them 90 years ago in a case called Humphrey’s Executor vs. U.S.

In creating such bodies, Congress often was responding to the problems of a new era.

The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to regulate railroad rates. The FTC, the focus of the court case, was created in 1914 to investigate corporate monopolies. The year before, the Federal Reserve Board was established to supervise banks, prevent panics and regulate the money supply.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission to regulate the stock market and the National Labor Relations Board to resolve labor disputes.

Decades later, Congress focused on safety. The National Transportation Safety Board was created to investigate aviation accidents, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission investigates products that may pose a danger. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission protects the public from nuclear hazards.

Typically, Congress gave the appointees, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, a fixed term and said they could be removed only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.”

Slaughter was first appointed by Trump to a Democratic seat and was reappointed by President Biden in 2023 for a seven-year term.

But conservatives often long derided these agencies and commissions as an out-of-control “administrative state,” and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said he believes their independence from direct presidential control is unconstitutional.

“The President’s power to remove — and thus supervise— those who wield executive power on his behalf follows from the text” of the Constitution, he wrote last year in his opinion which declared for the first time that a president has immunity from being prosecuted later for crimes while in office.

Roberts spoke for a 6-3 majority in setting out an extremely broad view of presidential power while limiting the authority of Congress.

The Constitution in Article I says Congress “shall have the power...to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution...all other powers vested” in the U.S. government. Article II says, “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States.”

The current court majority believes that the president’s executive power prevails over the power of Congress to set limits by law.

“Congress lacks authority to control the President’s ‘unrestricted power of removal’ with respect to executive officers of the United States,” Roberts wrote last year in Trump vs. United States.

Four months later, Trump won reelection and moved quickly to fire a series of Democratic appointees who had fixed terms set by Congress. Slaughter, along with several other fired appointees, sued, citing the law and her fixed term. They won before federal district judges and the U.S. Court of Appeals.

But Trump’s lawyers filed emergency appeals at the Supreme Court, and the justices, by 6-3 votes, sided with the president and against the fired officials.

In September, the court said it would hear arguments in the case of Trump vs. Slaughter to decide on whether to overturn the Humphrey’s Executor decision.

At the time, conservatives applauded the move. “For far too long, Humphrey’s Executor has allowed unaccountable agencies like the FTC to wield executive power without meaningful oversight,” said Cory Andrews, general counsel for the Washington Legal Foundation.

In defense of the 1935 decision, law professors noted the court said then that these independent boards were not purely executive agencies, but also had legislative and judicial duties, like adopting regulations or resolving labor disputes.

But Roberts and the conservatives have not been swayed by those arguments.

They are, however, not sure what to with the Federal Reserve Board, whose independence is prized by business. The Chamber of Commerce said the court should overrule the 1935 decision, but carve out an exception for the Federal Reserve.

Trump’s lawyer grudgingly agreed. If “an exception to the removal power exists,” he wrote in his brief in the Slaughter case, it should be “an agency-specific anomaly” limited to the Federal Reserve.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29e0eff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6123x3215+0+435/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9e%2F831abe4e4ae69296cd11f8bb770d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2203860656,N,,2025-12-08 14:57:08.973796

It sheds light on how their lives have changed under President Donald Trump's second term. The report shows how federal policies, combined with Florida's state policies, have pushed the immigrant community into social isolation.

USF sociology professor Elizabeth Aranda oversaw the research project. She said the report does not recommend specific policy decisions but could serve as a resource for lawmakers and the public.

The group interviewed include those without legal status, asylum seekers, people in the country with temporary protected status (TPS), DACA recipients, legal permanent residents known as Green Card holders and U.S. citizen children of immigrants.

""The impact of these enforcement policies really seeped into virtually every area of social life,"" said Aranda.

Avoiding law enforcement

In their testimonies, immigrants reported not going to work, church, the doctor or grocery stores to avoid contact with law enforcement. They also expressed hesitance to contact local police if they were victims of crime or witnessed a crime.

Florida holds the most 287(g) agreements with federal immigration agencies, the report stated. Those agreements allow local law enforcement and state agencies to aid federal immigration efforts.

""Across the board, everyone in the sample talked about insomnia, issues with their appetite — either losing their appetite or eating more — anxiety, depression, fatigue, hair loss, just a range of psychosomatic symptoms,"" Aranda said.

Parents said their U.S.-born children experienced similar ailments and were hypervigilant.

Aranda described one interviewee who said her daughter asked if her mom would still be home when she returned from school.

""She was always gleefully surprised that her mother was there. It gives you a little window into how children are thinking,"" said Aranda.

Interviewees described employment becoming more precarious. Immigrants have moved from construction, agriculture and other industries into more informal work, such as delivery driving or small-scale reselling, that are lower-paying and potentially exploitative.

Migrant farmworkers choose to stay

The fear of being stopped by law enforcement, the report said, did not only end travel to local job sites. Migrant farmworkers, who travel out of state for seasonal farm work, have also opted to stay in the state.

Immigrants also spoke of exploitation and scams.

Amanda, a 39-year-old asylum seeker from Venezuela who has lived in the U.S. for 11 years, described how members of her extended family lost thousands of dollars to a sham recruitment operation.

Amanda describes how her uncles paid a $400 deposit but ultimately were not hired to work.

""As work becomes less stable and more dangerous, the ripple effects extend directly into the home. Families already struggling to maintain employment now face shrinking options for where and how to live,"" the report said.

Some reported having to sell their homes, while others downsized and moved in with family members to consolidate expenses.

Even with increased enforcement, however, the report said that a majority spoke about staying.

""People felt like moving to another state wasn't necessarily going to solve things,"" Aranda said, ""so the question was, do they leave the country or not? And many of them chose to stay because the original reasons they left and the original reasons they built their lives here [in the U.S.].""

Rosa, a 42-year-old undocumented mother from Mexico, said she wants to stay in the U.S. for her children.

""Sometimes I would like to [leave]. But because of my children, no, since they're studying here, I think about it more for them. When I get stressed … yes, I would like to leave, but I try to keep going for them,"" said Rosa.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f09a5a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4725x2481+0+335/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2Fe1%2F4da6b9cb493f820dc944729ef136%2Fap23258621693075.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:56:43.636187

WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced the launch of a new webpage, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which aggregates information on criminal illegal aliens arrested by DHS during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump Administration.

The webpage allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens who have been arrested across all 50 states, with criminal histories that include homicide, assault, rape, drug trafficking, child molestation, cruelty toward a child, battery, and armed robbery, among other crimes.

“This new Worst of the Worst webpage allows every American to see for themselves the criminal illegal aliens that we are arresting, what crimes they committed, and what communities we removed them from. This is all about transparency and showing results,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “As the media whitewashes the facts, day in and day out, our brave men and women of ICE risk their lives for the American people. Americans don’t have to rely on the press for this information – with this transparent tool, they can see for themselves what public safety threats were lurking in their neighborhoods and communities.”

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has fulfilled President Trump’s promise to carry out mass deportations – starting with the worst of the worst – including the thousands of criminal illegal aliens featured on the new webpage.

The launch comes as sanctuary city and state leaders refuse to assist federal law enforcement in honoring federal immigration detainers, and as malicious lies and hoaxes, driven by hateful rhetoric from the mainstream media, continue to distort the work of the brave men and women of ICE and CBP. With assaults against officers up more than 1,150% and an unprecedented surge in vehicle ramming attacks, the page showcases the incredible work of our officers as they continue to remove violent criminals from our streets and protect American families. The new page will feature 10,000 arrests upon launch and the Department will continue to update the page.

Some of the Worst of the Worst arrests featured on the page include:

Marimow, www.nytimes.com, ann-e-marimow",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/07/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-independent-agencies.html,"The Trump administration’s robust view of the executive is being weighed by a conservative Supreme Court majority that has also embraced the so-called unitary executive theory.
Some conservatives on the court have been signaling for years that they were eager to overturn the precedent, decided in 1935, that protects independent agencies.
Like other independent agencies, it was designed by Congress to be shielded from politics.
Mr. Trump dismissed her in March in an email that said her service was “inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.” She then sued.
Congress has also created dozens of new independent agencies that have wide-ranging responsibilities.","As a young staff member in the Reagan administration, John G. Roberts Jr. was part of a group of lawyers who pushed for more White House control over independent government agencies.

The “time may be ripe to reconsider the existence of such entities, and take action to bring them back within the executive branch,” the future chief justice of the United States advised the White House counsel in a 1983 memo. Independent agencies, he wrote, were a “constitutional anomaly.”

Once he ascended to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts joined other conservatives on the bench in a series of rulings that have chipped away at Congress’s power to constrain the president’s authority to fire independent regulators.

That decades-long project of the conservative legal movement collides on Monday, when the case is argued in the court. At stake is President Trump’s desire to oust officials across the government, in defiance of federal laws meant to protect their jobs and shield them from politics.

The result, the Supreme Court’s recent decisions suggest, is that the majority will likely side with Mr. Trump in a move that could significantly shift power from Congress to the president and usher in a dramatic change in the way the federal government is structured.

“This is not a bolt out of the blue,” said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer representing an agency official in a separate case who was also fired by the president.

“There is a tendency to see this as merely part of a recent short-term drama about President Trump, but really a majority of the justices have long been sympathetic to the argument that the Trump administration is making here — and that’s a view that transcends this presidency,” he said.

Monday’s case specifically tests whether President Trump can fire Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, simply because he says she does not align with his agenda — despite a law that says the president can only remove commissioners for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The court’s ruling, expected by the end of June, has implications for more than two dozen other agencies that are charged with protecting consumers, workers, the environment and nuclear safety, and have traditionally been insulated from complete presidential control by similar laws.

Since he returned to the White House, Mr. Trump has repeatedly ousted Democratic leaders of independent agencies, including at the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to make way for replacements who share his policy priorities.

A number of the officials have sued. The Supreme Court has generally allowed their firings to take effect but has done so in temporary emergency orders while their lawsuits proceeded through lower courts. In Ms. Slaughter’s case, the court will render a final and lasting judgment on the legality of Mr. Trump’s firings, a major test for the justices to determine how far to expand presidential power.

In January, the Supreme Court will separately consider whether the president has the power to fire Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board governor. In that case, the justices have allowed Ms. Cook to remain in her post for now, signaling that the central bank’s history may mean it can be uniquely insulated from presidential interference.

The Trump administration’s robust view of the executive is being weighed by a conservative Supreme Court majority that has also embraced the so-called unitary executive theory. That is the idea, dating back to the Reagan administration, that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and that he must be able to control everything the executive branch does.

Some conservatives on the court have been signaling for years that they were eager to overturn the precedent, decided in 1935, that protects independent agencies.

In a 2010 decision, Chief Justice Roberts said the president’s power generally includes “the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties. Without such power, the president could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities.”

Then, in 2020, during Mr. Trump’s first term, the court took a major step toward expanding the president’s power to fire independent officials. In a 5-to-4 decision, the court said the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional because it did not allow the president to fire the director without cause.

But the majority decision, again written by the chief justice, made a distinction between government agencies run by a single director and those led by multimember commissions that “do not wield substantial executive power.”

In its recent emergency orders, the court, with three justices nominated by Mr. Trump, has telegraphed strongly that it is now poised to give the president more direct control over those agencies as well.

“Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the president,” the majority said in an unsigned opinion in May, “he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”

Such orders have drawn vigorous dissents from the court’s three liberal justices, who accused the majority of displaying “impatience” to decide the fate of the 1935 precedent, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States. The majority, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in September, seemed determined to “extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.”

Created in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission protects consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power. Like other independent agencies, it was designed by Congress to be shielded from politics. It is led by five commissioners who serve staggered seven-year terms; no more than three can be members of the same party.

Ms. Slaughter, first nominated by Mr. Trump in 2018, was renominated by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2023, and unanimously confirmed by the Senate to a term that expires in 2029. Mr. Trump dismissed her in March in an email that said her service was “inconsistent with my administration’s priorities.” She then sued.

Mr. Trump dismissed a second Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya, as well. He initially challenged his firing but later resigned, citing financial pressures. As a result, the F.T.C. has been led by only Republicans since March.

Lower-court judges sided with Ms. Slaughter. A district court judge said that her firing was illegal and pointed to the job protections upheld by the 1935 decision.

Echoing the chief justice’s arguments dating to the 1980s, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, told the justices that those tenure protections are unconstitutional because they infringe on the president’s power to run the executive branch. The heads of government agencies are essentially the president’s “alter ego” and his ability to oust regulators is an “indispensable tool of control,” he said in a filing.

The F.T.C. regulates matters ranging from credit cards to horseracing, he added, and Congress cannot empower “unelected agency heads to wield executive power walled off from presidential control and electoral accountability.”

Pointing to the recent Supreme Court decisions, he wrote that if the 1935 precedent “is not already a dead letter, this court should overrule it.”

(As a secondary matter, Mr. Sauer said courts have no power to reinstate Ms. Slaughter even if she was improperly removed.)

The administration’s position has the backing of former Republican attorneys general Edwin Meese and Michael B. Mukasey and groups such as the Chamber of Commerce and the New Civil Liberties Alliance.

Ms. Slaughter’s legal team is led by Amit Agarwal, a former law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. He contested the administration’s view of the Constitution’s text and of history and urged the court not to transfer to the president “vast new powers that Congress and prior presidents, working together, chose not to vest in the president alone.”

Her lawyers noted that in the years since the court first held that Congress could adopt job protections for independent agency chiefs, 15 presidents of both parties worked within that system and accepted that F.T.C. commissioners could not be removed without good cause. Congress has also created dozens of new independent agencies that have wide-ranging responsibilities.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/00dc-scotus-agencyheads-top-mvgb/00dc-scotus-agencyheads-top-mvgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:55.141066

In many cases, ICE agents are telling detained spouses at green card interviews that they had overstayed tourist or business visas.
In July, ICE took Soliman into custody after he appeared at a routine check-in with ICE.
During his 73 days in detention, Soliman said he never saw sunlight, never breathed fresh air and never ate a raw fruit or vegetable.
ICE officials invariably say they are just following orders but maybe they should be considering whether their orders are legal.","Back during the first Trump term when we witnessed the child separation policy ripping families apart, I thought we had reached the height of cruelty. But I was wrong. ICE and Border Patrol are trying for a new standard. And there are so many awful stories to learn about. Somehow the idea of deporting the “worst of the worst” got lost and inexplicably the new mission is persecuting the most innocent.

ICE has been arresting foreign-born spouses of U.S. citizens who are complying with the law and trying to obtain permanent residency. The New York Times just did a feature story about this. In many cases, ICE agents are telling detained spouses at green card interviews that they had overstayed tourist or business visas. Foreign-born spouses are being handcuffed and taken away right from the interview.

The government strategy appears to be to induce couples to give up, abandon their case and accept the foreign spouse’s detention. There has been no consideration for either the fact of marriage or the reality that the couple may have small children.

The Times highlighted the case of Stephen Paul who is married to a British wife. Paul works for the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department and he and his wife have a four-month-old baby. At her green card interview, federal agents swooped in and took Paul’s wife away. She had been living in the U.S. for 14 months.

Paul said, “It’s insane to have them rip our family apart. Whoever is directing this has completely lost touch with their mission to the country.”

People like Paul’s wife have always been eligible for green cards in the past. Arrests like this were exceedingly rare as foreign spouses of Americans have typically been approved for permanent residency. The Trump regime is prioritizing fast track deportations regardless of circumstance, no matter how compelling the case or cruel the result.

Paul learned that the government was threatening to deport his wife without a hearing. More generally, this has become their go-to play. Paul’s lawyer had to file a lawsuit in federal court to halt her removal. That worked and secured her release.

Then there is the case of the interfaith chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Ayman Soliman. Soliman is Egyptian and has been in the U.S. since 2014. He had been in trouble with the Egyptian military regime as he had been working as a journalist. Because of his work, he was detained four times by the Egyptian authorities and he had been tortured. He came to the U.S. on a visa to study film and once here he applied for asylum. In June 2018, he was granted asylum.

In July, ICE took Soliman into custody after he appeared at a routine check-in with ICE. His asylum status had been revoked. He spent 73 days in detention. Without proof, the government stated he was part of a terrorist organization. During his 73 days in detention, Soliman said he never saw sunlight, never breathed fresh air and never ate a raw fruit or vegetable.

Because of his popularity for his work pastoring to very ill and dying children, Soliman got widespread support in Cincinnati. He received 760 letters of support from people in the community. The support was so intense that ICE released him from custody and he now awaits a green card determination.

I also wanted to mention the story of Ruperto Vicens-Marquez who has lived in the U.S. for two decades. He and his brother Emilio co-own a locally well-known Mexican restaurant, Emilio’s Kitchen, in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, a seashore community. Ruperto is head chef. He had moved to the U.S. from Mexico in 2007. He had a visa that was legally renewed and he was authorized to be in the U.S. until 2029.

Ruperto did not show up at work on Oct. 17. ICE had picked him up a block away from the restaurant, said he had entered the U.S. illegally and falsely asserted he had an order of removal from the U.S.

ICE held Ruperto at their immigration detention facility in Newark for over a month. The town of Atlantic Highlands was so upset, advocates in the community organized two demonstrations and created a GoFundMe campaign that raised almost $100,000 for legal defense. On Oct. 18, Ruperto was released by an immigration judge’s order.

The Department of Homeland Security says that 500,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office. NPR says 300,000 is a more accurate number.

In immigration court, ICE attorneys are short-circuiting due process by filing motions to pretermit which, if granted, avoid giving immigrants any chance to argue their asylum claim. When such motions are granted, people get deported without a chance to testify. The need for zealous immigration lawyers has never been greater.

Someday this entire enterprise of indiscriminate and racist deportation will be seen for the crime it is. It fits in with other seedier episodes of U.S. history like the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Japanese-American internments and Operation Wetback. If justice ever prevails again, there should be investigations and prosecutions of officials like Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller and Greg Bovino for their violations of due process which have characterized this regime.

ICE officials invariably say they are just following orders but maybe they should be considering whether their orders are legal. When what you are doing is heartless and mean as a crazed rottweiler, it is time to bail.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons sent a letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul calling on him to put the safety of Americans first and honor ICE arrest detainers of the more than 4,000 criminal illegal aliens in the state’s custody including murderers, sexual predators, and those convicted of or charged with weapons offenses.

Illinois' failure to honor ICE detainers has resulted in the release of 1,768 criminal illegal aliens since January 20. The crimes of these aliens include 5 homicides, 141 assaults, 23 burglaries, 4 robberies, 24 dangerous drugs offenses, 15 weapons offenses, and 10 sexual predatory offenses.

There are currently 4,015 aliens in the custody of an Illinois jurisdiction with an active detainer. The crimes of these aliens include 51 homicides, 1,134 assaults, 107 burglaries, 36 robberies, 275 dangerous drugs offenses, 120 weapons offenses, and 813 sexual predatory offenses.

In September, ICE sent a letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul asking for cooperation in honoring ICE detainers on criminal illegal aliens. His office did not respond.

“Governor Pritzker and his fellow Illinois sanctuary politicians are releasing murderers, pedophiles, and kidnappers back into our neighborhoods and putting American lives at risk,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “We are calling on Governor Pritzker and his administration to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 4,000 criminal illegal aliens in Illinois’ custody. It is common sense. Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”

Some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens released by Governor Pritzker and his fellow Illinois sanctuary politicians include:

Victor Manuel Mendoza-Garcia, a 49-year-old illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted for 3 counts of aggravated kidnapping/ransom and sentenced to 18 years in Illinois Department of Corrections in Cook County Court in Illinois. ICE’s detainer for Mendoza-Garcia was not honored. On November 12, ICE arrested Mendoza-Garcia where he remains in ICE custody.

Juan Morales Martinez, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was arrested after a vehicle crash near Westfield, IL where he was a passenger. Early reports of the vehicle crash show two fatalities (a county board member and his wife). Police also found an extended magazine and ammunition in the vehicle. On October 25, ICE lodged a detainer on Morales Martinez. On October 27, ICE arrested Morales after his release from the Clark County Jail. The jail did not cooperate with ICE, but ICE officers suspected his release and performed an enforcement action outside. He has now been removed from the United States.

Amilcar Waldo Gonzalez-Jimenez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted for 1 count of driving under the influence and domestic battery and 2 counts of criminal sexual assault. ICE’s detainer for Gonzalez-Jimenez was not honored. On November 13, ICE arrested Gonzalez-Jimenez.

Juan Alberto Caro Marin, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested and convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse/victim/family and sentenced to 6 years in Illinois Department of Corrections. ICE’s detainer for Caro Marin was not honored. On November 9, ICE arrested Caro Marin where he is currently in ICE custody.

Jose Manuel Fuentes-Vargas, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested for domestic battery, violation of protection order, and convicted of sexual assault of a victim less than 13 years of age. ICE’s detainer for Fuentes-Vargas was not honored. On October 30, ICE arrested Fuentes-Vargas where he is currently in ICE custody.

Leonardo Ignot-Osto, an illegal alien from Mexico, has illegally entered the U.S. at least four times. Ignot has a lengthy criminal history dating back to a December 27, 2010, conviction for theft in Cook County. Most recently on September 18, 2025, Cook County convicted Ignot for child abduction/lure child/victim for a child less than 17 years of age, sentencing him to 1 year imprisonment. Despite an Immigration Detainer lodged September 23, 2025, with the Cook County Jail, Ignot was released. ICE was able to locate and apprehend Ignot and on November 19, 2025, he was removed from the U.S.

Jaime Mandujano-Nunez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was sentenced to 17 years imprisonment in Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC), after his February 9, 2012, conviction for Predatory Criminal Sex Assault of a Child in Cook County. On December 11, 2024, ERO Chicago lodged multiple Immigration Detainers with IDOC. However, on an unknown date, the IDOC released Mandujano back into the community without honoring ICE’s detainers. Mandujano was located and apprehended by ICE and on November 15, 2025, ICE removed him from the United States.

Alfonso Batalla Garcia, an illegal alien from Mexico, with a criminal history including arrests for battery, carrying/possessing a firearm, battery with bodily harm, domestic battery, and Cook County ultimately convicted Batalla in 2001 for attempted murder, aggravated criminal sexual assault with bodily harm, and aggravated kidnapping, sentencing him to 30 years in Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). IDOC refused to honor ICE’s Immigration Detainer and released Batalla on an unknown date. ICE was able to apprehend Batalla and removed him from the U.S. on November 5, 2025.

Guillermo Garcia-Porcayo, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, was arrested by Chicago PD for aggravated battery with great bodily harm. Garcia was then convicted on February 9, 2018 in Cook County of attempted murder with intent to kill and sentenced to 12 years with the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC). On July 2, 2018, ERO Chicago lodged an Immigration Detainer with IDOC. On June 25, 2025, IDOC released Garcia back into the community without honoring ICE’s detainer. On July 15, 2025, ERO Chicago removed Garcia from the United States to Mexico.

This month’s blog focuses on the move-on support provided to individuals with newly granted international protection status, which frequently leaves people who the Government has accepted require sanctuary, facing street homelessness and imminent destitution.

What is Asylum Support?

The Home Secretary has an obligation to provide accommodation and financial support to individuals seeking international protection who are assessed as destitute, while their claim is being determined. This is known as ‘asylum support’ and is most commonly provided under section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum act 1999.

The statutory scheme currently provides that asylum support will be terminated 28 days after an individual is granted some form of international protection. The notice period given by the Home Office before ceasing that asylum support is known as the ‘move-on period’. This move-on period has long been a topic of contention and subject to policy change.

Expert homelessness and refugee organisations have long expressed serious concerns about the 28-day move-on period. For example, in December 2018, the British Red Cross published a report showing that the 28-day move-on period often leaves people facing extreme poverty and homelessness and recommending that the move-on period should be extended to at least 56 days.

Background: A History of the Move-On Period

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Home Secretary operated a practice of ceasing asylum support 28 days after receipt of a Biometric Residence Permit (“BRP”). This practice resumed after a period of temporary operational adjustments introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce street homelessness.

In August 2023, the Home Secretary significantly changed her policy, calculating the move-on period as commencing on the date of the grant of status, prior to being in receipt of a BRP. In effect, this resulted in individuals having a move-on period as short as seven days in some cases. This change led to devastating levels of destitution and in December 2023 the Home Secretary reverted to her previous practice of calculating the move-on period from the date of receipt of a BRP.

On 5 December 2024, the Home Secretary announced a Pilot policy to extend the move-on period to 56 days from the date of the grant of status, a move which was welcomed by NGOs and front-line agencies who had long been calling for such a change as a way to significantly reduce homelessness of newly granted refugees. In the announcement, the Home Secretary confirmed that the decision had been made as an interim measure during the period of increased decision making and the transition to eVisas and that it would remain in place until June 2025. Before June 2025, it was extended for a further three-months.

Curtailment of the Pilot

On 10 July 2025, the Home Secretary announced that the Pilot would be extended again until the end of 2025, to maintain support for local authorities and newly granted individuals during the continued period of increased decision making, and to allow a full assessment of the impact of the Pilot. However, on 26 August 2025, the Home Secretary announced her unexpected decision to curtail the Pilot for all single adults.

As a result of this curtailment of the Pilot, on 1 September 2025, the move-on period was reverted to 28-days for all single adults who do not fall within the ‘exception criteria’. The ‘exception criteria’ includes pregnant women, persons over the age of 65, persons with a known/evidenced disability, and families. Those falling within the exception criteria continue to receive 56 days’ notice.

The decision to curtail the Pilot appears to have been made with the intention of rapidly reducing the number of asylum seekers accommodated in hotels, as a response to the recent riots and growing public interest on the matter.

Insufficiency of the 28-day Move-On Period

As set out above, the move-on period has long been a subject of significant concern for NGO’s and front-line organisations. The insufficiency of a 28-day move-on period to allow time to source accommodation and to access mainstream benefits, if so required, is well-documented.

There is substantial evidence that a 28-day move-on period is incompatible with the interrelated systems of relevant organisations. In summary:

to apply for Universal Credit, an individual must have opened a bank account. Many banks will not approve an account for an asylum seeker, and even once they are granted status, individuals often face barriers such as having a valid proof of address and ID;

claims for Universal Credit usually take an average of five weeks from the date of application until receipt of the first payment. It is therefore not normally possible to be in receipt of Universal Credit prior to the expiry of a 28-day move-on period;

local Authority interim housing is only available if an individual is assessed as being ‘priority need’. Priority need does not include healthy, single adults and so most individuals affected by the curtailment of the Pilot will not be eligible;

Local Authorities have a relief duty to assist individuals who are assessed as homeless to source accommodation. This relief duty usually applies for a period of 56 days which is at odds with the 28-day move-on period; and

it often takes more than 28 days for clients to secure employment. Many refugees suffer from physical or mental health conditions, or speak limited English, which can make it particularly difficult for them to access work.

How to Seek a Reinstatement of Support

Although she has failed to make this clear nor to publish any clear process for seeking extensions of support, the Home Secretary has a discretion to extend the move-on period for individuals. This is otherwise known as a ‘reinstatement request’. This is set out in limited detail in the Home Office’s guidance on ‘Ceasing Section 95 Support instruction’.

DPG is representing a number of individuals who are affected by the curtailment of the Pilot to assist in preventing destitution and street homelessness and, through legal correspondence, the Home Secretary and Migrant Help have confirmed that reinstatement requests should be submitted to:

reinstatements@homeoffice.gov.uk where the individual is due to be evicted within 48 hours; and

coc@migranthelpuk.org and positivemoveon@migranthelpuk.org in all other cases. In these cases, a response should be provided by Migrant Help within five working days.

DPG has prepared template extension requests to assist front-line organisations. Please contact Megan Smith (msmith@dpglaw.co.uk) if these would be of assistance.

Conclusion

On 12 September 2025, over 60 NGOs and front-line organisations wrote to the Home Secretary expressing their concern over the curtailment and what will inevitably result in increased pressure on local authorities and increased levels of destitution and street homelessness in the winter months.

These NGOs have called on the Government to reverse its decision, reinstating a 56-day move-on period for single adult refugees – safe and essential transition time that aligns with existing support systems – and allowing the full pilot evaluation to complete so that the evidence can be used to make wider improvements to the move-on process.

It is hoped that the Government will take these calls seriously as it is clear that reverting to a move-on period of 56 days would have significant benefits for both refugees, a particularly vulnerable cohort, and the UK as a whole. In 2020, the British Red Cross published a cost-benefit analysis of extending the move-on period to 56 days which concluded that extending the move-on period to 56 days could result in net annual benefits of between £4 million and £7 million to the UK.[1]

Moreover, as Enver Solomon, the CEO of the Refugee Council has rightly said: “For too long refugees have been at risk of becoming homeless at exactly the point the Government grants them safety. Extending the time people have to move on should give men, women and children who have lost everything more of a breathing space to find accommodation and work as they rebuild their lives and contribute to our communities.”[2]

Campaign Launches With New Video Here

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR) announced the launch of the Masks Off, Rights On campaign, a new effort aimed at advocating for transparency, accountability, and civil rights in the face of increasingly anonymous and masked law enforcement actions in our communities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

A recent national poll by LCCHR found a solid majority (56%) disapproves of ICE’s performance, and a plurality (46%) strongly disapproves. Only 4% of Hispanic voters say ICE is making life better for everyday Americans. Despite federal law enforcement being required by law to wear identifying uniforms when addressing civil disturbances, the Trump administration’s decision to allow ICE agents to wear masks while carrying out arrests is a dangerous tactic that undermines accountability and public safety.

Maya Wiley, President and CEO of the Leadership Conference, said: “The Trump Administration is sending ICE and other agents into our streets and communities – and it’s making us less safe. ICE is menacing innocent people, including children at school, sowing fear, and even using physical force without justification. They are causing chaos and committing civil and human rights abuses while hiding behind masks and refusing to identify themselves. This is wrong, and it’s dangerous. We’re going to call it out and make our voices heard.”

If ICE agents can be anonymous, criminals can pretend to be them. Agents who abuse people can get away with it. This makes everyone less safe. It erodes trust and makes our neighborhoods places of fear.

The Masks Off, Rights On campaign will bring together policy recommendations, local advocacy tools, storytelling, and a coordinated media strategy to:

Highlight the civil rights and community safety risks of anonymous ICE actions

Support partners and supporters in pushing for transparency and identification protocols

Provide resources to know your rights, prepare for ICE encounters, and take action

Mobilize communities to take action at the local, state, and federal levels

The new public awareness campaign will include:

A launch advocacy toolkit featuring an open letter from LCCHR President, Maya Wiley

A “How To” guide on sending a message to your local representatives or school board, urging them to keep our communities safe.

A video documenting ICE’s masking policy and its impacts on communities

The call for transparency is a call for basic public safety. Our neighbors, our communities, and our safety depend on protecting our basic rights.

Trump administration argues that decision stopping president from removing officers must be overruled

Arguments in the case that will decide whether Donald Trump can fire officials from independent agencies have started.

First up is solicitor general D John Sauer, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration.

He kicks off his opening remarks by arguing that the key 90-year precedent, known as the Humphrey’s Executor, “must be overruled”.

He describes the ruling as a “decaying husk with bold, and particularly dangerous pretensions” that ultimately creates a “headless fourth branch insulated from political accountability and democratic control”.

A quick reminder that, in September, the supreme court granted a justice department request to block a lower court’s order that shielded Rebecca Slaughter, from being dismissed from the consumer protection and antitrust agency before her term expires in 2029. She will remain fired until the court issue their decision.

While answering questions from justices today, Agarwal said that the “real world danger” if the administration is successful, is that “everything is on the chopping block”.

He added that there was “absolutely no principled basis” for “carving out” independent agencies from Congress’s purview.

“We’re talking about more than two dozen traditional independent agencies that have been established by statutes enacted by the people’s elected representatives and signed into law, all of them by democratically elected presidents,” Agarwal said.

The bench just wrapped its questions to the administration’s lawyer, solicitor general D John Sauer.

Arguing on behalf of Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the fired Democratic member of the FTC, is Amit Agarwal.

“Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790,” Agarwal said in his opening remarks. “So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start.”

Justice Jackson is now pushing back against the administration’s claims that these independent agencies aren’t answerable to Congress – which delegates their creation, oversight, budgets and laws.

“Part of your argument seemed to revolve around this notion that there’s some kind of thing happening with the independent agency that the reason why the president needs to control it is because they don’t answer to anybody,” she said.

“What I don’t understand from your overarching argument is why that determination of Congress, which makes perfect sense given its duty to protect the people of the United States, why that is subjugated to a concern about the president not being able to control everything.”

As he responds to questions from justices today, Sauer has repeatedly argued that independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are a “headless fourth branch” with limited government oversight.

When responding to questions from justice Brett Kavanaugh, the solicitor general said that these agencies exercise “a great deal of control over individuals and business” but “ultimately do not answer to the president”.

Speaking now is the third liberal justice on the bench, Elena Kagan.

She says that what the administration is asking for would give the president “massive, unchecked, uncontrolled power” over independent agencies. It’s a role that Congress, with its Article I power, has controlled for 9o years.

Share

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, also pushed back on the administration’s premise – in line with justice Sotomayor’s line of questioning.

“I appreciate that Article II has some language in it that you’re pointing to, but as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the constitution does not speak specifically to removal,” she said. “I don’t know why we’d make that inference when the power to create agencies and set everything up lies with Congress.”

She went on to probe the solicitor general as to why he thought that Congress was “somehow less democratically accountable” for the way in which it constructs agencies and determines the terms of its officers.

“You seem to think that there’s something about the president that requires him to control everything as a matter of democratic accountability, when on the other side, we have Congress saying we’d like these particular agencies and officers to be independent of presidential control for the good of the people,” Jackson said.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of three liberal justices on the bench, seemed unconvinced with the administration’s argument off the bat.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government,” she told solicitor general D John Sauer. “To take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that a government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

Supreme court to hear arguments in case testing Trump's ability to fire officials

In less than an hour, the supreme court will here arguments in a landmark case that tests Donald Trump’s ability to fire officials.

Earlier this year, the president moved to fire Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission. Trump actually appointed her to the position back in 2018, and she was re-confirmed for a second term under Joe Biden that was set to expire in 2029.

One of the main questions the nine-justice bench will consider today is whether to overturn a key 1938 decision which established that the president requires Congress’ signoff to fire an official from an independent government agency, and it needs to be “for cause”.

Slaughter’s case is the latest emergency appeal that the supreme court will hear from the Trump administration, after a lower court judge blocked her firing, and an appeal court upheld that decision. A reminder that, in May, the court allowed Trump to remove two Democratic members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board – despite job protections for these posts – while litigation challenging those removals proceeded. And in September, they deferred action on the Department of Justice’s request to allow Trump to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, at least until it hears oral arguments on the case in January.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is covering the latest out of Europe, particularly the London meeting between Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several Nato allies – France’s Emmanuel Macron, UK prime minister Keir Starmer, and Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Jakub notes:

The sombre tone of the opening remarks was highly telling: it’s clear that this was not merely another photo opportunity designed to merely convey solidarity with Zelenskyy, but they face urgent – increasingly so – issues that need to be resolved soon.

A reminder that Donald Trump Jr warned that his father may walk away from the Ukrainian war in a lengthy tirade against the purpose of continued fighting in Ukraine, as he also claimed Ukraine’s “corrupt” rich had fled their country leaving “what they believed to be the peasant class” to fight the war.

Meanwhile, the president said on Sunday that Russia is “fine” with the peace proposal (although he didn’t elaborate if this was the same framework that Moscow seemed initially unhappy with during Steve Witkoff’s visit). Trump added: “But I’m not sure that Zelenskyy’s fine with it. His people love it. But he isn’t ready.”

More than 2,000 national guard soldiers have been in Washington since Donald Trump’s initial deployment in August, part of the president’s contentious immigration and crime crackdown targeting Democratic-led cities.

In what was seen by many as an example of federal overreach, the president federalised DC’s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its history over the summer.

Trump said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi.

This was despite violent crime in Washington DC actually having fallen sharply since 2023.

Smith says 'there comes a time when you just know it's time' to step down

Axios broke the news of Pamela Smith’s resignation. Speaking to the outlet, she said: “There comes a time when you just know it’s time.”

Smith, who has 28 years of law enforcement experience, said her decision is not related to the deployment of national guard troops to the city.

Speaking to Fox 5 about her decision to resign, the outgoing police chief said it was a “tough” decision and was made to spend more time with her family.

She said:

I have been going nonstop. I have missed many amazing celebrations, birthdays, marriages, you name it, within our family.

And being able to come home for thanksgiving two years after my mum passed really resonated with me and has allowed me to make a decision that I think is necessary not just only for me but also for my family.

Smith is expected to step down on 31 December and the mayor’s office will name an interim chief shortly, according to Axios.

Throughout this period, they consistently had a higher median entry wage than immigrants of all the provinces.","The median wage earned by new immigrants in Canada one year after admission can be a good predictor of their future economic outcomes. The real median entry wage (after adjusting for inflation) of newcomers decreased by 10.6% from 2022 to 2023, the largest decline since 1991.

This drop among immigrants from 2022 to 2023 occurred amid a 1.1% increase in the overall real median wage of Canadians over this period. While entry wages decreased across most immigrant categories, the overall decline is partly related to the fact that the proportion of immigrants admitted as principal applicants under the Canadian Experience Class (CEC), who typically have a higher entry wage, reached an all-time high in 2021, but fell below 2019 pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels in 2022.

This Daily release explores the economic outcomes of recent immigrants in the 2024 Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB). It outlines variations in the economic outcomes of newcomers by admission category, pre-admission experience and province. The IMDB is the result of a collaboration between Statistics Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and the provinces.

The median entry wage for new immigrants decreases more in 2023 than in 2020, but remains higher than every other year prior to 2021

The median entry wage of immigrants steadily increased from 2010 to 2022, except in 2020 when wages were impacted by the pandemic.

From 2020 to 2021, the real median entry wage of immigrants rose by over one-fifth (+21.2%), increasing from $34,400 to $41,700. It then rose a further 6.7% year over year to $44,500 in 2022. In 2023, the median entry wage of immigrants declined by 10.6% to $39,800 but remained higher than the median entry wage in 2020 ($34,400) and every other year prior to 2021.

This was a relatively large decline, given that the overall real median wage of Canadians increased by 1.1% to $47,650 in 2023.

The decrease in the number of Canadian Experience Class principal applicants admitted in 2022 may contribute to the overall decline of the median entry wage of new immigrants in 2023

In 2023, immigrants from each of the main admission categories saw their median entry wage decline compared with the previous year. Specifically, the median entry wage declined for spouse and dependent economic immigrants (-7.3% year over year to $34,400), for immigrants sponsored by family (-4.1% to $30,300) and for refugees (-1.9% to $25,900).

Economic principal applicants, who are selected for their ability to contribute to Canada's economic development, had the highest median entry wage among the four main admission categories at $51,500 in 2023. While this was a 5.5% decline from the previous year, each of the specific programs within the economic principal applicant stream experienced smaller decreases or even increases in entry wage.

In 2023, CEC principal applicants, who are selected based on their Canadian work experience, remained the admission category with the highest median entry wage. Their median entry wage rose 3.4% to $60,600 in 2023, following a decline in 2022 from its peak in 2021 ($71,000).

In 2023, principal applicants from the skilled worker and skilled trades (-4.4% to $56,000) and provincial/territorial nominee (-3.8% to $47,700) programs saw their entry median wages decrease from a year earlier. Business (-2.4% to $24,900) and caregiver (+4.9% to $38,500) principal applicants had the lowest entry income among economic principal applicants.

The decreases in the median entry wages by admission categories in 2023 were mostly smaller than what was observed for the overall immigrant population (-10.6%). This discrepancy is likely related to changes in the makeup of the immigrant population and their admission categories.

In 2021, IRCC specifically invited express entry candidates, who were more likely to be physically located in Canada and therefore less impacted by pandemic-related border restrictions, to apply for permanent residency. This was done, in part, by increasing the number of immigrants admitted through the CEC program, the category with the highest median entry wage. Specifically, the share of immigrants aged 15 years and older admitted as CEC principal applicants increased from 12% in 2020 to 27% in 2021. This change contributed to the growth of the entry wage of all new immigrants in 2022. With the removal of border restrictions in 2022, CEC principal applicants were less targeted, and their share declined to 5% in that year. This, in addition to the other factors at play during the post-pandemic period, contributed to the overall reduction in the entry wages of new immigrants in 2023.

Among economic principal applicants admitted in 2013, skilled workers and skilled trades principal applicants saw their median wage grow the fastest over the following decade

While median entry wage is a good indicator of the short-term economic outcomes of new immigrants, it is also relevant to consider how their wages evolve over longer periods of time. Immigrants admitted in 2013 saw their real median wage increase by 74.8% over the following decade, rising from $27,400 in 2014 to $47,900 in 2023.

The wage trajectory of economic principal applicants varied between admission categories. In 2014, the median wage of economic principal applicants admitted a year earlier was the highest for the CEC ($64,000), followed by provincial and territorial nominees ($47,000), skilled workers and skilled trades ($31,300), and caregivers ($31,300). Meanwhile, it was the lowest among those from business programs ($19,900).

A decade later, in 2023, CEC principal applicants of the 2013 admission cohort remained the category with the highest median wage, at $92,100 (+43.9%). They were followed by skilled worker and skilled trade (+131.0% to $72,300), provincial/territorial nominee (+40.6% to $66,100) and caregiver (+56.9% to $49,100) principal applicants.

Business program principal applicants continued to have the lowest median wage in 2023, at $27,900 (+40.2%).

Immigrants with pre-admission work experience see their median entry wage decrease in 2023

Pre-admission work experience can help boost entry wages of immigrants upon admission. Immigrants with work permits only (-7.6% to $50,000) and those with both work and study permits (-3.0% to $48,700) prior to admission had the highest entry median wages in 2023, though both were down from a year earlier.

For immigrants with both work and study permits prior to admission, 2023 marked their lowest median entry wage recorded since 2017 ($48,200).

In contrast, in 2023, immigrants with a study permit only prior to admission had a median entry wage of $20,100, up 11.0% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, those without pre-admission experience had an entry wage of $32,600 (+12.4%), while immigrants who had an asylum claim prior to admission had an entry wage of $34,700 (+7.4%). For these three categories, this was the highest median entry wage in a decade.

In 2023, none of the pre-admission experience groups saw their entry median wage decrease as much as what was observed for the overall immigrant population (-10.6%). Again, changes in the cohort of newcomers from 2021 to 2022 may also be a factor. The share of immigrants aged 15 years and older admitted with both a work and a study permit (the pre-admission experience category with one of the highest median entry wages), declined from 39% in 2021 to 22% in 2022. Most of this decline can be attributed to the decrease in CEC principal applicants with work and study pre-admission experience in Canada.

The median entry wage grew faster for immigrants in Quebec and New Brunswick than in other provinces during the decade from 2014 to 2023

The median entry wage of immigrants admitted one year earlier rose by 45.3% over the course of a decade, increasing from $27,400 in 2014 to $39,800 in 2023.

In 2014, immigrants in Quebec ($22,400) and New Brunswick ($23,700) had the lowest median entry wage among the provinces. A decade later, the entry wage of immigrants in these two provinces were among the highest in the country. For example, the entry wage of immigrants in Quebec rose 96.4% over a decade to $44,000 in 2023, while in New Brunswick, the entry wage of immigrants rose 70.5% to $40,400. As a result, in 2023, the median entry wage of immigrants in Quebec was the highest of all provinces, while New Brunswick came third after British Columbia ($43,100).

Immigrants in Alberta ($37,600), Saskatchewan ($37,000) and Newfoundland and Labrador ($36,900) had the highest median entry wage of all provinces in 2014. By 2023, however, the entry wage in Alberta had fallen by 6.4% to $35,200, while in Saskatchewan, the entry wage had decreased 9.2% to $33,600 and in Newfoundland and Labrador, it had fallen 1.6% to $36,300, placing all three provinces below the overall level for Canada ($39,800).

Immigrants in the territories saw their median entry wage increase from $43,100 in 2014 to $56,500 in 2023. Throughout this period, they consistently had a higher median entry wage than immigrants of all the provinces.

A second release, to be published on December 19, 2025, will examine the mobility of immigrants.

“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner.
There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.” Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment.
“I urge you … to act to defend the authority of the legislative branch.
Such action is necessary to ensure we can effectively represent our constituents and the people of Nebraska.”","LINCOLN — A Nebraska lawmaker two times was denied entry to the controversial state-run federal immigration detention facility that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink” — and now is calling on the Legislature’s Executive Committee to step in.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said Monday that she made the four-hour trip to McCook in mid-November to check out the conditions of the place where migrant detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held pending deportation.

She argues that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services violated state law by not allowing her into the converted Work Ethic Camp, and cites a state statute that says Nebraska legislators are entitled to visit any state correctional facility “at any time.”

When Gov. Jim Pillen and Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys announced the agreement with the federal government, Cavanaugh said, they stated that the department would manage the property and it would continue to be considered a state facility.

“The denial of physical entry to a sitting senator is not only unprecedented — it is the latest escalation in a broader pattern of obstruction that undermines the Legislature’s statutory and constitutional oversight obligations,” Cavanaugh said.

The Omaha senator said she routinely conducts unannounced visits to state-run 24-hour facilities “because direct oversight is not optional — it is a core responsibility of my job.”

She said she specifically wanted to visit the McCook ICE detention center, because it involved “people being held in Nebraska without criminal charges and, in many cases, without clear legal recourse.” The immigration court and deportation process is separate from state courts, and immigrants held by ICE often face civil versus criminal charges.

“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner. “There is no scrutiny. There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.”

Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment.

Cavanaugh documented her efforts to gain entry to the former WEC in a letter to State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, and Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee.

She also chronicled five prior legislative attempts to obtain information about the project, describing a pattern of “limited transparency and restricted information.”

Email between Cavanaugh and Jeffreys and a person she described as a warden at the McCook facility offers details of the rejected visits on Nov. 12-13.

According to the email exchange:

Cavanaugh arrived at the facility around 4:20 p.m. Nov. 12, and apparently spoke to Jeffreys via the warden’s cell phone around 4:30 p.m., who told her she had failed to provide notice of her visit.

Said Jeffreys: “You were instructed that no person could arrive unannounced and be given immediate entry to a Nebraska correctional facility or a federal detention center.”

Cavanaugh, in an email around 10 p.m. that night of Nov. 12, emailed the warden and Jeffreys that she would be returning to the facility the next morning.

“Though statute 83-186 (attached) does not require me to provide notice, I am giving you this notice per my conversation with Director Jeffreys on Warden Sommer’s cell phone at approximately 4:30 p.m. today, when Director Jeffreys informed me that I had failed to provide notice of my visit.”

Jeffreys later wrote to Cavanaugh to “clarify the legal position” of the department as to why she was not allowed to enter.

“It is the fundamental nature of corrections, safety protocols and operations, and consistent with Nebraska law, that unannounced visitors of any type cannot be accommodated.”

He said her communication alerting them that she’d be there again Nov. 13 was “short notice” and “again a problem.”

Of Cavanaugh’s legal justification for her visit, Jeffreys said in email that his team “worked to analyze your request, get legal advice and collaborate with our federal partners.”

“We have come to the determination that you will not be allowed to enter the WEC until you have complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protocols related to detention center visits and provided sufficient notice to allow for the safe conduct of a visit.”

He also said that statute 83-186 “does not displace protocols for the security and safety of corrections facilities.” He said his team read that statute “in harmony with the statutory scheme of which it is a part.”

Cavanaugh, in the letter to Hansen and Dorn, said she reviewed the state’s contract with ICE and believes it provides that any “provision of this agreement contrary to applicable statutes … is null and void and shall not necessarily affect the balance of the agreement.”

“This means that the right of access provided in 83-186 invalidates any interpretation that members of the Legislature may be prohibited from accessing the facility.”

Cavanaugh said the documented history demonstrates that legislative leaders “have repeatedly sought access to accurate, timely information” on the project and its implications.

She said the Executive Board oversees all legislative services and employees and hears matters of “general import to the Legislature and its operations as a whole.” She said Jeffreys actions were a “direct disregard” of the Legislature and its constitutional authority.

The year before, the church listed the names of the cities that have experienced mass shootings.

Isabella County - Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/pung-v-isabella-county/,"Furious, Pung refused to pay that portion of the property taxes, leaving an unpaid tax bill of approximately $2,200.
Pung filed suit, alleging violations of the Takings Clause and the Excessive Fines Clause.
Pung asked the Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Court agreed to do so.
Across the Atlantic, that same protection was written into the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was eventually adopted word-for-word as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.
And in every case to interpret the Excessive Fines Clause since Austin, the Court has expressly reaffirmed this holding.","When Scott Pung passed away in 2004, his property had a special tax exemption for principal residences. Years later, the local tax assessor determined that Scott’s surviving family members who occupied the home should have resubmitted paperwork for the exemption and thus retroactively denied it. Litigation before the Michigan Tax Tribunal proved the tax assessor wrong. But when Scott’s brother Michael Pung, the administrator of his estate, went to pay the family’s taxes in 2012, a town clerk informed him that once again the tax assessor had denied the tax exemption, notwithstanding the decision of the Tax Tribunal.

Furious, Pung refused to pay that portion of the property taxes, leaving an unpaid tax bill of approximately $2,200. That disputed bill was the only unpaid tax in the Pungs’ history. Nonetheless, the county initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property, eventually selling it at auction for $76,000 despite acknowledging its assessed fair market value was $194,400. The county kept the entire profit from the sale.

Pung filed suit, alleging violations of the Takings Clause and the Excessive Fines Clause. Reaching only the Takings Clause issue, the district court held that the county was required to reimburse the Pungs for the difference between the artificially depressed auction sale price and the unpaid tax debt.

On appeal to the Sixth Circuit, Pung asserted that he was due not just the surplus from the auction sale but the full assessed fair market value of his property (minus the tax debt), notwithstanding the fact that the property was sold at auction for much less than its full fair market value. The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument, holding that failure to pay the full fair market value was neither a taking nor a fine within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause. Pung asked the Supreme Court to hear his case, and the Court agreed to do so.

In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court in support of Pung. Our brief focuses on the Excessive Fines Clause, responding to the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that Michigan’s tax foreclosure scheme is categorically exempt from Eighth Amendment scrutiny simply because its main purpose is “to encourage the timely payment of property taxes.” Our brief makes three main points.

First, we explain that the historical roots of the Excessive Fines Clause show that it applies to financial penalties that are not just punitive, but also serve remedial purposes. The Excessive Fines Clause was taken nearly verbatim from the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which in turn codified Magna Carta’s guarantee that excessive financial payments—then known as “amercements”—would not be extracted. Amercements were neither civil nor criminal in nature. Though they were generally imposed to sanction wrongful (though not necessarily criminal) conduct, they also served remedial purposes—that is, they repaid the costs that the community or the Crown had incurred as a result of the wrongdoing.

During the seventeenth century, the modern-day fine replaced the amercement as the preferred financial sanction. In that same period, despite Magna Carta’s guarantees, the Stuart kings increasingly abused their power to extract financial payments, ultimately leading to the recodification of Magna Carta’s protections in the English Bill of Rights. Across the Atlantic, that same protection was written into the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was eventually adopted word-for-word as the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.

As our brief describes, colonial and early American records also make clear that the Founding generation did not draw sharp distinctions between remedial and punitive economic sanctions, and thus would not have viewed the Excessive Fines Clause as applying to only those payments that served exclusively punitive purposes. Indeed, in early America, a wealth of economic sanctions explicitly called “fines” were used for partially, or even primarily, remedial purposes. Further, early statutes expressly, and frequently, stated that fines collected as punishment would go toward these remedial purposes.

Second, our brief explains that under the Supreme Court’s precedents, a remedial sanction falls within the ambit of the Excessive Fines Clause so long as it also serves a partially punitive purpose. The Court made this explicit in Austin v. United States when it rejected the argument that an in rem forfeiture was beyond the scope of the Excessive Fines Clause because it also served remedial purposes and was imposed in a civil—not criminal—proceeding. And in every case to interpret the Excessive Fines Clause since Austin, the Court has expressly reaffirmed this holding. Indeed, just two years ago, two members of the Court underscored the point yet again in a case involving tax foreclosure, Tyler v. Hennepin County.

Finally, our brief argues that the court below erred by misapplying the test for what constitutes a fine under the Eighth Amendment. The court below misconstrued the Supreme Court’s precedents, leading it to conclude that Michigan’s tax foreclosure scheme is categorically exempt from scrutiny under the Excessive Fines Clause because it “does not necessarily punish property owners for failing to pay their property taxes” and because its chief “aim is to encourage the timely payment of property taxes.” Relying on an inapt Michigan Supreme Court decision, the court completely ignored the Supreme Court’s repeated admonition that economic sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose, and so they still constitute fines so long as they serve at least in part as punishment. That is true whether or not they are tied to criminal behavior, and whether or not their main purpose is to encourage the timely payment of property taxes rather than to punish the failure to do so.

To ensure that the Excessive Fines Clause can continue to play its important role in guarding against government abuse and overreach, our brief concludes by asking the Supreme Court to set the record straight about what constitutes a fine within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-12-08 11:57:53.148064

Dec. 10, 2025, is the annual celebration of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

This year’s theme is “Human Rights: Our Every Day Essentials.” It is intended to

be a reminder that our every day experiences depend greatly on the preservation of basic human rights—spending time with family, reading the news, walking freely, drinking clean water, or enjoying a meal … This year the theme also celebrates that the UN Declaration, ratified in Paris in 1948 by the General Assembly, was the first to codify these every day essentials as embedded in universal human rights. The vote in support of this Declaration included a “yes” from the United States.

Today, more than usual, we are experiencing deep challenges to these universal human rights and their “Every Day Essentials” here in Rochester, throughout the US and around the world.

Consequently, not only reminders, but opportunities for reflection and action are needed in our community. We can celebrate that many in our community are already responding to these challenges in diverse ways. More is needed.

A small planning committee for Human Rights Week surrounding Dec. 10 has been planned by an interfaith group emerging from the Greater Rochester Community of Churches, started as Voices of Faith on Immigration. We have been challenged to think more broadly, giving opportunity for reflection and action that includes not only the immigration crisis but extends well beyond it. We are a ‘sanctuary community”—yes, for immigrants and refugees, but also for ALL OF US. These universal human rights are being challenged for All OF US in our every day experiences.

The result of our own group reflections has been to plan a week of human rights opportunities for reflection offered by speakers from many faiths, recognizing actions of others in our community to date, and creating brainstorming opportunities for forward thinking actions to the human rights challenges we face. The calendar of events, some planned by us and some planned by others, in the spirit of universal human rights, is included as invitation to engage with us during this week of reflection and wider conversation about our community values; and, also, to challenge you personally to reflect on how you depend on these universal human rights for your “every day essentials”.

ICE has arrested nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, according to the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project. That’s more than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE agents. The figures don’t include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has also launched large immigration operations in cities.

News10NBC looked into the local numbers. In total, ICE arrested 56 people in Monroe County since Jan. 20. Four were convicted criminals, five had pending criminal charges, and 43 had no current criminal records (labeled: other immigrant violator). Out of those arrested, 26 were Ecuadorian, representing the largest share. All but five of those arrested were males. You can explore the data here.

News10NBC has covered several immigration investigations this year. That includes last September, when people gathered at a home in the Park Avenue neighborhood in support of roofers targeted by an ICE investigation. A man from Ecuador was arrested and, during the protest, someone slashed the tires of a government vehicle.

There was also a traffic stop on Lyell Avenue and Whitney Street in March, where video shows Rochester Police officers helping Border Patrol agents. RPD Chief David Smith said the officers in the video violated city policy by helping the agents to get people outside of the van and handcuff them. A month later, U.S. Border Czar Tom Homan visited Rochester to criticize the sanctuary city policy that limits the ways that RPD can cooperate with federal immigration agents.

Morning Reads

Roberts and Kagan prepare for another showdown on executive power (Joan Biskupic, CNN) — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan are expected to be on opposite sides in Trump v. Slaughter, as they have been in several cases on presidential power over the years, according to CNN. “Since his days as a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan administration, Roberts has argued for vast executive power, including the authority to fire individuals who lead administrative agencies. … Kagan, in contrast, believes the constitutional separation of powers allows Congress to establish and safeguard certain areas of administrative independence.”

After Supreme Court win, GOP rushes to draw more House maps (Patrick Marley, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — On Thursday, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Texas to use its new congressional map in the 2026 elections, “and Republicans across the country took the decision as a sign they could redraw more lines as they seek to retain a fragile majority in the U.S. House next year,” according to The Washington Post. “The next battleground is Indiana,” where the state House approved a new map on Friday, and Florida leaders have also expressed interest in redistricting, although “Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has said the state should wait” until the Supreme Court addresses the future of the Voting Rights Act in Louisiana v. Callais.

Democrats divided on redistricting in wake of Supreme Court’s Texas ruling (Caroline Vakil, The Hill) — As Republicans push forward with redistricting plans after the Supreme Court’s ruling on Texas’ map, Democrats continue to debate whether to pursue similar efforts in blue states, according to The Hill. “While Virginia Democrats are signaling they’ll move forward with redrawing their congressional lines, Democrats in other states have expressed opposition, posing a challenge for those in the party who want to net as many additional seats as possible before the midterms.”

Why Costco, other businesses are suing the Trump admin over tariffs (Rachel Barber, USA Today) — Businesses, like Costco, that have filed lawsuits seeking tariff refunds if the Supreme Court strikes down a large share of Trump’s signature tariffs are taking the risk of upsetting customers who support the president and complicating their relationship with the administration. “There’s so much uncertainty right now that the calculation becomes: Is filing a suit worth the incremental certainty that if this action is taken, we are in a better position?” said Drew DeLong, head of corporate statecraft at Kearney Foresight, to USA Today.

Actually, the Supreme Court Has a Plan (Sarah Isgur, The New York Times)(Paywall) — In a column for The New York Times, Advisory Opinions host and SCOTUSblog editor Sarah Isgur contended that, in Trump v. Slaughter, the court can work to “rebalance the separation of powers in the federal government” if it makes it clear that the president should have control over agencies housed within the executive branch while also reining in “Congress’s bad habit of delegating vast and vague powers to the executive branch.” “The Constitution vests ‘all legislative powers’ in Congress and ‘the executive power’ in the president,” she wrote. “The court is overdue to police those lines and keep the branches separated.”

A Closer Look: Humphrey’s Executor v. United States

A 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, is in the spotlight as the justices hear argument in Trump v. Slaughter this morning. Slaughter is specifically about the president’s authority to remove a member of the Federal Trade Commission without cause and more broadly about whether Congress can place limits on the president’s authority to fire the heads of independent, multi-member federal agencies. In considering this case, the court is faced with whether to overrule Humphrey’s Executor and thereby increase the power of the executive branch.

Humphrey’s Executor arose out of a dispute between President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and William Humphrey, an FTC commissioner who had been appointed by Roosevelt’s predecessor, President Herbert Hoover, to a seven-year term in 1931. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, he twice asked Humphrey to resign. Humphrey refused, and so, a few months later, Roosevelt removed him from office. Humphrey died just over four months after that as he was fighting his removal, and the executor of his estate kept the battle going by asking the Court of Claims for “Humphrey’s salary from the date of his removal until the date of his death,” as Justice Clarence Thomas explained in a 2020 opinion.

The executor’s effort to recover backpay made it to the Supreme Court in 1935, which considered whether the Federal Trade Commission Act’s removal restrictions – it states that commissioners can only be removed “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” – unlawfully limit the president’s executive power.

The court unanimously held that those removal restrictions “are definite and unambiguous” and that it was, therefore, unlawful for Roosevelt to remove Humphrey from office for reasons other than those listed. The court further held that Congress could limit the president’s authority in this context, because the Federal Trade Commission’s “duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.”

With that memorable description, the court worked to explain why it had diverged from its decision in a 1926 case called Myers v. United States, which said the president could fire a postmaster without getting approval from the Senate, despite a federal law imposing that requirement. The justices drew a distinction between a president’s relationship to the FTC and a president’s relationship to a postmaster, determining that “[a] postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions,” whereas the FTC is more like a judicial or legislative body.

In Slaughter, the Trump administration contends that the FTC has changed significantly over the past 90 years and now exercises much more executive power than “Humphrey’s Executor attributed to the 1935 FTC.” But the administration also argues that Humphrey’s Executor should be overturned altogether, because it places impermissible limits on presidential authority.

We shall see if a majority of the justices agree.

Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Trump’s Challenge to Birthright Citizenship

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments early next year in the challenge to President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship – the guarantee of citizenship to almost everyone born in the United States. The announcement came in a brief list of orders from the justices’ private conference on Friday morning. Read Amy’s analysis to understand what’s at stake in the case.

The court also took up three other cases on Friday. Amy highlighted those disputes in a separate post.

Trump Administration Asks Court to Settle Dispute Over Immigration Judges

For the 32nd time since late January, the Trump administration on Friday came to the Supreme Court seeking emergency relief. In a 26-page filing, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to block a ruling by a federal appeals court that sent a dispute over a policy governing speaking engagements by immigration judges back to a federal trial court. Federal law, Sauer argued, makes clear that the trial court lacks the power to consider the group’s claim, because judges are required to challenge the policy through an administrative process. For more on the case, read Amy’s analysis.

Amy Howe on Hamm v. Smith

In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled in Atkins v. Virginia that the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment bars the execution of people who are intellectually disabled. On Wednesday, Dec. 10, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Hamm v. Smith on how and whether courts should assess a defendant’s claim under Atkins when he has taken multiple IQ tests. In her case preview, Amy explored the background of the dispute and the key arguments raised by each side.

Ronald Mann on FS Credit Opportunities Corporation v. Saba Capital Master Fund

The justices will be treading on familiar ground during argument in FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund, to take place on Wednesday, Dec. 10. Like many cases the court has heard in the last decade, this one asks the justices to consider whether the federal courts should recognize a federal statute as implying a private right of action (that is, providing the ability for private parties to sue) when the words of the statute do not explicitly authorize it. Ronald Mann previewed the case for SCOTUSblog.

But together, everyday people—the demos—can reset norms, rebuild institutions, shift power, and make good on the nation’s potential.","This article concludes NPQ’s series Toward a Third Reconstruction, co-produced with Dēmos. Authors in this series articulate why we need bold, courageous action to bring a Third Reconstruction within reach—and offer strategies for systemic change that can help us get there.

As the nation’s young, limited, and fragile multiracial democracy is tested, fraying under authoritarian executive actions of the Trump administration, the urgency of now makes it difficult to think expansively about the future.

As serial emergencies threaten to keep Black people and people of color perpetually off-balance—be it ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) terrorizing our communities, extrajudicial “disappearings,” de facto martial law, criminalization of racial equity, and more—history offers grounding by contextualizing the current emergencies. These are all part of a cycle of oppression, progress, and backlash that is the story of the United States.

The constructs of race, racism, and othering—catalyzed by White supremacist ideology, xenophobia, and colonialism—do not just keep us from an expansive vision of liberation. They fuel a perpetual cycle of redefining who the United States is for. Each time progress is made toward an inclusive, just society with a promise of liberty and justice for all, there follows a new season of retraction.

The First Reconstruction was a post–Civil War attempt to rebuild the nation, reclaim and more fully realize the ideals of freedom and liberty enshrined by the Constitution, and provide formal citizenship to Black Americans. But as we know, this inclusion was never fully realized and was largely reversed by Jim Crow in the South and racial discrimination in the North.

During Jim Crow, Black people and their allies fought for civil and human rights. Today…we can do no less than our forbearers.

The Second Reconstruction, also known as the modern Civil Rights movement, was a grassroots response to the authoritarian, oppressive governmental rule of Jim Crow. This movement built a new national consensus around racial justice and economic opportunity, made way for new civil rights laws, and created new tools (such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965) to make that vision a reality.

Since the close of the Civil Rights era 60 years ago, additional progress has been made. More prominent from our current vantage, however, is a protracted backlash that has rolled back those gains.

To escape this cycle, activists must both dream and plan. This is a tall order for those of us whose day-to-day lives take place in an increasingly oppressive and hostile world. In this time of pain, it may even seem impossible. But we do, in fact, possess many tools for liberation.

Those who fought before us beckon us to follow in their footsteps. Indeed, amid the most challenging context of slavery, enslaved people and their allies worked for abolition. During Jim Crow, Black people and their allies fought for civil and human rights. Today, as we face the latest antidemocratic, authoritarian regime, we can do no less than our forbearers. We must embrace and advance bold ideas like an expansive, inclusive participatory democracy.

Below, I lay out a Reconstructionist path forward. Advocates must begin by dreaming, by envisioning what radical citizenship could be. This goes beyond what seems possible at a time when we are struggling to simply defend what we thought we had achieved.

Dreaming

In Imagination: A Manifesto, Ruha Benjamin wrote that “radical imagination…isn’t counter to doing the work of changing our material conditions and improving our quality of life. Rather, radical imagination can inspire us to push beyond the constraints of what we think, and are told, is politically possible.”

This underscores that emancipation will only result from creativity—thinking beyond the range of ideas and approaches that we are explicitly and implicitly told are possible choices. We must shake off the constructs that have constrained us and replace them with something bigger, brighter. Something joyous.

Why can’t we believe bigger? Looking back, those who have been marginalized have forged paths of big dreams. Black, Latine, other people of color; young people; people with disabilities; LGBTQ+ people who came before us, all created joyous liberatory movements that insisted on inclusion and, more importantly, liberation.

Their movements challenged those who write the rules, demanding release from their oppressive systems. Today, these groups are growing. To escape minority rule in our country, we must think above and beyond the status quo. We must imagine a truly liberatory society that centers racial justice, one that can stop the cycle of retrenchment in its tracks.

We dream of achieving a world free from want not by way of benevolence by the powerful, but through a shifting of power.

It’s time to imagine a Third Reconstruction that continues the unfinished work of the Reconstructions that came before it, reclaiming and evolving a consensus around racial justice that goes beyond a circumscribed conception of political and civil rights. In this new consensus, all people will be granted radical citizenship.

In his contribution to this series, Peniel Joseph took us back to Dr. King’s “Beloved Community,” a vision of a society that has the things they need to live—affordable housing, freedom from hunger, basic healthcare, income, and safety. But the beloved community can also count on having less tangible, but not less important, things: dignity, agency, compassion, and the spiritual liberation that comes when a chronic fear of wanting for basic needs is eliminated.

The first necessary step toward a Third Reconstruction is ensuring each member of society freedom from want.

We dream of achieving a world free from want not by way of benevolence by the powerful, but through a shifting of power. Where everyday people hold and exercise power to say what their wants are and then to satisfy them.

We dream of a world where the government protects the public good and, even more, supports flourishing communities. We dream of a world where corporations hold less power, where the interests of the wealthy and corporate interests are not permitted to constrain the self-determination of everyday people, where they are not allowed to extract and must instead invest.

We dream of a world where private philanthropy is no longer necessary, because public goods are so expansive that the needs of people, the needs for material and spiritual sustenance, for food and shelter and for joy and frolicking, are met.

As King noted, “Power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose.” Radical citizenship and radical power mean that everyone thrives, not merely survives, that everyone lives in their purpose, and that self-determination is fully realized for everyone.

Allowing ourselves to dream despite the pain is our first step. But how do we live into the dream? This is where planning comes in. Institutions must foster and bolster that dream. They must transform.

There can be no inclusive multiracial democracy without a commitment to rewrite our society’s racist rules.

Transforming Social Norms for Inclusion

Transforming social norms is the most important and most difficult task required to bring about a lasting Reconstruction. Norms undergird policies, institutions, and daily practices. Yet, as evident during this period of retrenchment, they are also oddly ephemeral.

The nation is undergoing a seismic shift in understanding what behavior is appropriate for leaders, government, and individuals in society. This shift is terrifying, but it is also an opportunity. In moments of upheaval and discontent, there is space for new narratives to settle in as truths, and for those truths to take hold as new norms. We must shape our truth definitively and speak it loudly and repeatedly for it to take root in the cracks that have and will continue to emerge.

What is that truth? That truth is unapologetically centered around the imperative for racial justice. In this moment of intensified White supremacy, some shy away from explicit discussion of race and racial justice. But there can be no inclusive multiracial democracy without a commitment to rewrite our society’s racist rules.

This means sharply rejecting White supremacy and the anti-Blackness that animates it. Unless and until we have truly embraced a more expansive vision of who the United States is for, White supremacy’s reign will continue.

Since the nation’s founding, White supremacy has effectively divided people—extracting resources from them while preventing an expectation of shared prosperity from taking root. But escaping the trap of White supremacy lays the foundation for other norm shifts. On this foundation, a culture of collective responsibility that makes the beloved community a reality can be built.

A Third Reconstruction must introduce a social contract that says that all people have—by right of their innate humanity, not false constructs of deservingness—freedom from deprivation and the ability to experience dignity, peace, and joy.

Transforming Institutions

The nation’s institutions—and its bodies of government, learning, and commerce—are entangled in systemic racism, neoliberal ideologies, and other myths. To liberate ourselves, a Third Reconstruction must transform institutions and free them from these constraining frames.

Time and again, the US government has enacted policies that systematically exclude Black people and people of color from even limited democratic rights. The change needed in government institutions requires restructuring so that everyday people—their needs, their priorities, and their wants—are shaping policy decisions. That means getting money out of politics, co-governance strategies, expansive voting rights, and ultimately a more representative and accountable government.

Corporations hold outsized power in US society. A Third Reconstruction must transform the relationship between corporations and government so that those institutions serve citizens and consumers, not the other way around. Unless and until the nation changes who is valued in this economy, inequity will persist.

Building Power for the Demos

We will not realize a multiracial democracy if we do not shift the nexus of power, using what King called “the strength required to bring about social, political, and economic change.”

To generate this strength we must build new forms of economic, political, and grassroots power. These three constituent forms of power reinforce one another. Economic power allows the people—the demos—to meet their basic material needs and fully participate in the political process. Political power means that government institutions are responsive to and representative of the needs of the people and thus ensure people’s economic needs are met. And grassroots power is the saving grace, the check, the balance, when these other forms of power break.

In a 2021 paper entitled “Introducing radical democratic citizenship: from practice to theory,” Zaunseder, Woodman, and Emejulu called for power that is organic, that is reactionary, that is insurrectionary, that we see in the streets and in the press and on the ballot, that is signed in ink on petitions demanding what is needed. This grassroots power holds all other power accountable.

We must understand the past to build a durable Reconstruction. The Third Reconstruction must go far beyond narrow policy prescriptions to pursue an inclusive vision that confers, by right, a set of material and moral benefits to everyone.

For the last 25 years, my organization has held a vision of a just, inclusive multiracial economy and democracy as our North Star. To achieve that vision, movements must dream boldly, plan wisely, and manifest a Third Reconstruction.

To be sure, the United States has long fallen short of its promise. But together, everyday people—the demos—can reset norms, rebuild institutions, shift power, and make good on the nation’s potential.",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Paving_the_Road.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 11:57:33.502484

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup.
They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.
The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.
Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction.","State and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism and protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New Orleans, monitoring message boards around the clock for threats to agents while compiling regular updates on public “sentiment” surrounding the arrests, according to law enforcement records reviewed by the Associated Press.

The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.

“Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” said a briefing circulated early on Sunday to law enforcement officials. Earlier bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants”.

Immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens”. But the law enforcement records detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation.

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup. They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.

“It confirms what we already knew – this was not about public safety, it’s about stoking chaos and fear and terrorizing communities,” said the Louisiana state senator Royce Duplessis, a Democrat who represents New Orleans. “It’s furthering a sick narrative of stereotypes that immigrants are violent.”

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to questions about the intelligence gathering and referred the AP to a prior news release touting “dozens of arrests”. The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.

The DHS has publicly detailed only six arrests stemming from the operation – all people with criminal histories – including a man they vaguely said was convicted of “homicide” and another convicted of sexual assault. The agency, which has several hundred agents on the ground in south-east Louisiana, has said it aims to make at least 5,000 arrests in the region over an operation expected to last up to two months.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families or their neighbors,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.

DHS and Republican leaders have framed the crackdown as targeting the most violent offenders. But the records reviewed by the AP identify only nine of the 38 people arrested in the first days as having criminal histories that rose beyond traffic violations – information the intelligence bulletins warn “should not be distributed to the media”.

The New Orleans city council president, JP Morrell, said the stated goals of the operation to arrest violent offenders did not align with the reality of what is taking place.

“There’s literally no information being given to the city of New Orleans whatsoever,” Morrell said. “If the goal was for them to come here and augment existing law enforcement, to pursue violent criminals or people with extensive criminal histories, why wouldn’t you be more transparent about who you’ve arrested and why?”

Morrell and other officials have said the crackdown appears to be a dragnet focused on people with brown skin, citing viral videos of encounters such as masked agents chasing a 22-year-old US citizen returning home from the grocery store.

Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction. “For some supporters, the videos with sounds of children crying in the background as their parents are placed under arrest, is weighing heavy on their hearts,” one briefing stated.

The records also shed new light on cooperation among state and federal authorities in an operation welcomed by Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Both the FBI and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have stationed agents at the Louisiana State Analytical and Fusion Exchange, an intelligence and data sharing center that is closely following discussions on the online forum Reddit that local residents have used to exchange information about the immigration raids.

One briefing noted that some “have gone so far as to accuse agents of racially profiling Hispanic areas specifically”. Another flagged social media posts suggesting agents “are not keeping with the mission of targeting criminal immigrants only”. And a third pointed out that critics of the raids “bring up past hurricanes and the work done by immigrants” in their aftermath.

“The chatter is slower during the night, mainly just commenting on posts from earlier in the day,” one of the briefings states. “Once daylight arrives and agencies are back out, the chatter and new posts will pick back up.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8bb4bbac12785d74bcac754e57899fce2427de9/642_0_6422_5138/master/6422.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=379a43734a682d8c18906ee715d79a9e",N,,2025-12-08 11:57:42.310628

“The Augsburg University community was deeply shaken by an incident that took place on campus on December 6.
Without producing a warrant, an armed, masked group of ICE agents targeted an undergraduate student and confronted members of our community directly outside a residence hall.","Augsburg University students said they’re worried about their safety after the university confirmed armed ICE agents were standing outside a residence hall over the weekend.

The university confirms the men were federal immigration agents who detained a student on campus.

A student shared the video with 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS. It shows a man holding a rifle near a residence hall entrance. About a minute later in the video, a second armed man walks through the same parking lot. The footage ends with at least two unmarked SUVs driving away.

In an email to students and staff, the university’s provost said the incident happened around 3 p.m. Saturday in Parking Lot B.

According to Augsburg, ICE agents in an unmarked car tried to detain a student who officials believe was followed and targeted before arriving on campus.

The provost said campus public safety responded, and when an on-call administrator arrived, the agents told them they did not have a judicial warrant. The student was ultimately taken off campus.

A university spokesperson declined an on-camera interview, but said in a statement the agents’ tactics were “unacceptable, dangerous and profoundly disturbing.”

“I’m worried, don’t know if I feel safe here,” Adam Maxmed, a student, said. “I feel like my friends and everyone I know might be taken away one day, and I won’t really know where they went.”

Several students told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS they’re unsure what this means for their safety moving forward.

“It’s unlawful. If they have a warrant, there’s nothing we can do about it, but if they can bust in, just take whoever they want without a signed warrant signed by a judge, that’s worrisome,” Maxmed said.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more information on why the student was detained, and is still waiting for a response.

Augsburg University’s statement is below.

“The Augsburg University community was deeply shaken by an incident that took place on campus on December 6. Without producing a warrant, an armed, masked group of ICE agents targeted an undergraduate student and confronted members of our community directly outside a residence hall. They aimed weapons at witnesses that included staff and students while many more students watched from their windows. These tactics, with the implicit threat of violence, are unacceptable, dangerous, and profoundly disturbing.

“As an urban university, Augsburg has long-standing, professional relationships with local law enforcement, and we are accustomed to partnering closely on public safety issues. What happened on December 6 was far outside the scope of our normal experience. Our focus in the wake of this traumatic incident is on the safety and well-being of our campus community. Now more than ever, our mission of education is critical to the healthy functioning of a free, democratic society.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/STR_ICE_AUGBSBURG_BRLL_mov_00.00.05.50.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 09:56:28.126730

Burnsville Police do not engage in federal immigration enforcement and are typically not notified of federal operations.","BURNSVILLE, Minnesota — On Saturday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided a home in Burnsville and detained four people, according to family members at the house.

Ring camera footage shows more than a dozen agents at the front door of the home on McAndrews Road.

""They just kept banging on the door until they broke it down,"" said Sofia Alvarado, through a translator. Alvarado's husband owns the home and they rent the lower level.

Damage could be seen not only on the front door but also on multiple doors throughout the home on both levels.

Alvarado heard banging and she, along with three other family members on the upper floor, hid in the bathroom, not knowing who was at the door.

Angel Alvarado, Sofia's brother, said ICE agents took his sister, mom, daughter and niece into the kitchen and made them hand over their phones.

""They all were scared, crying... they were pointing with the guns not to move,"" Angel said.

He said all four are U.S. citizens and were able to show their paperwork to ICE eventually.

Sofia said it all started when the couple renting on the lower level was headed home from the grocery store. According to Sofia, the couple was followed home by ICE agents.

Ring camera footage shows ICE agents detaining the man while the woman runs away. Family said she ran into the house and hid with her 7-year-old boy.

Angel showed the bedroom door with a hole through the middle of it. Both Angel and Sofia said ICE agents detained both of the 7-year-olds' parents and that his father has a work permit.

Angel said ICE also detained another man downstairs and a fourth man, a father to two kids with a third child on the way.

His wife, who asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons, is six months pregnant.

""She said as soon as her husband walked out of the room, she didn't see him again,"" a translator told KARE 11.

She hid with her 7-year-old daughter and 1-and-a-half-year-old boy.

""When she went out, they were pointing their guns at her,"" a translator said.

She said the family is here illegally from Honduras for work and that ICE told her to voluntarily self-deport.

A translator said, ""She said that if you can have someone help her... have her husband come back home because in the state that she is in with two kids and one more on the way, she thinks it's going to be very hard for her.""

She is also now taking care of the 7-year-old boy while they wait to find out what will happen to his parents.

The families at the house claimed ICE entered the home without showing a warrant. KARE 11 has not been able to independently confirm that, but we have reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and are waiting to hear back.

The United States remains one of about thirty countries, mostly in the Americas, that grant automatic citizenship by birth.
Two landmark Supreme Court cases, United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution.

A study by the Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University’s Population Research Institute found that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the unauthorized population by 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.","The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could determine whether the United States will continue to recognize birthright citizenship, a constitutional protection that has stood for more than 150 years. The justices announced Friday that they will decide whether President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end automatic citizenship for certain children born in the country is constitutional. The directive, called Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship, was issued on Trump’s first day of his second term and has been blocked by multiple federal courts.

Under the order, which has not taken effect due to litigation, people born in the United States would not automatically receive citizenship if their parents were in the country temporarily or without legal authorization. The administration argues that the 14th Amendment was intended to apply only to freed slaves and their children, not to undocumented immigrants or people visiting the country. The case poses sweeping implications for Trump’s broader immigration agenda and for the longstanding understanding of what it means to be an American citizen.

The 14th Amendment, enacted in 1868, states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” For nearly 160 years, this clause has been interpreted to guarantee citizenship to nearly all people born on US soil, with exceptions for children of diplomats and foreign military personnel. The United States remains one of about thirty countries, mostly in the Americas, that grant automatic citizenship by birth.

Two landmark Supreme Court cases, United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution. These rulings form the core precedent that federal courts have repeatedly cited while blocking Trump’s attempt to reinterpret the amendment. According to the 9th Circuit, which unanimously ruled the order unconstitutional in July, the directive “violated the plain language of the 14th Amendment.” In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have struck down the order.

Despite this broad judicial rejection, the Supreme Court’s right wing majority ruled in June that “universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.” While that decision did not address birthright citizenship directly, it limited the tools available to lower courts and helped pave the way for this case to reach the justices. The Supreme Court has not yet set a date for oral arguments, but a ruling is expected months from now.

Civil rights groups say the legal question is already settled. “No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” said Cecillia Wang, national legal director at the ACLU, which is leading a nationwide class action challenge to Trump’s order. She added, “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,” and said, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

Other advocates expressed alarm that the Court agreed to hear the case at all. Brett Edkins, managing director of policy and political affairs at Stand Up America, said, “This case is a right-wing fantasy, full stop. That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair.” He added, “Even if the court ultimately rules against Trump, in a laughable display of its supposed independence, the fact that fringe attacks on our most basic rights as citizens are being seriously considered is outrageous and alarming.”

Legal groups emphasized the longevity and clarity of existing constitutional protections. Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, said “it’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” noting that “every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional.” Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund, said, “The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution.” She added, “We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century. Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”

The administration’s argument rests on a narrower reading of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer claims that the amendment was adopted “to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” Sauer argued it is a “mistaken view” that birth on US soil confers citizenship and claimed this interpretation has had “destructive consequences.”

The potential consequences of ending birthright citizenship are substantial. According to data cited in the source material, about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the US in 2016, a 36 percent decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorized immigrant parents. A study by the Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University’s Population Research Institute found that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the unauthorized population by 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075. Such an outcome would create more people without legal status, including those born and raised in the United States, intensifying the very conditions the administration claims to be addressing.

The legal stakes, political consequences, and human impact of this challenge to the 14th Amendment are enormous. The Court’s decision to hear the case signals a willingness to reconsider constitutional guarantees that have guided the country for more than a century and a half. The ruling will determine not only the fate of Trump’s executive order but also the stability of citizenship for millions of Americans, and the durability of one of the Constitution’s most far reaching promises.",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/26182333/faviconmaster.png,N,,2025-12-08 10:58:55.741588

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

Thailand’s military said today that it launched airstrikes along the disputed border with Cambodia in response to Cambodia’s attack yesterday on Thai soldiers. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he would “use necessary means to preserve [Thailand’s] sovereignty.” A spokesperson for Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defence said today that Thailand struck first, claiming they attacked Cambodian troops yesterday afternoon and again this morning. The Thai army said that more than 50,000 people have left areas near the border, while Cambodian Information Minister Neth Pheaktra said that Thai forces killed four Cambodian civilians, adding that tens of thousands of residents had been displaced from several border villages. Jintamas Saksornchai and Sopheng Cheang report for AP News; BBC News reports.

The United Nations today announced that it will halve the amount of money it requests from donor countries in 2026 to help people affected by war and natural disasters. “It’s the cuts [to aid budgets] ultimately that are forcing us into these tough, tough, brutal choices that we’re having to make,” U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher told reporters. “We are overstretched, underfunded, and under attack.” Emma Farge and Olivia Le Poidevin report for Reuters; Nick Cumming-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

Beijing’s Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong summoned journalists from foreign media organizations on Saturday to warn them about coverage of the city’s recent Wang Fuk Court fire, according to the New York Times. The officials told journalists that they would face consequences if they were deemed to have violated the national security law, with one saying: “Do not say you have not been warned.” In recent days, the office issued statements warning “anti-China forces” not to exploit the Wang Fuk Court fire to undermine social stability. The New York Times reports.

Nigeria’s government has secured the release of around 100 schoolchildren who were abducted last month in Niger State, a local broadcaster reported yesterday, and Niger State’s police chief confirmed today. Madina Maishanu and Basillioh Rukanga report for BBC News.

The Africa Corps, a new Russian military unit that has replaced the Wagner mercenary group in Mali, is carrying out abuses, including rapes and beheadings, alongside Mali’s military, dozens of civilians told AP News. Monika Pronczuk and Caitlin Kelly report.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

International Criminal Court arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russians accused of war crimes in Ukraine will stay in place even if a blanket amnesty is approved in the U.S.-led peace talks, ICC prosecutors said on Friday. The prosecutors said that a U.N. Security Council resolution would be required to suspend the court-issued warrants, adding “apart from the bracket we mentioned in respect of the Security Council route, we are obligated to observe our statute, which does not give weight to some of those political arrangements.” Anthony Deutsch reports for Reuters.

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner held productive talks with Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov and Ukrainian Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces Andriy Hnatov on Friday, according to U.S. officials. A White House Official said that “progress was made,” but did not provide any further details. The participants are said to have discussed the developments arising from Witkoff’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier last week. Steve Holland, Humeyra Pamuk, and Andrea Shalal report for Reuters.

Russia unleashed more than 650 drones and 51 missiles on towns and cities across Ukraine in an overnight assault on Friday, according to Ukrainian officials. On Saturday evening, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he had “just had a long and substantive phone call” with Witkoff and Kushner, during which they “agreed on the next steps and formats for talks with the United States.” One source told Axios that the territory discussion was difficult, with another source adding that the United States is trying to develop new ideas to bridge the issue. Cassandra Vinograd, Oleksandr Chubko, and Maria Varenikova report for the New York Times; Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

“We are starting a new diplomatic week right now – there will be consultations with European leaders,” Zelenskyy said yesterday in a video address. He is set to meet with British, French and German leaders in London today. Olena Harmash reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Gen. Eyal Zamir, told his troops yesterday in Gaza that “the Yellow Line is a new border line – serving as a forward defensive for our communities and a line of operational activity.” Zamir’s comments come amid uncertainty over how the next phase of the peace plan, requiring Hamas to disarm and Israel to withdraw further from Gaza, will be implemented. James Shotter reports for the Financial Times.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that the second phase of the U.S. plan to end the war in Gaza was close, but still hinged on unresolved issues such as whether a multinational security force would enter Gaza. Netanyahu said that he is set to hold talks with Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the second phase is achieved. Alexander Cornwell reports for Reuters.

“We can talk about freezing or storing or laying down [weapons], with the Palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AP News yesterday. Naim suggested a long-term truce of five or ten years for discussions aimed at the establishment of a Palestinian state to take place, adding that Hamas is “very open minded” about what to do with its weapons. Josef Federman and Samy Magdy report.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Israeli soldiers yesterday shot at three Palestinians who were throwing rocks at cars in the occupied West Bank and killed one of them, the Israeli military said, adding that one other person was “neutralized” and one was arrested. The Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed that one person had been killed and one wounded in the incident. On Saturday, Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian teenager who, the Israeli army says, was driving a car towards them and a bystander at a checkpoint in Hebron. Ali Sawafta and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

A drone attack, allegedly by the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, hit a kindergarten in Sudan’s South Kordofan region, killing 50 people, including 33 children, Sudan’s Doctors’ Network said on Friday. The death toll is expected to be higher, but communication blackouts in the area have made it difficult to report. AP News reports.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

Top Democrats yesterday called for the release of a classified video of the U.S. military’s Sept. 2 strikes on an alleged drug vessel, in which two survivors of an initial strike were killed by a follow-up strike. “It seems pretty clear they don’t want to release this video because they don’t want people to see it, because it’s very, very difficult to justify,” Democratic leader of the House Armed Services Committee Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA) said yesterday. Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO’s conventional defense capabilities by 2027, Pentagon officials told European diplomats in Washington last week, according to five sources. Pentagon officials indicated that Washington was not satisfied with the steps Europe has taken to boost its defense capabilities, adding that if Europe does not meet the 2027 deadline, the United States may stop participating in some NATO defense coordination mechanisms. Gram Slattery and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

The United States, Israel, and Qatar yesterday held a trilateral meeting in New York to rebuild relations after the Israeli strike in Doha, two sources told Axios. Barak Ravid reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

New Orleans City Council leaders on Friday pushed back against the Homeland Security Department’s “Operation Catahoula Crunch,” calling for DHS to release arrest data, for federal agents to remove their masks and for the department to offer clear due process protections. Mayor-elect Helena Moreno issued five demands, which she says were sent directly to Border Patrol agent Gregory Bovino, who is leading the New Orleans-area operation. Chelsea Brasted reports for Axios.

While immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps in New Orleans are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens,” law enforcement records shared with AP News detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation. The records also show that state and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism of the immigration crackdown, monitoring message boards for threats to agents and compiling data on public sentiment surrounding the arrests. Jim Mustian and Jack Brook report.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to return Faustino Pablo Pablo, a man it deported to Guatemala in violation of an immigration court’s finding that he was likely to face torture there. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday deported around 50 Iranian citizens on a chartered plane, making stops in Egypt and then Kuwait, where the Iranians would transfer onto a different flight to Tehran, according to two Iranian officials. A U.S. official confirmed the flight had taken off yesterday and described it as a routine deportation flight that included nationals from other countries, not just Iran. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A bicameral version of the National Defense Authorization Act, set for a vote as soon as this week, would authorize around $8 billion more for the military than the Trump administration had requested. The legislation would also place new restrictions on reducing troop levels in Europe, standing in contrast to Trump’s new national security strategy published last week. The legislation Connor O’Brien reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the Justice Department from using key evidence in its efforts to seek another indictment against former FBI Director James B. Comey, following an emergency filing on Friday night by Daniel C. Richman arguing that the DOJ had obtained his files in violation of his constitutional rights and should not be allowed to use them in any attempt to re-indict Comey. Alan Feuer reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday granted the DOJ’s request to publicly release grand jury records related to the criminal prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The judge said that the new law requiring the department to disclose nearly all investigative records into Epstein held by the DOJ surpasses the standard regulations prohibiting the public release of grand jury material. Erica Orden reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday rebuked Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) for his “lack of loyalty” as Cuellar announced that he will be running for Congress again as a Democrat just days after Trump pardoned him. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

Trump said on Friday that winning the first-ever FIFA Peace Prize was “truly one of the greatest honors” of his life. “The fact that we could do that, in India, Pakistan, so many different wars that we were able to end, in some cases, a little bit before they started, just right before they started … but we got them done,” Trump said at Washington D.C.’s Kennedy Center. Josephine Walker reports for Axios.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court said on Friday that it will hear arguments on the Trump administration’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship. Justin Jouvenal reports for the Washington Post.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration exceeded its authority in holding migrants designated for deportation at the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The judge rejected the administration’s request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. The judge also denied class certification of the case with respect to the named Plaintiffs’ habeas corpus claim, while certifying a class of “all immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States who have been ordered removed…and who are, or will be, held at the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.” Carol Rosenberg reports for the New York Times.

Advocates summarized in their letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations. The letter comes just weeks after Rep. Veronica Escobar warned that people detained at Ft. Bliss were given foul-tasting drinking water, rotten food, and inadequate healthcare.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Ft. Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility. Numerous detained people told lawyers that officers have engaged in a widespread and unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force.

One detained teenager using the pseudonym “Samuel” told lawyers he was beaten by officers so severely he sustained injuries across his body, lost consciousness, and had to be taken to a hospital in an ambulance. The letter relays Samuel’s account that his right front tooth broke from the force of being slammed to the ground, and as Samuel attests, one officer “grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” Samuel went on to say that while he was feeling “dizzy” and was “fighting to remain conscious,” an officer laughed at Samuel for having a chipped tooth after being slammed to the ground and told Samuel he was “like a little girl.” Samuel said that weeks after the beating, damage to his left ear is so severe that he now has trouble hearing.

In their letter, the groups also reiterate their calls to immediately halt deportations of people to third countries to which they have no genuine ties. Interviewees said that at Ft. Bliss, the prospect of such removals has taken on a particularly abusive character. People detained attested that officers at Ft. Bliss have beaten detained people and used the threat of violence, criminal charges, and imprisonment in attempts to coerce non-Mexican immigrants held at Ft. Bliss to cross the border into the Mexican desert.

Isaac, a Cuban immigrant held at Ft. Bliss, attested in a sworn declaration that officers told him that he was going to be deported to Mexico. Isaac told lawyers that, “the guards hit my head” and “slammed it against the wall approximately ten times.” He also said that officers grabbed and crushed his testicles between their fingers, and that soon after, officers handcuffed Isaac and approximately 20 other people, placed them on a bus, and drove them to the border, where they were informed they could get off the bus and cross into Mexico. Isaac added that officers told them “If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa.” Isaac is also using a pseudonym to protect his identity.

The letter – which was signed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Mexico, ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, and Texas Civil Rights Project – also follows widespread media coverage detailing abusive conditions. In September 2025, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Ft. Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

The Trump administration hastily opened the sprawling tent camp in August 2025, despite warnings from members of Congress and advocates that the facility would be a humanitarian disaster. The facility is located on the military base formerly used to intern people of Japanese descent during World War II and currently holds over 2,700 people, making it the country’s largest immigration detention center.

Gray’s Landing resident and plaintiff Mindy King said that since June, chemical agents have drifted into her complex multiple times.
Dooly also said a number of tenants who live on the side of the building facing the ICE facility have received doctor’s notes to move to a unit further from the facility.
He continued, ""There is precedent in other cases where courts have imposed these kinds of injunctions, like, specifically against the use of tear gas.
“The truth is, residents of all types and community members of all types are being impacted by the tear gas and the use of it through ICE,” King said.","The owners and some residents of an apartment complex next to the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility filed a lawsuit against the federal government.

The landlords of the building, Gray's Landing, along with seven of its residents, filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking to stop the use of chemical munitions by federal agents near the building.

The nonprofit REACH Community Development owns Gray’s Landing, which houses over 200 low-income seniors, veterans, families, and people with disabilities.

Dan Jacobson, the attorney representing the residents and nonprofit, told KATU News that the lawsuit focuses specifically on federal agents’ use of tear gas, smoke grenades, and other chemical munitions during the ongoing protests outside of the ICE facility, and their impact on residents.

'Unstoppable coughing'

The apartment complex's residents said federal officers have repeatedly used chemical agents over the past six months, with the chemicals often seeping into their homes.

Gray’s Landing resident and plaintiff Mindy King said that since June, chemical agents have drifted into her complex multiple times.

“There was the time where it actually got into the buildings of the entire, this entire Gray’s Landing apartment building and the Matisse,” King said. “I know floors two through six, end to end, were full of tear gas, which meant it did creep into every residents’ home that didn’t have their door sealed.”

PAST COVERAGE | Neighbors of Portland ICE facility allege harmful effects of tear gas in lawsuit

The lawsuit states, “with each exposure, Plaintiffs experience physical reactions including difficulty breaking, unstoppable coughing, severe burning in their throats and eyes, dizziness, headaches, and more. Those symptoms do not usually end when the smoke clears.”

Another plaintiff and long-time resident of Gray’s Landing Susan Dooley told KATU News that she was recently diagnosed with mild heart failure, which she attributed to the chemical munitions being deployed on a regular basis.

Dooly also said a number of tenants who live on the side of the building facing the ICE facility have received doctor’s notes to move to a unit further from the facility.

Jacobson said in addition to the physical injuries, the residents have also reported psychological trauma.

“Our plaintiffs have resorted to, you know, putting wet towels under their doors, sealing their doors shut,” Jacobson said. “For one of our Plaintiffs who has two small children, the children have at times asked to sleep in the closet of his room just to feel some sense of safety. These are children under 10 years old.”

Jacobson also pointed out a number of residents are veterans and suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in various ways.

“All of these things happening outside every time inevitably triggers that PTSD and is really harrowing, including for some of our plaintiffs,” Jacobson said.

”This has been so traumatic that it’s actually in my nervous system,” King said.

On the necessity of deploying munitions

According to Jacobson, REACH has told him that they’ve taken numerous efforts ahead of legal action to try and mitigate the use chemical agents, including working with the city, and ""ultimately they decided they had to resort to litigation to try and protect their residents.”

Last month, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to the prospect of this lawsuit, saying in part, “DHS is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers.”

In response to that statement, Jacobson said, “there’s video proof of our allegations which we’ll introduce during the course of this case. There’s tons of video showing the deployment of this tear gas at times when there’s no violence going on.”

He went on to say, “The government is saying it’s warranted, but what we’re saying is only when it’s warranted in one particular very narrow circumstances where it’s necessary to prevent against an imminent threat to somebody’s life, not 'it’s warranted because this is just how they want to respond to people yelling loudly,' or because they want to disperse a crowd that’s assembled only in very narrow circumstance.""

He continued, ""There is precedent in other cases where courts have imposed these kinds of injunctions, like, specifically against the use of tear gas. We’re not asking the court to ban the use of these agents where it is truly necessary to protect somebody’s life, but to do it, to create a line that’s really as narrow as possible.”

In addition to asking the court to grant an injunction on federal agents’ use of chemical agents outside the ICE facility, the lawsuit is also asking for a judge to declare the conduct unconstitutional, and to get paid restitution.

The video came days after federal agents carried out a raid in Manhattan, prompting demonstrations near the city's Chinatown neighborhood.

Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on January 1, vowed to protect the city's 3 million immigrants, stating ""We can all stand up to ICE if you know your rights."" Newsweek has reached out to Mamdani's office and ICE for comment.

Why It Matters

The video marks an early indication of how Mamdani plans to navigate tensions between New York City's sanctuary city policies and President Donald Trump administration's federal immigration enforcement operations.

Mamdani, who will become New York City's first Muslim mayor, secured 50.4 percent of the vote and defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in both the Democratic primary and general election. Trump has pledged to crack down on sanctuary cities, vowing to withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that refuse compliance with federal immigration actions.

With ICE conducting sweeps in several U.S. cities, the guidance could affect how millions of immigrants in New York respond to federal agents.

What To Know

In the video, Mamdani outlined several key rights available to people encountering ICE agents. He explained that individuals can choose not to speak to federal immigration agents, film them without interfering with their work, and refuse requests to enter private spaces. ICE agents cannot enter homes, schools, or private workplace areas without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to Mamdani.

""ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. If you're being detained, you may always ask, 'Am I free to go?' repeatedly until they answer you,"" Mamdani said in the clip.

The guidance comes one week after demonstrators gathered as ICE attempted to detain people on Canal Street near Chinatown. A similar immigration sweep in the same neighborhood last October also met with protests, indicating ongoing tensions between federal enforcement and community resistance.

Mamdani has been highly critical of ICE, describing it as ""a rogue agency, one that has no interest in laws, no interest in order"" during a June interview. He previously pledged to use mayoral power to stop ICE agents from deporting New York residents and position the city as a model for progressive governance.

However, experts question the practical limits of municipal resistance. Scott Mechkowski, a retired ICE agent who worked for the agency from the mid-1990s until 2019, dismissed Mamdani's stance as campaign strategy, previously telling Newsweek that mayors cannot stop the federal government from executing its mandated duties.

Weeks before posting the video, Mamdani had what was described as a surprisingly cordial Oval Office meeting with Trump, whose administration is overseeing the current federal immigration enforcement operations.

What People Are Saying

Zohran Mamdani says in the video: ""New York will always welcome immigrants, and I will fight each and every day to protect, support, and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters.""

Mamdani on resistance against Trump's immigration plans: ""If you want to pursue your promise to create the single largest deportation force in American history, or your promise to persecute and punish your political enemies, then you will have to get through me to do that here in New York City.""

It's been three years since Stattmiller began hosting the weekly Sunday morning coffee meetups. This Sunday, the gathering was hosted outside of Holy Land on Central Avenue, and the coffee was accompanied by a common cause.

""We're trying to fight back,"" Stattmiller said. ""We know the people that work here. These are people that we care about, and they have worked their entire lives to make this work.""

Stattmiller said he's also worried about the economic impacts of slowed foot traffic at neighborhood businesses. ""Sales are down, and that's the whole district. That’s not just one or two businesses. That’s not just Holy Land.""

Meanwhile, in Washington, White House Border Czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the targeting of Somali immigrants in Minnesota. Homan argued that the operations are legal and that ICE agents are not detaining people based solely on their appearance.

“Their appearance alone can’t raise reasonable suspicion,” Homan stated. “It’s articulable facts, a lot of different facts, taking everything into consideration.""

Homan declined to address controversial comments made by President Trump the previous week, when Trump referred to Somali immigrants as ""garbage.""

""Do I think there’s been zero U.S. citizens who have been detained for questioning because reasonable suspicion suggested they may be in the country illegally or may have an issue?

The next three stories follow families who are grappling with the fallout.

On a warm afternoon in late September, Will Lambek walked up to an intercom box outside the U.S. Customs and Border Protection station in Richford.

His cell phone had been inundated with calls and texts since Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained nine construction workers during a targeted operation in Hardwick earlier that morning.

Lambek, an organizer with the group Migrant Justice, had come to the CBP station seeking answers about the detainees’ whereabouts.

“I was wondering if maybe they were brought here? Or if you know if they’re at ICE in St. Albans?” Lambek asked the agent through the intercom speaker.

“Sure, no problem, hold on one second,” the agent responded.

If CBP had the answer, they weren’t giving it to Lambek.

“Alright, no comment,” the agent replied. “Have a good day.”

Lambek walked back to the car to resume the search for the immigrant workers, all of whom lived in Caledonia County.

Back in January, it wasn’t at all clear what President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign would mean for immigrants in Vermont. Reality came into clearer focus on April 21, when immigration agents arrested and detained eight people at a dairy farm in Berkshire.

It was, at the time, the largest known immigration raid in Vermont history. It’s since been eclipsed multiple times in communities across the state, including by the Hardwick arrests.

“I think it’s still happening so much in the shadows,” Lambek told Vermont Public. Vermonters, he predicted, “are going to be shocked by the volume” of arrests.

Vermont has seen a bipartisan push over the past decade to protect its growing community of immigrant workers by prohibiting state and local police from collaborating with federal authorities on civil immigration enforcement. But in the past year, an influx of resources at the Department of Homeland Security, and significant changes to its enforcement protocols, have given federal agencies the tools they need to descend on rural Vermont communities and arrest people on their own.

In the last 10 months, federal agents have arrested more than 100 people in Vermont, according to Migrant Justice. Those arrests have upended the lives of those individuals and the families they support, and sent shockwaves through their communities.

Migrant Justice was founded in 2009 to improve working conditions and advance civil rights for Vermont’s immigrant farmworker community. This year, however, much of its work has been devoted to aiding immigrants targeted by a deportation program that’s unlike anything the organization has ever seen.

'The deportation machine on crack'

Rossy is an organizer at Migrant Justice who’s lived and worked in Vermont since 2017. Vermont Public is not using her last name because her immigration status puts her at risk of deportation.

“We’re living in terror,” Rossy said, speaking through an interpreter. “When we hear about an immigration detention happening like this it creates terror in the community and it has this very quick ripple effect where people hear about it and they feel fear. They don’t want to leave their homes. They don’t want to visit family members. They don’t want to go to the store.”

Migrant Justice operates a 24-hour emergency hotline for people to report immigration arrests, and it maintains a database of case files for people arrested and detained in Vermont. A raid of construction workers at a gas station in Jeffersonville in early November pushed this year’s total to more than 100.

Last year, the organization documented fewer than 20 detentions.

Federal immigration authorities have not provided state-specific data on the total number of arrests in Vermont this year.

When people are detained, the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law School is one of the few places they can turn to for legal services in Vermont. Last year the center got four calls from individuals seeking advice or counsel, according to its director, Brett Stokes.

“Fast forward to now, I have simply just lost count of the number of calls that our office has received,” Stokes said.

Stokes and other immigration attorneys weren’t sure what to expect when Trump began his second term, because his campaign rhetoric back in 2016 didn’t translate into major policy shifts during his first term in the White House.

“If you’re trying to split hairs between what like, Trump 1 and Biden looks like, they’re exactly the same,” Stokes said. “There were no quantifiable differences in immigration enforcement policy between those two administrations.”

Stokes said Trump’s second term has ventured into uncharted territory.

“Basically I describe it as, this is the deportation machine on crack,” he said.

Trump officials say the crackdown is necessary to combat what they’ve characterized as “mass unchecked migration” into the United States.

One distinguishing feature of the new administration, according to Stokes, is the abandonment of historical norms that focused immigration enforcement primarily on public safety threats.

“Everyone’s a target now, versus in the past there was some semblance of what I’ll refer to as enforcement guidelines or enforcement priorities,” he said.

The Trump administration has also dramatically increased financial resources available to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, and assumed a far more aggressive posture in federal immigration courts.

Making a life in Vermont

Vermont residents caught up in that wider net have sometimes been sent to out-of-state detention facilities, accused by the federal government of nothing more than a civil immigration offense. They include Jose, who came to the state from Chiapas, Mexico, about a year and a half ago.

Jose — Vermont Public is not using his last name because of his immigration status — works on a farm in Franklin County. Immigration agents showed up at his house in the spring, arrested him, and flew him to a detention center in Texas.

“It was sad at first with the uncertainty, and thinking that we were going to be deported,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.

He was released on bond and came back to Vermont. The federal government’s deportation case against him is still pending. Jose said being locked up for those two weeks changed him. He doesn’t leave his home anymore, and lives in fear of another arrest. But he said the experience has only cemented his resolve to build a more prosperous and secure life for his family in Vermont.

He has a wife and a 13-year-old son in Chiapas whom he hopes to one day bring to the U.S.

“They should know that as a community we’re united,” he said. “And we’re committed to being here and defending our rights and continuing to progress as a community.”

Rossy, the organizer with Migrant Justice, said when she first arrived in Vermont, most immigrants were working on farms. Now they’re also mainstays in the construction and hospitality industries.

The Vermont Department of Labor said it doesn’t have any data on the number of undocumented people in the state’s labor force. Migrant Justice estimates the number of Latin American immigrants working without authorization is somewhere near 3,000.

Trump’s deportation campaign notwithstanding, Rossy said most of them still want to make a life here.

“This isn’t about the fight today. It’s not about the fight tomorrow. It’s for the long term,” Rossy said. “And maybe I’m not going to be the one who benefits from this struggle, but maybe it’s going to be kids, or the next generation after them.”

Rossy said it’s been gratifying to see so many Vermonters protest against ICE, and sign court petitions in support of detained immigrants.

“I think here in the state of Vermont a lot of people do see us and they recognize our fight for human rights,” she said. “We know there are people here who have our backs.”

Then she paused and began to cry.

What’s also become clear over the past 10 months, Rossy continued, is how many people want them gone.

“We also know there are a lot of people who don’t want us here, who are racist, who discriminate against us, who are happy about what’s happening to us,” she said. “So to those people, I want to say that we’re human beings as well and we deserve the same things as everyone else.” ■",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9359f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4850x2546+0+687/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2Feb%2Fb83b6d9746b2b86d747f66c9b8da%2Fmigrant-justice-rally-rossy-vermontpublic-zmcdonald-20250424.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 07:57:11.674750

A clash of views on independent agencies Slaughter believes that it is vital for the Supreme Court to preserve the independence of bipartisan multimember agencies and allow her to be reinstated.","The Supreme Court hears Monday arguments in a case that could end the independence of independent agencies, overturn a 90-year-old precedent, and reshape the balance of power between Congress and the president.

At issue is whether President Trump can fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, whom Trump appointed in 2018, during his first term, to fill a Democratic seat on the Federal Trade Commission. President Biden appointed Slaughter to a second term, which was supposed to end in 2029.

Instead, in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel informing her that she was being removed from office, effective immediately. She was told her ""continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with [the Trump] Administration's priorities.""

Congress created the FTC in 1914 as a bipartisan, independent agency tasked with protecting the American economy from unfair methods of competition. By law, the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party, and commissioners can only be fired for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.""

Slaughter had been given no such reason for her removal, and so she sued. A lower court declared that Slaughter had been unlawfully removed from the FTC and ordered her back to work. The Trump administration appealed that ruling, and in September, the Supreme Court issued an emergency order removing her from her seat until the merits of her case could be heard. Justices voted 6 to 3 along ideological lines to allow her firing to stand -- for now.

Reconsidering a 90-year-old precedent

Proving that history does repeat itself, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire an FTC commissioner over ideological disagreements. In that case, called Humphrey's Executor, the court unanimously held that while the president has the power to remove purely executive officers for any reason, that unlimited power does not extend to agencies like the FTC, whose duties ""are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.""

Following that 1935 decision, Congress went on to create many more multimember, independent agencies whose members likewise can only be removed for cause. Since January, Trump has also removed Democratic members from some of those agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

In Slaughter's case and others, the Trump administration argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Executor was flawed, due to a misunderstanding of the FTC's functions at the time. The administration maintains that the FTC did in fact exercise executive power then and says those powers have only grown in the decades since.

During Trump's first term, the Supreme Court chipped away at Humphrey's Executor when it permitted Trump to fire the head of another independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the firing was permissible because the CFPB is run by a single director rather than a multimember board. Chief Justice John Roberts described Humphrey's Executor as applying to multimember agencies ""that do not wield substantial executive power.""

On Friday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in line with that guidance. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court said Trump's firings of Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris and National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox were lawful, citing those agencies' ""significant executive powers.""

A clash of views on independent agencies

Slaughter believes that it is vital for the Supreme Court to preserve the independence of bipartisan multimember agencies and allow her to be reinstated.

""Independence allows the decision-making that is done by these boards and commissions to be on the merits, about the facts, and about protecting the interests of the American people,"" she said. ""That is what Americans deserve from their government.""

James M. Burnham, an attorney who has served in both Trump administrations, offered an opposing view.

""I don't think there is such a thing as an independent agency because everything has to be in one of the three branches of government,"" he argued. ""I don't think they've ever been independent because I think the removal protections have been unconstitutional from the beginning.""

The court will continue its deliberation on Humphrey's Executor on Jan. 21 when it considers another case involving Trump's attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

ICE agents on campus

What we know:

Augsburg University stated that the incident occurred around 4 p.m. and involved ICE agents aiming weapons at witnesses, including staff and students. The university described these actions as ""unacceptable, dangerous, and profoundly disturbing.""

A viewer provided FOX 9 with a video of the incident, noting that someone was detained. However, FOX 9 has not yet independently confirmed this information.

Legal perspective on ICE presence

What they're saying:

""The public just can't walk into the school hallways. Well, there's no reason why an ICE officer can do the same and so if they want to get in, they can either get a warrant or they can wait outside. They can't come in the building,"" said David Wilson, managing attorney.

He explained that ICE needs a judicial warrant to enter school buildings.

Wilson also emphasized that if ICE shows up without a judicial warrant, individuals are not obligated to answer questions or provide information.

""ICE is often just probing and trying to find out if someone is there. And so often, people volunteer information when they really don't have to do that,"" said Wilson.

Why you should care:

This incident highlights ongoing concerns about ICE activities in the Twin Cities and raises questions about the rights of schools and individuals when ICE agents are present.

Two types of warrants

Big picture view:

There are potentially two different warrants ICE could show you. They can show you an ICE warrant or a judicial one.

According to Wilson, with the ICE warrant you can’t interfere, but you don’t have to facilitate in finding someone.

""An ice warrant will describe it will have ICE's in notation, saying, this is a notice from ice could be a notice of inspection. It could be an administrative subpoena. A judicial warrant will be signed by a judge. It will have a seal on it, it'll be very clear that a judge has reviewed it, compared to an ice officer signing it over at Fort Snelling,"" said Wilson.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1280/720/12_7_25-augsburg-raw-rb_00.00.00.00.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:01.813288

“Growing up in the suburbs was peaceful but did not feel safe,” Julio told me recently.
Over 1 million Latinos live in the Chicago suburbs, and the Latino population of the suburbs has grown more quickly than that of the city over the past 15 years.
“I think in the Chicago suburbs for a long time [organizing has] been [about] Chicago, but now it’s changing.
West Chicago, Elgin, Waukegan, Aurora … This is ground zero.” I work with the rapid response team in Elgin even though I am fearful.","I’ve been living in the suburbs for over three years. I don’t enjoy driving a lot, but the suburbs help me feel safe. My older sister and I grew up undocumented in South Central Los Angeles, a place I have a lot of love for.

But I also experienced a lot of danger and trauma there, which I know is a result of systemic racism that leaves neighborhoods like mine with fewer resources to go around. Once, I witnessed a drive-by shooting in the middle of the day and had to take cover, then watched the ambulance crew place a dead body in a black bag. I often saw helicopters circle my neighborhood after the sound of gunshots; sometimes, the helicopter shined a spotlight on my block.

Now, the violence and uncertainty I grew up with have followed me to the suburbs of Chicago because of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Immigrants and United States citizens are getting kidnapped and denied due process because of how we look. The systemic racism that made South Central unsafe has done the same to the suburbs. I am part of a larger movement that is trying to organize and fight back.

In my early 20s I moved from L.A. to live with my parents in Portage, Indiana, a suburb of Chicago. It was my first time interacting with white people in my own neighborhood. It was also a culture shock because Portage did not have public transportation; walking around, its neighborhoods felt isolated and lacking the signs of life I was used to. But Portage was calmer than Los Angeles, and I liked that I didn’t have to feel like I was constantly looking over my shoulder. Then, I moved to rural Iowa, where the stars were visible, and there were no people in the streets. Next, I landed in Durham, North Carolina, a little suburban college town where I got used to the sense of safety and quiet.

I currently reside in Naperville, Illinois, about 30 miles west of Chicago, which is home to large Indian and Middle Eastern populations whose cultures and cuisines flourish in the area. And I spend a lot of time in the nearby western suburbs of Elgin and Aurora, which both have large Latino populations and delicious food everywhere. They are where I go to reminisce about the good parts of my childhood, and also where I have met some of the best people in my work in politics.

But they are no longer places where I feel safe. Now, I live in fear of my house getting raided by military vehicles and helicopters. I worry about randomly getting picked up by masked ICE agents at my local Menards or Home Depot because of the color of my skin.

And I am far from alone here in the suburbs. My friend Julio, who is undocumented, moved to Wheaton, Illinois in 2007, when he was 8 years old. Julio sometimes felt like an other in Wheaton, he has explained to me, but he also found support and acceptance in many institutions—including Wheaton College, where he earned his degree—and from his teachers, church, and friends.

“Growing up in the suburbs was peaceful but did not feel safe,” Julio told me recently. “I felt that I had to be vigilant of my actions, the way I talk, where I was, why, and when. I always have to be on top of things here.”

Now, the administration’s violence feels as close as a few minutes away. He narrowly missed ICE at his workplace earlier this fall. Julio plans to move back to Mexico by next year, despite the fact that he is married to a U.S. citizen and has been trying to get his citizenship.

Now, I live in fear of my house getting raided by military vehicles and helicopters. I worry about randomly getting picked up by masked ICE agents at my local Menards or Home Depot because of the color of my skin.

Over 1 million Latinos live in the Chicago suburbs, and the Latino population of the suburbs has grown more quickly than that of the city over the past 15 years. But there are only a handful of organizations that focus on immigrant rights work here, unlike in the city, where communities have organized for years. Organizing in the suburbs poses challenges. Neighborhoods are far apart. Residents vary socioeconomically. For a long time, it wasn’t easy to get people to come together around a common goal.

That’s starting to change. In Elgin, where 55% of the population is Latino, people are taking the attacks personally and fighting back. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem led a raid there in September, and the town has seen U.S. citizens detained, a community college student taken on campus, and violent deportations. I have become involved with Elgin’s rapid response team, an alliance that includes immigration organizations, businesses, and churches.

The Elgin Area Rapid Response team focuses on making sure we hold ICE accountable and responding to the immediate needs of the community, including families of the kidnapped. But I think the alliance can do more than just meeting people’s needs in the moment. This effort can also encourage community members to be proactive and to push for local legislation and leadership that stands up against the Trump administration’s racist policies.

Benjamin is an Elgin community leader and the son of undocumented parents who arrived there in 1972; in 1979, his father was deported back to Guerrero, Mexico. “We need to start a movement,” Ben told me. “I think in the Chicago suburbs for a long time [organizing has] been [about] Chicago, but now it’s changing. It’s here. It’s happening here. West Chicago, Elgin, Waukegan, Aurora … This is ground zero.”

I work with the rapid response team in Elgin even though I am fearful. I know that sitting back and waiting for things to get better is not going to bring safety and peace for myself, Julio, and other immigrants. I want to help create a path to a system that does not profile people like us. A system that helps create a United States that works for everyone, not just wealthy Americans who thrive under white supremacy. This fight is about uplifting our community and ending systemic violence—from the cities to the suburbs and beyond.

They took classes at the local community college, and an art gallery displayed work from 13 prisoners this summer.

For more than two decades, the prison, known as the Work Ethic Camp, was Nebraska’s only state prison geared solely toward rehabilitation. The facility held nonviolent felony offenders who were nearing the end of their sentences and prepared them, with counseling, schooling and job training, to return to the outside world.

That changed this fall, after state officials announced that the Work Ethic Camp would be replaced with a 300-bed, high security Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center to support President Trump’s national crackdown on illegal immigration.

And so a place that had been devoted to second chances now had a very different mission, and a new name to go with it: “The Cornhusker Clink.”

In McCook, a conservative town of about 7,500 that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, some residents have objected. Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison. With its close ties to the community, it was a place that helped Nebraskans get back on their feet.

Other residents said they were in favor of the new ICE facility, viewing McCook as doing its part for the president’s agenda and potentially benefiting from 50 to 60 added jobs. But opponents said they were frustrated by Gov. Jim Pillen’s unilateral decision to change the facility and turn it into a place to detain immigrants. City officials are also worried about the potential strain on resources if hundreds of detainees are transported in and out through the town’s small airport, which has one full-time employee.

“Now when people think of McCook, this is all it is — it’s ICE detention,” said Nate Schneider, the city manager and a registered Republican who said he has voted for both parties over the years. “But for us, it’s a lot more than that. McCook is home. McCook is a place that I want my kids to think is a good place to live. We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.”

The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise. A single fence surrounded only the back buildings where inmates slept.

McCook officials said they were given no advance notice of the state’s decision to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp, nor have they been told that the city can expect any revenue from the ICE agreement with the state, which Mr. Pillen has said will bring in about $14 million annually, after expenses to run the facility.

Thirteen McCook residents and a former state legislator sued the governor, arguing that the facility was designated and funded by the Nebraska Legislature for the purposes of rehabilitating state inmates, and that Mr. Pillen did not have authority to change that. In October, a judge declined to grant the residents an injunction but also declined the governor’s request to dismiss the case, which is proceeding.

“I have no problem with prosecuting immigrants who commit crimes,” said Bruce McDowell, a retired telecommunications technician and a plaintiff in the suit. Mr. McDowell, a Democrat, said he viewed Governor Pillen’s decision to turn the facility over to federal authorities as a political calculation. “He’s trying to curry favor with Donald Trump, and that carries a lot more weight than a few of us down here,” he said.

Mr. Pillen’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the governor has previously said that the facility would benefit the state, calling it “good for Nebraska’s taxpayers” and a way to ensure that Nebraska is “doing all that we can to keep criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

In 1997, the Nebraska Legislature approved the Work Ethic Camp, so named to reflect the facility’s stated philosophy that “positive work ethics can be learned and transferred to other areas of an individual’s life.” Its purpose was to prepare low-level offenders to return to the community and to reduce a perpetual overcrowding problem in Nebraska prisons. The state’s prison system regularly ranks among the nation’s most overcrowded.

The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually. Its programming included vocational and educational courses, as well as classes to contend with substance abuse and domestic violence. McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.

Over 48 cent coffee at Arby’s, where a group of men gather most mornings, residents were divided over whether McCook should have had a say in the decision to convert the facility into an ICE detention center.

“Who are we to say, ‘No, you can’t bring them here, you’ve got to go somewhere else,’” asked Brad Gillen, who owns a carpet cleaning business in McCook and voted for President Trump. “If this is our part we have to do, that’s fine.”

But others took issue with Governor Pillen for choosing to partner with federal authorities without seeking input from the community most affected, McCook.

“He did it to us, not with us,” said Dale Dueland, a semiretired farmer and rancher, who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Mr. Pillen and describes himself as nonpartisan.

“If you’d come before this all happened, most people here would say that what happens in Washington is so far away, it doesn’t affect us,” Mr. Dueland added. “All of a sudden it’s like a wake-up call that what happens in those faraway places can directly affect us here.”

From Washington to McCook

In mid-March, Mr. Pillen and his staff members traveled to the White House to attend one of President Trump’s executive order signing ceremonies. The following week, David Lopez, Mr. Pillen’s chief of staff, exchanged emails with D.H.S. officials, thanking them for meeting with him. He also inquired about how Nebraska might assist in immigration enforcement.

It is not clear exactly how Mr. Pillen and the corrections department landed on offering up the Work Ethic Camp, one of nine state correctional facilities, in the months that followed. But in August, in a joint statement with D.H.S., the governor announced the plan. That was the first time most people in McCook learned that the camp would be repurposed.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:13.724420

El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) is the largest prison in the Western Hemisphere with a capacity of 40,000 inmates.1 Construction of the massive 57-acre prison began in March 2022 as part of President Nayib Bukele’s anti-gang crackdown. The facility was built specifically to imprison “Maras,” gang members described as “the most dangerous terrorists who tormented the streets.”1 Under Bukele’s campaign, the government of El Salvador declared a “state of exception,” which permitted the mass arrests of suspected gang members without due process.2

However, in early 2025, CECOT expanded into something else entirely: a destination for hundreds of deported Venezuelans sent from the United States. The transformation happened quickly. Earlier this year, President Bukele offered the United States an unprecedented arrangement: allowing for the transfer of foreign and American prisoners to El Salvador’s mega-prison.2

Figure 1 | President Nayib Bukele during a visit to CECOT. Image from Wikimedia Commons (CC0)

Bukele’s rationale was primarily financial—the facility was half-empty and needed additional inmates and fees from other countries to sustain its operations.2 Over a single weekend in March 2025, the Trump administration deported approximately 300 Venezuelans with alleged connections to the Tren de Aragua (TdA) or Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gangs to CECOT.2 TdA, a Venezuelan criminal organization, is known for trafficking, extortion, and violent crime across Latin America, while MS-13 originated in Los Angeles and later expanded throughout Central America. The White House framed the deportations as necessary to “protect the safety and security of the American people,” pledging to use “every possible tool” at its disposal.3

The speed and scale of these deportations raised immediate questions about the legality of the process itself. In the Supreme Court case Noem v. Abrego Garcia, the court found that Kilmar Armando Ábrego García had been illegally deported to CECOT, in violation of a withholding order that explicitly forbade sending him to El Salvador due to fear of persecution or torture.4 Specifically, under the U.S. Constitution’s Convention Against Torture, it is prohibited for the government to deport individuals to countries where they face a “clear probability” of torture or inhumane treatment.4

García’s case also drew attention to the use of expedited removal, a process first implemented in 2004 to fast-track deportations of individuals apprehended within two weeks of entry and within 100 miles of the border.5 The policy was later expanded in 2017 to apply to anyone who had entered the country within two years, extending its geographic reach nationwide. Today, expedited removal can be applied throughout the United States, often regardless of time since entry. This allows for the rapid deportation of individuals without pending immigration cases, and sometimes even detaining them directly in court after previous removal orders have been dismissed. However, the policy still requires removal proceedings to consider a detainee’s credible fear of torture or persecution—a safeguard that is often overlooked, as in the case of Garcia.5

Further, the cases of Venezuelan nationals Edicson Quintero Chacón and José Manuel Ramos Bastidas outline the concerns surrounding these deportations. Both men were labeled as members of TdA after being detained during immigration raids in Texas, based solely on unverifiable information.6 For instance, Ramos told reporters that he was detained “simply because of my tattoos. I am not a criminal.”6 Subsequent investigations revealed that neither man had a criminal record or any confirmed ties to organized crime. Their experiences illustrate how flimsy evidence and rushed classification procedures resulted in wrongful imprisonment at CECOT.7

These “oversights,” as described by the White House in Noem v. Abrego Garcia, were not only illegal but also in clear violation of the right to due process and the Convention Against Torture.4 They demonstrate that there was no adequate mechanism to determine whether deportees were actually affiliated with gangs or if sending them to El Salvador would subject them to inhumane treatment.4 Reports from former detainees describe torture in the form of beatings, electric shocks, prolonged solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and medical care, all intended to extract confessions or maintain control over prisoners.8

The reported conditions at CECOT raise serious human rights concerns. Human Rights Watch documented cases of deportees being held incommunicado—denied contact with family members, lawyers, or consular officials for extended periods—and subjected to torture upon arrival.8,9 Their investigation found cells so overcrowded that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor or standing, sometimes in complete darkness, with only thirty minutes per day outside their cells. In one documented case, a young construction worker reported being beaten with batons for an hour upon arrival, then sent to a dark basement cell with 320 detainees, where guards and other prisoners continued to beat him daily, breaking a rib.8 Others described being forced to kneel naked for hours or submerged repeatedly in barrels of ice water until they nearly drowned.8

The organization also documented over 3,300 children, some as young as 12, detained at the facility, many of whom had no gang affiliations, with 66 documented cases of minors subjected to torture and ill-treatment.10 These accounts illustrate the severe overcrowding, torture, and deprivation that exist within the Salvadoran prison system.

These human rights violations demand immediate action and systemic reform. The U.S. deportation process must implement enforceable safeguards to ensure proper hearings and to prevent deportation to countries where individuals may face torture. With over 300 Venezuelans deported in a single weekend, more than 3,300 children detained, prisoners subjected to torture or ill-treatment, numerous cases like Kilmar Armando Ábrego García, in which federal court orders were ignored, and ongoing rapid deportation of individuals, the need for reform is urgent.7,10 Individuals who were wrongly deported must be returned and provided with legal recourse. Families unjustly separated must be reunited, including the immediate release of children falsely accused of gang affiliation. Human rights organizations must continue monitoring and reporting on these practices, and the international community must hold both governments accountable under international human rights law.

That crackdown came on the heels of Trump publicly raging against the Somali community in Minnesota after the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal that has roiled the state.
“We believe that the Somali fraud operation in Minnesota is the single greatest theft of taxpayer dollars, through welfare fraud, in American history,” Miller told Fox News’ “Hannity” last week.","WASHINGTON — Border czar Tom Homan on Sunday defended ICE’s crackdown in Minnesota — where officials said up to half of Somali migrants have fraudulent immigration paperwork.

Homan contended that Minnesota, particularly Minneapolis, is rife with illegal immigrants and that lawful citizens “have nothing to fear” as ICE’s crackdown in the North Star State kicks into gear.

“There’s a large illegal Somali community there. There’s an illegal alien community there. If you’re a US citizen, you know, you have nothing to fear,” Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.

“…Because they’re [Minneapolis] a sanctuary city, we got to send more resources there to flood the zone. Because it takes a whole team to find somebody in the community.”

President Trump last week raged against the Somali community in Minnesota in response to revelations about a massive $1 billion aid fraud scandal, involving many Somali immigrants.

Minneapolis-St. Paul has the largest Somali population in the country. ICE announced last week that it apprehended over a dozen illegal immigrants during its operations there.

That crackdown came on the heels of Trump publicly raging against the Somali community in Minnesota after the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal that has roiled the state.

Fraudsters set up firms claiming to provide social services that they didn’t actually provide and instead pocketed taxpayer dollars, federal prosecutor said.

Dozens have been indicted, and the scandal has largely centered around the Somali immigrant population.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump seethed during a cabinet meeting last week. “Their country is no good for a reason. Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country.”

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller surmised that law enforcement has only “scratched the very top of the surface of how deep” the fraud scandal goes.

“We believe that the Somali fraud operation in Minnesota is the single greatest theft of taxpayer dollars, through welfare fraud, in American history,” Miller told Fox News’ “Hannity” last week.

“And we believe that what we are going to uncover is going to shock the American people.”

Homan waved off critics who downplayed the illegal immigrant population in Minnesota and stressed that the administration is prioritizing “public safety threats,” but will detain and deport all illegal immigrants that agents come across.

The hardline efforts to enforce immigration law have spurred harsh criticism from the left and even from some Republicans who have felt the approach is too aggressive.

CNN anchor Dana Bash played a clip of a US citizen who was nabbed by immigration officials before they discovered her driver’s license in her car.

“I can’t tell how you many times an illegal alien claimed to be a U.S. citizen. It happens all the time. But it’s getting back to what I just said, reasonable suspicion,” Homan explained.

“As soon as that questioning is over, if they’re a U.S. citizen, they will be released. It takes probable cause to arrest somebody and actually transport and take them into custody.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/comp-tom-homan-defends-ices-116928786.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 06:57:17.523121

It is the second such deportation flight after a rare agreement between Washington and Tehran, which do not have diplomatic relations, amid the Trump administration’s extreme push to expel undocumented immigrants.

There are serious concerns from human rights and advocacy organizations about the Iranians who fled to the US and may now be forced to return. The State Department’s latest human rights report, issued under the Trump administration, said there are “significant human rights issues” in Iran.

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran. The first deportation flight was in September.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Iranian Mission to the UN for comment.

ICE declined to confirm reporting by BBC Persian about the deportations, without denying the planned operation, citing “the safety of the flight and its passengers.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a047ee0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+132/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2F26%2Ffeed39d24597a855bb1a17ae8353%2Fcnn-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2ltywdll2luc3rhbmnlcy9jbwl1cwfqndkwmdaxm2i2bm1mbza2zxvn-l19jb21wb25lbnrzl2fydgljbguvaw5zdgfuy2vzl2ntaxvwbglpzjawodaynna1ntv5dmg0anu.JPG,N,,2025-12-08 08:57:25.507837

“There is no time frame—nobody knows how long this is going to be,” immigration lawyer Teresa Coles-Davila told The Times.","Immigrants who are one step away from American citizenship have suddenly found themselves in limbo after President Donald Trump ordered a fresh immigration crackdown.

All over the country, the Trump administration has been canceling naturalization ceremonies of people from certain countries in the wake of the murder of a National Guardsman in Washington, D.C., according to reports by WGBH and The New York Times.

Project Citizenship, a nonprofit that works with immigrants in Massachusetts and New England, said that this month alone, 21 clients have received notices about the cancellation of their oath ceremonies, the last step in the lengthy process of becoming a U.S. citizen.

“One of our clients said that she had gone to her oath ceremony because she hadn’t received the cancellation notice in time,” Project Citizenship executive director Gail Breslow told WGBH. “She showed up as scheduled, and when she arrived, officers were asking everyone what country they were from, and if they said a certain country, they were told to step out of line and that their oath ceremonies were canceled.”

“People are devastated and they’re frightened,” she added. “People were plucked out of line. They didn’t cancel the whole ceremony.”

Last month, Trump intensified scrutiny of people from 19 countries deemed to be “of concern” after 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal—an Afghan immigrant granted asylum in April under the current administration—was identified as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guardsmen in D.C., which killed Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and injured Andrew Wolfe, 24.

The countries on that list include Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Cuba, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow vowed in a statement after the D.C. shooting to “ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

“Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests,” he said. “American lives come first.”

An internal guidance at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services obtained by CBS News instructed staff to “stop final adjudication on all cases,” including “all form types and making any final decisions (approvals, denials) as well as completing any oath ceremonies.”

USCIS and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately return a request for comment on Sunday. The Daily Beast has also reached out to the White House for comment.

The order halting naturalization ceremonies has stirred widespread confusion among immigrants and their lawyers, who are hard-pressed to provide answers.

“There is no time frame—nobody knows how long this is going to be,” immigration lawyer Teresa Coles-Davila told The Times. “Literally, no one knows what is happening.”

Rosanna, a student in Texas who was born in Libya and holds Canadian citizenship, told the outlet that she was looking forward to receiving an email setting the date for her oath ceremony but instead got a cancellation notice.

“It’s definitely disappointing. Having come from a third-world country, it’s just never-ending disappointment,” she said. “I definitely feel unwelcome here.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ncf1vrP39DBc5GCyozlsLw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/09774da3b4c52d385789f6203894b791,N,,2025-12-08 03:56:43.615352

The plane — carrying about 50 Iranian citizens, as well as deportees from Arab countries and Russia — departed from an airport in Mesa, Ariz. and will make stops in Egypt and Kuwait, said the two Iranian officials, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The U.S.-chartered deportation flight for Iranians was the second of its kind, after the first took off in September, after months of negotiations between Tehran and Washington.

Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic relations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and for decades the United States has provided refuge to Iranian dissidents, religious and ethnic minorities; members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community; and others fleeing persecution in their homeland.

But as part of the Trump administration’s pursuit of mass deportations, it reached a deal with Tehran to coordinate the return of Iranian citizens facing deportation — currently estimated at about 2,000 people — and send them on chartered planes to Tehran. In the past, the United States deported Iranians individually on commercial planes.

The identities of Sunday’s deportees and their individual circumstances — including whether they had voluntarily accepted deportation or had been forced onto the plane — were not immediately clear. One of the Iranian officials familiar with the list of Iranians on the flight said they had entered the United States through the southern border, lingered in detention facilities for months and had their asylum requests denied.

The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the flight. A U.S. official, who asked not to be named to discuss the issue, confirmed the flight had taken off on Sunday and described it as a routine deportation flight that included nationals from other countries, not just Iran.

One of the Iranian officials, who has worked closely with American officials on the transfer, said that Arab and Russian nationals would get off the plane when it landed in Cairo and that the Iranians would then travel on to Kuwait, where they would transfer to a chartered Kuwait Airways airplane for the final leg to Tehran.

Mojtaba Shasti Karimi, director of consular services for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, told local news media on Sunday that Iran was expecting to receive about 55 deportees from the United States in the coming days.

Mr. Shasti Karimi said that those in the group had expressed their willingness to return home to Iran because of “the racist and anti-immigration policies,” of the U.S. government and said Tehran had received reports of “inhumane” treatment of Iranians held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

As news reports of the possible flight began to circulate over the weekend, however, an Iranian-American U.S. lawmaker, Representative Yassamin Ansari, Democrat of Arizona, warned on social media that the flight could include “vulnerable individuals who could face persecution” if returned to Iran.

The Trump administration has said it plans to carry out the largest deportation in the country’s history, targeting undocumented immigrants and those who had illegally crossed the U.S. border. The administration has also said that it would severely reduce the number of asylum cases it grants and limit them to white migrants from South Africa or English-speaking Europeans.

Iranians are among the citizens of 19 countries targeted in President Trump’s travel ban. Their — and many others’ — legal pathways to immigration have also been restricted following new limits Mr. Trump announced after the shooting of two National Guards members last month in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, which killed one of the soldiers, is an immigrant from Afghanistan.

The first flight of Iranian deportees departed in September and landed in Tehran in early October, by way of Qatar, and at least eight out of 45 people on the flight said they had resisted deportation, begging to not be sent to Iran because they feared for their lives. Two deportees on the flight to Tehran recounted their ordeals in detail, saying they had been beaten by immigration officials in the United States and in Qatar and dragged onto the plane.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/08int-iran-us-flzw/08int-iran-us-flzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 03:56:47.532892

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security issued one of its most sweeping restrictions on immigration to date, ordering a pause of all immigration applications from nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and 16 other so-called “high risk” countries.

The new directive to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — issued in the wake of the fatal shooting in Washington, D.C., of two National Guardsmen, allegedly by an Afghan man — affects everything from green card applications to citizenship ceremonies for individuals from the 19 countries. The policy also paused all pending asylum claims, regardless of the applicant’s country of origin.

In the statement, Salazar — one of only a few Cuban Americans in Congress — said the new policy amounted to “collective punishment” of “the innocent for the sins of the guilty.”

“Freezing asylum, green card, and citizenship processes is not the answer. It punishes hardworking, law-abiding immigrants who followed every step of the legal process,” said Salazar, who has advocated for compassionate immigration policies as Trump pursues his mass-deportation agenda. “That is unfair, un-American, and it goes against everything this country stands for. Background checks already exist to stop terrorists and they should.”

Salazar’s strongly worded statement — which also mentioned how thousands of immigrants in South Florida who applied legally and “waited their turn” would be affected — was more critical of the Trump administration than a joint statement released Wednesday by Miami’s two other Republican members of congress, U.S. Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Carlos Gimenez.

In their statement, the Cuban-American lawmakers blamed former President Joe Biden for the change in immigration policy, describing it as the aftermath of his administration’s “reckless abandonment of border security and its systematic failure to properly vet nearly 10 million people...”

“For four years, our urgent warnings ... about the consequences of the Biden Administration’s grotesquely irresponsible open-border policies and non-existent vetting were ignored,” the joint statement said. “Today, we are unfortunately dealing with the consequences.”

Diaz-Balart and Gimenez called Trump’s immigration efforts part of “protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting.”

Rising concern in Miami

The new DHS policy has created anxiety in South Florida, home to many immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean who are already coping with years-long backlogs for asylum interviews, green cards and naturalization ceremonies, immigration attorneys told the Herald.

Over a million people from Cuba, Venezuela and Haiti lost legal protections when Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole established under the Biden administration were ended earlier this year. Many have sought to remain in the U.S. by applying for asylum, or in the case of Cubans, adjusting their status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, which allows them to become a permanent U.S. resident after being in the country for a year and one day.

South Floridians from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela expecting to become U.S. citizens this week learned instead that their naturalization ceremonies had been canceled after the announcement, according to multiple immigration attorneys.

With the recent announcement, all now find themselves once more in legal limbo.

The 176-page report from Humans for Rights Network, includes contributions from 17 refugee and human rights organisations operating in northern France and six in the UK.
The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.
In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.
Lily MacTaggart from Humans for Rights Network said: “The violence at the UK-France border is endemic, causing acute emotional distress and significant damage to people’s health.","The UK’s policy to stop asylum seekers from crossing the Channel in small boats has led to an increase in violence, deaths and smuggler control, but has not deterred arrivals, according to a report by human rights organisations.

The 176-page report from Humans for Rights Network, includes contributions from 17 refugee and human rights organisations operating in northern France and six in the UK.

It details the use of rubber bullets and teargas by French police, who have been given hundreds of millions of pounds by the UK to secure the UK border, along with testimonies from asylum seekers and professionals including doctors who treat those trying to reach UK.

The report was shared with the Home Office, which did not comment on the content, instead describing the number of small boat crossings as “shameful”.

It follows a report from the Mixed Migration Centre of the Danish Refugee Council, which has found that hardline migration policies are fuelling people smuggling.

Despite the money spent by the UK government to prevent crossings, they remain at a high level.

So far this year, more than 39,000 people have crossed the Channel in dinghies, which is an increase on last year’s total of about 37,000 but not as high as the 2022 record of 46,000.

The report calls for a statutory inquiry into the increase in deaths and violence, along with the establishment of safe routes.

“This investigation should seek to establish how UK funding contributed to the increase in violence including the rise in the power of smugglers in response to heightened security and lack of safe routes,” the report states.

It adds: “Reinforced securitisation does not operate as a deterrent but instead makes it increasingly dangerous for people to cross the border.”

According to the report in 2024, the organisation Human Rights Observers documented 28 violent police operations targeting transport networks used by asylum seekers in northern France resulting in at least 44 arrests.

The organisation observed more than 800 evictions of living sites affecting at least 16,365 people.

The French association Utopia 56 found that between March and September 2025, 680 people were affected by police violence in northern France at times when they were not attempting to cross the Channel. In 2024, there were a record 89 deaths recorded of people trying to cross the Channel.

An increase in violence by the people smugglers, who routinely carry guns, is documented in the report, with at least four people shot dead in and around a camp in Dunkirk so far in 2025. One 16-year-old autistic boy had a gun held to his head by smugglers.

“By allowing smuggling networks to decide who is and isn’t allowed to cross, the UK and French governments have handed over the fundamental right of access to asylum to these organised criminal networks,” the report states.

The charity Médecins du Monde said that 88% of the medical treatment it provided was for conditions linked to people’s poor living conditions.

One doctor from a clinic in Calais which treats people waiting to cross the Channel said that fuel burns from dinghy engines were not uncommon, particularly to lower legs and feet, resulting in some people’s feet being “macerated” inside their shoes, particularly when they had to walk long distances after a failed crossing attempt.

Lily MacTaggart from Humans for Rights Network said: “The violence at the UK-France border is endemic, causing acute emotional distress and significant damage to people’s health.

“The UK and France are both responsible for funding this violence, implementing policies which abuse human rights and in some cases have caused death.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The number of small boat crossings is shameful and the British people deserve better.

“France remains a critical partner in securing our borders, and our joint work has already prevented over 21,000 crossing attempts so far this year. Thanks to our landmark deal, people crossing in small boats can now also be detained and removed.”

The boy, Yuanxin Zheng, is among the youngest migrants to be stripped from a parent by federal immigration authorities in New York City since the crackdown began. He and his father, Fei Zheng, were detained at what they believed was a routine check-in on Nov. 26.

Yuanxin was enrolled at Public School 166 in Astoria at the time, and some of those who came out in the chilly sunshine to join the rally, at the playground on 35th Avenue, had a connection to the school.

Camille Hlavka, who helped organize the event, has a 6-year-old son who attends the school.

“Taking children from their families is not normal,” Ms. Hlavka told the crowd. “It is cruelty. It doesn’t matter if it’s one child, it doesn’t matter if it’s a child you know. This is a human being, and he is being traumatized.”

Addressing the demonstrators, Sam Rasiotis, whose 6-year-old son also attends P.S. 166, condemned the Trump administration’s actions as antithetical to the ideals of a country shaped by waves of immigrants.

“Many of us can trace back our roots several generations, and some of those generations were persecuted and mistreated when they came to this country, to the city,” Mr. Rasiotis, a union organizer, said. “But here we are again. I never thought my son’s generation would face such barbarism.”

Government records show that after Mr. Zheng failed to comply with an order to leave the country, he and his son were separated, in line with a Trump administration tactic meant to pressure undocumented immigrants to follow such orders.

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency arrested at least 140 children in the New York City area since Mr. Trump’s second term began in January through mid-October, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. More than 2,600 were arrested nationwide in that time.

Mr. Zheng and Yuanxin were initially taken into custody in April after they entered the United States illegally via Mexico and were discovered by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Dulzura, Calif., according to federal documents. Mr. Zheng told federal agents that he had come to America because he was afraid of being tortured in his native China.

Immigration officials ruled that his fear was not credible, and an immigration judge affirmed the determination. Mr. Zheng does not have a criminal history, according to government records.

He and his son had been in and out of detention at least twice before being taken into custody last month at ICE’s New York City offices at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, according to government records and Mr. Zheng’s lawyer.

The lawyer, Mike Gao, said his client had refused to board an ICE flight to China in September because he feared government retribution there. ICE tried to get Mr. Zheng on a China-bound plane again in October, but again he refused, documents show.

Federal officials want to deport Mr. Zheng and his son together later this month, according to records that indicate the government plans to reunite them for a flight to China.

In a statement last week, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman emphasized that migrant parents had the option of leaving the country with their children and that Mr. Zheng had been “given a lawful order of removal as a family unit.”

As of last week, Mr. Zheng was at an adult detention center in Orange County, N.Y., and Yuanxin was being transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds unaccompanied immigrant children, according to federal documents.

“We understand that Yuanxin is safe, but he is being held somewhere where nobody who knows him or cares about him can see him or give him a hug and make him feel safe,” Devora Fein, a leader of the western Queens chapter of Indivisible, the anti-Trump group that organized the rally, told the crowd. “He is not the only one.”

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who is facing trial on a federal misdemeanor charge after a standoff with immigration agents at 26 Federal Plaza, discussed his own case and how it tied into Yuanxin’s.

“We’re not going to let ICE or Donald Trump or anyone else separate us or divide us from each other,” Mr. Lander, a Democrat, said.

Among those in the crowd was William McKernan, a 17-year-old high school student who lives in Astoria and attended P.S. 166.

“Kids shouldn’t be kidnapped,” he said. “I used to go to 166 and want to show up because I hate seeing this happen in my neighborhood, in my school and in my country.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/07/multimedia/07met-child-rally-gkbp/07met-child-rally-gkbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:57:03.433045

Sen. Mark Kelly recently told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he has read the Justice Department’s classified legal rationale for destroying alleged drug boats and that it should be released.

Not only is the senator right, he has the power to counter the Trump administration’s pernicious secrecy and make the document public himself.

Kelly, like other members of Congress, has broad immunity to expose government lies, thanks to the speech or debate clause of the Constitution, which protects him from arrest or inquiry for statements he makes on the floor of the Senate. (The same protection extends to congressional aides.)

He can, and should, follow the historic lead of Sen. Mike Gravel, who in 1971 read the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record.

Kelly should read the Trump administration’s legal justification for killing people without due process into the public record — without delay.

The document’s classified status shouldn’t stop him. In addition to Kelly having legislative immunity, records that are properly classified can still be declassified if their release is in the public interest.

The legal rationale for killing nearly a hundred people without due process meets that definition.

If Kelly truly believes the public deserves to know how the government is sanctioning these strikes, he should read the memo into the Congressional Record. We’re listening.

IRS says it will take 8 months to find an email

I filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the IRS in July for a single email from Andrew De Mello, the agency’s acting general counsel, explaining his refusal to turn over taxpayer data to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. De Mello, who noted “deficiencies” in ICE’s request to access more than 7 million people’s data in his denial, was fired shortly afterwards.

IRS recently emailed me, five months after I submitted my request, stating that it would need until March 24, 2026, to complete a search for a single email.

Luckily, the email reminded me that I had the right to sue over the delay.

The nearly one-year wait to find, much less review, a single document crystalizes two things:

The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.
While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.
None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.
“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.” Related","The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging five Wisconsin sheriffs’ practices of holding detainees in their jail for handoffs to ICE.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera. It names sheriff’s offices in Brown, Kenosha, Marathon, Sauk and Walworth counties as respondents.

All five sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers — nonbinding requests that a law enforcement agency assist ICE in taking custody of a person suspected of being in the country illegally by holding an inmate in a jail up to 48 hours past the person’s scheduled release. The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

The lawsuit argues that the detainers qualify as an arrest and that state statutes prohibit law enforcement agencies from making arrests based on ICE’s administrative warrants.

While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.

The sheriff’s offices have differing relationships with ICE. Brown and Sauk counties, for instance, also contract with ICE to hold immigrant detainees in their jails, meaning a person could remain in the same jail after entering ICE custody. Kenosha County has no such contract, but it does participate in a federal grant program that partially reimburses local law enforcement agencies for incarceration costs in exchange for data on undocumented inmates.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July of this year. Nearly 40% of those arrested were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case. Only one of those arrests took place in the Milwaukee County House of Corrections. ICE agents have arrested at least four people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse since April.

In its initial petition, Voces de la Frontera urged the Supreme Court to immediately take up the case as a statewide concern. The court’s order, published on Wednesday afternoon, allows the plaintiffs to skip the lower courts entirely.

Liberal justices have a 4-3 majority on the court. At least four unnamed justices voted to immediately accept the case. Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley, both conservatives, dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who often votes with conservatives, discussed the process in an opinion that did not specify his vote.

“When this court grants review in a case, we almost always let our grant order proceed without comment or dissent,” he wrote, later adding: “Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference.”

Voces de la Frontera has 30 days to file a brief in the case. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.

“We are reviewing the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order and evaluating our next steps in this litigation,” Milwaukee attorney Sam Hall, who is representing all five sheriffs, wrote in an email Wednesday evening. “We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.”

The Maine Human Rights Commission added a sixth district, Maine School Administrative District 52 in Turner, after its board voted 5-4 to adopt a policy mirroring an executive order signed earlier this year by President Donald Trump, the Portland Press Herald reported Friday. The policy asserts that Title IX requires schools to separate sports by ""biological sex.""

Superintendent Cari Medd warned that the district’s legal counsel might not defend the board’s decision, a concern also echoed in other districts facing litigation.

The commission is asking the court to block all six districts’ policies, require their repeal, and mandate new policies that comply with the Maine Human Rights Act.

In November, the commission filed a suit in Kennebec County Superior Court against five school districts — MSAD 70 in Hodgdon, RSU 24 in Sullivan, RSU 73 in Livermore Falls, the Baileyville School Department, and the Richmond School Department. The commission argued their newly adopted policies prevent transgender students from using restrooms or participating in sports teams aligned with their gender identity — a violation of the Maine Human Rights Act.

The complaint notes that Richmond approved a policy in October requiring students to use facilities and participate in sports based on ""biological sex."" Commission Executive Director Kit Thomson Crossman told NEWS CENTER Maine it was ""the first time in recent memory"" the agency initiated legal action without an underlying individual complaint, citing a rapid increase in districts adopting policies that conflict with state law.

LGBTQ+ advocates praised the legal action and said it sends a message that the state intends to protect transgender students.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) condemned the Trump administration as she alleged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers released an ""attack dog"" on one of her constituents.

Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home in Vancouver on Nov. 14, Murray said, before he was ""violently attacked and dragged away.""

The senator said Toledo-Martinez was attacked despite not resisting arrest or attempting to flee. His wife and two young children, ages two and three, witnessed the attack.

A good friend of Toledo-Martinez watched the situation unfold outside of their apartment complex.

""They sicced the dog on him; had him on the ground, hitting him,"" John Williams Sr. said.

KATU News reached out to the man's attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), awaiting response.

Sen. Murray criticized the broader deportation policies under former President Donald Trump, stating, ""Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.""

She continued, ""I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.""

Neighbors of Toledo-Martinez said his detainment has rocked the community.

""Me and my wife the other night, we were sitting on the couch, and we were shocked and awed, almost in tears just seeing, you know, a neighbor of ours being attacked, you know? Just lured outside against his own will,"" Pierce Stevens said.

Murray emphasized for Toledo-Martinez to be released from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, citing a lack of criminal convictions and urgent medical needs.

According to Toledo-Martinez's attorney, ICE agents lured him out of his home under false pretenses, leading to the attack. His attorney discussed the case with Don Lemon on his YouTube channel on Dec. 5.

""[ICE agents] lied to him, lured him outside, and then sicced a dog on him for no reason,"" Stevens said.

He went on to say, ""It's just not right; sickening, honestly. At the end of the day, these guys should be trained properly. You shouldn't have to lie or manipulate.""

'Or he's gonna get bit again'

A video taken by Toledo-Martinez's wife, shared via Sen. Murray, showed a man wearing a construction high-visibility vest while arresting Toledo-Martinez.

Another man wearing a badge around his neck is seen holding back a large dog. Someone is heard saying ""you need to back up...or he's gonna get bit again.""

The man in the vest is also heard saying, ""we are federal agents from Homeland Security,"" and that they will take Toledo-Martinez to be seen ""for medical attention"" at the ICE facility in Portland, after his wife asked if they will take him to a hospital.

Toledo-Martinez's attorney stated that the officers involved in his arrest did not wear body cameras.

After being mauled, Toledo-Martinez was denied medical care for hours, Murray and his attorney said, eventually receiving stitches and medication at a hospital. However, he reported difficulties in obtaining adequate medical care during his detention.

Toledo-Martinez, who is undocumented, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 and is married to a U.S. citizen with three U.S.-born children.

Williams Sr. told KATU News he's been driving Toledo-Martinez's family back and forth from Vancouver to the ICE facility in Tacoma, continuing to fight for his release.

""It's hard on the kids to watch them break down,"" Williams Sr. said. ""When I go see him there with the kids, I have to sit right outside to get out of there, because I can't stand to see his kids breaking down like that. They're strong.""

""A lot of people don't know the full story of what's going on right now, and there's a lot of innocent people being taken advantage of and not given their rights,"" Stevens said.

Referring to Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan, Greene told the 60 Minutes correspondent that those Republicans at that point “decided to put on a Maga hat for the first time”.

Greene was once a staunch Trump ally who has split with the president and is leaving Congress in January. Trump has called her a “traitor” and attacked her online, prompting what she says is a wave of threats against her.

In posts on Sunday on X, Greene said she has reported hundreds of threats to the US Capitol police. She added that first those threats came from those who opposed Trump on the US’s political left. But then, she said, threats were aimed at her and her son when she opposed Trump on his handling of files pertaining to the prosecution of the president’s former friend Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender and disgraced financier.

Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and died by suicide while jailed on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019, during Trump’s first presidency.

“All of the death threats came from the ‘left’ until I stood with the Epstein Survivors, woman who were raped as teenagers, abused, and trafficked by rich powerful men – and that’s when President Trump turned on me and called me a ‘traitor’ and then new death threats and harassments came from the ‘right’ or somewhere,” Greene wrote on X. “I sent these assassination threats on my son to President Trump in which he responded with harsh accusatory replies and zero sympathy.”

Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation.
A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.","The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the Trump administration says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.

“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”

Wade, a grandfather and US army veteran, was arrested for driving without a license in September and was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency tasked with carrying out Trump’s “mass deportation” program, local outlet KENS5 reported. He has been in ICE detention since.

Wade’s case is emblematic of a rising number of non-US citizen military veterans swept up by ICE under Trump’s immigration policies. The Biden administration had previously issued an ICE directive that helped protect non-citizen veterans and also issued an executive order that later created an initiative to help return deported veterans and their families.

The Trump administration rescinded the ICE directive after his second presidency began in January.

Non-citizens are eligible to join the US military. Wade, 65, came to the US from Jamaica at 15 years old, eventually joined the army and earned commendations for wartime service as well as good conduct, as KENS5 reported.

He later received multiple college degrees and worked multiple jobs throughout his time in the US. He was working at a cafe when he was detained by ICE, KENS5 reports.

Wade was being held inside the Stewart detention center, an immigration jail in Lumpkin, Georgia. The facility, one of the largest in the country, is run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

For years, Stewart has faced grave accusations of rights abuses, including allegations of medical neglect. There have also been a series of deaths at the facility.

One of the most recent deaths was a suicide in June. That was the third suicide at Stewart in recent years.

Wade’s six children told KENS5 they have not been able to visit their father as often as they would like.

“Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,” one of Wade’s daughters told the outlet. “He doesn’t deserve this, what he’s experiencing right now.”

Wade’s family has been seeking assistance with their legal fight against his deportation on the GoFundMe platform.

“We are looking to minimize financial catastrophe during his absence,” the family’s GoFundMe says.

Members of Congress have been requesting further information from the Trump administration about its targeting of non-citizen veterans for deportation. In September, multiple House representatives launched a congressional investigation into the detention and deportation of non-citizen veterans.

Those members of Congress wrote a letter to top Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, demanding more information on the number of veterans swept up by immigration agents.

A congressional letter from June estimated that 10,000 veterans or more have been deported. A 2022 report from the Migration Policy Institute said about 16 million US military veterans were born in another country.

The Guardian recently revealed that a number of US veterans may be swept up further by immigration officials, as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seeks to hand over to the Trump administration internal data of its non-citizen workforce. More than a quarter of the VA’s workforce is made up of veterans.

An internal memo shows the VA is urgently working on an internal report of non-citizens who are “employed or affiliated” with the department, potentially sweeping up thousands of people. Some details of the report will then be shared with other government agencies, including ICE.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fefb317917193303edd71518ccb0fee09c66b4b9/182_4_702_561/master/702.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=071e023a502dcd7239dbed504137e9da",N,,2025-12-07 15:57:08.100766

This second edition, updated to reflect the darkening reality of a second Trump administration, is both historical document and moral reckoning—a book that doesn’t just inform but demands we reconsider what American values actually mean in practice.

What distinguishes Towle’s work is her deliberate centering of women as the moral backbone of border resistance. The Angry Tías & Abuelas of the Rio Grande Valley emerge as the book’s beating heart—aunties and grandmothers who transformed familial care into radical political action.

Susan Law, Cindy Candia, Elizabeth “Lizee” Cavazos, Madeleine Sandefur, Joyce the archivist—these women become Towle’s guides through the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in their communities. They are not passive observers but active agents of welcome, their work simultaneously ordinary and heroic.

Towle’s genius lies in recognizing that these women’s stories have been systematically excluded from mainstream immigration discourse. While politicians thunder about “border security” and cable news fixates on chaos narratives, the Tías quietly do the unglamorous work: crossing into Matamoros to serve asylum seekers living in tents, documenting abuses inside detention centers, tracking down children stolen from their mothers.

They operate within what Towle calls the “100-mile law enforcement zone”—a constitutional gray area encircling the entire United States where rights supposedly guaranteed to all simply evaporate.

The author introduces us to Jodi, an attorney who witnesses seven mothers testify about children torn from their arms, then discovers 280 more women detained at Port Isabel, all separated from their children.

We meet Jennifer Harbury, who connects contemporary border violence to decades of US intervention in Central America. Through Towle’s empathetic reporting, these women’s labor—intellectual, emotional, physical—becomes visible in ways policy debates never allow.

Towle herself, a white woman educator and writer, navigates her own privilege thoughtfully. She positions herself as witness and amplifier rather than savior, acknowledging the ease with which her blue passport allows border crossings while asylum seekers face detention, deportation, and death. Her journey from Brownsville to Tijuana becomes a geography lesson in American hypocrisy, mapping the “Border Industrial Complex” that profits from human suffering.

The book doesn’t shy from institutional critique. Towle meticulously documents how “prevention through deterrence”—a forty-year-old strategy that has never stopped migration but has killed thousands—remains the bedrock of US policy. She traces the detention-to-deportation pipeline from Reagan-era Haitian asylum denials through Obama-era detention expansion to Trump’s family separation spectacle. Yet amid this systemic cruelty, the women activists refuse despair. They create what Towle calls “a handbook for a more humane world.”

Crossing the Line is also a devastating exposé of gendered violence. Mothers who fled rape and persecution only to have their children seized by US officials. Women detained in brutal conditions, denied due process, then deported back to danger. Towle gives particular attention to Cameroonian asylum seekers—teachers, lawyers, entrepreneurs fleeing civil war—who endured seventeen-month average detentions before ICE deported them in defiance of international law. Their testimonies, recorded in the scorching summer of 2022, chronicle abuses so routine that investigators struggle to keep pace.

The prose is urgent without being preachy, informed without being academic. Towle writes with a journalist’s precision and a humanist’s heart, rendering complex immigration policy comprehensible while never losing sight of individual human cost. Her metaphor of walls as a “second equator” cleaving rich from poor, white from Brown, safety from violence, crystallizes how border enforcement has become global apartheid.

If the book has a weakness, it’s that Towle’s earnestness occasionally overwhelms her narrative—the reader wants to spend more time with the Tías themselves, to hear their voices unmediated. But this minor critique hardly diminishes the work’s power.

Crossing the Line stands as essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how ordinary people maintain moral clarity when their government abandons it. Sarah Towle has created more than reportage; she’s built a monument to the often thankless, frequently invisible work of women who refuse to let cruelty be normalized. In documenting their resistance, she offers us a choice: Will we fly the tattered flag of American ideals alongside them, or let it fall entirely?","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qvK!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e0b884-d8c2-4aeb-8f58-30dbc4987345_1600x1200.webp",N,,2025-12-07 15:57:24.042554

Conclusion Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence.","1. Introduction

The Second Circuit’s summary order in Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi, No. 24‑1441 (2d Cir. Dec. 5, 2025), though expressly non‑precedential, offers an important illustration of two recurring themes in immigration litigation:

The decisive consequences of abandoning dispositive issues on appeal, particularly in asylum and CAT cases; and

The court’s growing willingness to call out, and potentially discipline, immigration counsel for misstatements of the record and governing law.

The case involves an Ecuadorian mother and her minor daughter seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Their claims rested on alleged past abuse by a former co‑worker and, secondarily, on their status as indigenous persons from Ecuador. An Immigration Judge (IJ) rejected their claims on credibility and “pattern or practice” grounds; the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, finding that key issues had been waived. At the Second Circuit, petitioners again failed to challenge these dispositive findings and presented a brief that, in the panel’s view, mischaracterized both the record and the CAT standard.

The court denied the petition for review, found the abandoned issues dispositive of all forms of relief, and, notably, referred counsel to the court’s Grievance Panel. While the order does not create new binding precedent, it sharply reinforces existing doctrine on appellate abandonment and underscores the professional obligations of attorneys practicing before federal courts in immigration matters.

2. Factual and Procedural Background

2.1 Parties and Claims

Petitioners, Nusta Rocio Medina‑Sarango and her minor daughter, are natives and citizens of Ecuador. The record, as summarized by the panel, indicates that:

Their protection claims were grounded primarily in Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a former co‑worker in Ecuador.

They also relied on their indigenous identity but did not demonstrate individualized targeting based on that identity or a broader pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador.

They sought three forms of relief:

Asylum, based on a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground;

Withholding of removal, which imposes a higher standard of proof than asylum; and

Protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), which requires a showing of likely torture with government involvement or acquiescence, but no nexus to a protected ground.

2.2 Proceedings Before the Immigration Judge

The IJ (Judge Reid) denied all relief by decision dated September 28, 2022. Two points of the IJ’s decision—critical to the Second Circuit’s ultimate ruling—stood out:

Adverse credibility finding. The IJ found that Medina‑Sarango’s allegations of past abuse by a co‑worker were not credible. Given that the daughter’s claims were derivative of the mother’s and rested on the same factual narrative, this credibility determination effectively undermined the factual predicate for all claims.

No proof of individual or group targeting as indigenous persons. Although the IJ accepted that petitioners are indigenous, he held that:

They did not credibly establish that they, personally, would be singled out for harm on that basis; and

The evidence failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous people in Ecuador that would independently support a well‑founded fear claim.

The IJ also:

Found that petitioners did not meet the standard for asylum; and under well‑settled law, failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily meant they did not meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

Denied CAT relief, both because the underlying factual narrative was not credible and because the legal standard for government involvement/acquiescence was not satisfied.

Contrary to petitioners’ later appellate assertions, the IJ did not find that they had abandoned any of their claims for failure to timely submit evidence. The IJ accepted all proffered evidence, including untimely submissions.

2.3 BIA Appeal

On April 29, 2024, the BIA:

Affirmed the IJ’s decision, adopting the IJ’s reasoning with respect to:

The adverse credibility determination;

The failure to establish individualized targeting or a pattern or practice of persecution based on indigenous identity; and

The denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection.

Found waiver: The BIA specifically held that petitioners’ brief to the Board had waived review of:

The IJ’s adverse credibility finding; and

The IJ’s conclusion that this adverse credibility determination was dispositive of all requested relief.

Thus, by the time the case reached the Second Circuit, there were at least two layers of unchallenged or waived findings: the IJ’s adverse credibility judgment and the BIA’s determination that it had been waived on administrative appeal.

2.4 Petition for Review to the Second Circuit

Petitioners, represented by attorney Michael Borja, then sought review in the Second Circuit. Their brief, however:

Did not address or contest:

The adverse credibility determination;

The IJ’s “no pattern or practice” finding; or

The BIA’s ruling that challenges to the adverse credibility finding had been waived.

Mischaracterized the IJ’s decision, asserting—incorrectly—that the IJ denied withholding of removal because the petitioners allegedly abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing evidence.

Advanced an incorrect view of the CAT standard, arguing that petitioners did not need to show that the Ecuadorian government condoned or acquiesced in the harm by a private actor, notwithstanding the contrary language of 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

The panel explicitly notes that these same misstatements of law and record had appeared in other briefs filed by the same counsel, a fact that becomes significant for the disciplinary referral.

3. Summary of the Court’s Order

The Second Circuit (Judges Newman, Sullivan, and Nathan) denied the petition for review. The key holdings can be summarized as follows:

Scope of review. The court reviewed the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA.” This means it considered the IJ’s reasoning together with the BIA’s additional findings, a standard practice in cases where the BIA adopts and supplements an IJ decision.

Standards re‑stated but not substantively applied. The panel recited the usual legal standards for:

Asylum and “well‑founded fear” (including past persecution and pattern or practice routes);

Withholding of removal and its higher “clear probability” burden; and

CAT relief and its distinct torture and state‑action requirements.

However, the court did not engage deeply with these standards in relation to the facts, because the petition was resolved on procedural grounds—abandonment of issues.

Abandonment of dispositive issues. The court found that petitioners had abandoned, on appeal, all dispositive grounds for denial:

They did not challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding.

They did not challenge the IJ’s rejection of their pattern or practice claim regarding indigenous people in Ecuador.

They did not challenge the BIA’s determination that the adverse credibility issue was waived.

Citing Debique v. Garland, the court held that claims not adequately raised in an appellant’s brief are deemed abandoned. Because the unchallenged findings were dispositive of asylum, withholding, and CAT, the abandonment was determinative.

Knock‑on effect for withholding and CAT. Relying on Lecaj v. Holder, the court reiterated that a failure to establish a well‑founded fear of persecution for asylum purposes necessarily precludes meeting the more demanding standards for withholding of removal and CAT. Accordingly, once asylum fell, the others followed.

Criticism of counsel and referral to Grievance Panel.

The court identified “defects in the briefing” by petitioners’ counsel:

Misstatement that the IJ denied withholding because petitioners allegedly abandoned asylum by late evidence submission—contradicted by the record.

Misdescription of the CAT standard, asserting that government condonation or acquiescence was not required, contrary to the regulation.

Failure to acknowledge the adverse credibility finding when arguing CAT relief.

The order explicitly notes that such misstatements have been made in “other briefs filed by Mr. Borja,” and directs that a copy of the order be forwarded to the court’s Grievance Panel.

The petition was therefore denied, all pending motions and applications were denied, and any stays of removal were vacated.

4. Detailed Analysis

4.1 Standards of Review and Substantive Legal Framework

4.1.1 Standard of Review

The court begins with standard appellate review principles in immigration cases:

Factual findings (including adverse credibility findings) are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B), factual findings “are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.” This is a highly deferential standard toward the agency.

Questions of law and the application of law to fact are reviewed de novo, see Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2018).

The panel reviews the IJ’s decision “as supplemented by the BIA,” per Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). This means that if the BIA adopts the IJ’s reasoning but adds its own analysis, both are considered part of the agency’s decision under review.

4.1.2 Substantive Standards for Asylum and Withholding

The order rehearses familiar principles:

Asylum requires a showing that the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of “persecution or a well‑founded fear of future persecution” on account of a protected ground: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523, 528 (2d Cir. 2022).

A well‑founded fear has:

a subjective component (the applicant actually fears harm), and

an objective component (the fear is reasonable in light of the evidence).

See Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2021).

Past persecution triggers a presumption of a well‑founded fear of future persecution, shifting the burden to the government to rebut that presumption. Liang, 10 F.4th at 112.

Persecution must be inflicted either by the government or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control. See Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540, 543 (2d Cir. 2015).

An applicant can meet the future‑persecution requirement either by:

Showing she will be singled out individually for persecution, or

Proving a pattern or practice of persecution against a group of persons similarly situated to her. See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2)(iii); § 1208.16(b)(2); Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir. 2013).

For withholding of removal, the applicant must show a “clear probability of persecution,” meaning it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted if removed. See Pinel‑Gomez, 52 F.4th at 528. Because this standard is more stringent than the well‑founded fear standard for asylum, an applicant who fails to qualify for asylum on the merits necessarily cannot qualify for statutory withholding. Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 2018).

4.1.3 CAT Protection

Protection under the Convention Against Torture is distinct from asylum and withholding in two main respects:

There is no requirement of a nexus to a protected ground (race, religion, etc.). See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 76.

The applicant must show it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed, and that the torture would be:

“by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.”

8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Thus, for CAT relief, the central issues are (1) whether the harm rises to the level of “torture” and (2) whether there is sufficient governmental involvement (or deliberate inaction) to meet the state‑action requirement.

4.2 Precedents Cited and Their Role

The panel’s order is heavily grounded in prior Second Circuit immigration and appellate practice decisions:

Yan Chen v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 268 (2d Cir. 2005).

This case establishes the standard that the Court of Appeals will review the IJ’s decision as supplemented by the BIA’s reasoning when the BIA adopts but supplements the IJ’s analysis. In Medina‑Sarango, the court explicitly follows this structure, clarifying that both tiers of agency reasoning are in play.

Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67 (2d Cir. 2018).

This decision is cited for the bifurcated standard of review (substantial evidence for facts, de novo for law), and for the principle that CAT relief does not require a nexus to a protected ground, a point the panel reiterates.

Pinel‑Gomez v. Garland, 52 F.4th 523 (2d Cir. 2022).

Used to restate the statutory definition of a refugee and the “clear probability” standard for withholding.

Liang v. Garland, 10 F.4th 106 (2d Cir. 2021).

Cited for the subjective–objective articulation of the well‑founded fear standard and the presumption triggered by past persecution.

Pan v. Holder, 777 F.3d 540 (2d Cir. 2015).

Supports the requirement that persecution either be by government actors or by private actors whom the government is unable or unwilling to control, reinforcing that private disputes without such a failure of state protection generally do not suffice.

Wei Sun v. Sessions, 883 F.3d 23 (2d Cir. 2018).

Confirms the hierarchy of burdens: failure to meet the asylum standard necessarily implies failure to meet the more demanding withholding standard. The panel in Medina‑Sarango uses this as part of the chain that disposes of withholding once asylum has fallen.

Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324 (2d Cir. 2013).

Invoked for the “pattern or practice” methodology and the related deference to agency factual findings about country conditions.

Debique v. Garland, 58 F.4th 676 (2d Cir. 2023).

This is the key authority on abandonment of arguments. It holds that:

“We consider abandoned any claims not adequately presented in the appellant’s brief, and an appellant’s failure to make legal or factual arguments constitutes abandonment.”

In Medina‑Sarango, the panel uses Debique to deem petitioners’ challenges to the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, and the BIA’s waiver determination abandoned.

Lecaj v. Holder, 616 F.3d 111 (2d Cir. 2010).

This case provides the doctrinal link for the “all or nothing” effect once asylum fails:

an applicant who fails to establish a well‑founded fear of harm rising to the level of persecution for asylum “necessarily” fails to meet the higher burdens for withholding of removal and CAT relief.

The Medina‑Sarango court cites this to explain why the abandonment of dispositive asylum issues is equally fatal to withholding and CAT.

None of these precedents are novel; rather, the order applies them in a straightforward manner. What is distinctive about this case is not the legal standard but the procedural route to affirmance and the court’s explicit disciplinary concerns.

4.3 The Court’s Legal Reasoning in Medina‑Sarango

4.3.1 Adverse Credibility and Pattern/Practice Findings as Dispositive

The IJ’s core determinations were:

Petitioners’ story of abuse by a former co‑worker was not credible.

They did not show either:

a likelihood of individualized harm on account of their indigenous identity, or

a pattern or practice of persecution of indigenous persons in Ecuador sufficient to substitute for individualized proof.

These determinations are critical because:

Without credible testimony, the factual foundation of all claims is gravely weakened. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(ii), the applicant’s testimony can be sufficient but only if it is “credible, persuasive, and refers to specific facts.” Here, it was found not credible.

The alternative “pattern or practice” route, which can sometimes mitigate weak individualized evidence, was explicitly rejected by the IJ. Petitioners therefore lacked both prongs: no credible individualized persecution and no group‑level persecution.

The BIA accepted these findings and further found that the adverse credibility issue was waived because petitioners did not properly raise it in their appeal to the Board.

4.3.2 Abandonment Before the Second Circuit

The petitioners’ brief to the Second Circuit did not:

Challenge or even mention the IJ’s adverse credibility finding;

Address the IJ’s conclusion that there was no pattern or practice of persecution against indigenous persons in Ecuador; or

Challenge the BIA’s finding that petitioners had waived any challenge to the adverse credibility determination.

Under Debique v. Garland, these omissions are fatal. Courts of appeals treat issues that are not adequately briefed as abandoned. It is not enough to gesture generally toward a claim; the appellant must make substantive legal or factual arguments addressing the disputed rulings.

The panel thus concludes that:

“These issues have thus been abandoned. … And that abandonment is dispositive of all relief.”

In other words:

Because the adverse credibility finding and the “no pattern/practice” finding were both dispositive at the agency level, failing to challenge them on petition for review leaves nothing for the court to overturn.

Even if petitioners had correctly stated the legal standards for asylum or CAT, the unchallenged factual findings would still require denial.

4.3.3 Collateral Consequences for Withholding and CAT

Having found that asylum fails due to abandonment of vital issues, the court relies on Lecaj and Wei Sun to dispose of withholding and CAT:

Withholding of removal demands a higher standard (“more likely than not”) than asylum (“well‑founded fear”). If petitioners cannot meet the lighter standard, they cannot meet the heavier one.

CAT relief, though conceptually distinct, also requires a “more likely than not” finding of torture and is often decided under a comparable or higher factual threshold. Moreover, where the alleged persecution is disbelieved, courts generally reject CAT claims unless there is strong independent corroborative evidence—which petitioners here did not show, and which they did not argue around the adverse credibility finding.

The panel succinctly invokes Lecaj to state that a failure to show a well‑founded fear “necessarily” implies a failure to satisfy the higher burdens for withholding and CAT. Strictly speaking, CAT analysis is sometimes treated as analytically distinct; but in practice, where the underlying narrative is rejected and there is no serious independent showing of likely torture by or with government acquiescence, the result is the same.

4.4 Treatment of Counsel’s Briefing and Referral to the Grievance Panel

4.4.1 Misstatement of the Record

The panel devotes a separate paragraph to identifying defects in the petitioners’ brief authored by attorney Michael Borja. First, it calls out a misstatement of the record:

The brief claimed that the IJ denied withholding of removal because he found that petitioners had “abandoned their asylum application by not timely providing all evidence.”

The court corrects this, noting that:

The IJ “accepted all proffered evidence (including evidence that was untimely), and did not find that any of Petitioners’ claims were abandoned.”

The court cites to the Certified Administrative Record (CAR at 82–84) to confirm this.

Mischaracterizing what the IJ did—especially when the record clearly contradicts counsel’s assertions—implicates the duty of candor to the tribunal.

4.4.2 Misstatement of CAT Law

Second, the panel addresses misstatements concerning CAT:

The brief argued that petitioners met their burden for CAT by showing that the Ecuadorian government “exacerbated” their problems, without acknowledging that the IJ had found their account of past events not credible.

More importantly, the brief contended that petitioners were not required to show that the Ecuadorian government “condoned or acquiesced” to their harm by a private actor.

The court flatly rejects this assertion as contrary to the CAT regulation’s explicit language requiring that torture occur “by, or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity.” 8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a)(1).

Presenting such a statement—ignoring directly applicable regulatory text already quoted in countless CAT decisions—raises serious concerns about competence and candor.

4.4.3 Pattern of Misconduct and Referral

Perhaps most striking is the panel’s observation:

“We note that the same misstatements of the record and the law have been advanced in other briefs filed by Mr. Borja.”

This signal—that the court has seen this behavior repeatedly—justifies escalation. The order concludes with:

“A copy of this order will be forwarded to the Grievance Panel.”

In the Second Circuit, the Grievance Panel deals with potential attorney misconduct, encompassing:

Misrepresentations to the court;

Repeatedly deficient or frivolous filings; and

Violation of professional responsibility obligations.

While the order does not specify what sanctions or remedial measures might follow, the referral itself underscores that:

The court is tracking patterns of misrepresentation or incompetence among immigration practitioners.

Repeated, documented misstatements of law and record can trigger disciplinary proceedings, including possible censure, suspension from practice before the court, or other sanctions.

5. Clarifying Key Legal and Procedural Concepts

5.1 Adverse Credibility Determination

An adverse credibility determination occurs when an immigration judge finds that the applicant’s testimony cannot be relied upon, often due to:

Internal inconsistencies;

Inconsistencies with other evidence;

Plausibility concerns; or

Non‑responsive or evasive answers.

Because asylum and CAT cases frequently turn on the applicant’s testimony, an adverse credibility finding usually has profound effects:

It means the applicant’s story of persecution or torture is not accepted as fact.

To succeed, the applicant would then need strong independent corroborating evidence sufficient to carry the burden without relying on the discredited testimony—rare in practice.

On judicial review, such findings are highly deferentially reviewed under the “any reasonable adjudicator” standard. In Medina‑Sarango, the petitioners did not even attempt to challenge the adverse credibility finding at the Second Circuit stage, rendering it unassailable.

5.2 Pattern or Practice of Persecution

A pattern or practice claim allows an applicant to obtain asylum or withholding not because she is personally singled out, but because:

She belongs to a particular group (e.g., a specific ethnic, religious, or political group), and

There is systematic, pervasive persecution of that group in her home country.

To succeed, the applicant must generally provide:

Country‑conditions evidence (e.g., U.S. State Department reports, NGO reports, news articles);

Expert testimony where available; and

A showing that the harm rises to the level of persecution and is widespread or systemic.

In Medina‑Sarango, the IJ found that:

While petitioners are indigenous, the evidence did not show that indigenous persons in Ecuador face persecution rather than mere discrimination or hardship; and

Therefore, there was no “pattern or practice” of persecution sufficient to satisfy the regulation.

Petitioners’ failure to challenge this finding on appeal rendered the pattern/practice avenue closed.

5.3 Abandonment of Issues on Appeal

In appellate practice, abandonment (sometimes termed “waiver” or “forfeiture” in specific contexts) refers to the principle that:

Issues not adequately raised and argued in an appellant’s opening brief are treated as abandoned and will not be considered.

“Adequately raised” means providing at least a basic legal and factual argument, with citation to authority and the record—mere conclusory assertions or passing references are usually insufficient.

Debique v. Garland crystallizes this for immigration cases in the Second Circuit. In Medina‑Sarango, abandonment occurred at both:

The BIA level (failure to challenge the IJ’s adverse credibility finding, resulting in “waiver” before the Board); and

The Circuit level (failure to challenge the adverse credibility finding, the pattern/practice finding, or the BIA’s waiver ruling).

Once issues have been abandoned in this way, the court generally will not rescue the appellant by raising them sua sponte.

5.4 Grievance Panel Referral

Most federal courts of appeals, including the Second Circuit, maintain a Grievance Panel or similar body to oversee attorney conduct. Referral to such a panel typically occurs when:

An attorney repeatedly files deficient briefs;

There are concerns about unprofessional conduct or incompetence; or

The attorney is suspected of violating duties of candor, honesty, or other ethical norms.

Consequences can range from:

Private admonitions;

Requirements to complete continuing legal education or mentoring;

Public reprimands; or

Suspension or disbarment from practice before the court.

In immigration practice, where vulnerable noncitizens often depend entirely on their attorneys to articulate complex claims, disciplinary oversight is especially significant.

6. Likely Impact and Practical Implications

6.1 No Formal Precedential Effect, but Strong Persuasive Signaling

The order is explicitly labeled a “Summary Order” with no precedential effect under Second Circuit Local Rule 32.1.1. It may be cited in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1, but it does not create binding circuit law. Nonetheless, it is:

A clear application of existing precedent (Debique, Lecaj, etc.) to a typical asylum/CAT scenario; and

A strong signal of the court’s intolerance for:

Inadequate briefing that omits dispositive issues; and

Systematic misstatements of law and record in immigration appeals.

6.2 Guidance for Immigration Practitioners

The order sends several practical messages to immigration counsel:

Always directly address adverse credibility findings.

If an IJ has found the client not credible, the BIA appeal and any petition for review must grapple with that finding: explain why it is erroneous under the substantial‑evidence standard, point to record inconsistencies in the IJ’s analysis, and marshal corroborating evidence. Ignoring it is effectively conceding the case.

Do not ignore “pattern or practice” and other alternative grounds.

When an IJ denies relief on multiple independent grounds (e.g., credibility and lack of pattern/practice), each ground generally must be challenged on appeal; failure to do so leaves that ground as an independent basis for denial.

Be scrupulously accurate about the record.

Claims that the IJ found abandonment or refused evidence must be firmly grounded in the transcript or written decision. The court will not tolerate misrepresentations that are contradicted by straightforward citations to the Certified Administrative Record.

Know and apply the correct CAT standard.

CAT requires government involvement—whether through direct perpetration, instigation, consent, or acquiescence. Arguing the opposite invites correction and undermines counsel’s credibility.

Understand that repeated errors can lead to discipline.

When the court notes that similar misstatements have been made “in other briefs filed by” the same attorney and refers the matter to a Grievance Panel, it signals that patterns of poor practice in immigration appeals are under active scrutiny.

6.3 Consequences for Noncitizens

From the perspective of noncitizen litigants:

The case illustrates how procedural missteps by counsel—especially failure to brief critical issues—can foreclose substantive review of their claims.

Even potentially meritorious arguments (for example, if the credibility finding were arguably flawed) cannot be resurrected if they are not properly raised at each administrative and judicial stage.

It highlights the importance of:

Retaining competent, specialized immigration appellate counsel; and

Understanding that appeal success often hinges as much on procedural rigor as on underlying facts.

7. Conclusion

Medina‑Sarango v. Bondi does not break new legal ground in asylum, withholding, or CAT jurisprudence. Instead, it reinforces established doctrine in two crucial respects:

Abandonment of dispositive issues. Under Debique and related cases, petitioners who fail to challenge key adverse findings—here, credibility and lack of pattern/practice—effectively concede defeat. The court will not reach the merits of underlying claims when no argument is made addressing the actual reasons the agency denied relief.

Counsel’s duty of candor and competence. The court’s explicit identification of misstatements in the brief, combined with the referral of counsel to the Grievance Panel for similar recurring errors, sends a clear message: immigration counsel must accurately represent both the record and the governing law, and must present fully developed arguments on all dispositive points.

In a system where the stakes for noncitizens are extraordinarily high—potential detention, removal, and return to possible harm—the quality of advocacy can decisively shape outcomes. Medina‑Sarango stands as a cautionary illustration: even where substantive law and standards are well settled, failures in briefing and professional responsibility can, by themselves, terminate a case and trigger disciplinary scrutiny.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 16:57:30.418991

Photos show the extent of his injuries — gashes on his arm and side.

The video was taken by his wife, a U.S. citizen and mother to their three young children.

Neighbor John Williams Sr. recalled the incident.

“His wife was screaming; the kids in the car were screaming,” Williams said. “I’m glad his 7-year-old daughter wasn’t here. The 2- and 3-year-olds were here. We were trying to ask, 'What’s going on?' and they are telling her to ‘Get back, get back, or we’re gonna sic the dog on you.’”

Toledo-Martinez himself is undocumented after being brought to the U.S. when he was 15.

According to his attorney, a federal agent lured Toledo-Martinez out of his home under false pretenses, posing as a construction worker who claimed to have hit Wilmer’s car and needed him to step outside to verify.

“He backed in his car because this is my garage, and the truck just pulled up right here and scraped the front right here.” Williams said.

Williams said Toledo-Martinez is loved in the community and a real asset.

“It’s just sad,” Williams said. “This young man works, he takes care of his family, he’s very great in the community. He tries to help any and everybody.”

He said he was in disbelief at what he was seeing.

“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life close up with no one, and it hurts. It really hurts, especially happening to a young man like that — a good, honest, young man.” Williams said.

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington is calling for Toledo-Martinez’s immediate release from the Tacoma U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, writing:

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.
He also said there was a “weaponization” of the justice system in his case, adding that while he was indicted, he was not, in fact, convicted.
I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air.
The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.","President Donald Trump has scolded a Texas lawmaker's ""lack of LOYALTY"" for announcing he will seek election again as a Democrat only days after the president issued a “full and unconditional” pardon in his favor.

“Only a short time after signing the Pardon, Congressman Henry Cuellar announced that he will be ‘running’ for Congress again, in the Great State of Texas…as a Democrat, continuing to work with the same Radical Left Scum that just weeks before wanted him and his wife to spend the rest of their lives in Prison—And probably still do,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Sunday morning.

Trump added: “Oh well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

Why It Matters

The pardoning of Cuellar and his wife was Trump’s third act of clemency this week, after commuting the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was facing a seven-year prison sentence for fraud, and scrapping a 45-year-old sentence for former President of Honduras Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.

But Cuellar’s pardon particularly played into Trump’s rhetoric of a “weaponized” justice system under Joe Biden's administration, with the president calling the Cuellars’ indictment a ""witch hunt”—the same term he had used for the cases against himself.

Trump was convicted by an unanimous jury in New York last year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged hush money scheme to influence the 2016 election. But in January, a judge sentenced him to an “unconditional discharge”—which means that he won’t face any jail time, fines or probation for it. The conviction, however, stands.

What To Know

Cuellar and his wife Imelda were indicted last year in a federal bribery and conspiracy case for allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijani government-owned oil company and an unnamed Mexican bank.

According to Trump, however, Cuellar—a moderate Democrat representing an area on the Texas-Mexico border—was unfairly targeted by then-president Biden for the congressman’s criticism of his administration’s immigration policies.

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump said when announcing he had pardoned Cuellar on Wednesday.

“One of the clearest examples of this was when Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders, and the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe,'” he added.

Cuellar has always said he and his wife as innocent to the federal charges.

Trump said on Sunday that he has never met Cuellar or his wife in person, but decided to pardon the couple after receiving a “beautiful letter” from their daughters.

The letter, dated November 12, 2025, and posted on Truth Social on Sunday, shows that the Cuellars’ daughters did appeal to Trump to show “mercy and compassion to our parents,” they wrote, “either by dismissing this case or granting a full and unconditional pardon.”

In the document, Catherine Ann and Christina Alexandra Cuellar described their parents as “two of the kindest, most selfless people we know,” and said that their father’s “independence and honesty may have contributed to how this case began”

The pair said that their father had “never been afraid to speak his mind, especially when it comes to protecting the people of South Texas and securing the border from the policies of the previous administration.”

In an appeal that would have resonated with the president, they talked of the Trump family's “own challenges” with the justice system, which they compared to theirs. They then speak of meeting Trump at a White House picnic—despite his later saying he has never spoken to them—and being told “personally” that he thought Cuellar was “a good man.”

In an interview with CNN, Cuellar said he thanked the president for the pardon and trusted his judgment on it. He also said there was a “weaponization” of the justice system in his case, adding that while he was indicted, he was not, in fact, convicted.

What People Are Saying

Henry Cuellar told reporters after the pardon, as reported by Politico: “It came as a surprise. I want to thank President Trump for this…Now we clear the air. Nothing has changed, and we’re going to be ready to win reelection again.”

President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday: “I signed the papers, and said to people in the Oval Office that I just did a very good, perhaps life saving, thing. God was very happy with me that day! THEN IT HAPPENED!!!…Such a lack of LOYALTY, something that Texas Voters, and Henry’s daughters, will not like. Oh’ well, next time, no more Mr. Nice guy!”

What Happens Next

Cuellar served in the Texas House of Representatives for 14 years, from 1987 to 2001, and then as the Texas Secretary of State in 2001—always as a Democrat.

The 69-year-old Texas lawmaker filed for reelection on Wednesday, telling reporters he had no intention of retiring or switching parties.

Lair,,,,,https://idahofreedom.org/sanctuary-schools-illegal-immigrations-toll-on-public-education/,"According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.
Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education.
Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded.
It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection.
It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”","In October 2025, a law enforcement operation at a horse track in Wilder, Idaho, turned into the state’s largest immigration raid, resulting in the arrest of 105 suspected adult illegal aliens. Subsequently, the day following the raid, nearly 20% of students in the Wilder School District were reported absent. This incident reveals how mass immigration is transforming Idaho’s rural communities and simultaneously raises another interesting question: why are the citizens of Idaho subsidizing the education of foreign nationals, let alone illegal aliens?

In 1982, the United States Supreme Court, in Plyler v. Doe, struck down a Texas statute that withheld state funds for the education of children who were not ""legally admitted"" into the United States and authorized local school districts to deny enrollment to illegal aliens. It also struck down an independent school district’s policy that charged illegal aliens an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student to compensate for lost state funding. The Court determined that the denial of a free public education to illegal aliens “is utterly incompatible with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”

The majority's opinion in Plyler holds that states lack any “compelling government interest” to deny enrollment to illegal aliens or charge them tuition for attending public school, but the numbers tell a different story. According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), there are over 21,000 children of illegal aliens in Idaho’s public school system costing the state roughly $245.1 million a year.

Mind you, the Office of Performance Evaluations released a report in March 2025 estimating there is a $82.2 million funding gap in special education. All the while, Idaho’s school choice program is drastically underfunded and currently only covers a fraction of the existing private school population. If Idaho weren’t compelled to spend hundreds of millions on educating foreigners, we would have more resources to adequately fund educational programs for our children.

Beyond this financial burden, there is an even more compelling reason to oppose the Plyler decision on principle. Our nation’s tradition of self-government is predicated on the understanding of society as a social compact, whereby, in the words of John Adams, “the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good.” This underlying philosophy is evidenced in the preamble of our own Idaho Constitution, which states that “We, the people of the State of Idaho, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare do establish this Constitution.” The functions of government are legitimate because we have consented to this mutual association to promote our joint happiness. Our system of public, free common schools was established only for the people of Idaho’s “common welfare” — the legitimate benefactors of the social compact and no one else.

In other words, access to a free education is a privilege of citizenship. By eviscerating the distinction between citizen and alien, Plyler v. Doe undermines the very foundation of our republican government. It is one thing to compel a man to pay for the education of his neighbor with whom, as countrymen, he shares a common destiny and on whose wisdom and virtue the security of his liberties depends; it is another to compel the people of Idaho to pay for the education of foreigners whom we have never consented to live among us. The former derives from our duties as citizens; the latter is nothing short of theft.

Our forefathers recognized that the people are only obligated to submit to controversial judicial decisions on matters that are “fully settled.” In response to the infamous Dred Scott decision, Abraham Lincoln laid out a framework for distinguishing settled from unsettled legal precedents. Among the criteria he lists are whether the decision was unanimous, without any apparent partisan bias, in accordance with legal public expectation, or repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as good precedent.

By this standard, Plyler is ripe for a legal challenge. The decision was narrowly decided on a 5-4 split of the justices. In his dissent, Chief Justice Burger took the majority to task for employing an “unabashedly result-oriented approach” based on its own “standards of desirable social policy.” Moreover, he observed that the majority's “unique confluence of theories and rationales” was so contrary to any known theory of “principled constitutional adjudication” that he expected it to establish “little beyond the results in these particular cases.” In short, the Chief Justice concluded that the Court’s decision was so egregiously political and contrary to legal public expectation that it did not warrant any meaningful consideration for future cases on questions pertaining to the proper application of equal protection.

Plyler represents a stark deviation from our nation’s legal tradition on the rights and privileges of immigrants. In 1923, the Supreme Court in Terrace v. Thompson upheld a Washington state law prohibiting aliens who were ineligible to become citizens from owning or leasing land, affirming that the Equal Protection Clause did not supercede a state’s “wide discretion in determining its own public policy and what measures are necessary for its own protection and properly to promote the safety, peace, and good order of its people.” Certainly, if a state may interfere in the private business contracts of resident aliens to lease farm land, it can require illegal aliens to reimburse the state for educating their unlawfully present children.

Plyler is also inconsistent with the rest of our immigration law. Foreign exchange students who are legally permitted to attend a public high school must pay the full, unsubsidized cost of education. However, that same student would be entitled to a free education were he to enter the United States illegally. Even more ridiculous is that while it is unlawful to charge tuition to an illegal alien, Idaho would be entirely within its rights to charge tuition to an American citizen from Pullman, WA, for attending a public school in Moscow.

Beyond these considerations, the landscape of K-12 education has changed drastically in the four decades since Plyler was decided in 1982. Among the most significant developments is the growth of charter schools, which now account for nearly 8% of the nation’s K-12 student population. Under Plyler, illegal aliens have a right to enroll in charter schools since they are publicly funded. However, unlike traditional common schools, charters are only theoretically open to every student. Many charter schools use a lottery system to determine eligibility for a finite number of seats. Given that enrollment in these schools is zero-sum, it is justifiable that enrollment should be reserved for American citizens.

Moreover, many states have begun implementing universal school choice programs. It is unclear whether these programs, which are publicly funded and available to all resident students, must also be made accessible to illegal aliens under equal protection. Even if the Court is unwilling to reconsider its major holding, it should at least clarify how its precedent applies to these new sets of facts.

Recently, several states — including Tennessee, Oklahoma, and Texas — have sought to challenge the precedent of Plyler. Unfortunately, none of these efforts has yet survived the legislative process. This upcoming legislative session, however, Idaho has the opportunity to lead out in restoring the integrity of our social compact.

In 2025, Rep. Dale Hawkins and Rep. Steve Tanner introduced House Bill 382 (H382), which would have required school districts to collect and report the immigration status and nationality of every enrolled student in Idaho's public education system. A 2026 version of H382 deserves to be reintroduced and will be essential to gaining a full and accurate picture of the burden illegal immigration imposes on our public institutions. The Legislature should also consider taking bolder action and directly challenging the main holding of Plyler.

Idaho not only has an interest but an obligation to press this issue. Just as the federal government is endowed with the authority to defend the rights of American citizens against abusive state power, so too do the states have the right to defend their reserved sovereign authority against an unjust encroachment by the federal government. As expressed by James Madison, the architect of our Constitution, whenever the federal government engages in a “deliberate, palpable and dangerous” exercise of powers beyond the scope of the Constitution, the states “have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.”

For too long, the people of Idaho have been burdened without their consent with the expense of supporting an alien population by order of judicial fiat. It is high time we reaffirm that the Constitution was not established for the benefit of illegal aliens, but “to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”",https://idahofreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Article-Headers-2025-12-06T163229.040.png,N,,2025-12-07 14:56:34.601082

ICE is currently holding 65,000 migrants in detention centers around the country, according to DHS data posted online.","More than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE officers in the first nine months of the Trump administration had no criminal histories, according to new data.

The data, which includes ICE arrests from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, shows that nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records have been swept up in immigration operations that the president and his top officials have said would target murderers, rapists and gang members.

“It contradicts what the administration has been saying about people who are convicted criminals and that they are going after the worst of the worst,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The figures provide the most revealing look to date into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They were shared by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project, which obtained them through a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The data is compiled by an internal ICE office that handles arrest, detention and deportation data. The administration stopped regularly posting detailed information on ICE arrests in January.

For arrestees with criminal histories, the data doesn’t distinguish between those with a history of minor offenses and those who have committed more serious crimes, like rape and murder, whom the administration has said it is targeting.

And the figures do not include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has launched aggressive immigration operations in several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina. Border Patrol sweeps are currently underway in New Orleans.

Border Patrol and ICE are both under the Department of Homeland Security but they are two different agencies with two different missions. Border Patrol agents typically operate along the southern and northern borders, but recently hundreds have been sent into the interior of the United States to track down undocumented immigrants.

“That is the black box that we know nothing about,” Ruiz Soto said. “How many arrests is Border Patrol doing? How many of those are leading to removals and under what conditions?”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE field offices have been under intense pressure to ramp up arrests.

In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin arresting at least 3,000 migrants per day, NBC News previously reported.

But the new data shows that ICE is still falling well short of those targets.

ICE agents have made an average daily total of 824 arrests since Jan. 20, according to the data. Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

The data also reveals that about 90% of the people ICE arrested through mid-October were male. Mexican nationals accounted for the largest share of the overall arrests, with about 85,000, followed by nationals of Guatemala at 31,000 and Honduras at 24,000.

More than 60% of those who were arrested were between the ages of 25 and 45.

“Now we’re really feeling that pain in the workforce,” said George Carrillo, chief executive officer of the Hispanic Construction Council.

Carrillo praised the Trump administration for its efforts to secure the border but said the ongoing enforcement operations are having a significant impact on companies that employ migrant workers.

“Now even the most conservative Republicans are feeling it and understanding that, hey, something different has to be done because now it is affecting their businesses,” he said. “And they’re worried about this strategy.”

It’s not clear from the data how many of those who were arrested were deported, but 22,959 are listed under the category of “voluntary departure,” meaning they left the United States of their own accord.

""That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center.","A Georgia grandfather and U.S. Army veteran has spent the last three months in immigration detention after what began as a simple traffic stop.

His case is unfolding as federal protections for non-citizen veterans have quietly been scaled back.

A traffic stop that changed everything

Godfrey Wade, a longtime Covington resident who came to the United States from Jamaica at 15, was pulled over in Conyers in September for failing to use a turn signal. Police discovered he was driving without a license and arrested him. ICE took Wade into custody shortly after.

His fiancée, April Watkins, recorded on her phone the moment he was taken away in handcuffs.

""He wasn't born in this country, and still, he loves this country enough that he signed up to serve it,"" Watkins said. ""Fifty years later, when he needs this country, this country is turning its back on him.""

A veteran with deep ties to Georgia

Shortly after he arrived in the United States, Wade enlisted in the United States Army, 7th Infantry Division, beginning in Aschaffenburg, Germany. He earned commendations for good conduct and wartime service.

After his honorable discharge, he built a wide-ranging career and earned multiple college degrees. He's worked as a master tailor, fashion designer, tennis coach, and chef. He was working at the Georgia Capitol Café before he was detained.

He and Watkins say they were in the process of securing his citizenship.

""We had an attorney, but it's a very expensive endeavor; the cost is astronomical,"" she said. ""Still, he did make the effort. We did a lot of things to make sure this day would not come, and yet here we are.""

Calling from Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Wade admitted he didn't expect this day to come.

""For 52 years I've lived in this country and raised my children, worked hard, paid my taxes,"" he said. ""A lot of the processes of immigration I didn't know about. I'm learning more while I'm in here.""

Suffering at Stewart Detention Center

65-year-old Wade said he spent his first 12 days at Stewart Detention Center sleeping on a makeshift bed on the ground, a result of overcrowding.

""We don't have any bunk space,"" he said. ""We're given what we call boats, and those are placed on the floor with a two-inch mat.""

He also said there are only two working urinals for his entire pod of 80 people.

""There's sewage water flowing on the ground,"" he said.

Records obtained by 11Alive show the Office of Detention Oversight (ODO) found 12 deficiencies at the center during its last inspection. Those deficiencies related to health and safety, food service, phone access, use of force, and more.

The agency also noted violations of the required 12-to-1 detainee-to-toilet ratio.

Over a series of weeks, 11Alive News Investigates repeatedly reached out to CoreCivic, the contractor that runs Stewart Detention Center, for comment. As of this publication, it has still not responded.

Protections rolled back

For years, non-citizen veterans had legal safeguards against deportation.

In 2022, the Biden administration directed ICE officers to consider U.S. military service when deciding whether to pursue removal, allowing exemptions for veterans without serious criminal histories.

But an internal ICE memo obtained by 11Alive Investigates shows that directive was rescinded in April of this year.

The memo preserves certain protections for active-duty service members, but leaves others vulnerable. In fact, the new directive explicitly states, ""an honorable discharge does not prevent an alien from being subject to immigration enforcement.""

Georgia lawmakers raised the alarm

Earlier this year, Georgia U.S. Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, along with Rep. Hank Johnson, joined more than 60 Democratic members of Congress demanding the federal government produce a list of veterans who have been detained or deported so far in 2025.

That list was due Sept. 16.

Documents provided to 11Alive News by Rep. Johnson's office show the Department of Defense said it wouldn't meet that deadline, but expected to give a response by Oct. 17.

It never came.

""Senator [Elizabeth] Warren's office has been following up every two weeks with no response,"" said a spokesperson for Rep. Johnson.

""He doesn't deserve this""

Wade's six children say they've only been granted sporadic access to see their father.

""Just the process of being able to see my dad is very traumatic,"" said Wade's daughter, Christian, a teacher. ""He doesn't deserve this, what he's experiencing right now.""

Christian is the mother of two of Wade's grandchildren, 4 and 6.

""It's been hard trying to communicate why granddad is not available,"" she said. ""We typically see him every weekend. He doesn't want them to see him behind that plexiglass. He doesn't want them to see what he looks like.""

Wade's youngest child, Emmanuela, 28, said she's struggling with the thought of her father, who has never had more than a traffic violation, being perceived as a criminal.

""For my first talent show, I was doing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and he created a kimono for me,"" she said. ""There were stars all alongside the sleeves. He was always supportive of our aspirations and our dreams.""

30-year-old Zoe said his father also instilled a love of country in the family.

""He would have us standing at attention and then tell us, 'At ease!'"" He laughed. ""We'd sing cadences, different army songs. He really instilled some great foundations for us and was very patriotic.""

""We're here because of him,"" Christian added. ""We have these rights because he came here. His grandchildren are experiencing their rights because of his bravery. And through all of this, he is still choosing the United States, his faith in and patriotism for this country.""

Wade's children and three grandchildren cherish the limited phone calls they get from Stewart Detention Center.

Agreeing to have his words published, Wade insisted on making it clear he holds no animosity for the country he's served.

""If I didn't believe this country is still great, I wouldn't want to stay here,"" he said. ""I shed my blood for this country. I can live with myself if I just have a day in court so somebody can hear my story.""

Wade says he wasn't assigned a case agent for 55 days and still hasn't appeared before a judge.

""I was told through my attorney that they're waiting for a deportation,"" He said. ""I haven't gone to see a judge. They're saying that my situation is final.""

Watkins says his confusion about being denied a hearing was only recently addressed.

""They're saying they mailed me a notice of appearance to a judge back in 2014,"" he said. ""But it went to the wrong address.""

Asked whether she's prepared herself for the possibility of her fiancé's deportation, Watkins held back tears.

""I have not,"" she said. ""Will we even get to say goodbye, or is it just gonna be a phone call and then the next thing you know, he's in Jamaica?""

Watkins said she hopes sharing her fiancé's story might inspire legislative action to restore deportation protections for non-citizen veterans.

""If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,"" she said. ""That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.""",https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/c1495a75-aaaa-4dbc-99ee-ed20814c41bc/20251204T180306/c1495a75-aaaa-4dbc-99ee-ed20814c41bc_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 15:57:59.831734

Illegal immigration has been reduced toward zero, and the political stars seem in alignment, at least theoretically, for reductions in legal immigration as well.

But that seems unlikely. And not just because of timidity of lawmakers but because the two writers take too mechanical a view of mass immigration. For people don’t uproot themselves and head for unfamiliar lands for just marginal economic gain.

In my 2013 book, “Shaping Our Nation: How Surges of Migration Transformed America and Its Politics,” I argued that the unusual phenomenon of mass migration only occurs when large numbers of people are pursuing dreams or escaping nightmares.

Cowen, a market-friendly economist, sees it differently. Looking back, he thinks that America had “a fine policy” before 2016, “keep(ing) borders nominally restricted … but allow(ing) immigration, both legal and illegal, to become increasingly attractive to people around the world.” Mordantly, he adds, “I call this ‘asymptotically approaching open borders.'”

To which voters, as he points out, react negatively as they do to mention of an explicit open-borders policy. They’re fearful that some large proportion of the 95% of human beings who don’t live in the U.S. would like to come here.

That’s probably unrealistic. Mexico has been at peace with the U.S. since 1848, and the U.S. has always had higher wage levels. But for more than a century, only a negligible number of Mexicans crossed the border. For most Mexicans, America was so geographically distant and culturally different that they never dreamed of coming.

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act imposed limits, for the first time, on immigration from Latin America, and few Mexicans arrived in the stagflationary 1970s. But mass chain migration to Ronald Reagan’s sunny California began in the 1980s and crested in the 2000s as banks, incentivized to loan to Hispanics, issued $300,000 mortgages to borrowers with no money down, no W-2s, no assets.

That led to the 2007 housing market collapse, which turned immigrants’ dreams of unloading their houses for $600,000 into bankruptcy nightmares. Net migration from Mexico turned negative for a decade, and the Biden-era surge of illegal immigrants came not so much from Mexicans but from Central Americans and assorted others, crossing Mexico to be welcomed across the Rio Grande. The Trump administration’s success in border and internal enforcement will, for a time, disincentivize illegal migration by turning would-be migrants’ dreams into nightmares.

While Cowen thinks that’s cruel, Caldwell hails it as a step toward “America’s third great slamming of the Golden Door.” The first, he dates from 1775 to 1815. But those were mostly wartime years — the American Revolution up through 1783, the world war between revolutionary and Napoleonic France and parliamentary and commercial Britain for all but one year from 1793 to 1815.

The second started with passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, which virtually eliminated immigration from eastern and southern Europe, dominant in the Ellis Island era (1892-1914, 1919-24). But the law’s effect was limited. It blocked several million migrants in the prosperous 1920s but very few (though, tragically, some refugees) in the depression 1930s, when there was little migration, internal or international. And world war, in 1939-45, as it had in 1914-18, cut immigration to essentially zero.

The 1924 law remained in effect till 1965 and limited postwar immigration from Italy and Greece, but many prewar immigrants from those countries returned home, and many southern Europeans postwar headed to newly prosperous northern Europe. And of course, there was no substantial postwar immigration from Eastern Europe, behind the Iron Curtain.

Caldwell credits the “pause” in immigration following 1924 for encouraging assimilation into an American mainstream. But that was furthered more by the sudden appearance of mass media — radio, movies, television — and by World War II, which put 16 million men in a nation of 131 million into the military, putting literally in uniform Americans of all origins.

They partook of a common popular culture transmitted by universal media and established a national consensus that dismantled the separate segregation system established and maintained in the South for 75 years. That, perhaps as much as changes in the 1965 law, may have made the dream of life in the United States seem achievable to millions in Latin America and Asia during the great immigration surge in the quarter-century from 1982 to 2007. If the forces of assimilation were not as strong in those years as they were in the 1940s military or the New York City public schools a century ago, that’s something to work on now.

In the meantime, it’s an exaggeration to say that America is closing its doors when it swears in about 800,000 new American citizens every year. There are arguments for changing our legal immigration system to prioritize high-skill migrants, as well as to reduce or (as I would prefer) increase the total flow of immigrants. But there are limits on what the law can do when, despite economic incentives, people only take the unusual step of uprooting themselves to pursue dreams or escape nightmares.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been one of the most vociferous defenders of President Donald Trump’s expansive use of executive authority, withholding billions of dollars in federal funding to states and dismissing protests of the White House’s boundary-pushing behavior as the gripings of “disenfranchised Democrats.”

But court documents reviewed by ProPublica show that a decade ago, as a House member, Duffy took a drastically different position on presidential power, articulating a full-throated defense of Congress’ role as a check on the president — one that resembled the very arguments made by speakers at recent anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies around the country.

Related | Only Sean Duffy could make safety bigoted and weird

In an assertive, thoroughly researched 2015 legal brief, Duffy, then a Republican representative from Wisconsin, detailed the history of America’s creation in reaction to the absolute power of the English crown, invoking the Magna Carta and the Founding Fathers as he made the case for the separation of powers.

“Just as Congress may not bestow upon the President Congress’s own exclusive power to make, or to repeal, federal law,” Duffy argued, citing a 1998 court decision, “it may not bestow upon the Executive its own exclusive power of the purse.”

The brief went on to cite James Madison’s account of the Constitutional Convention, where there was “unanimous agreement that Congress, not the President, should control the purse.”

At the time, Duffy filed the friend-of-the-court brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gets funded. Duffy, who chaired the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, maintained that the agency’s unique funding system — its dollars come directly from the Federal Reserve System rather than by a congressional appropriation — improperly bypassed lawmakers’ authority.

The 39-page brief was filed under Duffy’s name along with a nonprofit group aligned with the Republican legal activist Leonard Leo and submitted by a preeminent conservative lawyer. Today, it stands in stark contrast to Duffy’s own actions as transportation secretary in the first year of Trump’s second stint in the White House. Indeed, his attempts to restrict congressionally appropriated transportation funding across all 50 states this year have been condemned by a congressional watchdog and federal judges, resulting in stinging public rebukes from the other branches of government that echo his own 2015 position.

Peter Levine, a civics expert at Tufts University, said that while it could be that Duffy’s views on presidential power have evolved over time, his apparent flip-flopping on something as fundamental as the meaning of the Constitution raises the prospect that Duffy may “just be playing a game for power.”

“The Constitution is a promise to continue to apply the same rules and norms over time to everybody,” he added. “When political actors completely ignore that, and just go after their own thing, I don’t think the Constitution can actually function.”

In response to questions, a Department of Transportation spokesperson asked for a copy of Duffy’s brief. But after ProPublica provided it, the spokesperson stopped responding. A message sent to a number listed for Duffy hasn’t been returned.

The expansion of executive power has been a hallmark of Trump’s second administration. The president issued a whopping 214 executive orders between Jan. 20 and Nov. 20, according to the The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In both “number and ambition,” the orders and resulting actions are “exceeded on these dimensions in the last century only by Franklin D. Roosevelt,” one Harvard Law School professor recently noted.

Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds. And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.

But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.

For Duffy, the first instance came in May, when the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, concluded that the DOT had violated the law when it halted payments in February from a $5 billion fund for electric car charging stations that Congress approved under former President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.

“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume. “The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.”

A White House spokesperson called the GAO’s opinion “incorrect” when it was issued and argued that the DOT was “appropriately using” its authority.

In June, a federal judge in Washington ordered transportation officials to lift the pause after a handful of states sued Duffy and the DOT, writing that when the executive branch “treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch,” it’s up to the court “to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power.”

The government has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that it had revamped the grant application process for the charging station money and also that the states’ constitutional concerns were unfounded, since another part of the Constitution “vests the President with broad, discretionary authority to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The suit is ongoing.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1502157/story_image/AP25279796254436.jpg?1764101525,N,,2025-12-07 12:57:34.356679

Finally, we discuss below the insurmountable problems in any attempt to consider the drugs or boats targetable as “war-sustaining” objects.","The Sept. 2 attack on a boat allegedly carrying drugs has sparked widespread discussion regarding the targetability of the 11 people aboard, including two who survived the first strike, and of the drugs themselves. Given the administration’s lack of transparency, especially from the Department of Defense, there is widespread speculation about what really happened in this first, highly controversial Operation Southern Spear attack.

Initially, reports were that the two survivors were merely clinging to the wreckage of the boat when they were killed in a follow-on strike. This led to widespread accusations of war crimes on the basis that those individuals were hors de combat. Next, a narrative emerged that the survivors were on board the boat and communicating with other cartel boats in the vicinity. This led the Washington Post to suggest that, “[t]he version of events [Admiral] Bradley is expected to deliver would rebut claims by legal experts that the killing of the two survivors could have constituted a war crime.” In yet another turn, some members of Congress who viewed the video of the strikes have suggested the two survivors were in fact perched, shirtless, on capsized wreckage of a portion of the boat (the rest having burned or separated), unarmed, and with no radio or other communication equipment available, and having waved their arms before they were killed – in other words, utterly defenseless and posing no threat.

Flawed legal analysis has plagued discussions of the operations. In fact, there have been no war crimes because there is no “war.” And even if the United States were engaged in an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua or drug cartels, much of the discussion about the operations generally, and the Sept. 2 strike in particular, misses or misconstrues fundamental points of law that should be driving scrutiny of the campaign broadly and of individual attacks.

In this article, we attempt to clear some of the fog of law by zeroing in on whether individuals aboard the boats or the drugs they were transporting were legally targetable in the first place. We start with the law that actually applies to the strikes. Our analysis then turns to the law of armed conflict (LOAC). That law does not apply, but because it is nevertheless occupying (inappropriately) so much of the discussion, we will delve into those aspects of it that deal with targeting.

The bottom line: there is no legal basis for targeting the drugs, the boats carrying them, or the people on board. That is true under the law that applies (international human rights law) and under the law that does not apply (the law of armed conflict).

The Applicable Law: What Makes a “Non-International Armed Conflict”?

The administration has claimed that the operations against the drug cartels are occurring in the context of a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) that triggers the applicability of LOAC. This assertion is unambiguously incorrect as a matter of law, a point illustrated by the near universal rejection of it among LOAC experts.

Non-international armed conflict must be distinguished from international armed conflict (IAC), which is a conflict between States. In a NIAC, armed hostilities exist between a State and a non-State entity that qualifies under LOAC as an “organized armed group” (OAG).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was the first body to address the nature of non-international armed conflict in any depth. In its first case, Tadić, the ICTY explained that a NIAC is characterized by “protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a State” (Jurisdiction, ¶ 70).

Many subsequent decisions of international courts have unpacked this characterization. For instance, in Limaj, the ICTY, citing Tadić, observed, “The two determinative elements of an armed conflict, intensity of the conflict and level of organisation of the parties, are used ‘solely for the purpose, as a minimum, of distinguishing an armed conflict from banditry, unorganized and short-lived insurrections, or terrorist activities, which are not subject to international humanitarian law’” (Judgment, ¶ 89). In other words, pure criminality, even if violent, does not qualify. The DoD Law of War has embraced such organization and intensity criteria for NIAC (§ 17.1.1).

Importantly, to reach the threshold for a NIAC, the conflict situation in question must be military in character. As noted by the ICTY in Haradinaj, “an armed conflict can exist only between parties that are sufficiently organized to confront each other with military means” (Judgement, ¶ 60). It explained that the indicia of qualification as an OAG include

the existence of a command structure and disciplinary rules and mechanisms within the group; the existence of a headquarters; the fact that the group controls a certain territory; the ability of the group to gain access to weapons, other military equipment, recruits and military training; its ability to plan, coordinate and carry out military operations, including troop movements and logistics; its ability to define a unified military strategy and use military tactics; and its ability to speak with one voice and negotiate and conclude agreements such as cease-fire or peace accords (¶ 60; see also DoD Law of War Manual, p. 85).

And that tribunal addressed the requisite intensity for a NIAC in its Boskoski Trial Chamber judgment (¶ 177).

Various indicative factors have been taken into account by Trial Chambers to assess the ‘intensity’ of the conflict. These include the seriousness of attacks and whether there has been an increase in armed clashes, the spread of clashes over territory and over a period of time, any increase in the number of government forces and mobilisation and the distribution of weapons among both parties to the conflict, as well as whether the conflict has attracted the attention of the United Nations Security Council, and whether any resolutions on the matter have been passed. Trial Chambers have also taken into account in this respect the number of civilians forced to flee from the combat zones; the type of weapons used, in particular the use of heavy weapons, and other military equipment, such as tanks and other heavy vehicles; the blocking or besieging of towns and the heavy shelling of these towns; the extent of destruction and the number of casualties caused by shelling or fighting; the quantity of troops and units deployed; existence and change of front lines between the parties; the occupation of territory, and towns and villages; the deployment of government forces to the crisis area; the closure of roads; cease fire orders and agreements, and the attempt of representatives from international organisations to broker and enforce cease fire agreements.

It is clear that the hostilities between the United States and Tren de Aragua, or any other cartel, did not on Sept. 2, and almost certainly do not now, comprise a NIAC. Indeed, hostile action using military means has been engaged in only by the United States, not by any cartel or criminal gang against us. The gangs and cartels are involved in criminality when they are trafficking drugs, to be sure, but they are not organized militarily to engage in military operations.

There is the possible exception of a few groups that have been in conflicts within the States in which they are based, but not with the United States, such as the ELN in Colombia (this surely does not extend to the vast majority of the reportedly 24 groups the president has directed the U.S. military to target with lethal force, and the administration has not disclosed which groups are the 24 listed). Yet, even groups like the ELN that might be organized militarily or have a military wing are not and have not in the past been directing hostilities at the United States, and certainly not by virtue of smuggling drugs, which is not a hostile act or an attack.

In short, this is not, even by the most liberal interpretation of the term, a non-international armed conflict. We find it difficult to imagine how any executive branch lawyer could have reached a different conclusion.

The Applicable Law on Targeting in These Operations

As we and others have repeatedly noted (see e.g., here, here, here), in the absence of an armed conflict, whether international or non-international, the applicable international law governing the targeting of boats with people aboard is international human rights law (IHRL). Under IHRL, life may not be taken by a State “arbitrarily,” a right recognized by the United States to apply extraterritorially (U.S. Army’s Operational Law Handbook, pages 98-99; see also Ryan’s explanation). As noted by the UN Human Rights Committee in General Comment 36, the right to life extends to persons “located outside any territory effectively controlled by the State whose right to life is nonetheless affected by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable manner” (¶ 63).

There are clear IHRL standards for determining when lethal actions are arbitrary. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, for example, explains that “intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life,” and only in the case of an “imminent threat of death or serious injury.” And even in such cases, lethal force is arbitrary if “less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives” (¶ 9; see also Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, art. 3, commentary). Although framed in the context of law enforcement, the principles reflect the IHRL standard of arbitrariness binding on State organs that use lethal force, including the armed forces (which are sometimes used to support law enforcement activity, such as in maritime drug interdiction operations). Case law applies these principles of customary international law (i.e., that no more force “than is absolutely necessary in defence of persons from unlawful violence”) even to situations in which people killed by the State were in fact terrorists (e.g., McCann), which is not the case with the boat strikes in Operation Southern Spear.

It is noteworthy that there is both international law and extensive State practice regarding the interdiction of drug trafficking at sea. For instance, Article 108 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea obligates States to cooperate in the suppression of illicit drug trafficking at sea, whereas Article 110 allows for the boarding of ships that are “without nationality,” as is likely to have been the case in these operations. Although the United States is not a Party to the Convention, it has often cooperated with other States in maritime drug interdiction and recognizes Article 110 as reflecting customary law. Moreover, Article 17 of the Narcotics Suppression Convention, to which the United States is Party, provides well-established procedures for the interdiction of suspected drug smuggling. Nevertheless, it cautions that “the Parties concerned shall take due account of the need not to endanger the safety of life at sea.” The point is that there is a robust international law framework for interdicting drugs at sea in place, and it does not include the use of lethal force. The United States has long been a key player in conducting these operations, often in cooperation with partners.

The U.S. Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations provides detailed guidance on how force may be used when conducting maritime counterdrug operations. For example, it sets out when the use of warning shots and disabling fire is appropriate. However, the guidance is clear that the sole basis for employing force against individuals or vessels at the lethal level is the “commander’s inherent authority and obligation to use all necessary means available and take all appropriate action in self-defense of the commander’s unit and other U.S. forces in the vicinity” (ch. 3).

In this regard, the Commander’s Handbook emphasizes(§ 4.4.1.2) that in maritime law enforcement (MLE) operations, which exclude operations during armed conflict, the Standing Rules on the Use of Force (SRUF) apply. According to the SRUF,

Normally, force is to be used only as a last resort, and the force used should be the minimum necessary. The use of force must be reasonable in intensity, duration and magnitude based on the totality of circumstances to counter the threat. If force is required, non-deadly force is authorized and may be used to control a situation and accomplish the mission, or to provide self-defense of DOD forces, defense of non-DoD persons in the vicinity if directly related to the assigned mission, or in defense of the protected property, when doing so is reasonable under the circumstances.

As the discussion illustrates, the applicable law is simple. Because there is no armed conflict, international human rights law governs the U.S. operations. The law does not allow for the use of deadly force except in situations where it is employed to safeguard life. Moreover, as counterdrug operations, there is no legal basis for using deadly force during them except in situations of defense of self or others. On the contrary, there are international agreements governing how such operations must be conducted, as well as clear guidance to U.S. forces on the use of force during them. These strikes conducted to date are clear violations of U.S. obligations under international human rights law (and may also amount to crimes, including murder, by some of those involved under the domestic law of States having jurisdiction over the offenses).

The Inapplicable Law on Targeting in These Operations: the Law of Armed Conflict

As explained above, the United States is not mounting these operations during an armed conflict, yet the administration continues to claim involvement in a NIAC. It would be difficult to accept that the government lawyers providing advice on these operations simply do not understand the law that applies, since the legal criteria for triggering a NIAC are uncontroversial, relatively straightforward, long settled in the executive branch (including DoD), and clearly not satisfied in these circumstances.

It is more likely that the United States is seeking to take advantage of the fact that targeting during an armed conflict is more permissive, and have for that reason attempted to create a legal theory that would purport to justify the targeting program that began on Sept. 2. Notably, targeting based solely on an individual’s status is sometimes permissible in a NIAC, whereas outside armed conflict, lethal force may be employed, as explained above, only against an individual based on that person’s conduct, specifically conduct posing a threat to life. Since it is self-evident that no one aboard any of the boats being struck presents an imminent threat to anyone, the administration is likely trying to get around that fact by asserting a right to engage in NIAC status-based targeting. But that attempt does not work: neither the people aboard the boats nor the boats themselves would be lawful targets even if there were an armed conflict, which we emphasize, there is not.

During a NIAC, there are three categories of people that a State’s armed forces may attack, including by lethal means. Not only may these individuals be killed, but harm to them does not factor into the LOAC proportionality analysis or the requirement to take precautions in attack to minimize any harm to civilians. The sole exception is when they are hors de combat due to capture, wounds, or being shipwrecked. The last category may seem relevant based on accounts of the Sept. 2 re-attack that killed two survivors, but that issue would only come into play if they were targetable in the first place. They were not.

Members of dissident armed forces: The first category of targetable persons during a NIAC consists of “dissident armed forces,” that is, units of the armed forces that have turned their guns on the government. This category is obviously irrelevant in the current circumstances.

Members of an organized armed group: The second category consists of members of an organized armed group. As noted in the DoD Law of War Manual, “members of hostile, non-State armed groups may be made the object of attack unless they are placed hors de combat” (§ 5.8.2.1). Yet, as explained in detail above, almost none of the cartels against which the United States is using force qualify as an OAG in the LOAC sense. They are not organized to engage in military-like operations, are not armed to do so, and have conducted no armed operations against U.S. forces. On the contrary, their organization and activities are those of a purely criminal organization, which at times engages in violence, but not to fight against the United States in any systemic way. This being so, its members are not subject to status-based targeting based on OAG membership. The few cartels or criminal groups that do arguably qualify as OAGs based on the intensity and nature of the hostilities they engage in against the State concerned, such as ELN in Colombia or Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación and the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. But they are not mounting armed operations against the United States.

We note that at times there are groups that have sub-components that are organized to engage in systemic violence against a State. The paradigmatic example is Hamas, which performed governmental functions in Gaza, but also has an armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, dedicated to conducting military operations against Israel. In that case, Hamas did not qualify as an OAG, but the al-Qassam Brigades did, and its members were subject to being targeted by Israel. However, none of the groups targeted by the United States has an armed wing, the mission of which is to conduct hostilities against the United States, whatever the reason for doing so.

Accordingly, no one aboard the boats is targetable as an OAG member.

Directly participating in hostilities: This leaves the final category, individuals who are directly participating in the hostilities. Under treaty law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflict, such individuals may be attacked in certain circumstances (AP I, art. 51(3); AP II, art. 13(3)). Although the United States is not a Party to the relevant treaties, it recognizes that their provisions on direct participation generally reflect customary law. Extracts from the DoD Law of War Manual are instructive in understanding the U.S. view of direct participation.

At a minimum, taking a direct part in hostilities includes actions that are, by their nature and purpose, intended to cause actual harm to the enemy. Taking a direct part in hostilities extends beyond merely engaging in combat and also includes certain acts that are an integral part of combat operations or that effectively and substantially contribute to an adversary’s ability to conduct or sustain combat operations § 5.8.3).

The emphasis is on a direct nexus to “combat” operations. This is clear from the examples the Manual provides of acts qualifying as direct participation. Of direct relevance in this case is the example the Manual provides on “delivering ammunition to the front lines” (5.8.3.1). This example served as the basis for extensive discussion during an ICRC expert project that led to the publication of its Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities (prior to issuance of the Law of War Manual). One of us was a member of the international group and can attest that the following analysis was unanimously acceptable to the members.

The delivery by a civilian truck driver of ammunition to an active firing position at the front line would almost certainly have to be regarded as an integral part of ongoing combat operations and, therefore, as direct participation in hostilities. Transporting ammunition from a factory to a port for further shipping to a storehouse in a conflict zone, on the other hand, is too remote from the use of that ammunition in specific military operations to cause the ensuing harm directly. Although the ammunition truck remains a legitimate military objective, the driving of the truck would not amount to direct participation in hostilities and would not deprive a civilian driver of protection against direct attack. Therefore, any direct attack against the truck would have to take the probable death of the civilian driver into account in the proportionality assessment.

The basis for the conclusion was that the causal connection between the act (transporting ammunition) and the harm caused (use of the ammunition against the enemy) was too attenuated to amount to direct participation, except in cases of delivery to the front. The experts agreed that transportation other than to those who would use the ammunition was “indirect” rather than “direct,” pointing in particular to the lack of temporal or geographic proximity. It was this analysis that led to the “to the front lines” caveat in the Manual.

Putting aside the self-evident fact that delivering drugs to be sold cannot be characterized as “hostilities,” the transportation of drugs to be distributed to unknown buyers at some point in the future is even more attenuated than the transportation of the ammunition to ports to be carried to known units near the front.

Applying the DoD standard (which, we emphasize, does not apply outside of armed conflict), individuals transporting drugs aboard a boat to be sold at an onward destination are not “directly participating in hostilities.” That means they are not targetable on that basis either.

Finally, we discuss below the insurmountable problems in any attempt to consider the drugs or boats targetable as “war-sustaining” objects. But assuming, even in the best case scenario for the administration, that they are targetable war-sustaining objects (again a truly insurmountable “if”), that would mean there is even greater reason civilians involved in transporting such objects can never be considered direct participants in hostilities. If a civilian driving an ammunition truck away from the frontlines of a real war cannot be considered a direct participant in hostilities (consensus view discussed above), a civilian operating a vehicle (here a boat) involved in war-sustaining (revenue generating) activities surely cannot be. Indeed, the Department of Defense, despite external political pressure, concluded that the truck drivers bringing the Islamic State’s oil to market were civilians (see Department of Defense General Counsel Remarks 2016).

Drug boats as military objectives? This leaves open only the possibility that the people on the boats may lawfully be harmed in an attack if the drug boats constitute military objectives subject to attack under the law of armed conflict (which we remind readers does not apply in any event). As accurately explained in the DoD Law of War Manual, reciting well-accepted treaty and customary law, military objectives “include any object which by its nature, location, purpose or use makes an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage” (§ 5.6.3). Whether the boats qualify as military objectives depends, therefore, on whether their use at the time of the strike contributed to the gang or cartel’s “military action” and whether destroying the boats would result in a “definite military advantage” for the United States.

By the prevailing view, drug-related facilities, equipment, and assets do not qualify as military objectives. Indeed, precisely this issue became contentious among NATO forces during International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operations in Afghanistan. The American NATO Supreme Allied Commander and Secretary of Defense argued that drug producers/traffickers and narcotics-related assets generating funds for the insurgency could be attacked. The German Commander of Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum and the ISAF Commander, an American, countered that this position violated international law. The latter position prevailed within NATO, and an accommodation was reached in 2008 whereby the drug assets related to the insurgency could be destroyed in support of Afghanistan’s counter-drug law enforcement effort.

Since no gangs or cartels are involved in military action against the United States, and the United States gets no military advantage from destroying them, boats used to transport drugs, by the plain text of the rule, cannot qualify as military objectives subject to attack. This leaves only the possibility of the drugs themselves. In other words, if the law of armed conflict applied, which it does not, could the boats be lawfully attacked, subject to other targeting rules like proportionality and precautions in attack, because there were targetable drugs on board?

Drugs as “war-sustaining” objects? The only conceivable basis for the argument that the drugs were targetable was that they were so-called “war-sustaining” objects. Although it is not the prevailing view among States, the United States has long asserted that war-sustaining entities are legitimate military objectives, a position with which one of us agrees (DoD Law of War Manual, § 5.6.8). A war-sustaining entity “indirectly, but effectively supports and sustains the belligerents’ warfighting capability,” such as “imports of raw materials used for the production of armaments and exports of products the proceeds of which are used by the belligerent to purchase arms and armaments” (Commander’s Handbook, § 7.4).

This position is reported to be relied on in the OLC memo purporting to justify the boat strikes, so we will unpack why the “war-sustaining” objects theory fails in this context.

Even accepting the U.S. position that war-sustaining objects are targetable, the boats and their drugs would not qualify, because there is no war to sustain. Unlike the drugs in the Afghanistan case, or the export products in the Commander’s Handbook example, the proceeds of the sale of cartel or criminal gang-supplied drugs are not being used to sustain hostilities against the United States (or anyone else, with the limited exception explained below). They are not being used, for instance, to purchase arms that will be used against U.S. forces or pay the salaries of an armed wing that is conducting hostilities against them.

Assuming war-sustaining objects can be lawfully targeted, the argument that drugs are such objects might work in the case of cartels that qualify as OAGs engaged in hostilities against the State in which they operate, if drug sales do in fact fund their military operations. But taking the Sept. 2 strike against Tren de Aragua, for example, there is no gang or cartel “war effort” to sustain in the first place. This would be the case for nearly all of the cartels and criminal groups reportedly being targeted in the U.S. campaign. (We should note that even for those few cartels that do qualify as OAGs, and that are involved in conflict against a State in which they operate, the United States would not have a legal basis to enter that conflict absent a request from that State to do so. This is plainly not the case here – the relevant States in the region have strenuously objected to the U.S. campaign, several publicly calling for it to be stopped, or calling the killings “murder.”)

Simply put, absent actual military operations against the United States on the part of the group concerned, the “war-sustaining” justification for striking boats transporting drugs falls apart, even under the inapplicable law of armed conflict that the administration purports to operate under.

Concluding Thoughts

Despite the fervent debates about whether the operations as a whole, or individual strikes, violated the law of armed conflict, and may even have been war crimes by those involved, the correct legal regime governing them is international human rights law. That law imposes a stringent necessity standard according to which lethal force is lawful only in the face of an imminent threat to life, and then only in the absence of other means of responding to that threat in the circumstances. None of those aboard the boats that have been struck posed an imminent deadly threat to anyone.

But even if the law of armed conflict applied, and it decidedly does not, neither those on the boats nor the drugs and the boats in which they were transported qualified as lawful military objectives under that body of law. The gangs or cartels do not qualify as organized armed groups; thus, their members are not subject to status-based targeting. Those aboard the boats are not targetable as direct participants in the hostilities, because they are merely transporting the drugs, and not in temporal or geographical proximity to any location where they might somehow contribute to the cartel’s or gang’s purported “combat.” And finally, the drugs do not qualify as military objectives by even the controversial war-sustaining approach because there are no hostilities against the United States by the gangs or cartels involved to sustain.

Taken together, there is no justification under either international human rights law, the correct legal framework, or the law of armed conflict, the wrong one, to target the boats or the people on board. The administration’s justification for conducting the strikes is a house of cards, unable to withstand scrutiny.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gerald-ford-striker-group.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 12:57:44.281032

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

Even some in the GOP have questioned Trump’s decision given his administration’s very public campaign to target drug-carrying vessels with military strikes.

“The pardons Trump is handing out are a huge, growing scandal that not enough people are talking about,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said this week. “This is a money making operation – for Trump, his family, his crypto pals, and the Trump-affiliated lobbyists and grifters who the pardon seekers pay.”

Trump has been defiant in the face of criticism and questions about his decisions on whom to pardon. The president and White House officials have frequently defended Trump’s pardon decisions by arguing that they are a counter to what they view as a weaponized Justice Department during the Biden administration.

“President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals. And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers– and that’s not to mention the proactive pardons he ‘signed’ for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

Trump’s pardons reentered the spotlight this week when he pardoned Hernández, who was convicted in June 2024 of conspiring to distribute more than 400 tons of cocaine and accepting millions of dollars in bribes from traffickers to facilitate the shipment of those drugs.

“He was the president, and they had some drugs being sold in their country, and because he was the president they went after him. That was a Biden horrible witch hunt,” Trump said of his decision.

The pardon drew rebukes from both sides of the aisle, including from lawmakers who questioned whether it sent contradictory messages given the Trump administration’s military campaign targeting alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

“I hate it. It’s a horrible message,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters this week. “It’s confusing to say on the one hand we should potentially even consider invading Venezuela for drug traffick[ing], and on the other hand let somebody go.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued Trump’s pardon was not at odds with his broader agenda.

“I think that President Trump has been quite clear in his defense of the United States homeland to stop these illegal narcotics from coming to our borders, whether that’s by land or by sea,” Leavitt told reporters. “And he’s also made it quite clear that he wants to correct the wrongs of the weaponized Justice Department under the previous administration.”

It was the latest instance of the White House going on defense over Trump’s use of his pardon power in recent weeks.

Trump drew scrutiny for his pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and later attempted to downplay the move by suggesting he did not know who Zhao was when he issued the pardon.

As was the case with the Hernández pardon, the White House at the time argued that Trump was correcting a case of over-prosecution during the Biden administration.

The White House made the same argument this week when asked about Trump’s decision to commute the sentence of David Gentile, a former private equity executive who had been convicted of fraud in 2024.

“At trial, the government was unable to tie any supposedly fraudulent representations to Mr. Gentile,” Leavitt said at a press briefing. “This is another example that has been brought to the president’s attention of the weaponization of justice from the previous administration, and therefore, he signed this commutation.”

Trump again pointed to allegations that the Biden administration acted unfairly when he announced this week that he was pardoning Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and his wife, Imelda, who last year were indicted on charges related to allegedly accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes and laundering the funds.

While some pundits questioned whether the pardon could help the Texas Democrat keep his seat in a tough election next year, Trump made clear his motivation was undoing what he saw as a politically motivated indictment brought by the Biden administration

“Sleepy Joe went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman’s wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Cuellar became the latest lawmaker who had faced charges related to bribery, fraud or corruption to receive a pardon.

The president earlier this year commuted the sentence of George Santos, the former Republican representative who was expelled from the House and who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He also pardoned former Republican Rep. Michael Grimm (N.Y.), who had been convicted of felony tax fraud. And Trump pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat who has become an outspoken Trump supporter after serving time in prison on corruption charges.

A White House official pointed to comments Leavitt made last month, when she told reporters the administration treats pardons “with the utmost seriousness.”

“He’s the ultimate, final decision maker,” Leavitt said of Trump. “And he was very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice, and were over prosecuted by a weaponized DOJ.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/trumpdonald_111325gn17_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-07 12:57:40.561937

The United States and Iran do not have direct diplomatic relations, and most interactions are conducted through intermediary parties. However, the transfer of deportees involved an unusual amount of coordination between Washington and Tehran.

Accusations Against Iran

Washington and its Western allies have slapped severe financial sanctions on Tehran, accusing it of attempting to develop a nuclear weapon and of supporting extremist violence in the Middle East. Iran denies the allegations.

Human rights advocates have consistently urged the United States not to expel individuals to countries with poor rights records. Iran’s record, they say, is among the worst.

The Islamic republic continues widespread persecution of political dissidents, activists, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals.

In recent years, significant numbers of Iranians have joined larger migrant flows through Central America into the United States, citing those same risks as reasons for seeking asylum.

US authorities in September said the government had identified some 400 Iranians to be deported.

Following the first deportations, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was quoted by AP as saying: “The Trump Administration is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of illegal aliens in history, using all the tools at our disposal.”

The United States in early December paused all pending immigration application for nationals from 19 countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.

The move followed the attack on two US National Guard members three blocks from the White House by a suspect authorities say entered the United States from Afghanistan in 2021.

The man was charged with murder after one of the National Guard members died. The other victim remains hospitalized.

'This program is not going to be as easy as the administration initially claimed,' says one expert in immigration law

The Trump administration's ""gold card"" immigration program is due to be implemented by Dec. 18, according to an executive order issued in September.

President Donald Trump proposed a new ""gold card"" visa program in February, then in September ordered his administration to ""take all necessary and appropriate steps"" by Dec. 18 to implement the program, which aims to attract well-off immigrants who would pay $1 million each to the U.S. government for immigration status.

With Trump's deadline approaching, is the U.S. now close to seeing a big influx of gold-card holders - wealthy masses yearning to breathe free, so to speak?

Not exactly, as uptake may take time, according to immigration experts.

""I think there will be relatively few applicants at the beginning, but maybe in a year or two, we'll start to see an uptick in applications,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in immigration law who retired last year after decades as a professor of immigration practice at Cornell Law School.

Another immigration program, known as the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, launched in 1990 and only started to take off a couple of years later after Congress made changes to it, he noted.

It's a ""good first step"" that the administration has released a draft form for the gold card, but the form reveals details that indicate ""that this program is not going to be as easy as the administration initially claimed,"" Yale-Loehr said.

Those details include a $15,000 application fee; a required gift of $1 million per person, rather than just $1 million per family; a vetting process that looks at whether applicants got their $1 million in a valid way; and the program's reliance on existing green-card categories known as EB-1 and EB-2, ""each of which have backlogs for certain countries,"" according to Yale-Loehr. That reliance on existing categories likely means Congress won't need to pass a new law, but the gold card is going to have to be codified in new regulations eventually, he added.

David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said he has doubts that the Trump administration has the authority to do what it's doing without action by Congress, and he also has concerns about the gold card's high price. Those issues could lead to low demand for the new program in the weeks and months ahead, according to Bier.

""People are not going to want to pay for something that might be suddenly deemed unlawful - and then what's the process to get your money back?"" he told MarketWatch. Bier said it's a good idea in theory to let people simply pay a fee to immigrate to the U.S., given how difficult it is to immigrate legally, but added that the gold card's price tag of $1 million is probably too high.

Price cut from $5 million

In February, the president called for a ""Trump gold card"" program that would provide foreign investors who put up at least $5 million with U.S. residency and a path to citizenship. Then, in his Sept. 19 executive order, the president cut the required amount for the gold-card holder's ""unrestricted gift"" to the U.S. Commerce Department to $1 million, or $2 million if a corporation or other entity is donating on behalf of an individual.

In June, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said around 70,000 people had signed up at that point on the administration's waitlist for gold cards.

So-called golden visa programs exist in many parts of the globe - in the Caribbean, the Middle East, throughout Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Australia and Hong Kong, as MarketWatch has reported. The programs often call for foreign investors to invest capital into a specific fund that a nation sets up to pay for some objective, and they're rewarded with legal residency and sometimes even citizenship in that country. One key downside is the programs tend to spark concerns that investors are helping to drive up home prices.

Yale-Loehr said there's likely to be criticism of Trump's gold card from either end of the political spectrum. ""Progressive will say people should not be allowed to buy their way into the United States; MAGA types will say we shouldn't be encouraging any type of legal immigration,"" he said.

Single individuals could be most likely to apply for the gold card rather than investors with families, since unlike the long-running EB-5 program, the new card doesn't require a plan to create at least 10 U.S. jobs, according to Yale-Loehr. ""But if I'm a family of four and I want to immigrate to the U.S., that's $4 million, so that gets a little pricey,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the EB-5 program offers visas for a family in exchange for an investment of at least $800,000. The administration has indicated it would like to get rid of EB-5 visas, but experts say that only Congress could do that.

Will the administration actually meet Trump's deadline of Dec. 18 for implementing the gold card?

""They can always put out a form and ask for money,"" Cato's Bier said. ""Putting out a form isn't hard, so if the president wants to get it done, I think it will happen.""

The White House didn't respond to MarketWatch's request for comment.

Trump's September executive order said the steps that must be completed by Dec. 18 include specifying the date on which individuals or sponsors can start giving their $1 million or $2 million gifts.

She told the Post she has been unable to speak with her son since her arrest.","The mother of Karoline Leavitt’s nephew has spoken out against how the administration has characterized her and her relationship to the White House press secretary, saying ""why they’re creating this narrative is beyond my wildest imagination.”

In an interview with The Washington Post, published Sunday, Bruna Ferreira called the White House’s depiction of her as an absentee mother “disgusting,” and said she ""made a mistake"" in trusting Leavitt to be her son's godmother.

Newsweek contacted the White House via email on Sunday for comment.

Why It Matters

Ferreira’s arrest drew national attention due to her association with Leavitt, a leading figure within the administration and among the most ardent champions of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Since that time, the White House has depicted the 33-year-old—her relationship with her son, the press secretary and the broader Leavitt family—in a way that sharply contrasts with her own account.

What To Know

Ferreira, who has a child with the White House press secretary's older brother, Michael Leavitt, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on November 12. Ferreira is a Brazilian national who traveled to the U.S. legally at the age of 6 and previously held Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status.

The Post reported that she was detained for remaining in the U.S. unlawfully after overstaying her visa as a child.

In a recent interview with Newsweek, Ferreira’s attorney Todd Pomerleau said that his client has no criminal record and maintains close ties to the Leavitt family, contrary to the administration’s portrayal.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously told Newsweek that Ferreira had an arrest for battery on her record, and in a statement to CNN, the DHS called Ferreira a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil.”

White House press secretary Leavitt has said that anyone living in the country illegally will be considered a ""criminal,"" subjecting nonviolent migrants without legal status to the immigration raids that have swept the country since Trump returned to office.

Ferreira’s attorney told the Post that any reference to a criminal record could refer to a 2008 incident when she, then 16, was involved in a fight. However, Pomerleau said his that client was never arrested and that the case was dismissed.

Ferreira also rejected any claim that she does not have a close relationship with the White House press secretary herself.

“I asked Karoline to be godmother over my only sister,” she told the Post in a video interview from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana, where she is currently being held. “I made a mistake there.”

What People Are Saying

Michael Leavitt told The Washington Post via text that he “had no involvement” in Ferreira’s arrest and added: “I want my son to have a relationship with his mother as I always have shown that.”

Ferreira’s attorney Todd Pomerleau told Newsweek in a recent interview: “She doesn't have any bad blood with any of the Leavitts. She wasn't in any battle with the Leavitts. This isn't a War of the Roses. She was engaged to one of them, and it didn't work out like countless other relationships in the world. They were two young people. They loved each other. They had a child together. They were engaged, and then their relationship just ended like so many others.""

The anti-ICE nativity scene was placed outside the St. Susanna Catholic church in Dedham, Mass., a suburb outside Boston.

The display also had a sign with the contact number for a group that monitors immigration operations.

The Archdiocese of Boston blasted the display as “divisive political messaging” and called for it to be removed, saying it violated Catholic doctrine.

“The display should be removed, and the manger restored to its proper sacred purpose,” the Archdiocese said in a statement.

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging, the Church’s norms prohibit the use of sacred objects for any purpose other than the devotion of God’s people,” the spokesman said.

Acting ICE director Todd Lyons slammed Josoma as an “activist reverend,” and said it could lead to assaults on ICE officers.

“The actions of the activist reverend, Stephen Josoma, are absolutely abhorrent and add to a dangerous narrative responsible for a more than 1,150% increase in assaults on ICE officers,” Lyons told Fox News Digital.

There have been over 250 attacks on ICE officers this year, along with an increase in doxxing, stalking and death threats.

Father Stephen Josoma, the pastor at St. Susanna’s, told Fox News Digital that the purpose of the nativity scene is to “try to see what would it be like if Christ was born into the context of the world today.”

Josoma defended the display as “religious art” and said it was intended to provoke “emotions in people.”

“It’s supposed to affect people deeply, it’s supposed to move people, it’s supposed to change people, so, if this evokes a strong reaction, it’s maybe good to take a look at that,” Josoma said.

This is not the first controversial nativity scene the pastor has erected in front of his church. In 2018, he placed Baby Jesus in a cage away from his parents to protest Trump’s immigration policies.

More than 5,400 children were separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border during Trump’s first term.

The pastor has also erected nativity scenes that touched on gun control and climate change in years past.

“[Josoma] has become infamous for using his pulpit to advance his activist agenda and has now caught the attention of the Archdiocese of Boston, which has publicly condemned his most recent political stunt… I applaud the Catholic Church and the Archdiocese for taking a stand against such a dangerous and extremist narrative,” Lyons said.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/nativity-scene.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765064017&w=1200,N,,2025-12-07 09:56:31.745432

Protesters at the scene say the standoff began shortly before 10 a.m. in the 1600 block of Maple Lane when someone being pursued by federal agents ran into a second-floor unit of an apartment complex and was pushed onto the balcony by residents inside.

Around 3 p.m., agents could be seen escorting the man from the second floor of the complex.

Elgin-born state Sen. Cristina Castro was among those present Saturday afternoon as agents detained the man.

“Some folks were throwing him blankets and food, and ICE had all this region surrounded [and] eventually broke in, grabbed him, and yanked him out,” Castro said.

Several dozen protesters were in the neighborhood providing supplies to the man as he stayed on the balcony, witnesses said.

Several canisters of tear gas were deployed by agents and some protesters threw snow and water bottles back at agents.

Mikey Calderon has lived in the area where the standoff occurred for five years and woke up to the sound of cars with their horns blaring down the street.

He said tear gas was deployed earlier in the day because of an altercation between a protester and an agent, but he chose to stick around to help support his community.

“It’s kind of amazing to see the community come together and try to minimize the situation and see what we could do to make a difference,” Calderon, 20, said.

“It’s heartbreaking,” Calderon added. “There’s other ways to go about it than to tear these families apart by force.”

Castro, the state lawmaker, urged onlookers to continue to record federal agents as they conducted raids.

“They are obviously facing their own challenges in courts, but they still want to antagonize people, antagonize my city,” Castro said.

“A lot of people who live in this city, live in this city because they want to live the American Dream,” Castro added.

She says that federal agents are “striking fear in this community, and it’s unacceptable.”

With the possibility of agents returning at greater strength in the spring, Castro recommends staying vigilant but to also check in on neighbors.

One of them, Sarah Beckstrom, has died. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who worked for the CIA before the Taliban took control of his country. He was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 and granted asylum in April 2025.

“The animal,” President Trump declared, “will pay a very steep price.”

He subsequently ordered the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Service and other relevant federal agencies to “re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden”; suspend all pending Green Card requests from Afghans; “permanently pause” migration from all Third World nations; and denaturalize immigrants currently living in the U.S. “who undermine domestic tranquility” or “don’t add benefit our country.” Trump also claimed that immigration posed “the single greatest national security threat to our nation”; and that “only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”

To justify his policies, Trump is relying on a variant of an old fallacy. Instead of punishing individuals because they are members of certain organizations or nationalities, Trump’s version of guilt by association punishes an entire group of people because of the behavior of just one of its members.

Impervious to logic, evidence and the principles of individual rights and responsibilities enshrined in American law and morality, guilt by association is almost infinitely expandable. Trump is ramping up the template he used for the murder of University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley in 2024, when he promised to end the “staggering increase in violent crime” committed by immigrants who are “poisoning the blood of our country.”

He is considering deporting Lakanwal’s wife and family. After telling reporters there were “a lot of problems with Afghans,” the president then declared that Somalis were taking over the state of Minnesota. Asked what this claim had to do with the shooting in D.C, he responded, “Ah, nothing, but Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Meanwhile, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a staunch Trump ally, endorsed “deportation of any Islamist.” And Kristi Noem, Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security, advocated “a total travel ban on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches and entitlement junkies.”

Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that a migrant crime wave does not exist in the U.S. In 2017, for example, Afghan immigrants age 18-54 were less than one-tenth as likely to be incarcerated as native-born Americans. And Trump’s 2017 travel ban on refugees from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Syria had no effect on crime rates.

Between 2017 and 2022, when the immigrant population grew by 1.7 million, total crime nationwide dropped by 15.3 percent. Immigrants were less likely than native-born citizens to be arrested for felonies or incarcerated. Violent crime in cities where the immigrant population grew actually went down, and undocumented immigrants were half as likely to go to jail for violent and property crimes than individuals who were born in the United States.

Given Trump’s claim that immigrants have “wrecked the standard of living,” it’s worth noting that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that from 2024-2034, the surge in immigration during previous decades will increase Gross Domestic Product by $8.9 trillion, raise tax revenues by $1.2 trillion and reduce the deficit by $900 billion.

Afghan immigrants alluded to this evidence indirectly as they tried to stop the administration from imposing collective punishment on them. The Afghan Community Coalition of the United States expressed horror at the D.C. shootings and sympathy for the victims. One Afghan indicated that he and his fellow immigrants are “hardworking, tax paying members of society.” Another, also speaking anonymously, emphasized that the suspect acted “without any support, participation, and cooperation of others,” and “should not be counted for [against] the whole community.”

Recent polls indicate a substantial shift in public opinion about immigrants and immigration policies. Fifty-four percent of Americans still support Trump’s handling of border security, and a substantial majority agree that immigrants who are here illegally should be deported. But only 45 percent of Americans approve of the president’s handling of immigration. Substantial majorities oppose deporting children who enter the U.S. illegally and using the military to find and detain undocumented immigrants. A huge majority is against deporting immigrants who came here legally.

A majority of Americans believe that US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wrongfully arrests, deports and uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens and immigrants. More poll respondents approve than disapprove of organized protests against ICE.

Thirty years ago, only 31 percent of Americans indicated that immigration strengthens the country. Fifty-six percent now think it does, and 58 percent say legal immigration contributes to economic growth. More Americans favor increasing legal immigration than reducing it.

Since he became a candidate for president in 2015, immigration has been Trump’s signature issue. Today, it could become his Achilles’ heel.

Biden Jr.’s actions on immigration found that he and his closest advisers ignored early warnings about a border surge and rejected policies that might have eased a crisis that engulfed much of the Biden administration.

Their decisions created an opening for Donald J. Trump to win back the White House and adopt a more aggressive approach to immigration, The Times review found.

In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden blamed Republicans for blocking efforts to address the border crisis. “When it became clear Congress wouldn’t act, Biden took decisive action on his own,” the statement said.

Before Mr. Biden took office, advisers warned that his approach could lead to “chaos” at the border.

In August 2020, while Mr. Biden was still campaigning against President Trump in part by promising a more welcoming approach on immigration, his policy advisers wrote a memo warning that his proposals, coupled with pent-up migration demand under the Trump administration and economic hardship from the Covid pandemic, could lead to a huge increase in border crossings.

“A potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities and imperil the agenda of the new administration,” the advisers wrote. They suggested a range of steps Mr. Biden could take as president to head off that surge, such as making it easier to quickly reject asylum claims. Mr. Biden and his inner circle ignored that advice.

The Biden team misread the politics of immigration.

As border encounters surged at the start of the Biden administration, policy advisers continued to push the White House to focus more on border enforcement and deterring migrants.

But top aides to Mr. Biden worried that doing so would alienate Latino and progressive voters, former administration officials said. And they believed that the crisis was not a significant concern for people outside of border states. Both assumptions proved to be wrong.

“They were a little too sensitive to criticisms from the left,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who helped shape immigration policy in the Obama administration and oversaw domestic and economic policy for the Biden transition team.

The White House rejected pleas to help Democratic cities cope with migrants.

Soon after Mr. Biden took office, as border crossings began to spike, policy advisers in his administration argued for the federal government to transport migrants to their final destinations, in coordination with local officials. Proponents said that such a plan would relieve pressure on border communities, as well as northern cities struggling to manage the flow of migrants.

The idea was similar to the busing campaign that Mr. Abbott started in 2022, but with the goal of helping, not straining, cities that were receiving migrants.

Mr. Biden’s top aides rejected the proposal, saying that it would make the problem worse by encouraging more migrants. Other aides argued that Congress had not authorized it. In hindsight, such an effort “would have made a profound difference,” according to Mike Johnston, the Democratic mayor of Denver.

Mr. Biden kept waiting for Congress to act — a strategy that failed.

Mr. Biden considered acting unilaterally to reduce border crossings as early as 2022, according to Ron Klain, his chief of staff at the time. But he held off because Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, at the time a Democrat, was in talks with Republicans about an immigration bill. Those discussions did not lead to an agreement.

In 2023, lawmakers restarted talks about a border bill. The deliberations again collapsed. Senator James Lankford, the lead Republican negotiator, blamed the Biden administration for dragging its feet. “We don’t want our fingerprints on these negotiations,” Mr. Lankford recalled the White House telling him.

That delayed the deal until after Mr. Trump had secured his party’s presidential nomination, Mr. Lankford said. If the talks had wrapped up sooner, he said, Mr. Trump might not have had the clout to torpedo the deal.

After the Senate talks failed, Mr. Biden used his authority to close the border without Congress. His efforts succeeded at reducing border crossings. But with just five months left before the election, his actions came too late to change voters’ minds about Democrats being the party of open borders.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/00dc-biden-immig-takeaways-01-lbvt/00dc-biden-immig-takeaways-01-lbvt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:25.621004

How Biden Ignored Warnings and Lost Americans’ Faith in Immigration

The Democratic president and his top advisers rejected recommendations that could have eased the border crisis that helped return Donald Trump to the White House.

In the weeks after Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president, advisers delivered a warning: His approach to immigration could prove disastrous.

Mr. Biden had pledged to treat unauthorized immigrants more humanely than President Donald J. Trump, who generated widespread backlash by separating migrant children from their parents.

But Mr. Biden was now president-elect, and his positions threatened to drastically increase border crossings, experts advising his transition team warned in a Zoom briefing in the final weeks of 2020, according to people with direct knowledge of that briefing. That jump, they said, could provoke a political crisis.

“Chaos” was the word the advisers had used in a memo during the campaign.

They offered a range of options to avert that crisis, by better deterring migrants. Mr. Biden seemed to grasp the risk. But he and his top aides failed to act on those recommendations.

The warnings came true, and then some. After Mr. Biden became president, migrant encounters at the southern border quickly doubled, then kept rising. New arrivals overwhelmed border stations, then border towns, and eventually major cities like New York and Denver.

Anger over illegal migration helped return Mr. Trump to the presidency, and he has enacted even more aggressive policies than those Mr. Biden first campaigned against. Mr. Trump has drawn outrage from Democrats by sending masked agents to target immigrants, often aided by National Guard soldiers.

But a New York Times examination of Mr. Biden’s record found that he and his closest advisers repeatedly rebuffed recommendations that could have addressed the border crisis faster, and eased what became a potent issue for Mr. Trump as he sought to return to the White House and justify the aggressive tactics roiling American cities today.

Former Biden administration officials told The Times that Mr. Biden and his circle of close confidants — including Ron Klain, who was chief of staff during the president’s first two years, Mike Donilon, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon and Anita Dunn — made two crucial errors.

First, they underestimated the scale of migration that was coming. Second, they failed to appreciate the political reaction to that migration — believing that stronger enforcement would alienate Latino and progressive voters, and also that a border surge would not be an important issue to most voters. Those calculations would later prove to be mistaken, with many voters, including Latinos, citing immigration as a reason for supporting Mr. Trump in 2024.

“Everybody was reacting to the excesses of the Trump administration,” said Cecilia Muñoz, who helped shape immigration policy in the Obama administration and oversaw domestic and economic policy for the Biden transition team.

Yet as public concern over border security grew, partly in response to Mr. Biden’s own actions, his administration proved catastrophically slow to change course, former aides said. The president and his closest aides treated immigration as a distraction from other issues, such as the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.

Aides stressed that the Biden administration faced a steep challenge addressing a border crisis while adhering to outdated immigration laws. But they lamented that Mr. Biden never articulated a clear vision or pushed his cabinet secretaries to coordinate their efforts on immigration in the way that Mr. Trump has.

Mr. Biden created new legal pathways for migration to ease pressure at the border, under which more than one million people were allowed into the United States, fueling public resistance. And he failed to convince Congress to change immigration laws, dragging his feet on a crucial Senate border deal, according to the lead Republican negotiator, who said the effort might have otherwise succeeded.

The shooting in Washington last month that killed one National Guard soldier and left another critically injured has renewed scrutiny of Mr. Biden’s immigration programs. The suspect arrived through Operation Allies Welcome, which offered entry to Afghans fleeing the Taliban in 2021.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Biden declined to make him available for an interview. She provided a statement that blamed Republicans for blocking additional funding for hiring more border agents, deploying more security technology and processing immigration cases more quickly. The statement also blamed Republicans for walking away from the proposed border bill “because Donald Trump told them to.”

“When it became clear Congress wouldn’t act, Biden took decisive action on his own,” the statement said.

Mr. Klain defended the administration’s actions on immigration as part of a broader set of priorities.

“We came in during an economic collapse and 3,000 Americans dying each day from Covid. We focused on those first and got both turned around quickly,” he said. “We ended the cruelty of Trump’s immigration policies but hit a wall on building a sensible asylum system when Republicans blocked action on needed legislation.”

But former advisers said the problem ran deeper than Republican obstruction.

The Biden White House “had no strategy, because they had no goal,” said Scott Shuchart, who joined the administration in 2022 as a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “All they had was wishing the problem would go away so that they could focus on the things they cared about.”

Year 1: Chaos, Then Paralysis

Mr. Biden’s policy advisers sounded the alarm before he even won the election.

In August of 2020, several aides wrote a memo cautioning Mr. Biden’s inner circle that his promises — coupled with pent-up demand from the Trump years and economic hardship from Covid — could provoke a spike in border crossings.

“A potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities, and imperil the agenda of the new administration,” the advisers wrote, according to a copy of the memo viewed by The Times.

Mr. Biden was confronting challenges that had been years in the making. Migrants had increasingly turned to claiming asylum. By saying they were fleeing persecution, many had been permitted to live and work in the United States for years until their claims could be heard.

Asylum

The Refugee Act of 1980 gives people the right to request asylum in the United States because of persecution or a fear of persecution in their home country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The law gives people the ability to claim asylum when they arrive at the border or once they’re already in the country. President Trump and President Biden took steps to restrict that ability; those steps have been challenged in court.

President Trump had tried deterring asylum seekers. His administration separated children from their parents. He created the “Remain in Mexico” program, forcing asylum claimants to wait in Mexico until their cases were heard. During the pandemic, he invoked a public health rule, Title 42, to turn back migrants.

The memo from Mr. Biden’s advisers offered a range of options, including making it easier to quickly reject asylum claims; holding people in “reception centers” until their cases could be heard; transferring some migrants to other countries; and continuing to make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico, while ensuring they had access to shelter.

Title 42

Title 42 is a legal provision that lets the government block the entry of people who risk introducing a communicable disease into the country. The Trump administration began applying the rule to migrants in 2020, at the start of the Covid pandemic.

Once in office, Mr. Biden had to decide between the more permissive approach that Democrats demanded and the warnings from some policy advisers to tack to the center.

He wasted no time answering.

Soon after being sworn in, Mr. Biden issued a 100-day pause on deportations. He drastically narrowed the categories of unauthorized immigrants targeted for arrest. He directed his government to stop building the border wall, a centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s agenda. He suspended Remain in Mexico. He sent draft legislation to Congress to create a citizenship pathway for people in the country illegally. He kept Title 42 in place, but stopped using it to turn back children who crossed the border alone.

Remain in Mexico

At the beginning of 2019, the Trump administration started the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico.” Under that program, people who arrived at the border seeking asylum were given a date to appear in immigration court then sent to wait in Mexico, often for six months or longer.

The speed of Mr. Biden’s actions masked deep disagreements on his team.

Some advisers warned that he was moving too quickly. Others worried that Latino voters would object if the new president softened support for migrants.

“The president and others made a decision that he wasn’t going to lose that community,” said Roberta Jacobson, the border czar for the first three months of the administration.

Mr. Biden’s policy changes, some of which were halted by the courts, were not the only causes of that early surge. The draw of the U.S. economy, which bounced back quickly from Covid, mattered too. But the changes signaled to migrants that the border was opening again, former aides said.

The crisis foretold by Mr. Biden’s border advisers quickly emerged.

Border Patrol encounters at the Southwest Border

In January, the month Mr. Biden took office, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 75,316 encounters with migrants along the southwest border. By March, that number passed 169,000 — far higher than at any point during the Trump administration. Many arrivals were children, jammed into border stations ill-equipped to hold them.

The perception of chaos began to erode the pro-immigrant sentiment that had shaped Mr. Biden’s campaign promises. In March, 40 percent of Americans said they worried about illegal immigration “a great deal” — the highest number Gallup had registered in a decade.

Two months into his term, Mr. Biden assigned Vice President Kamala Harris with reducing illegal migration, especially from Central America, by working on the “root causes” of that migration.

Republicans labeled Ms. Harris the president’s border czar. But none of the former officials who spoke to The Times described her as a central decision maker on border policy. A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris did not respond to requests for comment.

Many former aides complained about the administration’s reluctance to push foreign governments harder to slow the movement of migrants or accept more deportation flights, as Mr. Trump has done in his second term.

Aides described Mr. Biden as having no strong positions on immigration beyond two key areas. He resisted anything that looked like Mr. Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy. And he did not want to send children back across the border.

As border crossings jumped, advisers across the administration kept offering ideas to deter migrants. But political concerns remained.

“They were a little too sensitive to criticisms from the left,” Ms. Muñoz said.

The result was paralysis. Andrea Flores was director for transborder security at the National Security Council early in the administration. Her first assignment, she said, was to help prepare a memo for Mr. Klain offering additional ideas for deterring migrants.

Officials could not agree on what options to present, she said, “so the memo died.”

Some Biden aides believed that the less the president said about immigration, the better. In June, the White House planned for Mr. Biden to give a speech on the border. Officials circulated the president’s remarks, Ms. Flores said, only to change their minds at the last minute.

Angela Kelley, who was then a senior immigration adviser at the Department of Homeland Security, described a collision between Mr. Biden’s campaign promises and “reality on the ground.”

“We didn’t really have a grip on it,” Ms. Kelley said.

The problem was about to get worse.

Year 2: The Border Moves North

One April day in 2022, a bus pulled up near the U.S. Capitol. It was carrying 12 Venezuelans, four Colombians, four Cubans and four Nicaraguans — and the start of a new phase in the immigration debate.

The bus had been chartered by the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “By busing migrants to Washington, D.C., the Biden administration will be able to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border,” Greg Abbott, the state’s Republican governor, said in a statement at the time.

The busing campaign had been under consideration since the previous summer, when local officials met with Mr. Abbott in the small border town of Del Rio seeking help with the growing flow of migrants, according to two former senior Abbott officials who spoke on the condition that they not be identified.

Initially, the buses all went to Washington, “to take the border to the president,” the officials said. In August, Mr. Abbott began sending busloads of migrants to New York City. A few weeks later, buses began heading to Chicago, then Philadelphia.

By the end of 2022, Texas had sent more than 16,000 migrants to those cities, according to data obtained by The Times last year through a records request.

The Biden administration accused Mr. Abbott of a cruel stunt. But the campaign worked. Until then, the White House viewed the migration crisis mainly as a problem for border states, former aides said. When migrants began making headlines in places like New York, that view changed.

Many Biden officials came to view Mr. Abbott’s campaign as the point Democrats lost the debate.

“I don’t think we ever recovered,” said Deborah Fleischaker, then the assistant director for policy at ICE.

Mr. Abbott’s campaign echoed an idea that some Biden officials had been advocating for internally: using federal resources to help migrants reach their destinations, but in coordination with the cities receiving them.

Jason Houser, then the chief of staff at ICE, said he had pushed the idea partly to help make the movement of migrants more orderly. He said Mr. Biden’s senior advisers refused.

Some officials contended that the Department of Homeland Security lacked congressional authority to transport immigrants not in government custody. Others felt that providing free transportation would draw more migrants.

If the Biden administration had worked to coordinate migrants’ travel in the United States, “it would have made a profound difference,” Mike Johnston, the Democratic mayor of Denver, said in an interview.

As Mr. Abbott’s campaign ramped up, White House officials debated taking executive action on the border, Mr. Klain said in an interview. But Kyrsten Sinema, then a Democratic senator from Arizona, had begun talking to Republican lawmakers about border legislation, he said. Mr. Biden wanted to give that effort a chance.

“We were trying to cut a deal,” Mr. Klain said.

But Democrats were running out of time.

Year 3: Trial and Error

By the halfway mark of Mr. Biden’s term, the failure of his approach was impossible to ignore.

The Border Patrol reported 2.2 million apprehensions along the Mexican border the previous year, up from 400,000 the year Mr. Biden was elected. In 2023, the number of unauthorized migrants in the country who were not detained and were waiting for their cases to be resolved surpassed 6 million, almost doubling since 2020.

The White House began experimenting. In January, the Department of Homeland Security started admitting migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, provided they could find an American sponsor, pass a background check and pay for a plane ticket. By giving those migrants an official way to enter, the program — called C.H.N.V., after the names of the four countries — sought to reduce their incentive to cross the border illegally.

C.H.N.V.

A program introduced by the Biden administration at the start of 2023, awarding two-year residency permits to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had U.S.-based sponsors and passed background checks. More than half a million people entered through the program before President Trump canceled it.

C.H.N.V. was an evolution of more targeted migrant programs introduced earlier in the Biden administration, starting with Operation Allies Welcome, which allowed the suspect in last month’s attack on the National Guard troops into the United States. In 2022, the administration started a similar entry program for Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country.

Republicans accused the administration of letting in unauthorized immigrants. And no one at the Department of Homeland Security was responsible for ensuring that people who entered through C.H.N.V. left the country when they were supposed to, according to a report this year by the agency’s inspector general.

Still, C.H.N.V. succeeded in reducing the number of people from those four countries approaching the border. But overall crossings remained high.

In May 2023, the administration replaced Title 42 with new restrictions. Asylum seekers were supposed to book an appointment through a mobile app, CBP One, which offered a limited number of openings.

CBP One

CBP One was a mobile phone app introduced by the Biden administration in 2023. People trying to file an asylum claim at the border were first directed to get an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app, which could sometimes take months. More than 900,000 people eventually booked appointments using the app; the Trump administration has ordered many of them to leave.

The administration also raised the threshold for asylum for people who did not use the app. But the new restrictions failed to stem the tide. Border encounters fell briefly, then rebounded.

Adding to the pressure, Mr. Abbott expanded his busing campaign. In May, Denver received its first busload from Texas.

Texas eventually sent more than 19,000 migrants to Denver. The city of about 720,000 wound up taking in 43,000 of them.

The influx became a crisis for Mr. Johnston, who was elected mayor three weeks after the first bus arrived. As the numbers grew, he repeatedly asked the Biden administration for money and policy changes to address what he called a “humanitarian crisis.”

The costs spread. The main safety-net hospital spent millions of dollars treating additional patients with no insurance. The school system made room for more than 5,000 additional students. Denver spent almost $100 million trying to manage the crisis.

The city was not alone. By September, Texas had sent tens of thousands of migrants to Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and New York.

“This issue will destroy New York City,” Mayor Eric Adams told a town hall that month. “The city we knew, we’re about to lose.”

Year 4: The Reckoning

On a Sunday evening in February 2024, Senator Chris Murphy was in his Capitol Hill office, watching the collapse of the Biden administration’s last best chance to manage its immigration problem.

Mr. Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, had led his party’s negotiations over a bill to fix the border crisis by giving the government authority to restrict asylum claims. The bill had taken Mr. Murphy and his Republican counterpart, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, months to agree upon.

Within hours, as Mr. Murphy watched Republicans attack the bill on social media, he knew it would fail. Early the next day, Mr. Trump delivered the death blow. “This Bill is a great gift to the Democrats,” he wrote on social media. “It takes the HORRIBLE JOB the Democrats have done on Immigration and the Border, absolves them, and puts it all squarely on the shoulders of Republicans. Don’t be STUPID!!!”

“We had our votes on Sunday afternoon,” Mr. Murphy said. “We didn’t have them on Monday morning.”

The bill could have provided what Mr. Biden needed as he ran for re-election: a drop in border crossings, blessed by both parties in Congress, with enough time before Election Day for voters to change their minds about Democrats supporting open borders.

Democrats blamed Mr. Trump for sinking the deal. But Mr. Lankford pointed to another culprit: the Biden administration’s own foot-dragging.

When negotiations had gained momentum the previous fall, the White House had refused to get involved, according to Mr. Murphy and Mr. Lankford. “We don’t want our fingerprints on these negotiations,” Mr. Lankford recalled the White House telling him. Only as border crossings continued to spike did the administration relent, he said.

Looking back, Mr. Lankford said he believed the delay was critical. If Mr. Biden had signed on sooner, he said, the talks could have produced an agreement before the end of 2023. At that point, Mr. Trump, who still faced opposition for the Republican presidential nomination, might not have had the clout to torpedo the deal.

Then Mr. Trump defeated Ron DeSantis in Iowa, and Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. By the time the border deal concluded in February 2024, “it was very clear that Mr. Trump was going to win” the nomination, Mr. Lankford said. And Mr. Trump was eager to score political points off Mr. Biden’s immigration record.

The deal’s failure left Mr. Biden in a bind. Border encounters were still higher than at any point in the Trump administration. The estimated number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States — 11 million when Mr. Biden took office — was approaching 14 million. And the election was nine months away.

Less than three weeks after the Senate deal collapsed, a 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, was killed on the University of Georgia campus. When a Venezuelan man who had entered the country illegally was charged with the murder, her death became shorthand for Democrats’ failures. Mr. Trump met with Ms. Riley’s family and said that she would still be alive “if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders.”

By June, 55 percent of Americans said total immigration levels should fall, the highest share measured by Gallup since just after the Sept. 11 attacks.

On June 4, 2024, five months before Election Day, Mr. Biden reversed course. He issued an order all but closing the border to asylum applications, a move that was far tougher than the proposals that had been rejected during his first year in office. Border encounters quickly fell.

Why Mr. Biden waited so long to effectively seal the border has become one of the defining questions of his presidency.

Some aides feared that closing the border would be overturned by the courts. Others said that principles mattered. “It was truly believed — deeply, by many, including the president — that that was not in keeping with our values,” said Ms. Jacobson, the former border czar.

Three weeks after closing the border, the president faced off against Mr. Trump in a debate at CNN’s Atlanta studios. Asked why voters should trust him to solve the crisis, Mr. Biden flubbed it.

“What I’ve done — since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened?” said Mr. Biden, who had not changed the law. “I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally.”

Mr. Biden went on: “I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the … the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.”

“I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t think he knows what he said either.”

Within a month, Mr. Biden left the race.

On Mr. Trump’s first day back in the White House, he effectively blocked asylum claims entirely. He also shut down Mr. Biden’s border entry app, ordered the military to the border and directed ICE to drastically expand its scope of arrests and deportations.

“The American people deserve a federal government that puts their interests first,” read Mr. Trump’s executive order.

The Biden experiment was over. A very different kind of experiment was just beginning.

Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

ICE is currently holding 65,000 migrants in detention centers around the country, according to DHS data posted online.","More than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE officers in the first nine months of the Trump administration had no criminal histories, according to new data.

The data, which includes ICE arrests from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15, shows that nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records have been swept up in immigration operations that the president and his top officials have said would target murderers, rapists and gang members.

“It contradicts what the administration has been saying about people who are convicted criminals and that they are going after the worst of the worst,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The figures provide the most revealing look to date into the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. They were shared by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project, which obtained them through a lawsuit brought against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The data is compiled by an internal ICE office that handles arrest, detention and deportation data. The administration stopped regularly posting detailed information on ICE arrests in January.

For arrestees with criminal histories, the data doesn’t distinguish between those with a history of minor offenses and those who have committed more serious crimes, like rape and murder, whom the administration has said it is targeting.

And the figures do not include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has launched aggressive immigration operations in several cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina. Border Patrol sweeps are currently underway in New Orleans.

Border Patrol and ICE are both under the Department of Homeland Security but they are two different agencies with two different missions. Border Patrol agents typically operate along the southern and northern borders, but recently hundreds have been sent into the interior of the United States to track down undocumented immigrants.

“That is the black box that we know nothing about,” Ruiz Soto said. “How many arrests is Border Patrol doing? How many of those are leading to removals and under what conditions?”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE field offices have been under intense pressure to ramp up arrests.

In mid-May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller threatened to fire senior ICE officials if they did not begin arresting at least 3,000 migrants per day, NBC News previously reported.

But the new data shows that ICE is still falling well short of those targets.

ICE agents have made an average daily total of 824 arrests since Jan. 20, according to the data. Those figures are still more than double the average daily arrest total under the Biden administration in 2024, when ICE arrested 312 people per day.

The data also reveals that about 90% of the people ICE arrested through mid-October were male. Mexican nationals accounted for the largest share of the overall arrests, with about 85,000, followed by nationals of Guatemala at 31,000 and Honduras at 24,000.

More than 60% of those who were arrested were between the ages of 25 and 45.

“Now we’re really feeling that pain in the workforce,” said George Carrillo, chief executive officer of the Hispanic Construction Council.

Carrillo praised the Trump administration for its efforts to secure the border but said the ongoing enforcement operations are having a significant impact on companies that employ migrant workers.

“Now even the most conservative Republicans are feeling it and understanding that, hey, something different has to be done because now it is affecting their businesses,” he said. “And they’re worried about this strategy.”

It’s not clear from the data how many of those who were arrested were deported, but 22,959 are listed under the category of “voluntary departure,” meaning they left the United States of their own accord.

The news, confirmed by the National Association of Immigration Judges, highlights a profound staffing crisis.

The judges worked at 26 Federal Plaza, a key location that also houses the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office and serves as a focal point for migrant arrests.

According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, since Trump took office in January, more than 100 immigration judges out of approximately 700 have been fired or forced out. This drastic reduction is crippling the courts, which must manage a soaring caseload due to the administration’s policy of intensifying arrests and deportations.

Legal Basis and Further Developments

The legal basis for the firings is that immigration judges report to the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review and are not part of the federal judiciary. The administration asserts that the President and Attorney General Pam Bondi have the constitutional right to remove these judges as “inferior officers.”

The Justice Department has remained silent, refusing to comment on “personnel matters.” These firings are not isolated, but follow prior episodes. Just last month, the administration had fired five judges in San Francisco, one in New York City, and another in Boston.

The aggressive firing policy is generating lawsuits. On Monday, a former immigration judge in Ohio, who was fired in February, filed a lawsuit, alleging she was wrongly terminated because of her sex, national origin, and political affiliation.

These events fit into a broader pattern of conflict between the Executive and Judicial branches. Several recent reports point to continuous tension and the suspension of executive orders. Federal judges have recently blocked or suspended several key Trump administration initiatives, including attempts to revoke birthright citizenship and to cancel the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti.

The conflict over executive powers has often reached the Supreme Court, which has sometimes limited the power of lower federal judges to issue nationwide stay orders (universal injunctions). However, the Court has also given the administration “a free hand on firings” in some contexts, making the role of the judiciary the only real check on the expansion of presidential powers.

The situation paints a picture of ongoing tension and uncertainty within the U.S. immigration system, with the administration attempting to reshape the judicial apparatus in line with its political agenda.",https://www.focusonafrica.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot_20251207_123628_Google.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 11:58:08.803088

Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison.
We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.” The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise.
The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually.
McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.","The inmates housed at the minimum-security state prison in McCook, Neb., could often be seen around town, working on road paving, weeding cemeteries, taking down Christmas lights and mowing the high school football field before games. They took classes at the local community college, and an art gallery displayed work from 13 prisoners this summer.

For more than two decades, the prison, known as the Work Ethic Camp, was Nebraska’s only state prison geared solely toward rehabilitation. The facility held nonviolent felony offenders who were nearing the end of their sentences and prepared them, with counseling, schooling and job training, to return to the outside world.

That changed this fall, after state officials announced that the Work Ethic Camp would be replaced with a 300-bed, high security Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center to support President Trump’s national crackdown on illegal immigration.

And so a place that had been devoted to second chances now had a very different mission, and a new name to go with it: “The Cornhusker Clink.”

In McCook, a conservative town of about 7,500 that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, some residents have objected. Many said they support Mr. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration but also liked what they had before: A prison that didn’t feel like a prison. With its close ties to the community, it was a place that helped Nebraskans get back on their feet.

Other residents said they were in favor of the new ICE facility, viewing McCook as doing its part for the president’s agenda and potentially benefiting from 50 to 60 added jobs. But opponents said they were frustrated by the governor’s unilateral decision to change the facility and turn it into a place to detain immigrants. City officials are also worried about the potential strain on resources if hundreds of detainees are transported in and out through the town’s small airport, which has one full-time employee.

“Now when people think of McCook, this is all it is — it’s ICE detention,” said Nate Schneider, the city manager and a registered Republican who said he has voted for both parties over the years. “But for us, it’s a lot more than that. McCook is home. McCook is a place that I want my kids to think is a good place to live. We’ve been working so hard to make McCook a draw, and now this.”

The former work camp featured classrooms and open areas for exercise. A single fence surrounded only the back buildings where inmates slept.

McCook officials said they were given no advance notice of the state’s decision to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp, nor have they been told that the city can expect any revenue from the ICE agreement with the state, which Mr. Pillen has said will bring in about $14 million annually, after expenses to run the facility.

Thirteen McCook residents and aformer state legislator sued the governor, arguing that the facility was designated and funded by the Nebraska Legislature for the purposes of rehabilitating state inmates, and that Mr. Pillen did not have authority to change that. In October, a judge declined to grant the residents an injunction but also declined the governor’s request to dismiss the case, which is proceeding.

“I have no problem with prosecuting immigrants who commit crimes,” said Bruce McDowell, a retired telecommunications technician and a plaintiff in the suit. Mr. McDowell, a Democrat, said he viewed Governor Pillen’s decision to turn the facility over to federal authorities as a political calculation. “He’s trying to curry favor with Donald Trump, and that carries a lot more weight than a few of us down here,” he said.

Mr. Pillen’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the governor has previously said that the facility would benefit the state, calling it “good for Nebraska’s taxpayers” and a way to ensure that Nebraska is “doing all that we can to keep criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

In 1997, the Nebraska Legislature approved the Work Ethic Camp, so named to reflect the facility’s stated philosophy that “positive work ethics can be learned and transferred to other areas of an individual’s life.” Its purpose was to prepare low-level offenders to return to the community and to reduce a perpetual overcrowding problem in Nebraska prisons. The state’s prison system regularly ranks among the nation’s most overcrowded.

The Work Ethic Camp housed fewer than 200 people at a time and cost the state around $10 million annually. Its programming included vocational and educational courses, as well as classes to contend with substance abuse and domestic violence. McCook did not receive any direct revenue from the work camp but many residents were employed there, and the inmates worked low-paying jobs around town.

Over 48 cent coffee at Arby’s, where a group of men gather most mornings, residents were divided over whether McCook should have had a say in the decision to convert the facility into an ICE detention center.

“Who are we to say, ‘No, you can’t bring them here, you’ve got to go somewhere else,’” asked Brad Gillen, who owns a carpet cleaning business in McCook and voted for President Trump. “If this is our part we have to do, that’s fine.”

But others took issue with Governor Pillen for choosing to partner with federal authorities without seeking input from the community most affected, McCook.

“He did it to us, not with us,” said Dale Dueland, a semiretired farmer and rancher, who is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Mr. Pillen and describes himself as nonpartisan.

“If you’d come before this all happened, most people here would say that what happens in Washington is so far away, it doesn’t affect us,” Mr. Dueland added. “All of a sudden it’s like a wake-up call that what happens in those faraway places can directly affect us here.”

From Washington to McCook

In mid-March, Mr. Pillen and his staff members traveled to the White House to attend one of President Trump’s executive order signing ceremonies. The following week, David Lopez, Mr. Pillen’s chief of staff, exchanged emails with D.H.S. officials, thanking them for meeting with him. He also inquired about how Nebraska might assist in immigration enforcement.

It is not clear exactly how Mr. Pillen and the corrections department landed on offering up the Work Ethic Camp, one of nine state correctional facilities, in the months that followed. But in August, in a joint statement with D.H.S., the governor announced the plan. That was the first time most people in McCook learned that the camp would be repurposed..",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover/07nat-nebraska-ice-50929-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:48.616120

The woman, Viktoriia, is married to a U.S. citizen, had no criminal history and, CBS 8 is told, has complied with every requirement of the immigration system.

""She is my wife. She has kids. Everybody is stressed out,"" Victor Korol, Viktoriia's husband, said.

Korol is a citizen and has cancer. He depends on Viktoriia as his primary caretaker.

During their interview Thursday, Viktoriia was detained by ICE in front of him.

""They said that her TPS [Temporary Protected Status] status was not current. And they are detaining you. We tried to explain to them that they should not detain her,"" Korol said.

He said that she previously applied to renew her TPS and work authorization during the designated renewal period in January. Both of those cases are pending, according to Pathways to Citizenship, an organization based in Solana Beach that helps immigrants.

""This is widespread and a daily occurrence here in San Diego and throughout the nation that people's constitutional rights and legal protections have all but vanished,"" Caroline Matthews, a supervising attorney for Pathways to Citizenship, said.

Matthews is working with Korol to help him be reunited with Viktoriia.

""Unfortunately, I've had to file Habeas petitions in federal court, because what we've found is the immigration system right now is violating its own rules. It's acting unlawfully, despite knowing that those things are occurring, there's no recourse,"" Matthews said.

She told CBS 8 that in other cases that mirror Viktoriia's, many immigrants are spending, at minimum, 3 days in detainment.

""My client who was detained in a similar fashion on November 19, had to file a Habeas because she was still not located by that following Friday. And then we had a bond hearing eventually... And that bond hearing resulted in a decision that she would be out on bond. So, she's paying to get out of an unlawful arrest and detention, and then, despite our efforts and the agreement with the immigration judge that she would not be in alternatives to detention like an ankle monitor, she was put in one anyway,"" Matthews said.

In a ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss the case and has set a hearing for next week for the parties to discuss next steps in this case.

President Donald Trump in January announced his administration would use a detention center at Guantanamo to hold tens of thousands of the “worst criminal aliens,” as part of his wider immigration crackdown.

Between February and June, the federal government held around 500 immigrants at Guantanamo, according to Sooknanan, as authorities used the base as a way station for immigrants with final removal orders.

American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, who argued the case, said in a statement Saturday that he hopes the ruling “will put an end to the Trump administration’s unlawful policy of sending immigrants to military bases in the middle of nowhere solely for the theatric value.”

The ACLU and other advocacy groups have argued that transporting immigrants to Guantanamo is unlawful. The Trump administration has said it has broad authority to hold immigrants with final deportation orders at the facility.

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, said, “We look forward to a higher court’s vindication of our use of this facility to keep criminals off American streets.”

The base, often referred to as “Gitmo,” is best known for the suspects brought there after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated.”","Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., said she was “pushed-side and pepper sprayed” by federal immigration agents while on scene at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at an Arizona restaurant on Friday. Grijalva said in a video on X she was at Taco Giro in Tucson to ask for clarification, “which is my right as a member of Congress.”

“[I] was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others, when I literally was not being aggressive,” she said. “Once I introduced myself, I assumed that it would be a little calmer. But there was literally only one person that was trying to speak to me in any kind of civil tone, and everyone else was being rude and disrespectful. And I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else.”

Along with herself, Grijalva said she also witnessed members of the press and others being sprayed. Grijalva and two of her staff members still had remnants of what the agents sprayed on them after the raid ended, she said.

In another X post, Grijalva posted video footage of the incident.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, in a statement, dismissed Grijalva’s account, claiming she was not pepper sprayed, but was in the “vicinity” of someone who was as “they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” McLaughlin wrote, adding, “Presenting one’s self as a “Member of Congress” doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Two law enforcement officers were “seriously injured” during the raid, McLaughlin said.

During an interview with CNN anchor Laura Coates on Friday, Grijalva said “It’s convenient to them to make it seem as if I was doing anything other than inquiring about what was happening.”

Tucson Police were also at the site of the raid. Grijalva said they arrived after ICE was already at Taco Giro, and that they were not the aggressors.

An ICE spokesperson told local outlet WSAZ that multiple arrests were made, with an exact number to be released later.

Local response to ICE raid

The police department confirmed that Homeland Security Investigations served a federal search warrant at Taco Giro on Friday. No munitions or force were deployed by Tucson Police Department employees, the agency said.

“After deploying chemical munitions federal agents requested emergency support from TPD to assist in exiting the area,” Tucson police said. “TPD Rapid Response Team (RRT) personnel responded to the location to support a safe environment.”

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz put out a statement together stating that they share the fears in the community created by what they called “Trump’s immoral and inhumane immigration policies.”

“Under the Trump Administration unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like “police” to purposefully confuse the public,” the officials said. “Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25316824029346_AP_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:57:37.854719

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the expansion of the June travel ban, which barred 19 countries from partially or entirely sending their citizens to the US.

“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem asked Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Thursday.

DHS did not announce which countries will be included in the expanded ban and did not state when it will go into effect.

The June ban fully restricted travel from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

That ban also established partial restrictions on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

The Trump administration’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services further directed a hold on green card and citizenship applications for people from those 19 countries.

The agency also announced a hold on “all pending asylum applications, regardless of the alien’s country of nationality.”

The ramped up restrictions come in the wake of the broad-daylight shooting of two West Virginia National Guard troops in Washington, DC, on Nov. 26. The attack was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who came to the US under the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome.

National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, was killed in Lakanwal’s ambush, while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically wounded.

Lakanwal has been charged with murder, possessing a firearm during a crime of violence, and assault with intent to kill while armed.

""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""
That measure codified the Citizenship Clause's language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.
The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.","The US Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of US President Donald Trump's directive to restrict birthright citizenship in the country, a contentious part of his efforts to curb immigration and a step that would alter how a 19th century constitutional provision has long been understood.

The justices took up a Justice Department appeal of a lower court's ruling that blocked Trump's executive order telling US agencies not to recognize the citizenship of children born in the US if neither parent is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, also called a ""green card"" holder.

The lower court ruled that Trump's policy violated the US Constitution's 14th Amendment and a federal law codifying birthright citizenship rights in a class-action lawsuit by parents and children whose citizenship is threatened by the directive.

The justices are expected to hear arguments during their current term and issue a ruling by the end of June. They did not set a date for the arguments.

The Republican president signed the order his first day back in office on Jan. 20 as part of a suite of initiatives he has pursued during his second term as president to crack down on legal and illegal immigration. Trump's policies toward immigration have been among the most contentious aspects of both his terms as president, with critics accusing him of racial and religious discrimination in his approach.

The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship for babies born in the US. But the Trump administration has argued that the provision does not grant citizenship to the babies of immigrants who are in the country illegally or whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

""This case will have enormous consequences for the security of all Americans, and the sanctity of American citizenship. The Trump administration looks forward to making its case on the issue of birthright citizenship on behalf of the American people,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship,"" said Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs. ""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

The administration has said that granting citizenship to virtually anyone born on US soil has created incentives for illegal immigration and led to ""birth tourism,"" by which foreigners travel to the US to give birth and secure citizenship for their children.

The legal challenges appealed by the Justice Department concerned one lawsuit filed by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, and another filed in federal court in New Hampshire by plaintiffs who sued on behalf of a nationwide class of people affected by Trump's order.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states. Also in July, Concord, New Hampshire-based US District Judge Joseph Laplante let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump's order to be blocked nationally. The Supreme Court on Friday decided to hear the class action case only, not the one brought by the states.

The Supreme Court took up the case before a Boston-based federal appeals court had a chance to review it, a signal of the gravity of the legal divide and the need for the Supreme Court to definitively settle the matter on a national basis.

The 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause states that all ""persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the US and of the state wherein they reside."" The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the US.

The administration has asserted that the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" means that being born in the United States is not enough for citizenship. Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose ""primary allegiance"" is to the US, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued.

Such allegiance is established only through ""lawful domicile,"" which government attorneys define as ""lawful, permanent residence within a nation, with intent to remain.""

The challengers said the Supreme Court already settled the question of birthright citizenship in an 1898 case called US v. Wong Kim Ark, which long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the US to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers also point out that Trump's order violates a law Congress passed in 1940 that was subsequently included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That measure codified the Citizenship Clause's language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.

The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year. After lower courts halted Trump's order, the administration took the matter to the Supreme Court to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called ""universal"" injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, issued a ruling in June blunting the power of federal judges but did not resolve the legality of Trump's directive.

The ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.

Among these policies were Trump's revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.

Instead, ICE agents were waiting for him outside on Nov. 14.

Toledo-Martinez’s lawyer, Olia Catala, said once he went out to check on the damage and exchange insurance information, undercover agents released a dog that had been hiding out of sight with a handler. Immigration officials detained Toledo-Martinez, 28, of Vancouver, Wash.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is calling for the immediate release of the Clark County father of three, who was mauled by the dog despite not resisting arrest, his attorneys say.

“He heard the officer say, ‘He’s gonna run!’ or ‘He’s running!’ and he didn’t even realize what was happening,” Catala said in an interview Saturday. “And the next thing he knows is that the dog is on top of him, mauling him. He did not flee. He did not resist.”

Toledo-Martinez did not have weapons on him. He has no criminal convictions, though he had been arrested for investigation of a misdemeanor years ago in Oregon, Catala said. She suspects that’s why immigration officials had him on their radar. Court records suggest Toledo-Martinez has never been charged with a crime in Washington.

A video shows Toledo-Martinez being placed in handcuffs by an undercover officer wearing a construction vest, while a dog handler threatens his wife, who filmed the interaction.

“You need to back up,” the dog handler tells her. “Or he’s going to get bit again.”

Photos show Toledo-Martinez suffered deep cuts to his arm and back from the dog attack. He was denied medical care for several hours after his arrest, then given stitches and prescribed antibiotics, which were not immediately provided to him, Murray said.

“The photos documenting his injuries are horrific,” the longtime senator said. “This should shock the conscience of every one of us. I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.”

As of Saturday, Toledo-Martinez was being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma.

Murray said Toledo-Martinez’s detainment is an example of President Donald Trump’s “depraved” deportations, saying he’s going after all people, not just violent criminals.

“I am calling for Wilmer’s immediate release from NWIPC — he has no criminal convictions, he poses no threat to the community, and he urgently needs appropriate medical care since ICE is denying him the treatment he requires,” Murray said in a news release.

Toledo-Martinez’s lawyers told Murray their client is an undocumented immigrant and he was brought to the U.S. at age 15. He married a U.S. citizen and has three children, ages 2, 3 and 7.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.

According to his attorney, Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home on Nov. 14 by a federal agent posing as a construction worker, “who claimed to have hit Wilmer’s car and needed him to step outside to verify.”

They further allege another agent and a dog were hiding nearby, then that agent released the dog on Toledo-Martinez when he stepped outside.

After the dog attacked, Toledo-Martinez’s attorney said he “was left shaking and dizzy, and at one point his vision went black, yet he was denied medical care for hours.”

Eventually he was taken to a hospital where he received stitches and antibiotics. However, Toledo-Martinez later shared that “obtaining adequate medical care has been extremely difficult,” his attorney said.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran.","The Trump administration is expected to deport dozens of Iranians back to their home country on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.

It is the second such deportation flight after a rare agreement between Washington and Tehran, which do not have diplomatic relations, amid the Trump administration’s extreme push to expel undocumented immigrants.

There are serious concerns from human rights and advocacy organizations about the Iranians who fled to the US and may now be forced to return. The State Department’s latest human rights report, issued under the Trump administration, said there are “significant human rights issues” in Iran.

One person who said they are expected to be on the deportation flight Sunday said their life will be at risk if they return.

The person, who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation, said he fled Iran because of his sexuality. Homosexuality is punishable by death in Iran.

“I suffered a lot in country for what I am,” he said, telling CNN he was tortured and raped in Iran.

He said he came to the US “just to have a normal life like everyone else.” He was detained after crossing the border in the waning days of the Biden administration, after traveling months and being robbed and beaten en route to the US. He said he has suffered abuse and discrimination while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention.

CNN cannot independently confirm the man’s account. The person said he had filed for asylum, but the status of his application is unclear.

“Definitely my life is at risk if I return to my country,” he said.

The National Iranian American Council, a nonprofit organization, called on the administration to halt the flight.

“Iranians like the ones on this imminent deportation flight come here to escape government repression. It is disturbing that, instead of honoring their asylum claims and offering them safety, our own government may be violating their human rights and compounding the harm done to them with abuses in detention,” the group’s president, Jamal Abdi, said in a statement.

According to the source familiar with Sunday’s deportation flight, it is expected to stop in Kuwait en route to Iran. The first deportation flight was in September.

CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Iranian Mission to the UN for comment.

ICE declined to confirm reporting by BBC Persian about the deportations, without denying the planned operation, citing “the safety of the flight and its passengers.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2193097479.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-06 22:56:17.654995

The half-sunken boat was located Saturday by a passing Turkish merchant vessel, authorities said. Two survivors were rescued and a rescue operation to find more was ongoing.

Greece is a major entry point into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia and fatal accidents are a common occurrence. The short but perilous journey from Turkey's coast to nearby Greek islands in inflatable dinghies or small boats, often in poor conditions, used to be the major route until increased patrols and alleged pushbacks reduced crossing attempts. In recent months, arrivals from Libya to Crete have surged.

Authorities have not yet determined where the boat came from.

The conditions in the jail are “very bad,” Herrera-Cruz told Truthout, with the help of a translator. “There are some guards who are very racist towards immigrants.”

Herrera-Cruz, who is 25 years old, left Mexico to come to the United States to work with his brother for a roofing business in St. Louis. He was travelling in rural Missouri for a job when the trailer on his truck got a flat tire. Herrera-Cruz says a passerby stopped, began harassing him, and called the police. When local sheriff’s deputies arrived, instead of helping with the flat tire, they arrested Herrera-Cruz.

According to a Department of Justice press release, Herrera-Cruz was picked up on March 18, 2025, and charged with illegal reentry. He had previously been deported in March 2022 and made his way back to the country. He was arrested in Camden County, Missouri, best known for the Lake of the Ozarks, a scenic stretch of waterways surrounded by mountains. The press release says that Herrera-Cruz was arrested for not having a driver’s license following a “single vehicle accident.” (In Missouri and 30 other states, undocumented residents can’t get a driver’s license.)

Central Missouri is a politically conservative territory in a deep red state. Missouri, which has a troubled history as a slave state before the Civil War, is the third state in the nation for executions, behind Texas and Oklahoma. In the 2024 election, Donald Trump won Missouri with 58 percent of the vote. The state governor and local officials have eagerly collaborated with federal immigration agents to carry out the new administration’s mass deportation plans.

Despite its deep-red reputation, Missouri is also home to a growing movement of local community members organizing to fight back against mass deportation.

The Show-Me-Your-Papers State

On his first day in office in January of this year, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe signed an executive order entering into a 287(g) agreement for collaboration between the Missouri State Highway Patrol and ICE. The 287(g) program authorizes state and local police to carry out immigration enforcement duties, with Trump going so far as to offer financial incentives for training officers. In Missouri, 287(g) agreements have been rapidly expanding among law enforcement agencies across the state.

In September 2025, the governor activated 15 members of the Missouri National Guard to provide “logistical support” to federal immigration agents.

Phelps County jail, where Herrera-Cruz is reportedly being held, is 100 miles southwest of St. Louis. In January 2025, the county completed a jail expansion project that doubled its capacity to 400 beds. As Trump has shifted the U.S. deportation machine into high gear, the Phelps County jail has served as a holding facility, keeping between 50 to 70 immigrants on any given day.

An expanding detention network is being built out across the Midwest. Since Illinois banned immigrant detention, ICE sends people to county jails in nearby states. In a red state like Missouri, many of the sheriffs are Republican and support Trump’s anti-immigrant policies.

Three counties in central Missouri have opened their jail doors to ICE for immigrants arrested in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and elsewhere across the Midwest. Along with Phelps County, jails in Greene County and Ste. Genevieve County are holding people for ICE. Together, these county jails are detaining hundreds of immigrants awaiting a short appearance before a judge and a likely deportation order.

Doing Something on the Ground

Jails exist in part to hide people away from society. Behind jail walls, suffering is often out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the community. But in central Missouri, a growing number of community organizations are sprouting up to make sure immigrants in local jails aren’t forgotten.

The Phelps County jail is located in Rolla, Missouri, a small college town with a population of around 20,000 that is home to the Missouri University of Science and Technology. A group of local residents calling themselves Abide in Love formed to provide support for immigrants in the jail. They began monitoring the jail population through the sheriff’s online database, and recruited and trained pen pals to communicate with immigrants in the jail through a text messaging system. They pay for phone calls so immigrants at the jail can talk to their families. They provide hygiene packages. They also help connect families with attorneys.

Despite being a university town, “Rolla, like most of Missouri, is pretty red,” said Lucy Behrendt, current president of Abide in Love.

“A lot of us followed the rhetoric of this administration during the campaign and knew this was what was going to happen,” Behrendt told Truthout. “So when this group formed, it’s like, okay, something that I can do, besides just post stuff on Facebook, go to protests or whatever, something I can actually do, on the ground.”

While members of Abide in Love may oppose immigrant detention, they must rely on the cooperation of Phelps County Sheriff Mike Kirn to get access to immigrants in the jail. The group’s name is inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. and they use his philosophy to navigate the conservative political landscape.

“We use the six principles [of nonviolence] at every meeting. We read them and use the strategies to help bring about a beloved community,” Abide in Love’s founder Amy Beechner-McCarthy told St. Louis Public Radio. “That helps us focus on working within the system.”

Abide in Love is a “great help for everyone,” said Herrera-Cruz. “I’ve seen that they help many people with many things. Everyone in the organization is very kind, and they support us, whether with money or an encouraging text message. They even help people learn about their cases, because some people don’t know anything.”

A Form of Protest

Abide in Love chapters are spreading across Missouri to other county jails holding immigrants for ICE. An Abide in Love group was started an hour south of St. Louis in Ste. Genevieve County, along the Mississippi River bordering Illinois. After finding out about immigrants in their county jail and talking to the group in Rolla, community members launched Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve. Board member Susie Johnson told Truthout they filed for nonprofit status, trained volunteers, reached out to immigrants in the jail, and provided support.

“What Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve is doing by helping those detained and offering support,” Johnson said, “that’s a form of protest. And we know we are making a positive difference based on the thank you messages we receive almost daily.”

The city of Ste. Genevieve has a population of 5,000 people, but over the years the sheriff has expanded the jail to hold 500 people, an unusually large jail for a community this size. According to a contract with U.S. Marshals obtained through a Freedom of Information Act Request, 400 of the beds can be used for federal detainees at a per diem rate of $103 per person. As is often the case, a long-standing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service is used to hold ICE detainees. The Abide in Love chapter in Ste. Genevieve said there’s around 150 immigrants currently being held there.

Despite its remote location, the Ste. Genevieve jail has been in the headlines. In October, Abide in Love held a vigil for Leo Cruz-Silva, who died at the Ste. Genevieve jail. In November, the arrest by ICE of Ismael Ayuzo Sandoval, beloved owner of a Mexican restaurant in Staunton, Illinois, sparked community outrage. Sandoval is currently being held in the Ste. Genevieve jail. Abide in Love has been working to mobilize around these high-profile cases.

Truck Driver From Afghanistan Set Free

In Springfield, Missouri, the third largest city in the state, community organizers are developing solidarity networks and a chapter of Abide in Love is up and running. The Immigrant Justice Collaborative is advocating for legislative change, including the repeal of a ban on sanctuary cities in Missouri. Others have founded the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance (SMIA) which is more vocal in pressuring Sheriff Jim Arnott to stop holding immigrants at the county jail in Greene County, located in Springfield.

By monitoring the sheriff’s online data, the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance has been reporting statistics about detention on social media. According to SMIA, there have been more than 1,400 people held for ICE detention since May 14, 2025. In mid-November, daily population had grown to 295 people currently being held. Of those, 219 are listed as “Hispanic.” The contract with U.S. Marshals is for 375 federal detainees, at a per diem rate of $100 for each individual.

Asked to respond to whether he will keep the contract, Sheriff Arnott told Truthout, “Yes, we will,” but did not provide any reasoning.

In November, the Southern Missouri Immigration Alliance put a spotlight on the case of Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who was detained at the Greene County jail. They called on Sheriff Arnott and Greene County Commissioners to release Dadfar, an asylum seeker who served in the army in Afghanistan and was forced to flee the county with his family after the Taliban took over.

Dadfar is a long-haul truck driver who lives in Colorado, but was arrested driving through Indiana when he stopped at the Chesterton Weigh Station on Interstate 94. He was one more than 140 truck drivers rounded up in “Operation Midway Blitz” as part of a crackdown on immigrant drivers issued commercial driver’s licenses by sanctuary states in New York and elsewhere. (Dadfar obtained his commercial license in Colorado.)

After he was waved aside at the weigh station in Indiana, Dadfar was held for five hours before ICE showed up to arrest him. He was taken to a holding facility in Chicago for two days, then transferred to the Greene County jail in Missouri. There, SMIA members got in contact with Dadfar who asked that they reach out to Marissa Seuc-Hester, a friend through a local church in Boulder County, Colorado.

“We met Ali’s family when they arrived in Colorado,” Seuc-Hester told Truthout. “We were matched up with them to provide community connection and allyship as they built their new life here.” Her church ministry helps to resettle new immigrants by assisting with paperwork, building resumes, and registering children for school.

For a couple of days Dadfar’s family did not know of his whereabouts. With help from SMIA members, Seuc-Hester figured out the jail’s messaging app to communicate with Dadfar.

Public pressure recently helped to free Dadfar who was ordered released by a court order on December 1, 2025. U.S. District Judge M. Douglas Harpool, in the Western District of Missouri, ruled that his right to due process was violated. He had spent nearly two months in the Greene County jail.

“We are so relieved that Ali was released,” said Seuc-Hester, “and are grateful to everyone who followed and shared his story, and advocated for his release. We know so many others are still detained, and we hope the awareness we raised will lead to many more people being rightfully freed.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1596193818-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:52.712773

Voting Wrongs

Two months after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, the White House released the text of a sprawling executive order allegedly designed to ensure the integrity of U.S. elections. It demanded that states share their voter rolls with federal officials; mandated onerous proof-of-citizenship rules for people registering to vote (rules which didn’t include drivers’ licenses as valid forms of ID for this purpose); threatened local and state officials who didn’t cooperate with this power grab with legal sanctions; and ostensibly outlawed the counting of any mail-in ballots received after Election Day.

More recently, the White House announced it would soon be delivering another executive order going after mail-in voting more generally, and, in particular, that it would be targeting California’s voting system which, it alleged without evidence, was rife with fraud.

In the wake of lawsuits filed by Democratic-led states, the District of Columbia, and the League of United Latin American Citizens, courts have issued preliminary injunctions against the bulk of the provisions in Trump’s executive order from March. And when the administration pushes new restrictions on voting, California and other states have already made it clear they will head straight to court.

Yet even if many of Trump’s efforts to curtail voting end up stalled in the courts, the practical effect is one of intimidation: He is marshalling the full force of the U.S. government and all of the resources of the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) to craft a narrative that elections that don’t favor Republicans are inherently suspect.

In January 2021, Trump and his acolytes attempted to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, alleging that the election which he lost by millions of votes to Joe Biden was riddled with fraud. Between 2021 and 2024, many of the people involved in these schemes were successfully prosecuted, and many others — including Donald Trump himself — were investigated and charged with multiple felonies.

On day one of Trump’s second term in office, the MAGA leader issued mass pardons and clemencies for the January 6 insurrectionists and began a process of turning FBI and DOJ resources against those who had investigated and prosecuted them. That process has lasted all year, has resulted in wholesale purges, and, if Trump has his way, will lead to a slew of prosecutions against the officials who backed Jack Smith’s special investigation.

Many of the people who peddled outlandish election conspiracies five years ago are now in positions overseeing election integrity in the United States. These include Heather Honey, an outspoken 2020 election denier who is now the DHS point person on “election integrity,” charged with communicating to the states how the feds intend to protect elections from threats foreign and domestic to undermine the voting process. A New York Times investigative report found that Honey has, in private conversations with hard-right activists, proposed declaring a “national emergency” to allow federal official to bypass states and seize control over voting processes. The civil rights division of the Justice Department is now headed by another high-profile election denier, Harmeet Dhillon. And most of the senior personnel in the voting rights section of the Department of Justice have been dismissed, as have most active cases involving allegations against locales for creating racially discriminatory barriers to voting.

And it isn’t just a matter of a few bad actors being elevated to key roles and a few good actors being fired. Trump came into office determined to undermine the independence of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) — and promptly proceeded to fire board members who had been nominated by Democratic presidents. He has issued executive orders attempting to place independent executive branch agencies, including the FEC, under his direct control. And, with Trump having proceeded to fire key members of the FEC, the board no longer has the quorum to set in place meaningful election-protection policies, leaving it fundamentally hamstrung as the 2026 election season ramps up. In other words, there is now a systematic effort afoot to break down, or render impotent, key institutional players that could serve to limit Trump’s efforts to manipulate the outcome of the 2026 elections.

Making a bad situation worse, during the DOGE purges, the new administration slashed spending on cyber security and other security measures that warn states of threats to election systems, leaving elections officials largely floundering in the face of risks they no longer were receiving adequate briefings on. The administration also gutted the teams at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as in the FBI, that work to counteract foreign interference in U.S. elections. This is a historically unprecedented rollback of election security safeguards.

And at a state level, too, the rot is also accelerating. In key swing states such as Pennsylvania, the GOP has elevated election denying legislators to control the committees charged with setting election policy. Add into the mix Trump’s order to GOP state legislators in Texas and many other states to engage in mid-decade gerrymandering, so as to secure more than a dozen additional seats in the House of Representatives, as well as the likely Supreme Court ruling undermining Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and thus allowing southern states to legislate out of existence Black-majority districts, and the stage has been set for a massive onslaught on the concept of a level playing field for elections. Republicans could, in consequence, lose the popular vote by several percent and still end up in control of Congress.

None of this is to say that the Democrats won’t win control of the House next year — recent polls suggest Republicans are in deep electoral trouble. Thus, even with the GOP’s head start guaranteed by all of these shenanigans, it’s entirely possible Democratic candidates will overcome Republican advantages in dozens of districts around the country.

But Trump’s actions this past year do not give confidence that he will easily accept such an election defeat. He is maneuvering key agencies to be utilized to challenge results that don’t go his way, and his executive orders suggest a willingness to use federal muscle — even that of the military — to seize control both of election processes and of ballot boxes if things head too far south for the Republicans.

That’s a doomsday scenario that an increasing number of state and federal legislators are warning about. Officials worry about troops and DHS agents being deployed to polling stations to intimidate would-be voters, about cyberthreats being downplayed by the feds, about ballot boxes being seized. High-profile Democratic governors such as Illinois’s Jay Pritzker and California’s Gavin Newsom have warned that the deployment of National Guard troops into cities this year is likely a precursor for a concerted effort to send federal agents into Democratic cities and states during the 2026 elections. And U.S. senators such as Alex Padilla have announced they are prepared to introduce legislation to try to counter any presidential effort to declare a national emergency around the midterm elections.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2240387965-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:48.198943

That would be the governing party’s lawsuit against two of its former MLAs who had applied with Elections Alberta to rebrand the Alberta Party as the Progressive Conservative Party.
The notwithstanding clause, in its four decades of existence, has never been used as frequently by any government outside of Quebec.","It’s been hard to keep track of how many legal challenges and active court proceedings the United Conservative government has tried to quash or pre-emptively block in the last six weeks, but let’s try to tally:

The notwithstanding clause to thwart separate constitutional challenges by the Canadian Medical Association (1) and 2SLGBTQ+ advocacy groups (2) against Alberta’s ban on some transgender youth health care.

Notwithstanding clause against those advocacy groups’ challenge against the school pronouns law (3).

Notwithstanding clause against any potential challenges against the ban on transgender women in women’s sports (4).

Notwithstanding clause against teachers’ potential challenge to the strike-ending and imposed contract (5).

Bill 12’s provision to block public sector pensions from suing over the Alberta wealth management fund’s past trading losses (6).

And then the measure in this week’s Bill 14 designed to discontinue the court hearing about the constitutionality of a citizen’s initiative petition for Alberta separation from Canada (7).

One could argue there’s an eighth case the UCP government’s legislation would nullify if passed — one filed by the United Conservative Party itself. That would be the governing party’s lawsuit against two of its former MLAs who had applied with Elections Alberta to rebrand the Alberta Party as the Progressive Conservative Party.

Rather than his party trying to persuade a judge or jury that taking the old PC name was illegal under current laws, Justice Minister Mickey Amery drafted a new law to make it illegal to adopt that party name, or for any other party to use the word “conservative” in its moniker.

For all the talk of managing hearing backlogs in various jurisdictions, wielding legislation like this is technically one way to reduce court caseloads — it’s just unlikely that anybody has ever proposed this unorthodox means to that end.

But Premier Danielle Smith’s government has shown it’s willing to go farther and to use more tools to achieve its aims than others.

The notwithstanding clause, in its four decades of existence, has never been used as frequently by any government outside of Quebec.

There are some instances of government laws banning lawsuits — the Ontario government, for example, did so last year for cyclists injured on bike lanes the province removes. But that was to pre-empt wholly hypothetical cases; Alberta public sector pensions had already received a Court of King’s Bench ruling that the province and Alberta Investment Management Co. could be held liable for losses if ongoing arbitration failed.

Finance Minister Nate Horner justified that specific lawsuit ban in the name of protecting taxpayers from covering those losses. Safeguarding taxpayers from costs also emerged this week as a key rationale for imposing a four-year deal on Alberta teachers rather than risk higher pay increases through an arbitrated settlement.

The given reasons for the triple application of the notwithstanding clause in Alberta’s transgender laws was to protect children, athletes and parental rights — the Smith government’s same arguments for applying the laws in the first place, but with the added spectre of legal processes forestalling those protections.

In creating a list of words in party names that could not be copied by another party, Amery insisted “this is not a partisan issue.” Rather, it was because all parties “deserve to have their goodwill protected,” Amery said — even though this new ban is specifically backdated to early July, right before independent MLA Peter Guthrie spearheaded the Progressive Conservative rebrand application.

Guthrie didn’t see this as non-partisan, but a bid to “legislate away their competition,” he posted online.

“Alberta: Strong and Free — just not for anyone challenging the UCP,” he added, in a riff on the party’s slogan (and the new licence plate motto the Smith government adopted this fall).

Another denunciation of the Alberta government’s legal manoeuvres came this week from a higher office — Court of King’s Bench Justice Colin Feasby.

He did not take kindly to legislation to discontinue the hearing he was just wrapping up, into the constitutionality of the Alberta Prosperity Project’s petition to force a separatism referendum.

Feasby denounced “changing legislation to circumvent a valid legal process” as antithetical to “the stable, predictable and ordered society that the rule of law contemplates, and democracy demands.” Not only that, but it also showed “Alberta’s cavalier disregard for court resources,” given how much of the hearing had already occurred.

Besides, he added: “the Court cannot be silenced because the case has been decided.”

Before the hearing could be discontinued by legislative decree, Feasby ended it by ruling — that it would indeed be unconstitutional for citizens to initiate a referendum that replaces the Canadian Constitution altogether with an Alberta constitution.

The separatist movement had hailed Bill 14’s attempt to discard the constitutionality hearing.

It had erased a potential hurdle to their dream to get Alberta independence on the ballot, and ultimately win — and got the separatists happy with Smith’s UCP, days after jeering the premier at her own party convention for striking a pipeline and climate deal with Ottawa.

Was it worth it, trying to quash a court hearing to clear hurdles for UCP’s separatist faction, if in doing so it raised a judge’s warnings about dangers to democracy?

Was it worth it to use the notwithstanding clause to override the Charter rights of labour unions and trans youth if it met other various societal and economic aims, as well as politically satisfying the party base?

There’s a principle in political science that political actors will often refrain from using their legal powers to the fullest and most controversial extent to punish opponents or fulfil their own ambitions, because they’re aware that doing so risks creating permission for the other side to go to the same extremes when they’re in power.

It’s known as institutional forbearance, popularized in the 2018 book How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt.

Jared Wesley, a University of Alberta political scientist, said this is the concept that has traditionally restrained one government from routinely using the notwithstanding clause — nicknamed the Constitution’s nuclear option — to advance its aims, lest a successor government or other jurisdiction use the same tool to thwart those aims.

For instance, the Alberta government champions gun rights, but what if the federal government or a future Alberta premier from a different party used the notwithstanding clause to blunt gun rights?

“Populist governments, the Smith government included, tend not to think as often about how different measures would be used against them,” Wesley said. “They’re just more focused on using them in the moment.”

Classic conservatives were more cautious, more preoccupied with norms and the downdraft effects of drastic measures, Wesley told CBC News in an interview.

While former premier Peter Lougheed was a co-architect of Canada’s notwithstanding clause, subsequent Progressive Conservative governments were reluctant to wield the tool. The “new generation” of conservatives, Wesley added, have vastly different perspectives.

“They care less about institutional forbearance and more about owning their opponents,” he said.

Not only are the United Conservatives different from the Progressive Conservatives of yore, they’ve also legislated against anyone ever picking up that mantle again. In name, at least.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/73920a50-2f71-4bf0-bfa1-8cb1b608af26,1736735658244/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1920%2C1080%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-07 00:56:24.277656

Newberg said that people like her are now keeping a close eye on public schools with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's ""Operation Metro Surge"" now underway, prompted by President Trump's renewed attacks on Minnesota's Somali community.

While Newberg watched her street corner, Emily Phillips and Marie Purcell drove down the street, checking in on Roosevelt before moving on to other schools in the area. Purcell and Phillips don't know Newberg, but they share the same goal.

""We're hearing a lot both from parents and teachers that they want a lot more community presence,"" Purcell said.

On Thursday, St. Louis Park Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Carlondrea Hines sent a message to families acknowledging reported ICE sightings near one of the district's schools. While she said that there was no firm evidence that it happened, the district ""increased supervision at school sites to ensure each of our students made it home safely.""

""The only legal paperwork that would compel St. Louis Park Public Schools to act is a judicial order signed by a judge. Without that, we will NOT confirm the enrollment or attendance of any specific student or students,"" Dr. Hines said in her message. ""At no time will ICE or other related law enforcement agents be allowed access to the school beyond the main office area without specific court documents legally requiring us to provide this access.""

Ian McConnell, a parent in the St. Louis Park school district, said that there's been renewed fear among parents this week.

""My immediate feeling when I heard that ICE was present near Aquila [Elementary] was anger. Deep, righteous anger,"" McConnell said. ""When I look just a little deeper, it's deep sadness that my neighbors are experiencing, something that they shouldn't have to.""

Purcell had a whistle attached to her wrist on Friday at Roosevelt, ready to make noise if ICE were to show up. It's been a popular tactic for those looking to interrupt ICE operations in the Twin Cities and across the country.

As of Friday night, an ICE spokesperson had acknowledged WCCO's request for comment on operations near local schools but did not respond to questions.

ICE agents arrested 1,694 people in Minnesota from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 this year, according to the Deportation Data Project. They also arrested at least 12 people during the Twin Cities operation this week, the federal agency said Thursday.

U.S. Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) condemned the Trump administration as she alleged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers released an ""attack dog"" on one of her constituents.

Wilmer Toledo-Martinez was lured out of his home in Vancouver on Nov. 14, Murray said, before he was ""violently attacked and dragged away.""

The senator said Toledo-Martinez was attacked despite not resisting arrest or attempting to flee. His wife and two young children, ages two and three, witnessed the attack.

KATU News reached out to the man's attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), awaiting response.

Murray criticized the broader deportation policies under former President Donald Trump, stating, ""Trump is not going after violent criminals or the worst of the worst—he is terrorizing everyone, including U.S. citizens and their loved ones.""

She continued, ""I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.""

Toledo-Martinez's attorney stated that the officers involved in his arrest did not wear body cameras.

After being mauled, Toledo-Martinez was denied medical care for hours, Murray and his attorney said, eventually receiving stitches and medication at a hospital. However, he reported difficulties in obtaining adequate medical care during his detention.

Toledo-Martinez, who is undocumented, was brought to the U.S. at age 15 and is married to a U.S. citizen with three U.S.-born children.

Two agents were injured, federal officials said, and U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) posted on social media that she was sprayed in the face by a substance she could not identify. She accused immigration enforcement officers of operating without transparency or accountability.

“While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?” she said in a statement.

It was less than a month ago that Grijalva was sworn in as the newest member of Congress. She won special election in September to fill the House seat last held by her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva.

In a video posted to social media, Grijalva said she, two members of her staff and members of the media were harassed and sprayed by agents during what appeared to be a federal immigration raid. She said they interrupted because they “were afraid that they were taking people without due process, without any kind of notice.”

The video shows a staffer stepping in front of Grijalva, raising his arm and turning the congresswoman away as a federal agent sprays nearby protesters. Later in the video, as Grijalva continues walking in the street, a projectile is seen landing near her foot.

She said that she did not know what substance she was sprayed with but that it was “still affecting” her and causing her to cough.

Federal officials said Grijalva was not pepper-sprayed and that agents with Homeland Security Investigations were targeting multiple Tucson restaurants as part of a years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations. Several search warrants were served across southern Arizona on Friday as part of the operation.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement describing the group gathered in Tucson as a “mob.” She disputed Grijalva’s account and said that two agents were seriously injured in the clash.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin wrote. “Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Authorities used yellow tape to cordon off the restaurant and its parking lot as agents removed boxes from the building early Friday. By midmorning, protesters had gathered outside with signs and whistles.

Video shows Grijalva approaching the agents and asking where they were taking people. She asked them to stop being aggressive.

Some in the group were hit with pepper spray as they tried to keep federal vehicles from leaving the area.

Tucson police said federal tactical agents responded to extract investigative special agents from the area where the protesters were gathered. After deploying chemical munitions, police said federal agents then requested emergency support from local authorities to help exit the area.

TRUMP'S REMITTANCE TAX AIMS TO SLOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BY TARGETING THE MONEY FLOW

The warning came after a lawsuit was filed Thursday against the federal government on behalf of 21,500 immigrants facing daily penalties of $998, reaching up to $1.8 million each for staying in the U.S. illegally.

Their lawyers argued they were attempting to comply with federal immigration laws.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in October that migrants paroled in the U.S. would also face a $1,000 fee ""to institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system.""

DHS this week launched a ""holiday deal of a lifetime,"" offering illegal immigrants a ""Cyber Monday"" incentive to self-deport.

All illegal immigrants in the country could receive a free flight home and a $1,000 bonus for voluntarily leaving the country. The average cost to arrest, detain and deport someone is $17,000, according to DHS.

People in the U.S. illegally may also qualify for forgiveness of any civil fines or penalties incurred for failing to depart, DHS said, allowing the possibility for them to return legally.

TRUMP ADMIN ON PACE TO SHATTER DEPORTATION RECORD BY END OF FIRST YEAR: 'JUST THE BEGINNING'

The Trump administration previously announced it closed out fiscal year 2025 with 237,565 Border Patrol apprehensions, the fewest since 1970.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital in October that the administration was ""on pace to shatter historic records"" by tallying 600,000 deportations by the end of Trump’s first year back in office.

More than two million illegal immigrants have left the U.S. this year, she said, including 1.6 million who have self-deported, 515,000 deportations and another 485,000 who were arrested.

Grijalva (D-Ariz.) wrote on social media that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers ""just conducted a raid by Taco Giro in Tucson—a small mom-and-pop restaurant that has served our community for years.""

""When I presented myself as a member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,"" she added.

Grijalva said in a video uploaded to the post that she was ""sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others, when I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.""

""Pepper spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for,"" he added. ""Period.""

Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said on social media: ""This is unacceptable and outrageous.

Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order.
In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.
That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.","The United States Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether US President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship — as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment for more than 150 years — is constitutional.

Next spring, the justices will hear oral arguments in Trump’s appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down parts of an executive order — titled Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship — signed on the first day of the president’s second term. Under the directive, which has not taken effect due to legal challenges, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to US citizenship if their parents are in the country temporarily or without legal authorization.

Enacted in 1868, the 14th Amendment affirms that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”

While the Trump administration argues that the 14th Amendment was adopted to grant US citizenship to freed slaves, not travelers or undocumented immigrants, two key Supreme Court cases have affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution — United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk(1967).

Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order. However, the Supreme Court’s right-wing supermajority found in June that “universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”

In July, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously ruled that executive order is an unconstitutional violation of the plain language of the 14th Amendment. In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, national legal director at the ACLU — which is leading the nationwide class action challenge to Trump’s order — said in a statement Friday. “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

Brett Edkins, managing director of policy and political affairs at the advocacy group Stand Up America, was among those who suggested that the high court justices should have refused to hear the case given the long-settled precedent regarding the 14th Amendment.

“This case is a right-wing fantasy, full stop. That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.

“Even if the court ultimately rules against Trump, in a laughable display of its supposed independence, the fact that fringe attacks on our most basic rights as citizens are being seriously considered is outrageous and alarming,” he added.

Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, said that “it’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” adding that “every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional.”

Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund, asserted, “The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution.”

“We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century,” Mays added. “Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2221594152-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 18:57:31.068724

A justice department memo issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape.
The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.
Gregg’s memo was sent to Prea auditors, who review compliance with the law, directing the monitors to ignore LGBTQ+ protections in future audits.
The justice department, Gregg said, was “currently updating” its Prea standards to align with the president’s order.","The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.

A justice department memo issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.

The directive relates to regulations under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), a longstanding federal law which says incarcerated people should be screened for their risk of facing sexual assault when officials place them in housing and that assessments must consider LGBTQ+ status.

Prea, passed unanimously by Congress in 2003, includes standards aimed at addressing the high levels of violence that transgender, gender-nonconforming and queer people face in jails and prisons across the US. Prea applies to all correctional facilities.

The memo from Tammie Gregg, principal deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which is part of the justice department, said the policy shifts were designed to align with one of Donald Trump’s signature anti-trans executive orders. The “restoring biological truth” order, issued on Trump’s inauguration day, called for transgender women to be banned from women’s housing in correctional facilities and dictated that the federal Bureau of Prisons stop providing gender-affirming care to incarcerated trans people.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gregg’s memo was sent to Prea auditors, who review compliance with the law, directing the monitors to ignore LGBTQ+ protections in future audits. The justice department, Gregg said, was “currently updating” its Prea standards to align with the president’s order.

The affected regulations, the memo says, include policies mandating that trans, intersex and gender-nonconforming people be “screened for risk of victimization”. It also affects regulations designed to protect LGBTQ+ people from discriminatory pat searches by staff, including rules meant to ensure trans women can be searched by female officers and regulations to prevent invasive examinations of individuals’ genitals.

The memo further affects rules on how employees should respectfully communicate with LGBTQ+ people and requirements that sexual abuse investigations consider whether a perpetrator was motivated by a victim’s LGBTQ+ status.

“The proposed revisions to the Prea standards will lead to increased chaos and violence inside prisons and jails, placing staff and incarcerated people in greater danger,” said Linda McFarlane, executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights group, in a statement. “It will allow rapists to act with impunity. And it is already sowing confusion among prison leaders, who have worked for more than a decade to put in place commonsense rules to end prisoner rape … It’s sickening.”

McFarlane’s group has long trained correctional staff on Prea standards and has had certified auditors on staff. In an interview on Friday, she said the immediate impact was a loss of a critical oversight mechanism, and that she hoped institutions would continue to honor Prea.

Incarcerated trans people have long struggled with abuse, even with the standards in effect, she added: “They are already in grave danger. I’ve never met a trans person in detention who has not experienced sexual abuse or harassment while incarcerated.”

The memo comes even after Trump’s executive order has been blocked in court. Earlier this year, some trans women imprisoned by the Bureau of Prisons were moved from women’s facilities into men’s prisons, but the courts later ordered they be transferred back. The rulings have protected individual plaintiffs, but the majority of trans people in federal custody remain housed in facilities that do not match their gender identity.

Spokespeople for the White House and Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.

Kara Janssen, an attorney who has represented trans women in Bureau of Prisons custody in litigation this year, condemned the memo. “This is putting not only our clients in an incredibly dangerous situation, it’s putting all these facilities in an almost impossible position, with the federal government telling them not to comply with their own laws,” she said. “It’s saying you don’t have to be afraid to violate the law … and you can do these searches as disrespectfully as possible.”

Regardless of any changes to Prea, constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment remained in effect, Janssen added: “When people are assaulted as a result of these changes, there is liability for these facilities. That is not going away.”

Shana Knizhnik, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ & HIV project, noted the memo would create challenges for Prea monitors, with at least one auditor warning in a statement to NPR the memo would make their work “more confusing and more difficult”.

Knizhnik emphasized that Prea remained the law and institutions were required to follow it, but she was concerned about “the signal this sends to officials in charge of maintaining folks’ safety in custody”. She added: “This gives more license to individuals to target trans, intersex and other LGBTQ+ folks in carceral settings and ignore their obligations under the law.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc7a6d3f2e7a1abc018719839979abec40073388/0_0_4592_3674/master/4592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4bc6535cf9b2602e6c8ec7c10079ff5",N,,2025-12-06 22:56:26.289659

The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship, a significant legal challenge that questions the interpretation of the 14th Amendment. This directive, which aims to limit automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents, could have far-reaching consequences for immigration policy and citizenship laws in the country. With lower courts blocking the order, the Supreme Court’s decision will determine whether this controversial move aligns with constitutional principles and the nation’s longstanding approach to birthright citizenship.

The Supreme Court has agreed to review President Donald Trump’s controversial directive to limit birthright citizenship, which challenges the interpretation of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This decision will have significant implications on the country’s immigration policy, potentially altering the long-standing understanding of birthright citizenship established by a 19th-century constitutional provision.

In a move to curb immigration, the Trump administration issued an executive order instructing U.S. agencies not to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. to parents who are not U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. Lower courts swiftly blocked this order, ruling that it violated the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. However, the Justice Department appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, with arguments expected later in the current term.

This legal battle began when several states—Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon—along with individual plaintiffs filed lawsuits challenging the directive. The lower courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, arguing that the policy contradicted both the 14th Amendment and the federal law ensuring birthright citizenship. The U.S. District Court in New Hampshire even allowed a nationwide class-action lawsuit to proceed, effectively blocking the executive order on a national level.

The case has already been heard in lower courts, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals siding with the states. In the face of these setbacks, the Trump administration sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to resolve the matter definitively. The Court’s decision to take up the case before a federal appeals court could review it further highlights the significance of the legal divide and the urgent need for a national resolution.

At the heart of the case is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which states that all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are U.S. citizens. Ratified in 1868, the clause has historically been understood to guarantee birthright citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. However, the Trump administration argues that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” should not be interpreted as simply being born in the U.S. Instead, they assert that only children born to parents who have primary allegiance to the United States—such as citizens and legal permanent residents—should automatically receive citizenship. This interpretation could potentially exclude children born to non-citizen immigrants who are in the U.S. temporarily, including those on student or work visas.

The Trump administration’s position aligns with a narrower reading of the 14th Amendment, suggesting that “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” requires a level of permanent, lawful residency. The administration argues that parents must have “lawful domicile,” meaning they are lawfully residing in the U.S. with the intent to remain. In contrast, critics point to a well-established precedent in U.S. law, citing the 1898 Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which upheld the principle of birthright citizenship. In that case, the Court ruled that children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents were entitled to citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers in this case, including civil rights organizations like the ACLU, argue that Trump’s executive order contradicts this precedent and the statutory law passed by Congress in 1940, which was later incorporated into the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. This law codified the understanding that the 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status.

The administration’s argument also hinges on the idea of “birth tourism,” a term used to describe the practice of foreigners traveling to the U.S. to give birth so their children can automatically receive U.S. citizenship. The Trump administration contends that birthright citizenship has created incentives for illegal immigration, exacerbating the strain on immigration systems and contributing to the phenomenon of birth tourism.

As the case moves to the Supreme Court, the stakes are high. A ruling in favor of the Trump administration could redefine the meaning of birthright citizenship and restrict the automatic grant of citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. Such a decision would overturn decades of legal precedent and could have far-reaching implications for immigration law in the U.S.

The Court’s decision will likely come by the end of June, and the justices will hear arguments on the matter during their current term. The case is expected to spark significant debate over the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and the future of immigration policy in the U.S. While the administration maintains that its actions are necessary for the security of the nation, its critics argue that such a move would undermine the core principles of American citizenship and the rights afforded to all individuals born in the country.

Regardless of the outcome, this case represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing national discussion about immigration and citizenship. The Supreme Court’s ruling could set a precedent that shapes the future of birthright citizenship and how the U.S. defines its relationship with non-citizens and immigrants.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/istockphoto-623595614-612x612-12-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:56:28.210455

Potential ICE flight spotted at MSP

What we know:

The plane spotter named Nick Benson witnessed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trucks at the airport, with potentially 14 people being loaded onto a Global Crossing flight. Benson has observed similar activities multiple times since April.

The Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) clarified that they do not receive advance notification of government-related flights, including those by ICE.

What they're saying:

""This plane is going to fly to Omaha, Nebraska next. I assume it's going to pick up another group of deportees there,"" said Benson. He noted that Alexandria, Louisiana, is a major hub for ICE air operations.

Benson mentioned that Global Crossing planes have been coming to Minneapolis regularly, even during the previous administration, but it was more transparent back then.

A representative with DHS provided the following statement to FOX 9: ""ICE does not confirm or deny specific flights for operational security. However, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE removal flights are occurring every day.""

An ICE spokesperson shared a similar statement: ""To protect the security of flight operations, passengers and crew, ICE does not confirm future removal operations until they have landed in respective countries.""

During this time of year when we should be reflecting compassion and gratitude, far too many families in our community are instead living in fear. In my 25-plus years of working as a social worker with children and families, I have never witnessed the level of anxiety and trauma we are seeing today.

Friends and neighbors who have followed every legal step available to them are being arrested and detained without warning. Some are taken from their workplaces, while others are detained in front of their children’s schools. These actions are not only cruel but deeply destabilizing to families who have already endured unimaginable hardship.

Recently, a former colleague and close friend of mine was detained by ICE while simply doing his job. He is a devoted husband, father and friend and one of the most hardworking, compassionate, community-minded people I know.

Without notice, he was transported to a detention center out of state and held for weeks before finally being granted a bond hearing. His family spent every one of those days consumed with fear and uncertainty. After a few long weeks, he was released, but the trauma remains.

This is no way to treat human beings. Right here in Maine parents are being separated from their children, shackled during transfer and held in cold facilities without access to coats or warm clothing. These are not isolated incidents. This is happening across the country and violates people’s basic principles of dignity and due process.

The current administration is actively dismantling legal pathways and constitutional protections for people seeking safety. Many of those being detained are law-abiding individuals who fled instability, persecution and violence and have followed every legal requirement to pursue asylum or obtain green cards.

They have lived here for years. They work. They pay taxes. They contribute immeasurably to our workforce and our communities. And yet, because of a massive immigration backlog, some waiting a decade or more for their cases to be heard, families are left vulnerable to being arrested and detained.

We are punishing people not for breaking the rules, but for being stuck in a system that cannot process cases efficiently.

Detaining working, law-abiding community members without due process undermines both our legal system and our shared humanity. Maine families deserve better. We need solutions, not fear.

Here is where we must start:

1. Invest in immigration courts and case processing. The backlog of more than 3 million immigration cases nationwide is unacceptable. We need more judges (not fewer) and increased funding for the immigration courts and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Families should not wait a decade for clarity or safety.

2. End arbitrary arrests and ensure humane treatment. ICE officers should be required to identify themselves, follow transparent procedures and treat people with dignity. Fear-based enforcement erodes trust and re-traumatizes families who have already survived profound instability.

3. Guarantee due process and access to legal representation. Every person deserves a fair hearing and access to legal counsel. This is a constitutional right, not an optional courtesy, and the government cannot dismiss or adjudicate cases without providing due process.

Maine has always been a place where we take care of one another. In this moment, our values matter more than ever. We must raise our voices together and demand an immigration system that treats every person with safety, dignity and fairness.

We cannot remain silent while families live in fear, parents are torn from their children and hardworking members of our community are punished for bureaucratic failures. It is time to advocate for policies that prioritize human rights, strengthen our courts and provide real pathways to security and stability.

Maine can, and must, lead by example, showing that compassion, justice and accountability are not just ideals, but actionable commitments in how we treat every member of our community.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Trump_Immigration_Boston_65764.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-12-06 19:57:22.243343

Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US.","United States President Donald Trump announced drastic measures against immigration in late November. All asylum procedures were suspended indefinitely ""until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), posted on X.

Further restrictions have since been imposed on nationals from 19 countries. These include entry bans and the suspension of all immigration applications and naturalizations. The granting of permanent residence and work permits, known as green cards, has also been suspended for people of the nationalities in question. USCIS chief Edlow said the president had also directed him to conduct ""a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern,"" including holders of residence permits that have already been granted.

What sparked the immigration crackdown?

The background to these new policies is an attack on two National Guard soldiers in Washington on November 26. The two men were seriously injured by gunshots in the center of the US capital, and one of the victims later died. The suspected attacker, a 29-year-old Afghan, was arrested and charged with murder. According to media reports, he entered the US in 2021, the year of the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, having previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other US government agencies in his home country.

But the Trump administration's recent response is in line with asylum and migrationpolicies that have become increasingly rigid in recent months. The US president used this incident to once again sharply criticize immigration under Joe Biden, claiming that, like many others, the alleged assassin had entered the country ""unchecked"" during his predecessor's term in office.

But a US government file revealed that the alleged gunman was actually granted asylum this year under Trump, Reuters reported.

Which countries are affected?

The immigration ban applies to citizens of countries on three continents. In Asia, this includes Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and Laos. In Latin America, the ban applies to Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela. But most of the sanctioned countries are in Africa: Libya, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo and Burundi.

These are all the same 19 countries for which the US government imposed entry bans in June 2025. And these restrictions have now been tightened once again. They are considered ""high-risk"" because US authorities say that they don't receive enough reliable information about their nationals to conduct security checks. Many of these countries are also accused of failing to cooperate in taking back people who have been required to leave the US.

How are immigrants impacted?

The new restrictions have far-reaching consequences for the individuals concerned: all green card applications, naturalizations, and asylum procedures have been put on hold for the time being. Those affected cannot pursue their applications, even if they were already being processed. Even green card holders could lose their permanent residency status after a new security check. In the worst case, they would then face deportation to their home countries.

Late this week, it was announced that the US government would also shorten the maximum validity period of work permits for refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrants — from five years to 18 months.

Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US. The additional issue of reuniting affected families has now also been made extremely difficult or even impossible because family members will no longer be admitted to the country.

But the US economy is also facing negative consequences as a result of these policies. The freeze affects sectors that are heavily dependent on foreign workers, particularly in health, science, and technology. The refusal to issue visas, green cards, or work permits makes it difficult to import talent and skilled workers in these areas.

Who has criticized these policies?

While the US government considers the measures necessary steps to protect national security, Democratic lawmakers and human rights organizations have been critical. ""Nothing meaningfully links the 19 countries except the administration's opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born,"" Tanya Greene, US program director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""This sweeping change is not about safety. It is about scapegoating entire nationalities to justify discriminatory policies.""

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.
In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views.
Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.
With the right message and messengers, Democrats can show it is vitally important that they win majorities in the House and Senate next year to act as a check and balance on Trump’s destructive presidency.","Growing numbers of Americans are realizing President Trump is a raging bull in a china shop, recklessly destroying the effectiveness of federal agencies, making America less affordable, increasing unemployment, endangering our health and corrupting our justice system.

A November Associated Press poll found only 33 percent of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s management of government, down from 43 percent in March. While other polls show Trump with an approval ratings in the 40s, none show he gets the approval of most Americans.

Public support for Trump will likely fall lower as the affordability crisis worsens due to his tariffs and other harmful policies, and as more is revealed about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This could enable Democrats to win control of the House and Senate in 2026 elections.

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.

Trump was reelected because he promised to reduce unauthorized immigration, slow inflation, make health care more affordable and do much more to improve our lives. Other than arresting and deporting immigrants — often without due process of law — he has failed to deliver.

Instead, Trump has dedicated himself to investigating and prosecuting his enemies and to enriching his family. He has monetized the presidency to nearly double the net worth of his family to an estimated $10 billion since he was reelected, according to Forbes magazine.

In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views. New York City will get a democratic socialist mayor, but far more Democratic moderates were elected — including as governors and state legislators in New Jersey and Virginia, and as local officials in many places.

Although Democrats don’t agree on everything, we share many beliefs. Congressional candidates next year should embrace the following positions on domestic issues to take advantage of voter opposition to Trump’s failures and offer a better way forward.

For the sake of affordability, they should reach reciprocal tariff reductions with other nations to lower prices on imports and expand markets for U.S. exports, creating jobs. Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.

Democrats should promise to reform the immigration system to allow more people to enter the U.S. legally and create a pathway to citizenship. Halt roundups of immigrants whose only crime is being in the U.S. without authorization. Mass deportations are creating worker shortages that are worsening the affordability crisis by raising prices for food, housing and other essentials.

They should restore more than $24 billion in funds Trump cut from clean energy projects, along with a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles and a 30 percent tax credit for homeowners who buy solar energy panels. This would make energy more affordable and create jobs, in addition to fighting climate change.

To address America’s shortage of an estimated 4 million to 7 million affordable apartments and houses, they should launch a partnership between federal, state and local governments and the housing construction industry to increase the supply of affordable housing.

To fulfill our responsibility to educate our children, they should reverse Trump’s dismantling of the Education Department and restore the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs he has eliminated from the department.

They should reform the tax system so that wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fair share. They should also rescind Internal Revenue Service budget cuts to enable the agency to crack down on wealthy tax cheats.

Democrats must end Trump’s war on diversity, equity and inclusion, which is spreading bigotry and blocking the advancement of people who are not straight white men. America benefits when all people can reach their full potential and when the achievements of all Americans are celebrated.

On health Care, Democrats should promise to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of this year, to prevent 22 million Americans from seeing their health insurance premiums more than double. They should also restore medical research funding that Trump has cut.

They should also promise to end Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department and other federal agencies against the president’s enemies. They should restore about $500 million in budget cuts Trump has proposed for the FBI and restore the bureau’s role in preventing terrorism and fighting major crimes, rather than patrolling cities to roundup unauthorized immigrants.

Democrats should also halt Trump’s deployment of the military and National Guard troops in U.S. cities and increase funding for local police departments and community initiatives to prevent crime.

The above positions would benefit the Democratic Party’s candidates by attracting voters and more importantly would benefit America.

Taiwan’s significance boils down to semiconductors and shipping lanes. Washington’s “hectoring” of the wealthy Gulf monarchies needs to stop.

The world as seen from the White House is a place where America can use its vast powers to make money.

President Trump has shown all year that his second term would make it a priority to squeeze less powerful countries to benefit American companies. But late Thursday, his administration made that profit-driven approach a core element of its official foreign policy, publishing its long-anticipated update to U.S. national security aims around the world.

The document, known as the National Security Strategy, describes a world in which American interests are far narrower than how prior administrations — even in Mr. Trump’s first term — had portrayed them. Gone is the long-familiar picture of the United States as a global force for freedom, replaced by a country that is focused on reducing migration while avoiding passing judgment on authoritarians, instead seeing them as sources of cash.

“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world,” it says, “without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories.”

The National Security Strategy of Mr. Trump’s first term, by contrast, cast the world as a contest “between those who favor repressive systems and those who favor free societies.”

The National Security Strategy has no binding force, and some analysts cautioned against reading too much into it as a guide to future actions given Mr. Trump’s mercurial nature.

But the release of the strategy, which recent presidents have generally updated just once in every term, did carry significance as a snapshot in time. Amid the debates swirling among Republicans over American policy toward the Middle East, Russia, China and elsewhere, the document showed how the administration has appeared to coalesce around a commitment to avoid military entanglements and promote commerce.

In an interview, Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who argues in favor of American military restraint, hailed the new strategy as a “true break from the failed bipartisan post-Cold War foreign policy consensus.”

“For too long, delusion undergirded our foreign policy — delusion about America’s role in the world, delusion about our interests and delusion about what we can achieve through military force,” Mr. Caldwell said. “This is a reality-based document in that regard.”

The document codifies Mr. Trump’s well-established aversion to Europe’s liberal governments and his readiness to overlook human rights abuses, as with his “things happen” remark last month about the murder and dismemberment of a Saudi Washington Post columnist in 2018. Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it “discards decades of values-based U.S. leadership in favor of a craven, unprincipled worldview.”

The strategy depicts Europe as facing “civilizational erasure” at the hands of immigrants and its mainstream leaders. It says the United States will cultivate “resistance” to Europe’s mainstream leaders, and asserts that many of their governments “trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition.”

That stance provoked an outcry from European politicians, echoing the shock when Vice President JD Vance castigated German officials in February for trying to blunt the rise of the country’s far-right party. Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, posted on social media that the National Security Strategy “places itself to the right of the extreme right in Europe.”

Outside Europe, departing from decades of precedent in U.S. foreign policy, the 33-page document does not characterize democracy as a value to be defended. Israel and Taiwan — two democracies whose security the United States has long sought to support — are described in the context of their regions’ economic significance, not their connection to American values.

The Middle East, it says, is “a source and destination of international investment.” The document calls for “dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations — especially the Gulf monarchies — into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government.”

In Latin America, the document says, the United States will “reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere.” Along the way, American diplomats are to hunt for “major business opportunities in their country, especially major government contracts.”

“The terms of our agreements, especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage, must be sole-source contracts for our companies,” the document says.

The strategy offers little insight into the Trump administration’s deliberations about a possible attack on Venezuela. While it says the United States should have a “predisposition to non-interventionism,” it also says that American military force is to be redeployed to Latin America from elsewhere “to address urgent threats in our hemisphere.”

Mr. Caldwell, the former adviser to Mr. Hegseth, said that many in Mr. Trump’s “America First” movement “have concerns about a regime change war in Venezuela.”

“But that said, what happens in Venezuela and our own hemisphere deserves more focus than who controls the Donbas,” he added, referring to the region of eastern Ukraine that Russia is demanding in peace talks.

The National Security Strategy takes a far more restrained view of geopolitical competition than prior administrations did. Gone is any reference to the worldview laid out in Mr. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy: “China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests.”

Without describing Russia as an adversary, the new document says that “an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” is a “core interest of the United States.” The goal of such a peace deal, it says, would be both to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia” and to enable Ukraine’s “survival as a viable state.”

China is cast as a competitor, but mainly in the familiar commercial terms often repeated by Mr. Trump. The document says a war over Taiwan needs to be deterred because of what would be its “major implications for the U.S. economy.” It calls for “a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing,” echoing the conciliation of the trade truce that Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, announced in October.

Jonathan Czin, a director for China on the National Security Council under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the new strategy carried “a happier message for Beijing” than the versions published under Mr. Biden or in Mr. Trump’s first term. Among other things, he said, the document’s focus on Latin America should be welcome news for China.

“I think it would be viewed with some relief,” said Mr. Czin, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed.
The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country.
The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy.
City after city has risen up to defend its own.","As Donald Trump deteriorates and his grasp on power fades, he has been lashing out furiously at female journalists and ethnic groups, most recently Somali Americans. His insults land because of their animosity and his power, not their accuracy. Likewise, his administration’s attacks on immigrants are sloppy and driven by lies. It’s strikingly clear that the target is not individuals with criminal records. It’s anyone and everyone guilty of being brown. Native Americans with tribal identification cards, US citizens, people doing crucial work from construction to nursing, military veterans, college students, people sleeping in their own beds, small children: all kinds of residents of this country are under attack.

“ICE raids are cruel, inhumane, and do nothing to serve public safety,” declares Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect. Masked thugs smashing car windows and dragging parents away from their babies, terrorizing whole swathes of the population, and interfering with the ability of schools and businesses to function does the opposite. The rounds of targeted hatred by Trump and his minions – for people from Haiti during the 2024 campaign, for people from Venezuela this spring and summer, and most recently for people from Somalia – rely on defamatory lies and insults, because the facts about these groups don’t support the hate.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed. The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country. In 1776, the 13 colonies that became the United States included a significant percentage of Black and Indigenous people (some southern states were a third or more Black). When the US annexed Texas in 1844 and then in 1848 took Mexico’s whole northern half, a Spanish-speaking population was already settled across parts of what’s now the south-west and California. The first African Muslim in what is now the United States came in a Spanish expedition almost a century before the Mayflower brought its fanatical Puritans to the shores of Massachusetts in 1620.

The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy. Los Angeles, for example is an almost 50% Latino city, and despite the ICE and border patrol outrages, arrests, imprisonments and deportations, it remains so. The city’s very name is Spanish, a reminder of who was here first. All the hatred, all the persecution, seems like the panic of racists pretending they can stop the future of this country no longer being majority white through sheer cruelty.

It’s coupled with an attack on reproductive rights that is sometimes openly intended to make white women have more babies (the US has a below-replacement rate birthrate, which is less impactful than in many other countries facing the same decline, because a young, hard-working immigrant workforce keeps things going). Of course, rather than offering the support that might make parenthood less grueling, they are attempting to realize their goals by punitive means. And it’s not working. Margaret Talbot of the New Yorker writes that JD Vance’s reproductive politics – and insults to childless women – amount to pronatalism, which “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas”.

Likewise, CNN reports: “Reproductive rights groups and other advocacy organizations say these efforts to buttress the birth rate don’t make up for broader administration priorities aimed at cutting federal programs such as Medicaid, its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other initiatives that support women and children. The pro-family focus, they say, isn’t just about boosting procreation. Instead, they say, it’s being weaponized to push a conservative agenda that threatens women’s health, reproductive rights, and labor force participation.”

The anti-immigration and pronatalist policies add up to fantasies of redirecting the demographic future of this country. Both amount to, in the end, dim-witted bullying by haters inadvertently demonstrating that their claims to superiority have to be based on race and gender, because otherwise they’re incoherent idiots.

A lot of the Trump administration’s justifications don’t line up with realities and results. The attacks in the southern Caribbean target small boats not confirmed to be carrying drugs and not capable of reaching the US. Venezuela is not involved in any meaningful way in trafficking fentanyl and much less involved in cocaine trafficking than other South American countries.

“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies,” says a new White House document. Trump and company are sentimentally committed to fossil fuel, especially coal, and are forcing various US locales to waste money on this outdated and toxic fuel while sabotaging cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, is sabotaging public health while promoting anti-scientific schemes to control Americans’ diet.

The premise of the attacks on immigrants is that people of color who were not born in the US are intruders and threats, but from Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago to Portland to New York, it’s the Trump administration’s violent foot soldiers with ICE and the border patrol that locals perceive as unwelcome threats and violent invaders. There is no more dramatic sign of the rejection of Trumpism than the thousands upon thousands organizing, showing up, risking bodily safety, arrest and felony charges to defend their neighbors. City after city has risen up to defend its own. All of Trump’s insults cannot change that.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d8a325b3f1277257e32fe202baec9cae5a4b60/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9f538748b1202e4c24f59ebc9be83a80",N,,2025-12-06 16:31:38.359900

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Earlier today, a three-judge panel appointed by former President Bill Clinton heard oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as they consider whether to uphold a lower court decision from Hawaii placing a nationwide freeze on the Muslim ban. For the second time in the past week, President Trump’s inflammatory campaign statements targeting Muslims faced intense judicial scrutiny as the acting Solicitor General struggled to make the unreasonable sound reasonable.

The Fight Over Trump’s Muslim Ban Is A Fight Over America’s Identity

To be clear, this fight in court over Donald Trump’s Muslim ban is not an ordinary disagreement over immigration policy ― racism and discrimination are on trial, and concerned Americans are fighting back against efforts to make these the official policies of the United States. The intent behind the Muslim ban is becoming a central issue in ongoing lawsuits, precisely because a racist intent taints the law itself as racist ― and unconstitutional.

Iranian-Americans Continue Fight Against Second Muslim Ban

The judge in the Iranian-American lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban indicated Friday that she was not yet ready to issue a new nationwide freeze on the ban. Instead, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan in the Washington, D.C. Circuit requested additional briefs from the Iranian-American plaintiffs and from the government side, in order for her to make a decision some time after May 5th.

Court Hears Live Testimony Ahead of Friday Hearing on Muslim Ban

Washington, DC – DC District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan heard live testimonials on Tuesday from members of the Iranian-American community in the joint lawsuit, Pars Equality Center, et al., v. Donald J. Trump, et al., brought on behalf of four Iranian-American organizations challenging the Administration’s Muslim Ban.

Q & A: Would Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0 Keep Us Safer?

Trump’s revised Muslim ban is set to go into effect this Thursday, March 16th. Since it’s announcement last week, we at NIAC have received an avalanche of questions from across the United States. In an effort to keep you informed, we posed the five most common questions that we’ve received to NIAC’s Reza Marashi and Adam Weinstein. Their answers are as follows.

NIAC Panel on Capitol Hill Examines Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0

“Some refer to it as the Muslim ban, some argue that it does not affect all Muslims so it is not a Muslim ban, that is up for debate. What is not up for debate is that it affects all Iranians. Iranians, of the six countries, make up 58% of the visas that are granted annually” said NIAC policy director, Jamal Abdi, in his opening remarks.

Muslim Ban 2.0 Undermines American Interests

On March 6, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States” barring entry into the U.S. for foreign nationals from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Still a Muslim Ban, Still Permanent

The Trump Administration is fulfilling its campaign promise to impose a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States…” Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani indicated that the President asked him how to implement a Muslim ban legally prior to the first Executive Order, and advisor Stephen Miller indicated that the new order will feature only minor technical changes and will result in the same fundamental policy.

Why Trump’s Travel Ban is Still a Muslim Ban

President Donald Trump’s new travel ban may reduce the chaos at airports caused by his previous executive order, but it will not enhance American security or make the intention behind the original order any less bigoted.

Indeed, in our opinion, the new travel ban is still very much a Muslim ban, even if it falls short of the Trump administration’s true ambitions.

A close look at what the administration has been doing since the now-infamous executive order was issued on January 27 — banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations — reveals a clear intent from Trump’s inner circle to depopulate the United States of Muslims.

FAQ: Trump’s New Travel Ban

What is the Executive Order?

1. On March 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.” Section 3(c) of the Order blocks entry into the U.S. of foreign nationals from six affected countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — who:

1. are outside the United States on the effective date of the Executive Order;

2. do not currently have a valid visa; and

3. did not have a valid visa on January 27, 2017.

This travel ban is alleged to last 90 days from the date of implementation. However, Section 3(e) suggests that — for countries unwilling or unable to provide satisfactory information regarding its nationals seeking entry into the United States — the travel ban will be indefinite. Because the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations, it is highly unlikely that Iran would provide the information necessary to satisfy the standards of the Executive Order. As a result, it is expected that the Order’s travel ban will prove indefinite for Iranian persons.

Sessions May Have Committed Perjury on Muslim Ban As Well

Washington, DC – NIAC Action Executive Director Jamal Abdi issued the following statement:

“NIAC Action is concerned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in his confirmation hearing with regard to his role in planning and drafting President Trump’s executive order banning individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. With new questions being raised regarding whether the Attorney General perjured himself in testimony before the U.S. Congress over contacts with the Russian ambassador, it is appropriate to revisit the record regarding his testimoney that he played no role in drafting or planning the so-called “Muslim ban”, in addition to other immigration-related Executive Orders.

Update: What’s Next in the Effort to Overturn Trump’s Muslim Ban – and What Will the New Executive Order Likely do?

Efforts to overturn the Trump administration’s Muslim ban are expected to take a new turn this week with the issuance of a new Executive Order this coming Wednesday.

Dozens more have retired or resigned. The diminishing headcount and mounting backlog of cases is fueling further disorder at immigration courts already roiled by masked federal agents detaining migrants and reduced pathways to legal status.

The courtroom culling process has become formulaic, ousted judges and their advocates told POLITICO: The judges receive an email stating Attorney General Pam Bondi has removed them from their posts, pursuant to Article II of the Constitution; their names are immediately struck from the Department of Justice’s website; and the news of the latest wave ricochets around chat groups formed among ousted colleagues.

Immigration judges are treated as at-will employees because the administrative courts they preside over fall under the purview of the Department of Justice and are not part of the judiciary branch. Rulings by judges in those immigration courts can ultimately be overturned by the attorney general. The oustings have renewed calls for the immigration courts to be independent of the executive branch — a push unlikely to gain traction in a Republican-controlled Congress.

A Department of Justice spokesperson blamed the current state of affairs on former President Joe Biden’s administration.

“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” the spokesperson said.

The Trump administration has sought to replace terminated immigration judges with military lawyers as a stopgap and recruit “deportation judges to ensure that only aliens with legally meritorious claims are allowed to remain.”

“We all felt like you can’t do more damage than you already have to the immigration courts and to justice and to due process. Yet it’s like, ‘Hold my beer, watch this,’” said Judge Jennifer Peyton, who told POLITICO she was fired in July in Chicago, where 14 judges remain. “New York is decimated. Chelmsford (Massachusetts) is decimated. The San Francisco court is decimated. Chicago is down half. There’s literally millions — millions with an ‘m’ — millions of cases that are pending.”

At New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza, an epicenter of clashes between immigrants, federal agents and protesters, seven judges were pushed out in one day this week. The wave of dismissals leaves 25 immigration judges in a courthouse that in January had 37, according to a comparison of Department of Justice staff lists now and then.

The most senior among the New Yorkers is former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Amiena Khan, who is on the American Accountability Foundation’s “bureaucrat watch list.” Peyton of Chicago is also on the conservative opposition research group’s list. Of the nine judges targeted by it, only one remains on the bench: Claudia Cubas of Maryland.

Many of the judges are challenging their dismissals.

Cassin of New York has begun the process. Former Judge Tania Nemer of Ohio, who said she was fired in February, filed a lawsuit this week alleging the Department of Justice discriminated against her on the basis of sex, national origin and political affiliation. Nemer is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon and had sought local office as a Democrat.

Bondi referenced Nemer’s lawsuit at a Cabinet meeting, quipping, “Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

The seven judges terminated in New York on Dec. 1 are all women: Khan, Lisa Ehrens, Maria Lurye, Alice Segal, Evalyn Douchy, Theodora Kouris and Lori Adams, five judges and court observers told POLITICO.

The expulsions have intensified the need for independent immigration courts, judges and Democratic lawmakers said.

“These unlawful and politicized firings are definitely just another reason why there’s a strong need for an independent judiciary under Article I or Article III of the Constitution,” said Anam Petit, a former Virginia immigration judge who said she was fired in September. “Judges should not be afraid for their jobs. They shouldn’t be nervous that they need to rule a certain way.”

Reps. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) plan to reintroduce legislation to move immigration courts out of the executive branch. The bill would establish an independent immigration court system.

“By firing immigration judges whose rulings he does not like, President Trump is installing himself as the judge and jury of his own decisions,” said Goldman, who has frequently sought to inspect areas in 26 Federal Plaza where migrants are being held. Goldman is part of a slate of House members suing the Trump administration for barring them from providing congressional oversight.

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has launched a campaign seeking those willing to serve as “deportation” judges to fill the vacuum and is offering additional enticements. According to a job posting, the DOJ will provide a “25% of base pay recruitment incentive for first-time federal employees” placed in New York; Chelmsford, Massachusetts; San Francisco and other cities where a significant number of experienced immigration judges have been let go.

Jeremiah Johnson, an immigration judge who said he was fired in San Francisco late last month, called the recruitment effort a “false advertisement” that makes light of, and offers a bonus for, a position he and others consider a serious responsibility.

“During Trump One, when I was appointed, there was a policy that got some pushback called ‘No Dark Courtrooms.’ We were to hear cases every day, use all the space,” Johnson said in an interview. “Now, there’s vacant courtrooms that are not being utilized. And any attempts by the administration saying they’re replacing judges — the math just doesn’t work if you look at the numbers.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F48%2F97ccc0f14d25b11723eb2167c27a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2226350381,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:31.336507

Signed early in his second term, the order states that children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or in the country temporarily are not citizens.

Lower courts have said the order is unconstitutional, including the 9th United States Circuit Court of Appeals, which said in July that it “contradicts the plain language of the 14th Amendment’s granting of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

They continued to rule this way, even after the Supreme Court said in June that three federal district judges overreached their authority when they issued nationwide injunctions against the order.

The case being heard by the Supreme Court comes out of New Hampshire, and will be argued in the spring, according to The Associated Press, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.
Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.
They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.
“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States.","An administration official said to “expect a full overhaul of all adjudications,” adding: “We are at a critical moment of vetting foreign nationals, not just those from typical countries of concern.”

The official, like others, was granted anonymity to speak freely about the evolving plans within the U.S. government to respond to the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard that killed one soldier and left another in critical condition.

“We need to screen and screen and screen some more because really and truly this is a tragedy beyond belief,” said West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice. “If I were President Trump, I would say, ‘If you think there’s a better way, then fix it.’”

Since the shooting, the Trump administration has moved to freeze visa and asylum applications from Afghan nationals, and said it will audit green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries. Trump has also said the U.S. must “reexamine” all Afghans who came to the U.S. under Biden, and vowed to “permanently pause” immigration from all “third world countries.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears eager to go further. She posted on X on Monday that she has recommended the president expand travel bans “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

“There were some plans already afoot to find ways to revisit some of these cases. It was kind of tinkering around the edges,” said one person close to the administration. “But now, it’s going to be much more systematic, and I suspect they’re going to have to devote more resources to it.”

“I would call it an inflection point,” the person added.

Some of the proposals add procedural barriers. Immigration hawks on Capitol Hill are arguing for U.S. officials to restore standards a government commission convened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to root out potential security threats.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has pushed for legislation restoring those strict screening requirements, argued that chief among those steps would be the resumption in-person interviews for asylum applicants and more rigorous reviews to determine if an applicant has any ties to terrorist organizations.

“Does that take time? Of course it does, which is the point. I mean, the point is to zero in and make a judgment about each person you’re letting in because who knows how long they’ll be here,” Hawley said in an interview.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 on humanitarian parole. His application for asylum was approved in 2025 under the Trump administration. While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.

It’s unclear what inspired Lakanwal, who worked with a CIA-backed paramilitary force in Afghanistan, to carry out the shooting but reports have documented mental health concerns. Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.

Some of the plans under consideration would be unprecedented in scope. Two senior intelligence officials said that people who work in the National Counterterrorism Center are actively pushing the White House on a hardline plan to deport some 2 million people from mostly Muslim countries who entered the U.S. under Biden — and force them to reapply from abroad if they want to return.

The first intelligence official declined to explain how the NCTC arrived at the figure of 2 million.

Joe Kent, the head of the NCTC, has already floated the idea in public, advocating for retroactively vetting recent arrivals to the U.S. and deporting those “illegally admitted” under Biden on his social media account.

Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said NCTC “fully supports the mission to undo the damage caused by the previous administration’s lax vetting standards and get these monsters out of our country.”

Coleman also pledged that NCTC will “continue our efforts to identify individuals with terrorist ties, rigorously vet them, and equip DHS with the intelligence needed to remove these criminals from our country.”

The calls for more action are being amplified by long-time advocates for restricting legal pathways for migrants to enter the United States. They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.

“Many of them were, at best, very, very superficially vetted. Many probably weren’t vetted at all, and we’ve been paying the price for it. Not just with this attack on the National Guard, but in terms of criminal gangs moving in,” said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal pathways to emigrate to the United States.

Under multiple administrations, including under Biden, migrants and asylum seekers have been generally screened for ties to terrorist groups and potential threats they may pose to U.S. national security based on information available in federal databases. Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan — and therefore qualified to apply for a special visa — were typically initially vetted by military personnel at bases overseas. And not all Afghan refugees were offered humanitarian parole. Many still wait at U.S. military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of Special Immigrant Visas that would allow them to enter the United States.

Still, the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees.

In a letter Friday, all eight Republicans on the Senate Intelligence panel urged acting national security adviser Marco Rubio to fully implement the recommendations of the OIG report and to remove Afghan “evacuees” deemed a security risk.

Not all of the White House’s allies are pushing for immediate and dramatic action. Some Republicans are voicing caution, wanting to learn more about the shooter before pushing for major changes.

“Secretary Noem says that he was radicalized after he came to the United States, and that may be, but we just don’t have the facts yet,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who in the past has supported visa programs for Afghans who helped the U.S. in its two-decade war. “We don’t have the facts about the extent to which, if any, President Biden’s administration vetted the folks. We were told they would all be vetted, but we don’t know if that was the case or not.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is “working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history” as a way to correct damage from the Biden administration’s “reckless approach” to refugee settlement. McLaughlin added that the Trump administration is “reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from countries of concern.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump is “fulfilling his promise every day and any policy changes needed to more effectively achieve” his goal to “put America first and carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.”

Much of what the administration has carried out in recent days has built on its gradual steps to increase scrutiny of applications and reduce pathways to legally enter the United States, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

“It’s an escalation, but it’s building on these already extraordinary measures that they had been taking or trying to take,” Bush-Joseph said.

Among the changes, Bush-Joseph said, could be the reintroduction of rules around asylum introduced during the first Trump presidency. Many of those rules were blocked in the courts during Trump’s first term, but the administration has already shown a willingness to revamp other immigration policies that were hampered by litigation back then, such as changes to the diversity visa lottery.

Ken Cuccinelli, who served as acting deputy DHS secretary during the first Trump administration and wrote the chapter of a 2024 Heritage Foundation report that previewed many of the immigration policy changes Trump has since made, said that the administration should pursue a three-pronged policy of blocking new applicants from countries where vetting is impossible, re-vetting all applicants in the U.S. from those nations and deporting anyone who cannot be properly screened.

How far the efforts will go to re-screen foreign nationals is unclear. The first senior intelligence official said that senior White House officials have been briefed on the plan to deport the 2 million migrants from counterterrorism officials.

The second senior intelligence official cautioned that “a lot of things are floating around right now” in response to the shooting, but confirmed this idea was one of them.

In the interim, the political pressure is bubbling to the surface, as even lawmakers who have historically backed programs that grant Afghans and others who supported the U.S. military entry to the United States are acknowledging a need for more vetting.

“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States. I am very firm on that,” said Sen.

The justices will hear Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the country. The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer. The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, is part of his Republican administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings. But the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location. The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment. Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. His order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force. In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court, however, did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional. Every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under longstanding rules. The case under review comes from New Hampshire. A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order. “No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s national legal director, said in a statement, adding, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.” The administration had also asked the justices to review a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. That court, also in July, ruled that a group of Democratic-led states that sued over Trump’s order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others. The justices took no action in the 9th Circuit case. The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. “The Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children — not … to the children of aliens illegally or temporarily in the United States,” top administration top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, wrote in urging the high court’s review. Twenty-four Republican-led states and 27 Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are backing the administration.

—

When attorney Andy Armstrong went to the Salt Lake City office of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Dec. 2, he expected a typical appointment.

His client was there with his wife, a U.S. citizen, for an interview to check his background and verify the authenticity of their marriage. That’s the last step for someone to get their green card, or legal permanent residency.

The client was nicely dressed and feeling good, said Armstrong, who works with the Murray-based firm Stowell Crayk.

“There was nothing about his background that gave me any pause at all to think we would have any problem,” Armstrong said.

But instead of being told his green card was on the way, the youth soccer coach was called into a room.

“There were two officers from ICE who said they were taking him into custody to initiate removal action, or deportation action, against him,” Armstrong said. “And they handcuffed him, and they took him away without being able to say goodbye to his wife.”

The client is now in ICE custody. Armstrong expects him to be transferred to a detention center outside Las Vegas.

In a statement, ICE told KUER the man was required to leave the United States in 2008.

“He was arrested for overstaying his visa and will remain in ICE custody pending the remaining removal proceedings,” a spokesperson wrote.

But that’s a relatively common situation for people at their Citizenship and Immigration Services interviews who are also in the process of obtaining legal status, Armstrong said. Plus, overstaying a tourist visa is not a disqualifying factor for a green card through marriage.

Ultimately, Armstrong expects his client will be released on bond in about two weeks and eventually end up back in the interview room after his time in detention.

“He's not a danger to society, and he's not a flight risk, and he's got an American citizen wife and an American citizen child,” he said.

A search of Utah court records found two debt collection cases under the client’s name, along with a petition for a child’s name change. A search of federal court records yielded no results.

It’s common for ICE to arrest immigrants who lack legal status but have no criminal record. What surprised Armstrong was that his client, who was clearly on the path to permanent residency, was arrested.

The client is scheduled to appear in immigration court in early January. He’ll make his case to the judge, and Armstrong expects him to be referred back to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to continue his case there.

“He ends up exactly back where he started — I mean, status-wise, but he, his wife, his family, his child, having suffered needlessly,” he said.

He sees the detention as a waste of ICE’s time and money.

This is the first arrest at the Salt Lake City office that Armstrong is aware of, but similar arrests have occurred recently in San Diego.

“This speaks to, and this is my own personal opinion, that part of the Trump administration's push to do immigration enforcement is to sow the seeds of fear in the immigrant community so that they either self-deport or that they don't try to become legalized,” he said.

That’s even affecting clients with straightforward immigration cases.

“You've got a lot of people here who are very afraid, including people who should not be afraid because they've done everything the right way,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/16461e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4900x2573+0+309/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fd2%2Fc6137b90482296167a131b72765e%2F20251205-ml-img-1523.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 16:32:11.568857

The agency issued a news release saying that the arrestees had criminal records and blaming Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for local sanctuary policies. But some local immigration attorneys say law-abiding immigrants are being swept up in the arrests.

Immigrant advocacy groups told Sahan Journal that while they don’t have exact numbers, they believe, based on family and eyewitness accounts, that there have been more people arrested in Minnesota this week than the 12 reported by DHS.

“Every time ICE [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] begins an operation and focuses their attention on a certain city, they plan to make as many arrests as possible,” said Erika Zurawski, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.

Immigration agents have been seen making arrests on the streets primarily in south Minneapolis and Richfield, Zurawski said. Agents typically arrive in two to three vehicles and are usually seen wearing face masks and vests that read “POLICE.”

Local law enforcement don’t wear face masks and their vehicles are marked with clear signage with their city or county’s name, she said.

‘They’ve done nothing wrong’

Local immigration attorneys tell Sahan Journal they’ve received a handful of new clients this week as a direct result of the ICE operation targeting Somali residents.

The clients fall into two categories:

They immigrated to the United States within the last few years and are not U.S. citizens, but filed official paperwork with the government to receive asylum, and are awaiting a final decision.

They’ve been in the country for a long time and are not U.S. citizens, but are here legally under other immigration status, such as green cards. However, they have a prior deportation order from several years ago for a number of reasons, including a criminal conviction.

David Wilson, a Minneapolis-based attorney, said he took on two new clients this week who already have to check in with ICE on periodic bases as part of their ongoing asylum cases. Both were detained during their check-ins this week, Wilson said.

“They were compliant,” Wilson said. “They were doing the check-ins. They don’t have any criminal history. They’ve both been going to court. They’ve both been submitting their documents. They were in the queue waiting for a trial date.”

On Thursday, the federal Department of Homeland Security wrote in a statement that the 12 people arrested in the Twin Cities this week represented “the worst of the worst,” including “child sex offenders, domestic abusers, and violent gang members.” Wilson, however, opined that the brunt of people experiencing fallout from the Twin Cities operation are pawns in a political dispute between Trump and Minnesota Democrats.

“These are real people living real lives,” Wilson said of many other ICE detainees. “They’ve done nothing wrong but being from the wrong country at a time when the president gets mad.”

Abdi Jabane, another Minneapolis immigration attorney, said he’s obtained one new client who was swept up in ICE activity this week. The client, who is a Somali man from Ethiopia, came to the United States within the last two years and has a pending asylum application. Jabane said he was still researching information about how and why this client was arrested, but added that the client was also attending regular check-ins with ICE.

Wilson and Jabane said they have other Somali clients who were questioned by ICE this week but weren’t arrested.

One of Jabane’s clients was afraid to attend his regular check-in with ICE this week.

“He was terrified,” Jabane said. “He went and was not detained.”

Jabane implored all asylum seekers to continue attending their check-ins with ICE.

“I know ICE now is everywhere,” he said. “Stay calm, go to work and go to school. If you are detained, you will still have the right to a hearing and to a lawyer to represent your case.”

He also told people to carry any of their necessary immigration papers on them at all times in case they are questioned by ICE without notice.

“Gather your documents and be ready,” he said. “Do not listen to fear, do not listen to rumors. Stay calm and stay strong.”

One of Wilson’s clients is a female Somali truck driver from the Twin Cities who was questioned by ICE over the weekend. She was arrested, detained and then released several weeks ago as she drove through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Arizona.

Years ago, she was jailed and an immigration judge ordered her deportation. But her attorneys then successfully argued to prevent deportation to her home country because “she would be killed almost instantly if she returned to Somalia,” Wilson said.

Last month after she was arrested by ICE in Arizona, Wilson and his colleague successfully filed a habeas corpus motion, which argues that a person can’t be detained for long periods of time while the likelihood of deporting them remains uncertain. This led to her release from immigration detention.

Then, over the weekend, ICE agents visited the woman’s Twin Cities home and attempted to deport her, Wilson said. She called Wilson’s law office, and an attorney talked the ICE agents out of arresting her, Wilson said.

“It’s only because we had filed and already won [her habeas case] that they were willing to listen to the phone call from the attorney saying, ‘You really don’t want to do this again; we just did this 45 days ago,’” Wilson said. “No one had really actually screened whether she should have been taken into custody, because if they looked they would have seen that they had just lost this issue in federal court.”

Wilson said it’s likely that the ICE agents reportedly seen idling around Somali malls, homes and businesses this week are targeting immigrants with deportation and withholding orders from several years ago.

“If people have final orders [of removal], they might not have any check-ins anytime soon,” Wilson said. “So [ICE] goes out looking for them.”

Local immigration attorneys said such immigrants can be hard to deport because the federal government has already unsuccessfully tried to deport them, and the immigrants’ attorneys likely already successfully argued that their clients would immediately face danger if they were sent to their home countries.

“That doesn’t mean the government can’t send you somewhere else,” Wilson said, noting that east African countries like Uganda and Rwanda have agreed with the Trump administration to take detainees from other African countries.

Community, faith leaders show support

Community members and leaders, politicians and faith leaders have been mobilizing throughout the week to support the Somali community and call out the immigration enforcement.

More than a hundred people rallied Thursday outside the Target store on E. Lake Street in Minneapolis to demand that Target prohibit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials from using their parking lots to mobilize.

Photos and videos recorded by immigrant advocacy watch patrols showed ICE agents using the Minneapolis Target parking lot and one in Richfield to congregate, said Luis Argueta, communications director at Unidos MN, a statewide immigrant advocacy group.

“We know history will teach Target and other companies that darkness does not prevail,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR-MN.

Target issued a written statement to Sahan Journal denying any cooperation with ICE.

“These claims are entirely baseless,” said the statement. “We have no cooperative agreements in place with ICE.”

Suleiman Adan, CAIR-MN’s deputy director, said his group recently organized a state-wide task force that handles reports of ICE enforcement against Somali residents. The number of task force members has reached more than 500, he said.

Task force members operate in cities with large Somali populations, including St. Cloud and Moorhead, and in neighborhoods like Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis.

About 50 people, mostly Minneapolis residents, attended a training session Thursday evening at Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center to prepare for ICE activity in Cedar-Riverside.

“They’re just targeting a new group of people and we have to stand up against it as a community, because they have no right to say who doesn’t belong on stolen land,” said Nick Estes, one of the attendees.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country, with 80,000 residents, according to Minnesota Compass. About 4,200 people in the community are not U.S. citizens, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, but many are green-card holders. Some are undocumented or have temporary protected status (TPS); President Donald Trump announced in late November that he plans to cancel TPS for Somali residents in the country.

A city-wide prayer was also hosted Thursday morning at the Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center in Cedar-Riverside to show support for the Somali community. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the prayer that his department has seen a heightened sense of fear in the Somali community in the past few days, but reaffirmed his commitment to support them.

At a news conference hosted in the Umatul Islam Center mosque Thursday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Trump’s derogatory remarks on the Somali community are harmful. Faith leaders across different religions and Somali community leaders who were also in attendance denounced the federal ICE operation.

“The focus needs to be on who we are as a people and what we value as Americans,” Frey said.

He issued an executive order Wednesday to create signage for businesses and property owners that show support for immigrants, and that mark their properties as off-limits for federal immigration actions. He also prohibited federal, state and local agencies from using city-owned parking lots, garages, ramps and vacant lots for federal immigration actions.

“Every one of us needs to be standing up against this hateful rhetoric because, indeed, when you come for one of us, you come for all of us,” Frey said.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICECommunityResponse2_12-4-3193.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:57:39.371844

The woman who Border Patrol agents were seen chasing, a 23-year-old mother who lives in Marrero, matched the description of the wanted subject, the agency said. They added that the agents had identified themselves.

""Agents immediately stopped upon reaching the property, determined the individual in question was not the target, and all agents departed the area,"" DHS said. ""No arrests were made.""

The agency’s social media post was in response to WWL-TV, after the local television station shared the footage, which drew more than half a million views in less than a day on the social media site.

But the mother of the Marrero woman who was chased by Border Patrol agents told The Times-Picayune on Friday that the statement from DHS did not make up for what happened.

“We've seen this and they're just trying to cover their asses because they did not identify themselves or ask her,” said Ramona Anglin, the woman’s mother.

In an interview Thursday with The Times-Picayune, the woman who was chased by Border Patrol asked only to be identified by her first name of Jacelynn, out of fear of retaliation. She said the masked agents ran after her after she walked out of a corner store and was heading back home.

The agents then stood outside the family’s home for five to 10 minutes, according to her father, Juan Carlos Anglin, who was watching his granddaughter inside at the time. He said he heard his daughter scream and thought she was being kidnapped. Juan Carlos Anglin confronted the agents, who told him they were looking for a woman and held up a photograph of her.

Juan Carlos Anglin said the woman in the photo appeared to be a decade older than his daughter.

U.S. Border Patrol launched “Catahoula Crunch” on Wednesday in New Orleans, bringing President Donald Trump’s federal immigration crackdown to the state. DHS has repeatedly declined to share specific numbers of how many people have been detained in their immigration sweeps so far in the area, but has said dozens have been arrested.

In recent Border Patrol sweeps in Chicago and North Carolina, a vast majority of detainees had no criminal backgrounds. And in New Orleans, allegations that federal agents have detained people with work permits and American citizenship have quickly mounted.

A similar encounter unfolded on Wednesday, when a Border Patrol agent detained a man at a Lowe’s store in New Orleans who insisted he was an American citizen, according to footage of the encounter obtained by the immigrants rights group Union Migrante. The group said he was one of three citizens questioned and then released after agents confirmed their citizenship.

There were 123 listed Democratic co-sponsors, including several lawmakers representing areas ICE and USBP have pinpointed for mass enforcement activities.
Fox News Digital reached out to Jayapal, Smith and the Department of Homeland Security for additional comment on the pushback.","After more than 120 House Democrats signed onto a bill from a top progressive lawmaker to seek what they define as ""dignity"" for federal immigration detainees, critics sounded the alarm that the legislation could forever transform how illegal immigrants are treated in the U.S.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is spearheading the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, along with fellow Evergreen State lawmaker Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. They say it would curb the ""shocking surge"" of allegedly wrongful detentions and inappropriate conditions, particularly at jails run by private companies under government contract.

Critics vociferously objected to that suggestion in exclusive comments to Fox News Digital Friday.

""This legislation isn’t aimed at improving conditions for migrants navigating the U.S. immigration system. It would instead end the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration law entirely,"" members of the Day 1 Alliance, the main trade association representing longtime federal and state contractors in the criminal justice and immigration spaces, warned.

Day 1 Alliance members said that, for more than three decades, both Republican and Democratic congresses and administrations have respected the ""limited yet valued"" role their members play in working toward a better immigration enforcement system.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would lead to the repeal of mandatory detention for those captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to a summary posted by Jayapal, and create a presumption of release, imposing a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and ""vulnerable populations.""

It also would phase out the use of private detention centers, like those Day 1 Alliance members may work in or with, by about 2029.

DEM CONGRESSWOMAN DENIES RHETORIC INCITED ANTI-ICE VIOLENCE, DOUBLES DOWN ON CONDEMNING AGENCY

In apparent response to Democrats being iced out of ICE centers earlier in 2025, including a case in Newark, New Jersey, where Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was accused of accosting officers, it also would mandate that the Department of Homeland Security admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

Another case in Baltimore involved that city’s congressman, Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume, joining others downtown to protest to the press about not being allowed full access to the Charm City’s Department of Homeland Security installation.

""Contractors operate under strict federal oversight and standards set by the U.S. Congress,"" Day 1 Alliance members told Fox News Digital of the implications about the proposed changes.

""They do not make arrests, do not decide the length of detention and play no role in determining the legal status of individuals in their care.""

The members said contractors work to provide humane housing, proper meals and quality medical care for all in their ward.

Jayapal said Thursday the Trump administration has caused a ""shocking surge in the detention of people who have committed no crimes.""

""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse,"" Jayapal said. ""We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.""

Smith added that the U.S. is witnessing ""appalling conditions"" and a ""clear disregard for basic human rights"" of detainees.

""No one should be subjected to overcrowded cells, denied medical care or held in facilities that profit off of human suffering,"" he said, echoing his Seattle neighbor in saying the bill would provide proper oversight.

DHS SAYS FOUR HOUSE DEMOCRATS 'CHOSE TO STAND WITH CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS' AFTER VISITING ICE DETAINEE

Homeland Security officials torched the new bill later Friday.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital Jayapal's claims of overcrowding, mistreatment and wrongful detention are ""false.""

""ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,"" she said.

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" she continued. ""This includes medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by"" dietitians.

McLaughlin added that ICE deaths in custody are at a rate of less than 1%, lower than any previous administration's record.

She praised House Speaker Mike Johnson's ""big, beautiful bill"" as the facilitator of ICE improving detention conditions since President Donald Trump took office.

""Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,"" she said

A release from Jayapal’s office cited a figure of 66,000 people detained since Trump took office and claimed nearly three-quarters did not have any criminal convictions, an assertion immigration officials have rejected.

There were 123 listed Democratic co-sponsors, including several lawmakers representing areas ICE and USBP have pinpointed for mass enforcement activities.

Tlaib should be thanking ICE law enforcement for removing these heinous criminals including pedophiles, attempted murderers, and drug traffickers from American neighborhoods

MICHIGAN – Today, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., toured the ICE North Lake Processing Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, which detains some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens, including those convicted of heinous crimes such as sexual exploitation of a minor, attempted murder, obscene communication and enticement of a minor, possession of narcotics equipment, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, domestic violence, and drug trafficking.

Instead of thanking ICE law enforcement for getting these criminals out of American neighborhoods, Rep. Tlaib is smearing them. She claimed she is going to ""push back against ICE and get them off our streets and keep our families together.""

“When radical members of Congress like Rashida Tlaib visit ICE facilities, they never talk about the monsters that are detained,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Instead of focusing on the victims of these criminal illegal aliens, they use these visits as a poor excuse to demonize our brave ICE law enforcement and peddle FALSE allegations about illegal alien detention centers. This type of rhetoric is contributing to the more than 1,150% increase in assaults against them. When will Rashida Tlaib talk about the American families who have lost a loved one because of illegal alien crime? Too many Americans this holiday season are mourning a loved one whose life was taken at the hands of an illegal alien.”

Below are examples of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens detained at this facility:

“This is home for them, and that’s the sad part,” said Jessica Vigueras, who took cellphone video of the altercation that happened Thursday afternoon inside a bodega in Port Richmond.

She says she heard some commotion outside and ran up the block. That’s where she saw eight or nine ICE agents questioning immigrants.

“They didn’t come with warrants. They didn’t come with papers. They just came and said, ‘What’s your name? What’s your legal status?’ I find it completely not right. I understand if they want to get criminals out, but that’s not the way,” said Vigueras, who is the daughter of Mexican immigrants who own a bakery next to the bodega where the ICE arrests took place.

Vigueras, who was one of several bystanders who attempted to stop the arrest, says the entire community is scared to leave their homes now.

“Why should they have to run? Why? They’re not criminals. They’re just getting food to go home and cook for their families,” she said.

An agent can be seen taking out his taser, but Vigueras says that didn’t stop the crowd from going after the agents.

“We chased them until they got in their cars and we made them leave,” she said.

Vigueras’ mother, who has lived in the city for 33 years, says this recent uptick in ICE raids keeps her up at night.

“It makes me [cry] all the time, they make me scared, sometimes I can’t even sleep all night. I wake up at 2 o’clock in the morning,” Laura Gutiérrez said. “I can’t explain to you. I can’t. It’s very sad. Very, very sad.”

Vigueras says she is deeply concerned for her family and community, and she believes immigrants should not be targeted.

“At the end of the day, whether people like it or not, immigrants make this country. Immigrants are the ones who are making people’s food. Immigrants are the ones who are [at] the back. And it’s sad that we have to go through this because at the end of the day, we’re hardworking people. It’s not like we’re stealing anything or taking anything from anybody,” she said.

It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.

When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?

As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.

Arguments for automatic citizenship

Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.

The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.

One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.

Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.

If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.

However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.

The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”

One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.

The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.

Opposition to birthright citizenship

The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.

This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.

The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.

Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.

Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.

The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.

In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.

For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.

Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.

What might happen

The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.

The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco.","Mayors and local officials aren't just criticizing ICE raids in their cities: They're making life harder for federal law enforcement, while being careful not to go over the line.

Why it matters: The law forbids local leaders from impeding or interfering with federal officers. But cities are finding ways to push back on unwanted immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

The big picture: Homeland Security officials started broadcasting a plan to target sanctuary jurisdictions from the start of President Trump's second term.

This has put local leaders — because of the law, past litigation and public sentiment — directly at odds with Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Driving the news: Homeland Security officials are getting a cold shoulder from local leaders as they decamp to New Orleans for ""Operation Catahoula Crunch.""

""To be in the country undocumented is civil issue. We will not enforce civil law,"" said New Orleans Police Department superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick at a recent press conference.

The local sheriff's office won't allow ICE into its jails to make arrests or use the space for detention, because of a consent decree from a case that started in 2011 and is still being litigated.

The city council, led by Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, launched a new portal for residents to document instances of potential abuse by federal agents. In an interview with NOLA.com, Moreno accused Border Patrol of ""targeting Brown people.""

Zoom in: In Minneapolis, bracing for an ICE operation targeting Somali immigrants over visa fraud, Mayor Jacob Frey signed an executive order this week that bans law enforcement agencies ""from using any City-owned parking lots, ramps, garages, or vacant lots to stage civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Frey's staff is also sharing a notice template that small businesses or homes can display to deter civil enforcement in private spaces.

The big picture: This is happening city by city.

In Chicago, where Border Patrol and other federal agents swarmed the city for months this fall, Mayor Brandon Johnson issued a similar ban on using city-owned space for any immigration enforcement operations, called ""ICE Free Zones.""

Earlier this year, Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, worked to block the re-opening of an immigration detention facility, alleging that the building wasn't up to code. He and other demonstrators made a human barricade in front of the building in May.

Los Angeles County officials approved an emergency declaration that will cover living expenses for people who miss work because they fear immigration raids. It started accepting requests for aid in December.

Between the lines: Cities and states covered by sanctuary laws have learned to prepare for when — not if — ICE targets them. While community organizers are preparing to protest, city officials are also making plans.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco. But the local district attorney hatched a plan to charge ICE agents for violating state laws as they carried out arrests, such as violating the statewide ban on agents wearing masks and possible excessive force.

The other side: The Trump administration has swelled the number of deals between ICE and local law enforcement to more than 1,000 agreements across the country.

That's helped fuel immigration arrests and feed the pipeline for deportations. The Trump team is aiming for a million deportations a year.

The bottom line: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he told Trump in their recent meeting that the raids are ""cruel and inhumane.""

But Trump and administration officials aren't relenting.

The Department of Homeland Security posted on social media, days after starting the new operations in Minneapolis and New Orleans: ""To the violent rioters and sanctuary politicians: You will not stop us. This administration will not be intimidated.""",https://images.axios.com/ArmmfEqjygwNqjcMQrThJGarhzE=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/12/05/1764954874561.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 11:58:18.329367
