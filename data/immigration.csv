St. Susanna's pastor, Fr. Stephen Josoma, and the archbishop have been at odds over the ""ICE was here"" nativity scene that the parish's Pax Christi group erected at the beginning of Advent last month.

The archdiocese criticized the scene, which includes a sign saying the Holy Family is ""safe in the sanctuary of our church,"" as ""divisive political messaging."" The statement added: ""The display should be removed and the manger restored to its proper sacred purpose.""

Josoma says the scene is meant to depict ""Incarnation, 2025,"" adding: ""It reflects the context that Jesus would be coming into if he were born today.""

After the archdiocese issued its statement Dec. 5, Josoma said the display would remain as-is until he has a conversation with the archbishop. Josoma said in a telephone interview Dec. 16 that he hoped that would happen in the next couple of days.

He said there's ""no animosity"" between him and Henning and that he looks forward to the conversation.

Terrence Donilon, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said on Dec. 19 that he had ""no update"" on the situation.

What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

Just over a year after succeeding Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Henning has the chance to surprise his flock with an inspiring move: He could show up at St. Susanna's on Sunday, admit he was wrong to issue such a dismissive criticism, and learn more about what prompted the display in the first place.

A long shot? Probably. But maybe Henning is more inclined to listen than people give him credit for.

When he arrived at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross for his installation as archbishop of Boston last year, he was approached by survivors of clergy sexual abuse. They asked him if he would talk with them.

He approached them and said: ""I'm very sorry, I have to learn. I have to listen.""

His dustup with St. Susanna's presents Henning with a chance to do some of both. And there's nothing like an apology to serve as a gateway to getting at the truth.

That truth — of what this church's nativity scene is really about — brings us to a core principle of Catholic social teaching: subsidiarity.

Subsidiarity is the principle that decisions and actions should happen at the lowest, most local, competent level possible, with higher authorities only stepping in to offer support. That is especially relevant to a parish's work on behalf of immigrants in its midst along with the nativity scene it builds in front of its church.

Both the archdiocese and the parish have done considerable work on behalf of immigrants, with the archdiocese's Catholic Charities operation focused on issues of resettlement, housing and legal defense and the parish focused on support for individual immigrant families.

The parish also supports the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts known as LUCE, which helps warn undocumented people of possible raids by ICE.

A sign beneath the empty crib in the parish nativity sign reads: ""If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.""

The idea of a nativity scene is to help believers imagine as much of the truth of Christ's birth as possible.

Historians trace the first nativity scene to 1223, when St. Francis is said to have set one up in Italy. As Slate reported in 2012:

… The only historical account we have of Francis' nativity scene comes from The Life of St. Francis of Assisi by St. Bonaventure, a Franciscan monk who was born five years before Francis' death.

According to Bonaventure's biography, St. Francis got permission from Pope Honorious III to set up a manger with hay and two live animals — an ox and an ass — in a cave in the Italian village of Grecio. He then invited the villagers to come gaze upon the scene while he preached about ""the babe of Bethlehem.""

The Gospels of Luke and Matthew provide limited accounts of Christ's birth, but each provides some basis for St. Susanna's embellishments. Luke reports that, with no room in the inn, the family was turned away. Matthew casts the Holy Family as refugees, hoping to escape the scourge of King Herod.

Those two Gospels were written 80 to 90 years after Christ's birth, of course, so it's best to look to them more for symbolic truths as opposed to historical fact.

St. Susanna's has explored those truths in various ways in recent years, creating nativity scenes highlighting the climate crisis (Jesus floating in water filled with plastic bottles), family separation (Jesus in a cage) and gun violence (a list of mass shootings).

All of which sets the stage for a discussion Henning could have with the parishioners of St. Susanna's: What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

What have parishioners heard from people who may be undocumented and fear being picked up by ICE? What are some of the ways parishioners are working with immigrants? How might the archdiocese be more helpful to those efforts?

Earlier this month, Henning visited four parishes in the archdiocese as part of a novena to Our Lady of Guadalupe, often regarded as the spiritual guardian of migrants. Why not pay a visit to St. Susanna's with that same inspiration in mind?

Henning chaired the committee that drafted the statement about ICE enforcement that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued Nov. 12 at their meeting in Baltimore. He's the lead voice in a video montage of bishops speaking up on behalf of immigrants:

As pastors, we the bishops of the United States are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in our Lord Jesus Christ. And we are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.

In its editorial following the bishops' statement last month, NCR asked: ""What about real action?""

The parishioners of St. Susanna's have been taking real action. Their bishop should go learn from them.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-12/12.21.25%20Ice%20was%20here.JPG?h=82f92a78&itok=4Zjzv2wB,N,,2025-12-21 10:57:03.547040

Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported.","One in a series detailing how Trump's immigration policies are transforming America.

It was a Trump-era international love story: Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl gets detained by ICE.

But the detention of the Lithuania-born Tatjana Vesiolko is an unusual one, even in an era of increasingly strict immigration enforcement. She is entering her 11th month in an immigration lock-up. Al Dallasta, her American fiancé, can't understand why.

""She's essentially lost a year of her life for what?"" Dallasta said of his partner – a billiards champ, slender with a chestnut bob who friends call ""Tia"" for short. ""She's falling apart in there.""

The day President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, he signed seven executive orders that set the stage for a surge in immigration enforcement across the country. Vesiolko was among the first to be swept up in the administration's mass deportation campaign.

The Trump administration is now detaining more immigrants than at any time since World War II. As of Nov. 30, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported a record 65,735 people in immigration detention.

Deportation flights have become more frequent. But the proportion and number of people like Vesiolko, detained longer than six months, is climbing.

Two years ago, according to ICE data, about 1,300 people or 4% of the detained population, had been held for more than 180 days. That number rose to 6,500 people, or 10% of the detained population, in November ‒ Vesiolko among them.

She entered on a visa waiver in 2009 and stayed, without permission. She has no criminal record, holds a valid Lithuanian passport and comes from a country that accepts its nationals. Immigration attorneys say there are no obvious barriers to her removal.

Provided with the details of her case, the Department of Homeland Security sent a statement: ""The delay of her removal was because of the illegal alien's potential inclusion as a member of a class action lawsuit.""

DHS didn't name the lawsuit or respond to USA TODAY's questions for clarification. Dallasta said Vesiolko was never told she might part of a lawsuit, nor was she given a chance to opt out.

Vesiolko's prolonged detention may also be ""a symptom of ICE working in overdrive,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for immigration restrictions.

""There is no question that ICE and its partners have been making more arrests than can be efficiently processed for removal,"" she said. ""It sounds like a case of someone who slipped through the cracks.""

Vesiolko, desperate to be out by Christmas, decided to share her story. She spoke to USA TODAY by phone: ""Is this just a mean mistake?"" she asked. ""Have they lost my file?""

Boy meets girl

Before he met Vesiolko, Dallasta, born and raised in Philadelphia, believed a few things with certainty.

That the Eagles are the greatest team in the National Football League. That he would never live on the New Jersey side of the Pennsylvania state line. That he wouldn't likely travel abroad. He had no reason to.

He was a year out of a 14-year marriage that ended in divorce when he logged on to Facebook Dating in 2024.

He and Vesiolko exchanged messages for a few days until she fell silent. Assuming she was done with him, he sent a farewell message telling her she was beautiful and wishing her luck. They met that same night for a date at a Chickie & Pete's pub in New Jersey.

For the next six months, they were inseparable – until agents detained Vesiolko at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The couple was returning from their first vacation together. It was Valentine's Day.

He vividly recalls her being pulled aside at the airport: the shock, and the foregone conclusion, when a federal agent told him Vesiolko would be deported. They imagined she would be headed to Lithuania within days.

At home, without her, he broke down crying in the kitchen. She had left him a Valentine's card.

He read it alone.

""There are so many paths life can take,"" she wrote. ""The fact that you and I found each other in a whole world of people is not a coincidence.""

The cost of detention is counted in many ways

Vesiolko has now spent 311 days in custody.

The months have been hard on both of them. Vesiolko, 38, struggles to keep her spirits up; she was a runner and now gets precious little time outside. Dallasta, 43, battles anxiety, which has worsened with Vesiolko's detention. He recently resigned from his job as a safety associate for a major home improvement chain.

With no end in sight to his fiancé's detention, Dallasta tallied up the personal financial costs.

Some $22,000 in fees to immigration attorneys. Another $2,000 in commissary costs. Precisely $6,370 in phone calls to the detention center. His life savings.

Vesiolko counts the costs in holidays missed, dinners she didn't cook, trips they didn't take. And the guilt of what her detention has done to Dallasta.

Her detention is also costing American taxpayers.

The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute calculates that immigration detention costs an average of $152 per detainee, per day. ICE data shows detainees with immigration violations and no criminal record are spending, on average, 48 days in detention.

Past presidential administrations had focused immigration enforcement on violent criminals. Though Trump promised to arrest ""the worst of the worst,"" the mass deportation effort has put all immigrants here without legal documentation at risk for detention and deportation.

After her arrest in Puerto Rico, Vesiolko was sent to Richwood Correctional Center in northern Louisiana.

Over the ensuing months, she made bids to stay in the United States. Because she had entered on a waiver – and such visitors are held to a higher standard of conduct – she was ineligible for bond. ICE didn't respond to her request for humanitarian parole, Dallasta said.

One immigration judge denied her asylum claim, and another issued a final order of removal in June.

She didn't fight it. Dallasta mailed in her passport to ICE.

Dallasta planned to meet her in Lithuania. They imagined a new life in Europe, marrying and applying for Vesiolko to return to the United States as the spouse of an American.

""Before all this happened, I knew I wanted to be with her,"" Dallasta said.

Hope and 'habeas'

Sunday, Dec. 21, marks 180 days from the day her final deportation order took effect. It's also the day the law cracks open a window to potential relief.

Immigration attorneys say Vesiolko could now file what's known as a ""habeas"" petition, a formal legal request asking a court to review the legality of her detention. She doesn't have a lawyer – they're both nearly out of money now – and she has pleaded with her deportation officer to let her buy her own ticket home.

""When people volunteer to pay their own ticket, and they don't have a crime, there's no reason they're not on that commercial airline,"" headed to their native country, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is not involved in her case.

Under the law, immigration detention operates outside the norms of criminal incarceration.

Immigrants can be detained, indefinitely, without charge. They may hire an attorney but don't have access to government-appointed representation. Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported. Immigration judges, which the Trump administration has started calling ""deportation judges,"" are hired and can be fired.

But habeas petitions are a long shot in Louisiana right now, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. Judges often allow the government to say, ""We're working on it,"" and immigrants remain detained, sometimes for months longer.

Ahmed said detention is key to the Trump administration's messaging. ""This is about, 'If you dare come, you better expect you will be subjected to punishment.'""

In response to a request about Vesiolko's extended detention, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told USA TODAY immigrants have the option to ""self-deport.""

The administration's self-deportation campaign, featuring $1,000 bonuses to immigrants who leave willingly, began in early March, after Vesiolko was detained.

'I have a life out of here'

Vesiolko arrived in America from Moscow with $100 in her pocket and the knowledge that her father – a veteran of Russia's armed forces who hated the United States – would never forgive her.

""When I came here, my father found out and I was scared to go back,"" she said. ""He is a very radical Russian, against America. Everything about America triggers him. I had nowhere to go back.""

She had grown up in Moscow, with her father, his family and her Lithuanian mother.

At age 21, after her parents' messy divorce, she fled to New Jersey, where a friend had relocated. She learned American English.

The years snowballed. Vesiolko worked as a housekeeper, under the table. (Homeland Security noted, ""She freely admitted to being in the country illegally and never filing taxes."") She joined a local pool league, made friends and built an American life.

""Every bar with a pool table, people know me,"" she said.

When she met Dallasta for a first date, she asked him to meet her at a pub where she didn't think she'd run into people she knew.

""But right away, friends spotted me and said, 'Hey pool shark! Be careful with her!' It was a funny first date.""

Now they talk five times a day on pricey detention center phone lines and via 30-cents-per-minute video calls.

She calls Dallasta ""sweet cheeks."" When he started calling her ""freckles,"" she taught him the Russian. Now he says, 'Good night, moya venushka."" My little freckle.

""He reminds me that I have a future,"" she said. ""That I have a life out of here. He reminds me that I am loved.""

The months have dragged on.

Vesiolko has watched other immigrant women come and go, be released or deported. Most of the ones detained long-term with her are there, she says, because they are fighting to stay in the United States. She isn't.

Without knowing how much longer she'll be inside, how much longer before she'll see Dallasta face to face, she holds on to an idea from her mother's Catholicism.

That the seemingly endless detention is a penance.

""If that's the price I pay for being with the love of my life, I can pay that price,"" she said. ""Because I know, after this, I'm going to be so happy.""

Those who help people navigate the nation’s convoluted immigration system say the administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants has brought them a rush of new clients even as it has made it harder to help them.

“It’s a whole different world top to bottom,” said John “Jack” Pinnix, a longtime Raleigh immigration attorney and former national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). “It was never a good climate because of a poor court system and horrible backlogs. All that existed before Trump, but Trump has exacerbated it incredibly. It’s a lot nastier, too.”

Immigration law is not among the most lucrative legal practices. Many lawyers in the field do it out of sense of service. But that commitment also adds to the tension as some of their clients face deportation and family separations.

“The stress level is just out of sight,” Pinnix said. “You can’t get some immigration cases out of your mind. You lose one of those and the family is gone.”

Andres Lopez, a Charlotte immigration attorney who works out of the same building that houses the state’s only federal immigration court, said he feels that stress daily. Lopez, who came to the U.S. as a child and is a naturalized citizen, said, “It’s a secondary trauma” to represent clients in a system that now seems intent on deporting as many people as possible.

“We have to represent clients who are fleeing for their lives from situations that are awful. To see clients be dehumanized, humiliated, it certainly has an emotional effect on you as an attorney,” he said.

The Trump administration has fired about 100 of 715 immigration judges, who are employed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Some have been replaced by military judges who are less familiar with immigration law and less inclined to rule against the administration as it seeks to ramp up deportations.

“This administration cares more about numbers than they care about justice,” Lopez said. “It’s all about power, in a way it’s about abusing power and getting away with it.”

Jeremy McKinney, a Greensboro immigration attorney and also a former AILA president, said all areas of the immigration system are now focused on cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

“It’s never been worse because they have turned all the different facets of immigration into one big enforcement apparatus,” he said.

McKinney said federal immigration officers are approaching civil violations with criminal intensity as they round up people suspected of being in the nation illegally.

“You don’t apply force, you don’t need to carry assault rifles, you don’t need to cause traffic accidents to enforce a civil code,” he said. “This is all complete insanity.”

A recent sweep by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents in the greater Charlotte led to the arrest of more than 425 people. McKinney said the numbers would have been higher if immigration advocacy groups and immigration attorneys had not pushed back.

“My goodness, our bar, we have filed dozens and dozens of lawsuits against the federal government challenging their actions,” he said. “At this point, I think my office has sued the federal government at least once a week for the last seven weeks.”

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” provides billions of additional dollars for immigration law enforcement. But McKinney thinks having masked agents who refuse to identify themselves round up people who are not criminals and sometimes are U.S. citizens can’t continue.

“It’s completely unacceptable to have renegade, masked secret police roaming our streets,” he said. “It’s fundamentally un-American. I think that most people are not going to put up with it anymore.”

What needs to be done, he said, is “Congress has to figure out how to do hard things again” and reform the nation’s immigration laws. Rights need to be clarified, case backlogs cut, paths to citizenship opened and immigration quotas adjusted.

“Somewhere down the line there’s got to be enough of a consensus that we can fix this system and protect the American people and protect American jobs and still be pro-businesses and get this done,” McKinney said. “There has just got to be the willpower to do it.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/latest-news/w89s40/picture312963722/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CLT_BORDER_MONDAY_05.JPG,N,,2025-12-21 09:57:16.003241

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications.

This is the highest number since 2004. The news, confirmed by an ICE press release, has reopened the debate on the conditions in which immigrants are detained while awaiting trial or deportation.

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications. They are Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian who was arrested by ICE on December 11 and died the next day at Delaney Hall in Newark; Nenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old Bulgarian who died at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan; Delvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Nicaraguan detained in Natchez, Mississippi; and Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean who died at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

The increase in deaths is mainly due to overcrowding. There are currently around 66,000 people (a record number) being held in relatively small facilities scattered across the United States. ICE lists 131 official centers, but data suggests that between 190 and 400 are being used, including state and local jails and private prisons. Detainees often find themselves without beds, showers, adequate medical care, or quality food because the network is not equipped to accommodate thousands of immigrants every day. The lack of oversight makes the situation even worse. The Trump administration has closed at least two federal agencies that were responsible for oversight and continues to claim that “detainees are in good conditions.”

“There has been NO spikes in deaths,” Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post. “As bed space has expanded, we have maintained higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens—including providing access to proper medical care.”

Representatives of human rights non-profits, lawyers for some detained immigrants, and several congressmen denounce the deterioration of these facilities. “Four detainee deaths in one week is a red-hot crisis,” commented Eunice Cho, senior counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.",https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 10:56:55.010855

Since seeking asylum in the United States in 2022, Mr. Singh has clocked tens of thousands of miles hauling his 53-foot trailer.
‘It’s Just What We as Sikhs Do’ The Sikh entry into American trucking began in the 1980s.
The Department of Transportation crackdown is a frequent topic among Sikh drivers on weekends at Mr. Laut’s gurdwara, a Sikh house of worship.
“Trucking has now become an immigration issue, not a true safety issue,” said Ms. Kaur, who comes from a Sikh trucking family.","The phone vibrated just as Arash Singh curled onto a mattress in the sleeper cab of his semi truck parked in a lot off Interstate 5 in Northern California. As on most evenings, his parents were calling at the start of their day in a tiny village in Punjab, India.

“It’s winter almost. Please always wear a coat,” his mother gently implored on the video call. Mr. Singh nodded into the glow of the screen, before receiving their prayers.

His parents, followers of the Sikh faith, asked God to protect their son on his drive of more than 1,000 miles from Pasco, Wash., to Oxnard, Calif. Seventeen hours, if traffic was light.

“I will be safe,” Mr. Singh assured his mother.

It was an assurance the 25-year-old long-haul truck driver had given himself during his most stressful days on the road. Since coming to the United States a few years ago, Mr. Singh has navigated the perils of America’s highways: the drivers who veer into his lane while texting, ice storms in the Midwest, fellow truckers whose gazes linger on his turban.

Mr. Singh has had more on his mind these days than he would like. Driving a truck is a solitary job, but Sikhs suddenly feel very much in the public eye. While estimates vary, around a quarter of Sikh adults in the United States work in the trucking industry, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association, which advocates for Sikh truckers, and they are concentrated on the West Coast. Two fatal crashes since August involving Sikh truck drivers led to increased scrutiny by the Trump administration, which escalated a crackdown on immigrant drivers that had begun with new English-proficiency guidelines in the spring. Those crashes killed six people; one driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and the other with both vehicular manslaughter and vehicular homicide.

After the first crash, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said foreign drivers without proper training or licenses were a longstanding problem. About 200,000 foreign drivers hold licenses that allow them to drive commercial vehicles. Mr. Duffy issued rules that would make it much harder for many immigrants to drive, amid ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations and persistent verbal attacks from President Trump on immigrants.

“We have a government system designed to keep American families on the road safe,” Mr. Duffy said when announcing the rules. “But that system has been compromised.”

In response, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told at least 17,000 truck drivers that their licenses were being revoked.

On the highways, Sikh drivers, who often wear distinctive turbans, have faced increased harassment since the crashes, said Raman Dhillon, chief executive of the North American Punjabi Trucking Association. His organization, too, has received hate-filled emails in recent months.

“You and your raggedy, reckless drivers need to go back to India,” read one. “You people need to get out of trucking,” said another.

“Everyone is not over here illegally and making mistakes and making the roads less safe,” said Mr. Dhillon, a former truck driver.

Mr. Singh had heard about all the political fuss from other drivers, but he still felt a heaviness when he opened an email on his phone one afternoon in early November.

“We regret to inform you,” it read, “that the D.M.V. will cancel your commercial driver’s license 60 days from the date of this letter.” Mr. Singh had followed the rules in applying for a temporary work permit and commercial license, but to keep his license, according to the letter, he now needed to provide “legal presence documents that meet new federal guidelines,” such as proof of permanent residency or citizenship. He had neither.

Since seeking asylum in the United States in 2022, Mr. Singh has clocked tens of thousands of miles hauling his 53-foot trailer. He has seen more of the United States through the windshield of his 18-wheeler than he had seen of his home country.

“Right now, I am stuck,” he said. “I want to work.”

Not long after he received the letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the federal rules.

For now, at least, Mr. Singh could remain on the road.

‘It’s Just What We as Sikhs Do’

The Sikh entry into American trucking began in the 1980s.

Some followers of Sikhism, a minority religion whose adherents are concentrated in Punjab, India, have long pushed for a separate state. In 1984, tens of thousands of Sikhs began fleeing after a deadly dayslong Indian military operation against Sikh separatists and later anti-Sikh riots in the country. Fearing for their lives, many Sikhs joined relatives who had immigrated decades earlier to work the fields in the rich agricultural land of California’s Central Valley.

As American truckers retired, many of the recent transplants filled the void. Today, around 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry in the United States.

For a long time, Dave Laut was one of them.

He arrived in California from Punjab in 2004 and joined his uncle, who was working as a driver.

He now runs a company called FBT in Bakersfield, an agriculture and oil-drilling city two hours north of Los Angeles. These days, his company employs around 380 drivers, more than 60 percent of them from Punjab. It has become a common migration pattern.

But since California began notifying drivers of revoked licenses, Mr. Laut said, he has lost more than 50 drivers. Many of them, he said, fear that immigration officials will stop them at truck stops or along interstates.

“These are great drivers, no accidents, but they are being targeted,” he said on a recent morning from his company’s headquarters, where idling trucks hummed on the 10-acre lot.

Mr. Laut gained his citizenship in 2010 and six years later cast his first presidential vote for Donald J. Trump. He liked Mr. Trump because he was also a businessman and voted for him twice more.

During the president’s first term, Mr. Laut thought the economy was strong and the country focused on lifting up workers. Now, he said, the administration appears to be going after the blue-collar workers who voted Mr. Trump into office.

The Department of Transportation crackdown is a frequent topic among Sikh drivers on weekends at Mr. Laut’s gurdwara, a Sikh house of worship.

“Everyone wants answers,” he said. “But we have few.”

In November, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, joined more than a dozen other Democratic state attorneys general on a letter to Mr. Duffy. It argued that the proposed rules would disrupt the delivery of food, operation of construction equipment and other essential services, “raising costs and disrupting economic and other important activity across the nation.”

Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, the industry’s largest trade association, supports the proposed changes.

“If you are here illegally, you cannot have a commercial driver’s license. Period,” Mr. Spear said in a written statement.

The rules would also affect drivers who are legally in the country with pending asylum claims or temporary protected status. Even so, Mr. Spear said, those drivers pose a risk because it is difficult to obtain driving records from their home countries.

In 2021, the American Trucking Associations claimed the country needed 80,000 more drivers. But Mr. Spear said that shortage had largely evaporated. Recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that employment of truck drivers has increased around 15 percent since the pandemic. Fatalities from truck crashes last year declined about 11 percent from 2023, according to federal data.

“This is not about anyone’s background,” Mr. Spear said in the statement. “It’s about safety and compliance.”

But that’s not how Manpreet Kaur, a member of Bakersfield’s City Council, sees it.

“Trucking has now become an immigration issue, not a true safety issue,” said Ms. Kaur, who comes from a Sikh trucking family.

“People are scared,” Ms. Kaur said, “and this is yet another immigrant community being targeted.”

A Lonely Road

Mr. Singh clutched the wheel as he drove through miles of dense fog in Northern California. He was nearing the midway point of hauling 15 pallets of potatoes from Pasco to Oxnard.

Before the crashes, he drove across the country, heading east along Interstates 10 and 40. But these days, he avoids states, like Texas and Oklahoma, where he fears being stopped and questioned about his immigration status. Now, he mostly drives up and down the West Coast.

As he drove, Mr. Singh, slender and bookish, talked about his typical routine on the road. He starts most mornings with a cappuccino from Starbucks. To pass the time, he listens to audiobooks about Sikh history or calls a fellow long hauler to chat from his hands-free headset. He listens to his favorite Punjabi rapper, Sidhu Moose Wala, or his new favorite band, Guns N’ Roses.

He keeps the refrigerator in his cabin packed with rice and grilled vegetables from home, but sometimes stops at Indian spots catering to Punjabi truckers. On his rearview mirror hangs a photo of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious leader and militant killed in the operation in 1984.

Life on the road can be lonely — meals eaten alone, missed birthdays of relatives back in India. Recently, his father, who is saved in his phone as Dad with an accompanying red heart emoji, sent him a video from a Diwali celebration, and Mr. Singh played it on repeat.

“Every day, I miss my home, but it’s better here,” he said. “I can work and support my family. It’s safer for me here.”

He left Punjab in 2020, fearful he would be targeted by the Indian government. He supports creating a separate Sikh state, something the Indian government strongly opposes. He moved to London, where he worked in construction and improved his English.

In 2022, Mr. Singh flew to Mexico City, then made his way to the U.S. border. He crossed into Southern California and requested asylum, part of a huge influx of immigrants during the Biden administration.

He is often struck by the homeless encampments near highways. He knows that if he is unable to drive, he will be saddled with a truck loan he cannot pay off and limited work options.

As his truck barreled south down Interstate 5, Mr. Singh took the exit at Lost Hills to stop at one of his favorite Punjabi food trucks.

At a diesel pump, two drivers headed to Seattle filled up their tanks.

“You get the letter, brother?” Mr. Singh asked one.

“Yes, and him, too,” the driver said, gesturing to a trucker on the other side of the lot. “What are we supposed to do?”

Mr. Singh did not have an answer. He just wanted to grab a quick bite and get back on the road.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/00biz-sikh-truckers-2-46217-cover/00biz-sikh-truckers-2-46217-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 07:57:44.303704

In a statement, the Bush Center said turning away Afghans who assisted the United States runs counter to American values.

The criticism follows a shooting by Abdulrahman Lakanwal, a former Afghan soldier, involving members of the United States National Guard in Washington. In the wake of the incident, the Trump administration halted the granting of asylum and citizenship to migrants from Afghanistan and several other countries.

Lakanwal, who was relocated to the United States in 2021 under the Operation Allies Welcome programme along with his wife and five young children, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of a National Guard service member.

The Bush Center stressed that the shooter alone is responsible for his actions and that others should not be punished as a result. It added that, like many Americans, Afghans particularly those resettled in the United States are outraged by the shooting.

Following the incident, the United States suspended immigration applications from Afghanistan and several other countries. The Bush Center said the decision means Afghans who assisted the United States but remain stranded in Afghanistan will not be issued travel visas, while the cases of thousands of refugees already in the country will be re-examined.

The statement said officials should focus on what could have been done to prevent the attack, rather than targeting Afghans as a group. It noted that US immigration policies have long required reform and that revisiting vetting procedures could form part of that effort.

The Bush Center said the United States should remember that one of its defining strengths is its history of offering refuge to the poor and the oppressed. It added that America’s values and commitment to freedom are why many Afghan men and women, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, took great risks to stand with the United States and continue to seek a free and just future for their country.

According to the center, many Afghans were forced to flee because of the brutality of the Taliban regime and because of their opposition to it.

Earlier, 61 members of the US Congress also criticised the Trump administration’s actions in a letter to the US secretaries of state and homeland security, accusing the administration of exploiting the attack and collectively punishing Afghan migrants.

The policy shift has heightened fear among Afghan migrants already living in the United States. Immigration lawyers and refugee advocates in the Sacramento area of California, home to one of the country’s largest Afghan communities, have reported an increase in detentions and the cancellation of asylum-related interviews.

The Associated Press reported that since November 26, at least 24 Afghan migrants mostly in Northern California have been detained. In the past week alone, at least nine Afghan men were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they appeared for routine case-status checks.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/b54c91cc600bc7f7b7e261789cbc5f501eef7216-576x384.jpg?rect=0,41,576,302&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-21 07:57:48.781588

Trump has already surged immigration agents into major US cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed ​with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status. ICE and Border Patrol will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 — a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July. Administration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.

The expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Miami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling ‌have suggested rising concern among ‌voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics. “People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore ‌as ⁠much ​as it ‌is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,” said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican political strategist. “There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.” Trump’s overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50 percent in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major US cities, to 41 percent in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue. Rising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining US citizens.

’NUMBERS WILL EXPLODE’

In addition to expanding enforcement actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants ⁠have been deported since Trump took office in January.

White House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ‌the US-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more ‍officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.

“I think you’re going to ‍see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.

Homan said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.

Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the ‍center-left group Third Way, said US businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump’s immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.

Pierce said it will be interesting to see “whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.”

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to ​US cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.

Some businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors ⁠walk them. Some US citizens started carrying passports. Despite the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.

Some 41 percent of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6 percent of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted. The Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of US citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.

PLANS TO TARGET EMPLOYERS

The administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the US economy and Republican-leaning business owners.

Replacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress. Administration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.

Some immigration hard-liners have ‌called for more workplace enforcement.

“Eventually you’re going to have to go after these employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”

LONDON: London’s Metropolitan Police have used powers that have been withdrawn to clamp down on pro-Palestine rallies in the capital, legal experts have said.

The Guardian and Liberty Investigates obtained evidence that police officers had imposed restrictions on at least two protests based on the principle of “cumulative disruption.” But that power was withdrawn by the Court of Appeal in May, according to legal experts.

All references to cumulative disruption have been removed from relevant legislation, yet the Home Office and the Met continue to insist that police officers retain the power to consider the concept when suppressing protests.

On May 7, five days after the powers were withdrawn, the Met banned a Jewish pro-Palestine group from holding its weekly rally in north London, citing the cumulative impact on the neighborhood’s Jewish community.

Last month, the Met forced the Palestine Coalition to change the route of its rally on three days’ notice, highlighting the cumulative impact on businesses during Black Friday weekend.

Raj Chada, a partner at Hodge, Jones & Allen and a leading criminal lawyer, said: “There is no reference to cumulative disruption in the original (legislation). The regulations that introduced this concept were quashed in May 2025, so I fail to see how this can still be the approach taken by police. There is no legal basis for this whatsoever.”

The Met appeared “not to care” if it was acting within the law, the Network for Police Monitoring said, adding that the revelation surrounding “cumulative disruption” demonstrated an “ongoing crackdown on protest” that had reached an “alarming point” by police in London.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans in October to reintroduce the power to consider cumulative impact in toughened form.

But Nick Glynn, a retired senior officer from Leicestershire Police, said: “The police have too many protest powers already and they definitely don’t need any more. If they are provided with them, they not only use them (but) as in this case, they stretch them.

“They go beyond what was intended. The right to protest is sacrosanct and more stifling of protest makes democracy worth less.”

Cumulative disruption was regularly considered and employed in regulations if protests met the threshold of causing “serious disruption to the life of the community.”

The Court of Appeal withdrew the power following a legal challenge by human rights group Liberty.

Ben Jamal, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign’s director, was reportedly told by Alison Heydari, the Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, that her decision on imposing protest regulations “will be purely around the cumulative effect of your protests.”

She reportedly added that “this is not just about Saturday’s protest but it’s a combination of all the impacts of all the processions so far,” referencing “serious disruption” to the business community.

“You’ve used this route in November 2024, and you’ve used it a few times before then as well. So, there is an impact.”

The repeated disruption to PSC-hosted marches, the largest pro-Palestine events in London, was a “demobilizer,” Jamal said.

It also caused confusion about march starting points and led to protesters being harassed by police officers who accused them of violating protest conditions, he added.

A Met spokesperson told The Guardian: “The outcome of the judicial review does not prevent senior officers from considering the cumulative impact of protest on the life of communities.

“To determine the extent of disruption that may result from a particular protest, it is, of course, important to consider the circumstances in which that protest is to be held, including any existing disruption an affected community is already experiencing.

“We recognise the importance of the right to protest. We also recognise our responsibility to use our powers to ensure that protest does not result in serious disorder or serious disruption. We use those powers lawfully and will continue to do so.”",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/12/21/4669785-399591740.jpg?itok=1S0DaBxW,N,,2025-12-21 10:57:28.517646

For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare.
The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time.
Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world.
In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation.","Early this month, The 19th reported that a 22-year-old mother named Nayra Guzman was kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on her way to the neonatal intensive care unit to see her newborn daughter, just days after a long and complicated delivery. While her daughter remained hospitalized, Guzman—still recovering from a C-section and managing Type 1 diabetes—was taken to an immigration detention center and held for 34 hours without adequate medical care, food, or water, or access to a breast pump.

This is not an isolated failure. It is reproductive violence by design.

Immigration in the US has always been about control—controlling who belongs, who gets to build a family, and who is deemed worthy of safety and care. Early laws like the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 Immigration Act codified eugenicist ideas about which communities were deemed “desirable” and which the country sought to exclude. During World War II, Japanese Americans were subject to mass incarceration, families were separated, pregnancies endangered, and women sterilized. More recently, between 2017 and 2021, more than 4,600 children were kidnapped at the US border—1,360 of whom still remain unaccounted for.

Reports show this has been the deadliest year in immigration detention since 2004. Next year is projected to be even worse. People are dying from untreated infections, suicide, dehydration, and preventable complications. Investigations have documented hundreds of human-rights abuses—including pregnant people miscarrying, being shacked across their stomachs during transport, placed in solitary confinement, and denied translation during medical procedures.

We must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely.

Major medical, public health, and advocacy organizations have long recognized that pregnant and postpartum people should not be incarcerated. Under the Obama administration, ICE was directed to avoid the detention of pregnant people whenever possible, citing serious health risks and the agency’s inability to provide appropriate care. Under both Trump terms, those protections were rolled back. And last month, Intercept uncovered that the Trump administration has been actively concealing how many pregnant people are in ICE custody.

What we don’t know should scare us even more. Until recently, the Department of Homeland Security was required to publish semiannual reports detailing how many pregnant, postpartum, and lactating people were detained, and what care they received. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, those reports have stopped, and Congress quietly dropped the reporting requirement altogether.

Without even basic reporting requirements, what happens inside detention becomes nearly impossible to track, and people vanish. They are transferred in the middle of the night, across state lines, with no transparency, and no way for their families to know where their loved ones are or if they’re safe.

What we are seeing today are the consequences of a system rooted in racialized policing and mass incarceration—one that criminalizes migration and is built to financially benefit from human suffering. Today, detention quotas and private contracts dictate immigration policy.

For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare. But by the 1980s, as the ""War on Drugs"" expanded the criminal legal system, immigration enforcement adopted the same punitive logic. The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time. After 9/11, detention intensified with the “War on Terror” and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Private prison companies secured lucrative federal contracts, new facilities opened nationwide, and immigration violations—many of them civil, not criminal—were now punished with incarceration. ICE’s own data shows roughly 72% of people in detention have no criminal record. Yet thousands are incarcerated for civil violations that carry no criminal penalty under federal law.

As prison beds became profitable, people became commodities. Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world. In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation. The two biggest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group, have reported record-breaking profits and described the Trump administration as offering “unprecedented growth opportunities.”

As climate change, war, and economic and political instability drive global displacement and migration, the US has responded with cages instead of care. And apathy feels endless. Politicians who call themselves “pro-life” support policies that detain pregnant people, criminalize pregnancy, and separate families. The American people, exhausted and complacent, have learned to tune it out. Silence has become a coping mechanism.

Working in policy, I live with a constant tension: I know change is incremental, that the system moves slowly, but I am also an abolitionist. I do not believe in prisons or borders. I believe health and reproduction are human rights, and that no one should be imprisoned for migrating or for being pregnant. I think of my policy work as harm reduction—protecting people’s dignity and autonomy now, as we fight for collective liberation in the future.

Calls to release pregnant people from detention are growing. In November, the Democratic Women’s Caucus declared the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing people in ICE custody “unacceptable,” and last week, Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez introduced a resolution urging congressional action.

But that demand cannot come from advocates and politicians alone—change depends on ordinary people determined to not look away. Our outrage is long overdue. Call your representatives and let them know that cruelty is a political choice we refuse to normalize. Join groups organizing on the ground, donate to local defense funds, and talk about this in your circles.

In the long term, we must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely. That vision is at the heart of reproductive justice—because every struggle is connected, and every win brings us closer to the world we deserve.

I was watching television in 1954 when Welch, then the attorney for the U.S. Army, asked Sen. McCarthy, “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?”

McCarthy, senator from Wisconsin, had been falsely accusing many people in the government of being Communists and he likewise smeared a young lawyer on Welch’s team. Welch asked Sen. McCarthy the question that made Americans realize that the senator did not have basic decency.

Americans like to think that we are a moral people, and because we are a moral people, we act decently toward all people. A major claim to decency is that we require our police to follow due process in apprehending those who have done wrong. Like all nations we have written law, but in addition to the written law, we have the unwritten law for government officials to follow as they enforce the laws, such as police are not allowed to hide their identity behind a mask. Due process is the fair practice required as the law is enforced. Cruel and unusual treatment by those enforcing the law is an important place to start to consider what is decent and humane treatment.

An example of indecent and inhumane treatment is the treatment of immigration detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida. It is not consistent with decent treatment of human beings. When people’s heads are pressed down as they are made to walk shackled to their places of confinement, that is not the fair and decent treatment expected in due process.

Due process should be taken for granted by all Americans, and all people residing in the United States, as the way responsible and decent people in the government will act as they carry out the law. This is something that most Americans sense. Sen. McCarthy’s career virtually came to an end after the 1954 hearings in the Senate because people realized that he had stopped acting decently.

The overstepping of due process has been stretched far beyond words as used by Sen. McCarthy. The attacks, for example on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are only a revelation of beginning down the road of indecent behavior by the present Administration. More clearly the actual behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers has often overstepped the kind of decent behavior that officers of the law should follow. This includes chasing people and forcefully arresting them even though they may be American citizens who must hear their rights before being arrested. All citizens also have the right to be represented by a lawyer, which has not been followed by the federal officers.

Many people naturally wonder why America as a prosperous and strong nation cannot take care of its own people and also aid, along with other nations, suffering peoples in the world. In our own nation, Trump prepared the way for indecent and violent behavior by using the concepts of “retribution” and “revenge” in his political language, falsely giving the impression that he has been treated unfairly.

It is really a technique to win the support of people who feel that they have not been treated fairly. By promoting the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, he encouraged violence in political interactions. People who disagree with Trump fear that they may suffer violence against their families and homes. Trump has used very demeaning language for people, especially if they are brown or black people. He is building on emotions of white supremacy and looking down on large segments of the American population that are black or brown. Trump is encouraging racism that America has struggled against from its founding.

Americans like it when other countries want to be like America, but Trump has moved the united States in the opposite direction. America has already lost much of its position of being an ideal nation, yet it is possible to move toward being more like the democracy we used to be in which we emerged from the Great Depression and the racist society we were before the Civil Rights struggle freed us from those eras. Today, our overriding aspiration should be to become a nation where people see decency prevail.

Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force.
For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status.
According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.","Alex Lomong is a man of many labels: He’s a Virginia resident, was a decorated Division I athlete on the Ohio State University track team, and is a middle-distance runner whose times put him in sight of qualifying for the Olympic trials.

He is also an immigrant from South Sudan who was granted Temporary Protected Status. Now, with the Trump administration’s plan to end TPS designation for South Sudanese nationals on Jan. 5, Lomong is one of many facing an uncertain future in the United States.

“Ever since I’ve been here, this is the only home I knew,” Lomong, 28, told NBC News.

Born in a small village in what is now South Sudan, Lomong fled with his mother to Kenya in 2003 as violence at home escalated. He came to the United States in 2009 at age 11 on a student visa and quickly emerged as a standout runner. The end of TPS could mean that he, as well as hundreds of others, will be forced to return to a country with widespread famine and political instability.

“Being deported there is basically like a suicide mission,” Lomong said.

TPS provides temporary legal status to people whose home countries are deemed critically unsafe. South Sudan received the designation in 2011 after it seceded from Sudan to become an independent nation. TPS for South Sudanese people has been extended multiple times over the years, and many have depended on it to remain in the United States.

“You have people who have been relying on that status for at least 14 years, who have paid their taxes, worked, built lives here, and contributed to the U.S. economy,” said Mariam Masumi, an immigration lawyer who works with TPS holders in Virginia.

South Sudan remains deeply unstable, with ongoing violence and mass displacement. The United Nations has warned of widespread hunger, saying millions face food insecurity amid conflict and economic collapse. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that South Sudan is now among a group of five countries newly subject to full U.S. entry restrictions and travel limitations.

Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force. For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status. They fled violence in their home country to brave Maine’s blistering cold and rebuild their lives.

South Sudanese people have since opened grocery stores and churches, and became nonprofit leaders.

John Ochira is the previous president of the South Sudanese Community Association of Maine and founded the Community Champions League, a soccer program for low-income players in the greater Portland area. A naturalized citizen, he came to the United States in 2005 when he was 17 years old.

“I feel super lucky to have come when I came,” Ochira said. “Having come here as a refugee, I was able to naturalize, but not everybody around me has had the privilege to get naturalized.”

TPS allows people already in the U.S. to stay and work legally for a limited time while conditions in their home country are unsafe, but it does not provide a path to permanent residency, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager at the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition. Refugee status is granted to people outside the U.S. who face persecution and are resettled with legal status that can lead to citizenship, he said.

Matthew Long, a reverend at Portland’s Sudanese Fellowship Presbyterian Church, said that his community of South Sudanese worshippers panicked after hearing the news of TPS ending. Some, he said, have had trouble finding affordable legal representation.

“We should all be protected by the law in this country, but this is not the case right now,” Long said.

Issac Gang, an associate professor at George Mason University and the U.S. Missions representative for the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, said that the Sudanese community in Washington, D.C., is also preparing for the possibility of deportations in January.

“This status has been around for a while, and a good number of our people have enjoyed the status. Given what’s happening in South Sudan, we never expected it to be terminated, because you look at the war and the civil war and the problems, we didn’t expect a termination,” Gang said.

In October, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan issued a stark warning that political corruption and crisis is leading to an increase in armed violence, deepening grim human rights conditions. According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.

“Do not travel to South Sudan for any reason. U.S. citizens are at risk due to unrest, crime, health, kidnapping, and landmines,” the advisory stated.

“South Sudan still remains very much in a dire humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people just even in the last year have left the country,” Masumi said. “It’s not even just a reintegration at this point. You’re having people return to a country where, although yes, there’s no full-scale civil war, there’s still a significant amount of problems within the country.”

Now, facing the prospect of being sent back to famine and conflict, TPS holders have few viable pathways to remain in the United States.

“There are very limited options for folks. There may be other venues or pathways for immigration that they could qualify under, but it is very difficult to access them,” Torres said.

Torres said that the asylum system is so backlogged that cases can take eight to 10 years, and the traditional refugee admissions program has been replaced by a new Trump administration system that advocates argue does not follow the requirements Congress set in 1980.

“Under normal circumstances, TPS holders who lose status might shift to another category like asylum, an H-visa, or another visa they qualify for. But those avenues are largely closed, leaving almost no alternative pathways for people to remain in the country,” Torres said.

Even with the possibility of being returned to South Sudan without any living relatives there, Lomong still holds onto his dreams of becoming a U.S. Olympian, like his brother Lopez, who was a 2008 U.S. flag bearer. He also still hopes to build a life here without the constant fear of having to leave.

“I think it’s sad that we are just all a bunch of pawns in this big chess game, and we don’t have a choice to make any moves,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251210-Alex-Lomong-mn-1540-ff5822.jpg",N,,2025-12-21 06:56:43.715454

In D.C., a Defense Department worker looked up from a pile of congressional inquiries to check the clock.","A State Department worker watched on television as President Donald Trump, hours into his second term, signed executive orders that halted relocation flights for Afghan refugees — which her office existed to coordinate. She wondered: What would happen now?

A Veterans Affairs staffer in that agency’s equity office watched Trump sign another document, this one outlawing diversity programs, and thought, “It’s over.” And in a Social Security building, a woman wandered over to her co-worker’s desk worried about Russell Vought, Trump’s pick for budget director. Vought said he wanted to put federal workers “in trauma,” she pointed out, and would soon decide which agencies to cut and by how much.

“It isn’t easy to fire federal employees,” her co-worker told her. “We have all these protections. We’ll be okay.”

He was wrong. The United States’ 2.4 million federal employees were about to get caught up in a once-unthinkable overhaul of the nation’s sprawling bureaucracy, carried out in less than a year by one of the most polarizing presidents in American history.

Missions have shifted or shattered. Entire agencies were deleted. Nearly 300,000 employees were forced out of the federal workforce. The Trump administration froze or shut off billions of dollars in scientific research, gutted or eliminated offices and programs devoted to civil rights and diversity, rewrote the federal hiring system to reward loyalty to the president, and shrank Social Security while installing Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents in hundreds of new offices across the country.

More changes are coming: Trump officials are planning to cut tens of thousands of open positions from the Department of Veterans Affairs, downgrade performance ratings across the government, and replace the State Department’s traditional condemnation of torture and the persecution of minorities worldwide with scrutiny of abortion and youth gender transitioning in other countries.

Reached for comment, White House spokeswoman Liz Huston wrote in an emailed statement: “President Trump was given a clear mandate to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse from federal government. In less than a year in office, he has made significant progress in making the federal government more efficient to better serve the American taxpayer.”

A White House official who declined to give their name also shared 19 bullet points listing Trump’s accomplishments transforming the government in 2025. These included processing a record 2.5 million ratings claims at Veterans Affairs; ending the Biden-era Digital Equity Act, which, the official wrote, “provided billions in handouts based on race”; allowing fossil fuels to be used in federal buildings again; halting operations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; terminating “all federal Fake News media contracts”; requiring that agencies cut 10 existing rules or regulations for every new rule introduced; downsizing the federal bureaucracy; ordering staff back to the office five days a week; and shuttering “radical and wasteful government sponsored” diversity programs.

Several federal agencies did not respond to requests for comment, including Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This account of what happened inside the U.S. government in 2025 is based on a year’s worth of messages and interviews with more than 1,200 current and former federal workers. More than 200 also agreed to fill out a Washington Post survey asking about their experiences. Thirty participated in nearly 60 hours of video and phone interviews, with many speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs or their families.

This is their story.

Google searches for “federal workers return to office” spiked by 600 percent as soon as Trump ended remote work. Then instructions began to go out.

A Department of Health and Human Services staffer in the Southwest was given five days to move to D.C. A Defense Department worker had two months to report to an office in another state. In Pahrump, Nevada, a Bureau of Land Management employee received an email with the address of the nearest federal building: more than 70 miles away. Edward Brandon Beckham looked at his wife, dying of cancer in home hospice, and knew he couldn’t leave her to commute for three hours a day.

Workers turned a conference room in a Veterans Affairs office in California into desk space for six nurses. Veterans who called to confess thoughts of suicide could hear people speaking in the background. In the Southwest, a woman who conducted background investigations into federal applicants showed up to her new office to find she could hear every word of her co-workers’ conversations — and they could hear hers. She moved into a musty closet, closing the door.

A Customs and Border Protection employee, unable to locate a federal office building, started driving to an international airport that ran flights only on weekends. He walked and shuttled through miles of empty terminals each morning to a desk where he sat, all day, without seeing a single human face. After six months, he quit.

The FBI instructed janitorial staff in Quantico, Virginia, to paint over a colorful mural bearing the words “FAIRNESS,” “COMPASSION” and “DIVERSITY.” Pete Hegseth, the newly confirmed defense secretary, ordered an end to Black History Month celebrations. IT workers at the Transportation Department scraped every mention of “DEI” from their website.

The Social Security Administration shuttered its Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity, where 150 people handled civil rights complaints and harassment cases, and made accommodations for those with disabilities, both SSA workers and members of the public. One disabled staffer learned of the closure by reading media reports and, fighting tears, called her supervisor on his personal number. He knew no more than she did, he said.

At NASA, a worker emailed her office’s equal employment contact with a request. But the automated reply said the recipient “wasn’t found at nasa.gov.”

Dozens of Education Department staffers checked their email to find they were on leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” One of them, Donna Bussell, couldn’t understand why: Her job was helping administer grants to support Native American students. Then she remembered. She’d once served as president of an affinity group for Native Americans and Alaskans at the department.

A Veterans Affairs psychologist heard from a man who ran treatment groups for LGBTQ+ veterans. He was quitting, he said, because VA had become “hostile.” The psychologist’s LGBTQ+ patients stopped showing up to their appointments.

A National Guard employee and former lawyer responded with questions — How could this possibly work? Will the government be bound by it? He was careful not to type the word “resign.” A Veterans Affairs worker texted his wife: “It’s 100% a ‘here’s your chance to get out paid, you might not get that later.’” In Colorado, a Forest Service staffer opened his diary and wrote: “I advised as many people as I could not to take it. … I am coming to the realization that I have to fight back.”

In D.C., an Education Department staffer waited three weeks, then replied “resign,” because he was sure he’d get fired anyway. In Minnesota, Agriculture Department loan assistant James Barnebee resigned, too. It was an easy decision, even with four children: He had voted for Trump, who campaigned on reducing the size of the government. The president, Barnebee thought, was just doing what he promised.

Erica Hagen, 48, hoped it didn’t mean anything when bosses told her not to wear USAID gear to an event with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was touring Latin America.

Hagen, a program officer in the Dominican Republic, listened as Rubio promised the audience that foreign aid wasn’t gone, just under review. She thought about all the frozen programs she had helped oversee: One treating and preventing HIV. Another educating children in rural areas. A third reducing plastic in the oceans.

Not long after Rubio’s visit, Hagen and her colleagues were sent home, dismissed from their jobs. Someone staged a goodbye ceremony. “Participants will paint rocks with positive images and messages to commemorate the presence and contributions” of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the invitation read. Hagen wrote “RIP USAID” in red and black on an oval rock. She left it on a picnic table with nearly 100 other rocks, which someone eventually nestled under a tree.

She flew to D.C. with her three children and husband to find a final set of off-boarding instructions: She had to cancel her diplomatic passport by punching a hole in it. Everything Hagen owned was wrapped in plastic on a cargo ship, so she drove to her local library to borrow a hole punch.

She closed her eyes as she pressed down, wondering if this was how it felt to dig your grave.

Thousands of probationary workers found out they were fired from prerecorded videos. Some were instructed to leave the building in 30 minutes. The Office of Personnel Management’s acting director told probationary staff, “I understand that this may be unexpected and that this is difficult.” One worker asked, “Who is this guy?”

The Small Business Administration emailed terminated employees a number they could call to appeal. But when one woman phoned, an apartment building answered: “Thank you for calling Westbrooke Place.” A Veterans Affairs supervisor texted a fired subordinate: “It states it’s due to your performance which is not true. … You need to appeal it.”

More mistakes emerged. The Energy Department laid off hundreds of engineers, technicians and managers who maintain America’s nuclear weapons before scrambling to rehire them. Veterans Affairs had to bring back workers who staff the Veterans Crisis Line. The Department of Health and Human Services reinstated employees who oversee aid to survivors of 9/11 and regulate the nation’s food supply, including a neonatologist who helped oversee the quality of infant formula.

About 2 a.m., Elon Musk, the billionaire whom Trump had named to lead a cost-cutting team called the U.S. DOGE Service, shared a picture of himself in gladiator armor and wrote that he was destroying “the woke mind virus.” Later that morning, Forest Service worker Amanda Mae Downey drove to her office in Michigan to sign a letter accepting her firing, unsure how she’d support her three children, sick mother and newly unemployed husband. Above her signature, she wrote in blue: “Received and accepted under duress.”

Puzzled workers spending their Saturdays at dog parks or breweries, or taking their children to Scouting America events, opened a message titled “What did you do last week?” It asked for five bullet points of accomplishments.

A worker at the Food and Drug Administration reported it as spam. An employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development fed the instructions into ChatGPT, then responded with 20 pages of gibberish. At an airport in the Pacific Northwest, Transportation Security Administration employees who check for weapons were pulled away from their X-ray machines to compose bullet points. Lines swelled.

A Forest Service staffer copied the email verbatim into his diary. “Every week things come more and more into focus,” he wrote beneath it. “We are at war.”

In Virginia, the family of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services worker Caitlin Cross-Barnet checked her into a mental health facility. She was struggling with despair after a difficult hysterectomy, and because she felt Trump was unraveling the government. In daily calls to her husband, she asked about changes to the federal workforce. Six days after the “What did you do” email, she killed herself.

Within two months, as Musk fell out with Trump and prepared to leave the government, most agencies reversed course and told employees to ignore the emails.

Across the government, staff searched for words they hoped would save the work they believed in. NASA employees built a spreadsheet explaining why DOGE shouldn’t cancel the agency’s 13,000 contracts and grants: “Mission essential.” “Worthwhile scientific research.” “Taxpayer dollars … were already spent.”

At the Energy Department, one worker prepared memos arguing that his projects would cut costs for American homes and businesses. Someone decided to cancel many anyway. So he, like other employees, began deleting: Any mention of “carbon.” “Sustainability.” The word “green.”

State Department staffers scrubbed out the terms “diverse” and “inclusive.” One Environmental Protection Agency employee, tasked with eliminating information about race, gender and religion, confided to her diary: “It’s really difficult to have to erase someone’s existence from the federal government.”

At the National Institutes of Health, Elizabeth Ginexi was sent a list of grants to review for DOGE, along with words to watch for: “inclusion,” “race,” “ethnicity.” It felt unscientific. Had she really earned a Ph.D. to do this? Breaking the rules, she called one grantee from her personal phone and told them to revise their study abstract — removing the words “gender” and “minorities.”

Then DOGE arrived at her building. They were easy to spot: Silent young men in their 20s and 30s, always wearing backpacks. Some of her colleagues’ cars were searched in the parking lot. Other employees were stopped in the bathroom and asked for their ID cards. Ginexi began having nightmares about getting fired because she voted for Kamala Harris.

Not long before she decided to resign, she texted a friend: “NIH is being killed.”

Ten thousand health staff, including biomedical scientists and researchers who studied patient safety, lost their jobs. Senior leaders at the NIH received letters offering new posts in remote areas such as Alaska or Billings, Montana. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who oversaw chronic disease, HIV and tuberculosis programs were reassigned to the Indian Health Service.

When Tony Schlaff arrived at the Health Resources and Services Administration, he was astonished to see hundreds of people queued up outside. “What’s going on?” he asked. “Everybody is going through a full screening,” the person standing next to him said. Schlaff filed into line and, alongside hundreds of colleagues, waited for nearly two hours, shivering in the frigid wind.

Once indoors, Schlaff watched employees walk through a TSA-style screening machine and undergo badge checks. Some walked back outside, tearful. After half an hour, he got close enough to hear what was happening: “You do not have access to the building,” one security guard told a woman whose badge failed to swipe, which is how she found out she’d been fired. “Leave. Go home.”

In Texas, Shelley Bain awoke to her phone buzzing. Bain, a 66-year-old program specialist for the Administration for Children and Families, checked her email and saw she’d been fired at 4:30 a.m. She made a cup of coffee and calculated. She was losing half the retirement income she’d counted on. She is legally blind, so it would be hard to find another job.

At 6:24 a.m., she texted her children. Her daughter swore. When Bain’s grandchildren woke, she made breakfast and walked them to the bus stop. Before they boarded, she pulled the girls, 12 and 14, aside: “I just got fired, but it will be okay.” She watched the bus pull away, thinking about how she’d probably have to sell her home, a farm outside Dallas where she and her husband had hoped to die.

The spending limits on federal credit cards shrank to $1. Government scientists studying food safety ran short of lab-cleaning fluid. Contractors who help identify U.S. soldiers killed in combat were told to pause their work.

A climate researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey found herself unable to travel for research conferences, restock hydrogen gas or buy Scotch tape. A Food and Drug Administration staffer couldn’t purchase dry ice or environmental swabs, nor pay the highway tolls that safety inspectors incurred driving for work. When colleagues asked what they were supposed to do, she told them to try HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Trump.

In a Colorado branch of the Forest Service, one man was designated purchaser for the entire office. Anyone who wanted to buy horse fodder or irrigation pipes had to wait until the man returned from weeks-long firefighting trips. The new system meant staff were a week late buying chainsaw fuel, delaying the thinning of flammable forest brush. “In 15 years, I have never seen us so unprepared for fire season,” the local fire management officer told staff at a meeting, according to one worker in attendance.

General Services Administration political appointees imposed a rule mandating they approve project requests, and more than 1,500 built up in an internal tracker, including executed leases and notices saying construction could begin. At NASA, a group of employees wrote several detailed paragraphs, across multiple emails, to justify buying fastening bolts.

Social Security started requiring that one of fewer than a dozen people sign off on expenses for all 1,300 field offices. Staff ran out of paper, printer cartridges and phone headsets, even as calls poured in from Americans asking what Trump might be doing to their benefits.

In one Northeastern office, the fridge broke. In late April, a staffer emailed the office seeking donations: “We are going to purchase a new fridge since the funds that would normally be available for Facilities to provide us with one are still frozen. Before we do, I would like to see if anyone else is interested in contributing.”

It wasn’t Abby McIlraith’s primary job to take calls from survivors — until Texas flooded.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency had long contracted with phone centers to help handle the influx of calls after disasters. But the contracts cost more than $100,000, meaning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem had to approve them, and she was slow to do so, letting some lapse for close to a week.

So McIlraith was assigned to the phones, taking back-to-back calls. She wrote down what people had lost: homes, cars, furniture, appliances. She asked if they had anywhere to stay, if FEMA could help. She listened to people scream about how long they’d been waiting, demand to know why the government was moving so slowly.

Per her orders, she kept each call to a few minutes. Whenever a conversation ended, she had 40 seconds to finish her notes. She watched the timer on her screen count down to the next call.

A few months later, she heard that other employees were signing a letter of dissent, disagreeing with the direction of FEMA under Trump. She wondered if signing would cost her her job, then recalled her week answering phones. McIlraith signed her name — and was placed on leave.

Asked about McIlraith’s account, FEMA shared a written statement from acting press secretary Daniel Llargues asserting Noem’s tighter control over spending “strengthens oversight, safeguards against fraud, waste and abuse, and ensures funding decisions are well-documented and mission-focused.” Noem’s $100,000 rule has already “saved U.S. taxpayers … $10.7 billion,” Llargues added, stating without offering evidence that Noem reviews every contract within 24 hours.

New resignation offers rolled out, agency by agency. As the summer waned, people left.

The NIH lost six directors of institutes focused on infectious disease, child health and the human genome. The Federal Aviation Administration lost its chief air traffic officer, among nearly a dozen other top officials. The Internal Revenue Service lost its chief of staff, chief procurement officer and chief human capital officer — while the Treasury Department lost more than 200 technical experts and experienced managers who helped run the nation’s financial systems.

At a town hall, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy told staff: “We’re going to lose some knowledge, right? We’re going to lose some expertise as we go through this process.” He asked those staying “to get the best points from those who are leaving.”

In the Midwest, union leader Colin Smalley watched his Army Corps of Engineers unit dwindle. Among the departed: An employee so knowledgeable about rock blasting that the government brought him back the first time he tried to retire. A staffer who was spearheading a novel project to stun invasive carp with electric shocks. How, Smalley asked his wife, could they ever replace someone who knew how to electrify rivers?

A National Park Service staffer in Colorado tallied her park’s losses: Two people employed for 20 years each. One woman who’d been there even longer. A biologist who’d founded a key program the park ran. Soon, everyone was picking up new responsibilities. Bosses filled out time sheets, biologists signed travel authorizations and the staffer, a land surveyor, began leading park tours. Other days, she cleaned bathrooms.

Hearing about a protest against federal cuts, she drew up a poster to carry. “Where have all the rangers gone?” it asked.

In Lander, Wyoming, three Forest Service retirees noticed fences tilting over, docks slipping into lakes, mountain roads caving inward from water pressure. Barb Gustin, 69, began volunteering to keep open Lander’s Forest Service office. Bill Lee, 73, drove hundreds of miles through the forest weekly, fixing broken fences and fallen signs. And Del Nelson, 81, started wiping down five bathrooms a day. He knew money was short, so he used one paper towel per set of toilets.

More than 750,000 were sent home without pay as whole departments shuttered. Some National Park Service staffers left without being told if they could put up signs telling visitors their parks had closed. At the State Department, staffers who’d already been fired were surprised to see furlough notices hit their personal inboxes — a painful accident.

An Agriculture Department employee lined up a second job classifying soils, figuring the shutdown might last for a while. A State Department custodian required to keep working readied herself for another shift cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Education Department employees saw their out-of-office messages altered to blame “Democrat Senators” for the shutdown. On their sixth day working without pay, a skeleton crew of NIH researchers learned a well-liked animal health technician had been taken by ICE to a Louisiana detention center.

“We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters, even as senior federal officials privately warned such firings would be illegal. An IRS worker wondered whether his disability, which necessitates working from home, meant he would be dismissed first.

In a year when roughly 300,000 had already gone, 4,000 more lost their jobs — dismissals swiftly entangled in lawsuits. In the Oval Office, Trump said he’d fired “people that the Democrats want.” The reductions in force targeted staff who regulated hazardous waste, checked the quality of federal housing and assisted students with disabilities.

Nationwide, flights fell behind schedule. Taxpayer help lines shut down. The president ordered the Pentagon to use research funding to pay service members, while his top deputies claimed they or Trump had found unspecified ways to compensate immigration and law enforcement agents. Workers who’d missed two paychecks in a row, while showing up to the office, watched money flow into gun-carrying colleagues’ accounts.

In Philadelphia, staff at one of the largest food banks noticed shelves growing bare. In Colorado, service members and veterans flooded the Homefront Military Network, asking for help with mortgages, utilities, car payments. Federal workers paid their bills with credit cards and stocked their kitchens from food pantries. Cynthia Brown, of the Government Publishing Office, lost her car to repossession, sold two iPhones and began subsisting on coffee and protein shakes.

Just before the government reopened, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown would trim as much as $14 billion from the United States’ annual economic output.

Federal workers, grateful to pick up paychecks again, found other worries waiting. Some agencies privately warned staff to expect deep spending cuts in 2026, reflecting Trump’s desired bare-bones budget. Following guidance from a top administration official to stop giving “everyone … an A,” the National Park Service decided to give 80 percent of staff middling performance reviews, which help determine promotions and bonuses. The National Weather Service lagged in hiring hundreds of promised replacement forecasters. And Veterans Affair made plans to slice away as many as 35,000 open jobs.

At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an attorney whose job used to be fighting housing discrimination told himself to stop thinking about things he couldn’t control — and dived into yet another internal personnel case. The Trump administration had stalled all his lawsuits and barred officials at his agency from speaking any language that wasn’t English. They’d even ripped down posters written in Spanish. Overnight, the attorney found himself unable to talk to many of his complainants, or even explain why.

He tried to focus on that day’s assignment — an ethics advisory opinion for a colleague who wanted to sell his house — but kept thinking about what he’d seen in the garage. Months ago, ICE had begun using his New York City federal building as a detention holding center. The evening before, walking to collect his bike, he’d witnessed a family in chains being led into an unmarked van. The attorney could still hear the sound their manacles made, dragging on concrete.

Thousands of miles away in Alaska, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist stopped by a bush outside her building. She wasn’t eager to start another day of “Section 7 consults”: 500-page reports assessing the environmental impact of docks, airports and cable lines. It wasn’t unimportant, but it wasn’t the science she was hired to do — monitoring beluga whales, analyzing samples of stranded ocean mammals for disease, testing the impacts of pollution on pregnant whales. And it meant hours formatting Word documents.

The biologist stared at the bush, delaying a few more seconds. There used to be rocks beneath it, and in the spring, she’d painted some with slogans: “Save the Whales.” “NOAA Saves Whales.” Children began adding their own hand-painted contributions. It felt like hope. Then one day she arrived at work to find all the rocks had been removed. “This is what we’re fighting against, and losing,” she told herself now, looking at the bare earth, and walked into the building.

In D.C., a Defense Department worker looked up from a pile of congressional inquiries to check the clock. Two minutes to 11:30 — his lunch break. Another morning gone with no chance to turn to his studies of rising rates of mental illness among service members. Or his proposals, languishing for almost a year now, on how the government could drive those down.

This job was all he’d wanted to do since a close family member, a veteran, died by suicide. Then his office shrank by half under Trump. The staffers who were supposed to answer questions from Congress lost or left their jobs, and their work became his. Now, whenever the worker snatched time to resurface one of his ideas, he was told there was no money. He kept having the same thought driving to work, doing the dishes, just before he fell asleep: “You’re failing the American people.”

Rather than eat, the worker rose from his desk and walked until he found somewhere secluded. He knelt in prayer.

“If I am supposed to be here, then I am going to keep doing this,” he told God. “But if it’s time for me to go, please open the doors, so I can go.”

He repeats the prayer almost every day, waiting for a sign.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTXKP5IHUVEP7FHG4VOZCNXR2M.jpg&w=1200,N,,2025-12-21 09:57:20.170175

Earlier on today's show, we heard about the influential force of Turning Point USA in conservative politics today. Vice President Vance actually attended one of the organization's events in October, and he made a very specific claim about immigration that pops up a lot on the political right these days.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JD VANCE: If you go back to the 1920s, the United States passed an Immigration Reform Act that effectively cut down immigration to close to zero for 40 years in this country. And what happened over those 40 years? The many, many people who had come from many different foreign countries and different foreign cultures, they assimilated into American culture.

PARKS: We wanted to dig into this idea that immigrants used to want to assimilate more than they do now and that Americans used to welcome immigrants more because of that. Is any of that true?

To learn more, we called Nancy Foner. Her new book, ""Immigration: How The Past Shapes The Present,"" is coming out next year. Professor Foner, welcome to the show.

NANCY FONER: Thank you for having me.

PARKS: So let's just start there. How did immigrants assimilate 100 years ago, and, in turn, how did Americans welcome those immigrants?

FONER: Well, initially, I should say, we're talking about the immigrants who came at the turn of the 20th century, and they were overwhelmingly from Europe and from Southern and Eastern Europe. And many of them were Jewish immigrants and Italian immigrants. And initially, they were not welcomed, and, in fact, they were viewed in very negative ways. They were seen as racially inferior whites who were never going to assimilate, that they were polluting America's racial stock.

PARKS: Well, it's so interesting. I feel like there's this other claim that I see popping up a lot, especially I - when I'm not hosting this program, I cover voting in elections, and this comes up a lot when you talk about the idea of noncitizens voting in American elections, that - basically the idea is that when immigration mostly came from European countries, that the assimilation was easier. And what are your thoughts on that idea?

FONER: Well, I mean, there's this myth about immigrants in the past, you know, learning English right away, which was not true. Today, immigrants are actually more, not less, likely to speak English. Another popular myth is this rags to riches that, you know, immigrants in the past and Ellis Island immigrants came with nothing, they quickly and vastly improved their progress. And just like today, they didn't make great leaps forward. They made, you know, incremental steps up the occupational ladder.

Like my grandfather - I always say, a good example - who came to New York. He lugged seltzer bottles up on the Lower East Side. He eventually co-owned a garage in Brooklyn. But it wasn't until the next generation, the second generation, that his four sons all went to college and moved into professional jobs, and we see the same thing today. We have, you know, something like 35% of immigrants in the U.S. today over 25 have a bachelor's degree or higher.

PARKS: So then why do these myths persist then?

FONER: Well, I think that - well, there are political reasons. You know, this nativism is appealing to - certainly, when we hear it from JD Vance, immigration has been a big part of their political outreach, so to say, to their base of non-college-educated and evangelical whites and who are very concerned about the population change in the U.S. So there's a lot of racial resentment. And also the economic changes in America, where they're not doing well. There's been, you know, a decline in manufacturing jobs, and well, in the past, in post-World-War-II period in America, America was, you know, very prosperous at that time. The people who are unhappy now were growing up and moving into the workforce in a better economic time, and they're blaming immigrants. And this has been a successful ploy of the Republican Party.

PARKS: Can I ask - big picture, I guess, as somebody who studies immigration - how much of the current moment you do just feel deja vu every time you read a headline?

FONER: Well, we do feel deja vu. There are a lot of continuities with the past and similarities between then and now. And certainly, we've had Nativist movements. There were the Know Nothings. There was the anti-Mexicans. There was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and Asians were excluded basically for a very long time in American society. So it is not that we have welcomed with open arms immigrants. We have had this in the past.

But I think the pressures are going to be for - in continued immigration for demographic reasons. I mean, the United States is aging, and the baby boomers, as of 2030, will all be 65 and older. And so the question is, who's going to do their jobs? We're going to need workers. Employers are going to be pushing for immigrants to come in for that reason and are likely to, I think, lead to continued levels of fairly high immigration.

PARKS: That's Professor Nancy Foner. Thank you so much for talking with us.

FONER: Oh, well, thank you for having me.

Witness testimony described an agitated Dugan, whose colleague, Judge Kristela Cervera, testified — damagingly — that she was uncomfortable with how Dugan managed the federal agents she was outraged to find hanging around outside her courtroom.
The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified.
One of the most distressing aspects of the Dugan trial was the prosecution’s through-the-looking-glass invocation of the rule of law and the integrity of the courts.
Churches, day care centers and peaceful suburban neighborhoods are also “safe” environments for armed, masked federal agents.","According to the Eastern District of Wisconsin’s Interim U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel, freshly appointed to his position by President Donald Trump, the federal trial of Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan had nothing to do with politics. “There’s not a political aspect to it,” Schimel told reporters after Dugan’s felony conviction on charges she obstructed U.S. immigration agents as they tried to make an arrest inside the Milwaukee courthouse. “We weren’t trying to make an example out of anyone,” Schimel said. “This was necessary to hold Judge Dugan accountable because of the actions she took.”

Schimel didn’t say whether Dugan’s very public arrest and perp walk through the courthouse was also necessary, along with the social media posts by Trump’s FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, crowing about the arrest and sharing photos of Dugan in handcuffs.

There is no doubt that the Dugan case was highly political from the start.

As a coalition of democracy and civic organizations in Wisconsin declared in a statement after the verdict, Dugan’s prosecution threatens the integrity of our justice system and “sends a troubling message about the consequences faced by judges who act to protect due process in their courtrooms.”

But Schimel is right about one thing: Dugan’s trial this week was mainly about “a single day — a single bad day — in a public courthouse.”

That narrow focus helped the prosecution win a conviction in a confusing mixed verdict. The jury found Dugan not guilty of a misdemeanor offense for concealing Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the defendant she led out a side door while immigration agents waited near the main door of her courtroom to arrest him. At the same time, the jury found Dugan guilty of the more serious charge of obstructing the agents in their effort to make the arrest. The two charges are based on some of the same elements, and Dugan’s defense attorneys are now asking that her conviction be overturned on that basis.

An observer watching the trial from afar with no inside knowledge of the defense strategy might wonder why Dugan’s defense team didn’t enter a guilty plea on the misdemeanor charge and then strongly contest the felony obstruction charge as an outrageous overreach in a heavily politicized prosecution. That might have led to a more favorable mixed verdict, in which the jury found that Dugan was probably guilty of something, but that it did not rise to the level of a felony with a potential penalty of five years in prison.

I’m no expert, but daily reports from the trial this week gave me the strong impression that things weren’t going well for Dugan as long as witnesses and lawyers focused on a blow-by-blow account of the events of April 18. Witness testimony described an agitated Dugan, whose colleague, Judge Kristela Cervera, testified — damagingly — that she was uncomfortable with how Dugan managed the federal agents she was outraged to find hanging around outside her courtroom.

It’s not surprising that the jury agreed with the prosecution that Dugan was not cooperative and that she wanted to get Flores-Ruiz out of her courtroom in a way that made an end-run around the unprecedented meddling of federal immigration enforcement inside the courthouse. Like other judges and courthouse staff, she was upset about the disruption caused by ICE agents stalking people who showed up to court.

But, as Dean Strang, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and a long-time Wisconsin criminal defense lawyer, told me in April just before he joined the defense team and stopped talking about the case to the press, “Whatever you think of the actual conduct the complaint alleges, there is a real question about whether there’s even arguably any federal crime here.”

The government’s behavior was “extraordinarily atypical” for a nonviolent, non-drug charge involving someone who is not a flight risk, Strang added.

The handcuffs, the public arrest at Dugan’s workplace, the media circus — none of it was normal, or justified. When Bondi and Patel began posting pictures of Dugan in handcuffs on social media to brag about it, “what is it they are trying to do?” Strang asked. His conclusion: “Humiliate and terrify, not just her but every other judge in the country.”

The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Voces de la Frontera, and Common Cause-Wisconsin agree with that assessment, writing in their statement reacting to the conviction that Dugan’s felony conviction threatens the integrity of our justice system as a whole, and undermines the functioning of the courts by scaring away defendants, witnesses and plaintiffs who are afraid they might be arrested if they show up to participate in legal proceedings.

But that big picture perspective was not a major feature of the defense’s closing arguments, which relied heavily on raising reasonable doubt about Dugan’s intentions and her actions during a stressful and chaotic day.

That’s frustrating because, contrary to Schimel’s assertions, the big picture, not the events of “a single bad day” is what was actually at stake in this case.

One of the most distressing aspects of the Dugan trial was the prosecution’s through-the-looking-glass invocation of the rule of law and the integrity of the courts.

The federal agents called to the stand, the prosecutors in the courtroom, and Schimel, in his summary of the case, made a big point about the “safety” of law enforcement officers.

Repeatedly, we heard that immigration agents prefer to make arrests inside courthouses because they provide a “safe” environment in which to operate.

In his comments on the verdict, Schimel emphasized that Dugan jeopardized the safety of federal officers by causing them to arrest Flores-Ruiz on the street instead of inside the courthouse: “The defendant’s actions provided an opportunity for a wanted subject to flee outside of that secure courthouse environment,” Schimel said.

This upside-down view of safety has become a regular MAGA talking point, with Republicans claiming that when citizens demand that masked agents identify themselves or make videos of ICE dragging people out of their cars, they are jeopardizing the safety of law enforcement officers — as opposed to trying to protect their neighbors’ safety in the face of violent attacks by anonymous thugs.

Churches, day care centers and peaceful suburban neighborhoods are also “safe” environments for armed, masked federal agents. But their activities there are making our communities less safe.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Brown Watzka, delivering the prosecution’s closing argument, told the jury it must draw a line against judges interfering with law enforcement, or else “there is only chaos,” and that “chaos is what the rule of law is intended to prevent.”

But chaos is what we have now, with federal agents terrorizing communities, dragging people out of courthouses and private residences, deporting them without due process and punishing those who stand in their way in an attempt to defend civil society.

The real questions raised by Dugan’s case are whether we believe the “safety” of the agents making those dubious arrests matters more than the safety of our communities, and whether we want the courts to be able to regulate the conduct in their own courthouses as a check on the government’s exercise of raw power.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dugan1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 23:57:11.144538

President Trump weighed in on the election earlier this year, putting his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura.","The State Department on Friday restricted the visas of two Honduran officials over national security concerns, claiming they tried to impede on a special vote count following the nation’s election last month.

The Trump administration revoked a visa for Mario Morazán, a magistrate of the Electoral Justice Tribunal. Marlon Ochoa, a member of the Honduras National Electoral Council, was denied a visa. Both men are a part of the country’s LIBRE party, which holds the legislative majority in the Central American nation.

In a statement, the department pointed to Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to justify its moves. The section, per officials, “generally bars entry to those whose entry or proposed activities have potentially serious adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences.”

“The United States will not tolerate actions that undermine our national security and our region’s stability,” the statement reads. “We will consider all appropriate measures to deter those impeding the vote count in Honduras.”

The ban comes nearly 20 days after the election, which remains undecided among two candidates due to inconsistencies with the vote count.

President Trump weighed in on the election earlier this year, putting his support behind Nasry “Tito” Asfura. As of Saturday, Asfura is narrowly leading LIBRE candidate Salvador Nasralla, also a conservative, by roughly 0.6 percent, according to The Associated Press.

Nasralla acknowledged in a recent Reuters interview that Trump’s endorsement of his opponent likely “hurt” his chances of winning and ripped the algorithm after a brief website malfunction. But the candidate did not accuse the U.S. leader of meddling in the election.

After a special count was called, the president said there would be “hell to pay” if Asfura did not win.

“If he doesn’t win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,” he continued at the time. “Tito will be a Great President, and the United States will work closely with him in order to ensure the success, with all of its potential, of Honduras!”

Neither candidate has declared victory in the race.

Trump also issued a pardon for former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández in December. The embattled ex-leader, who was sentenced to 45 years behind bars in July 2024 for collaborating with drug traffickers, was released from prison after clemency was granted.

Hernández thanked Trump and is maintaining his innocence.”

Nasralla pushed back on the move, saying the former president “deserves punishment in Honduras.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25353688103948-e1766247354869.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-20 21:57:18.202332

This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans.
Congressman Seth Moulton has filed legislation that would allow those detained by ICE agents to sue them in federal court.
The bill, the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct (NOEM) Act, named after DHS Secretary Noem, would allow detainees whose constitutional rights were violated by federal immigration enforcement officers to sue those officers in federal court.
During a rally at Faneuil Hall in Boston on Friday, he said “Massachusetts won’t be complicit in ICE cruelty.” “What we are seeing is immigration enforcement masquerading as authoritarianism.","Massachusetts political leaders are ramping up messaging against federal agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as the Trump Administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration continues.

The federal agency is under attack from Bay State Democrats, including the likes of U.S. Senate candidate and Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06), Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Governor Maura Healey, who all claim ICE has acted “inhumanely” towards detainees and those they seek to arrest.

This week, Gov. Healey sent a letter to ICE leadership, demanding they stop using private aircraft at Hanscom Field airport in Bedford to remove illegal immigrants they have detained.

“It has come to my attention that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as part of its disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics, is using private aircrafts at Hanscom Field airport in Massachusetts to quickly remove residents and sever them from their family, friends, and counsel without due process of law,” Healey wrote in her letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, whose department oversees ICE, and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed. This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans. This practice must stop,” she said, going on to claim that “a significant majority of people detained by ICE in Massachusetts over the past year have no criminal convictions or charges.”

The Massachusetts Democratic Party is echoing Healey’s call, calling the ICE deportation flights out of Hanscom a “disregard for due process.”

“The Department of Homeland Security’s use of unmarked private planes to rapidly remove ICE detainees at Hanscom is yet another example of the Trump administration’s disregard for due process. We know that 73 percent of individuals detained by ICE have no criminal history. They are people who live and work and are part of the fabric of our communities,” said MassDems Chair Steve Kerrigan. “Through these unmarked removal flights, the Trump administration continues to circumvent the legal process, transporting individuals thousands of miles away from their families and legal counsel.”

One illegal immigrant recently detained and set to be deported by ICE sent a 63-year old woman flying nearly 80-feet and has left her intubated with a brain bleed at Massachusetts General Hospital. The horrific hit-and-run happened on December 7, when 23-year old Peruvian national Brando Diaz-Sanchez struck the victim and never stopped. He had been driving without a driver’s license and had been charged with reckless driving less than two months prior. He entered the U.S. in 2022 during the Biden Administration, whose immigration policies have been derided as “catch and release” by Republicans

The battle with ICE doesn’t stop with the governor’s office. Congressman Seth Moulton has filed legislation that would allow those detained by ICE agents to sue them in federal court.

The bill, the National Oversight and Enforcement of Misconduct (NOEM) Act, named after DHS Secretary Noem, would allow detainees whose constitutional rights were violated by federal immigration enforcement officers to sue those officers in federal court. Moulton’s office says the legislation would ensure ICE and other federal immigration officers can be held liable in the same way any state or local law enforcement officer would be when they violate the constitutional rights of detainees.

“Right now, if an ICE officer violates someone’s Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights, victims have almost no legal recourse,” Moulton said in a press release. “The NOEM Act fixes that. ICE is not above the law — and if its officers break the law, they should be held accountable in court.”

Moulton introduced the legislation just weeks after a highly-publicized feud with ICE and Acting Director Lyons after the congressman called for the agency to be prosecuted.

The Herald has reached out to ICE for comment on Moulton’s bill. The agency had some strong words about it already, posted Saturday on its official X account.

“Congressman, our ICE officers and agents enforce the laws YOU pass and we arrest the criminals who break the laws YOU pass,” the post stated. “Why are you so keen on defending criminal illegal alien murderers, rapists, drug dealers, child sex offenders — the WORST of the worst we’re taking off your streets to protect YOUR constituents?”

Moulton’s 2026 primary competitor, Senator Ed Markey, has also taken aim at the immigration agency. During a rally at Faneuil Hall in Boston on Friday, he said “Massachusetts won’t be complicit in ICE cruelty.”

“What we are seeing is immigration enforcement masquerading as authoritarianism. The Trump Administration has sought to end birthright citizenship, dehumanize immigrants with racist rhetoric and unleash masked ICE agents into our communities, violently abducting innocent people,” Markey said. “I’ve pressed the Boston field office and ICE leadership on ICE’s aggressive tactics, its brutal dragnet approach to enforcement, and the lack of transparency and accountability that we are seeing, and I am going to continue to demand answers from them that hold ICE accountable for their actions.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is pushing back against claims from Senate Democrats that 2025 has become the deadliest year in decades for immigrants held in federal custody.

In a post to X Saturday, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin slammed allegations made by the Senate Judiciary Democrats’ account, claiming ""30 immigrants have died in ICE custody since Donald Trump took office, making 2025 the deadliest year in ICE detention since the early 2000s.""

McLaughlin swiftly fired back, accusing Senate Democrats of ""trying to twist data to smear ICE law enforcement.""

""There has been NO spike in deaths. Consistent with data over the past decade, death rates in custody are 0.00007%,"" she said.

ICE IS NICE: AMFEST ATTENDEES OVERWHELMINGLY CALL FOR DHS TO TARGET THEIR HOMETOWNS AS DEMS SPURN AGENTS

McLaughlin also argued that those held in ICE custody receive appropriate medical care and a ""higher standard of care"" than most U.S. prisons.

""As bed space has rapidly expanded, we have maintained a higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens, including providing access to proper medical care,"" she said. ""For many illegal aliens this is the best healthcare they have received their entire lives.""

DHS FIRES BACK AFTER DEM LAWMAKER CLAIMS SHE WAS 'PUSHED ASIDE AND PEPPER SPRAYED' DURING ICE RAID

The response came just one day after DHS touted that ICE's ""Christmas gift to Americans"" came early as agents pulled more illegal immigrants with criminal records off the streets.

""This holiday season, ICE is working around the clock to ensure silent nights and safer streets,"" DHS said in its announcement.

With reports of immigrants detained and pop-up protests across the Twin Cities, some suburban police departments are taking the initiative to explain the roles they play — and do not play — in federal immigration operations.

St. Paul and Minneapolis both passed separation ordinances years ago, spelling out that local employees, including police, are not in the business of enforcing federal immigration law.

After Immigration and Customs Enforcement made the Twin Cities the focus of its Operation Metro Surge this month, several suburbs shared statements to address their own policies.

Their message: City-appointed officers will not be involved with ICE operations unless the arrest involves someone accused of crimes in their jurisdictions. They’re emphasizing that no community member, whether a citizen or not, should be afraid to call 911 or cooperate with local investigations.

Operation Metro Surge

ICE’s stepped-up enforcement operations in Minnesota began on Dec. 1, with reportedly at least 100 federal officers from out of state.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release last Friday that ICE agents had arrested more than 400 undocumented immigrants in Minnesota since the operation began.

According to DHS, the operation targets “criminal illegal aliens” with prior convictions for serious crimes such as sexual assault, domestic violence and gang affiliation, as well as individuals with final deportation orders.

Although DHS has not released a complete list of those arrested, the agency has said they’ve included “pedophiles, rapists and violent thugs” who were “allowed to roam Minnesota’s streets thanks to sanctuary policies.”

While initially focused on Minneapolis and St. Paul, the operation has expanded into suburbs such as Burnsville, Brooklyn Park and Chanhassen, according to media reports.

Burnsville incident

State Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, said she was “horrified” by reports that masked agents have detained the parents of young children, leaving them without the care of their parents.

Port was referring to a Dec. 6 case that made the news involving the arrests of two parents at a Burnsville home. ICE agents left behind a 7-year-old to be cared for by others, KARE-TV reported.

“I am horrified at the recent actions by federal law enforcement agents in Burnsville and across Minnesota,” Port said in a statement. “The videos of masked federal agents aiming guns at crowds and forcing their way into homes are scenes from a dystopia. This is no way to make our communities safe.”

The city of Burnsville said in a statement that it is actively monitoring federal immigration activity in the city.

“Burnsville Police do not engage in federal immigration enforcement and are typically not notified of federal operations,” the statement reads. “Burnsville police officers enforce only state and local laws. Burnsville Police do not check someone’s immigration status. Our role is to keep everyone in our community safe.”

The statement continued that residents and community members should never hesitate to call 911, regardless of their immigration status. It also stated that officers may respond to gatherings or related protests that occur “to ensure safety for everyone present.”

Other cities have issued statements in response to ICE activity or citizen concerns. What follows is a sampling of east metro statements.

Woodbury statement

Woodbury community members have reported concerns about recent ICE activity in the city, according to Public Safety Director and Police Chief Jason Posel.

“Woodbury Public Safety was not aware of this activity and does not proactively work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the department said in a statement. “We do not inquire about immigration status, nor do we enforce federal immigration law. Our goal is for everyone to feel safe interacting with our officers and comfortable calling 911 in an emergency.”

The statement went on to express that the city understands ICE activity can create stress among community members, especially immigrants, and that Woodbury is “committed to being a welcoming and inclusive community.”

“To our Somali residents and all members of our immigrant communities: you are valued, and your safety and well-being remain a priority,” the statement continued.

Stillwater statement

Stillwater officials issued a statement Wednesday afternoon on social media after citizens at Tuesday’s city council meeting asked them to address the potential for ICE activity in the city.

“Recent federal immigration enforcement activity in our region has understandably caused fear and uncertainty for some members of our community, particularly among our immigrant neighbors,” city officials said in the statement. “We want to share some important information and provide reassurance.”

Police officers do not enforce federal immigration law, the post states. Federal immigration enforcement decisions are made at the federal level and are outside the city’s control, according to the post.

Stillwater police officers do not ask about immigration status and do not conduct immigration enforcement, the post states. “We want everyone to feel safe calling 911, reporting a crime, or asking for help in an emergency,” according to the statement.

The Stillwater Police Department does not detain a person solely based on federal civil immigration violations, and the Stillwater City Council is not considering a cooperative agreement with ICE, according to the post.

“Should federal enforcement activity occur in Stillwater, the city’s priority would be the safety of everyone involved, maintaining calm, and reducing the risk of harm,” the post states. “Local police would be present only to support de-escalation and public safety.”

Rosemount statement

The city of Rosemount shared in a statement that it is committed to “protecting and serving all of our residents. Regardless of how long you’ve called Rosemount home.”

The Rosemount Police Department stated that they enforce state and local laws, not federal laws.

“If federal immigration enforcement were to arrive in Rosemount, our officers would not play an active role,” the city said in a statement. “However, they may respond to ensure physical safety near the scene, including the safety of neighbors or spectators.”

Rosemount officers will not ask about the immigration status of community members, or provide information “to anyone attempting to identify an immigration violation, or detain a person solely for a federal immigration violation,” the statement said.

Residents are encouraged to contact law enforcement as necessary, regardless of their immigration status.

Attorney general opinion

The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office also has weighed in with a recent opinion concerning 287(g) agreements, which are agreements that state and local governments can enter into with ICE authorizing state or local law enforcement officers to perform certain immigration duties.

According to the attorney general’s office, county sheriffs are not able to enter into 287(g) agreements themselves; the authority to enter into 287(g) agreements rests with the county board of commissioners rather than with sheriffs.

Sheriffs also may not detain immigrants “solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request if state law does not otherwise authorize law enforcement to detain them.”",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICEBlock_App_Trump_08164.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-20 21:57:25.525019

The letter urges university officials to cease any ongoing potential violations, saying that the university must ensure a safe environment for peaceful expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people.","United Nations (UN) special rapporteurs requested information regarding potential human rights violations in an Oct. 14 letter to Georgetown University, which the university responded to Dec. 12.

The letter, addressed to Interim President Robert M. Groves, cites the March detainment of Georgetown postdoctoral researcher Badar Khan Suri as part of a broader crackdown on academics engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy and urges Georgetown to take measures protecting academic freedom and student rights. Groves, in his response to the letter, reaffirmed the university’s commitment to its freedom of expression and speech policy and its concern for the implications of Khan Suri’s arrest.

The letter from the rapporteurs asks the university to detail the measures it is taking to protect student rights and requests any additional comments on the allegations. The rapporteurs also request information on how the university plans to prevent repression of expression protected under articles 19 and 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a UN treaty that commits signatory nations to respect individuals’ civil and political rights, such as freedoms of religion, speech and assembly.

“Please provide information about the measures your university intends to take to protect the rights of students and scholars, particularly Dr. Badar Khan Suri as well as other student activists and human rights defenders at Georgetown University expressing their solidarity with victims of human rights violations in Gaza and the West Bank,” the letter reads.

In an email to the rapporteurs Dec. 12, Groves responded to the letter, saying the university is committed to the freedoms of speech and expression.

“Our long-standing, university-wide Speech and Expression Policy protects our community members’ rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even on controversial or objectionable ideas,” Groves wrote in the email. “Our policy ‘encourages and protects the free expression of ideas within the broadest possible latitude… and the untrammeled verbal and nonverbal expression of ideas.’”

The rapporteurs’ letter says there have also been cases of mistreatment and detainment among non-citizen scholars from Cornell University, Tufts University, Minnesota State University and Columbia University. These universities received similar letters addressed to their respective provosts and presidents.

“These individuals, many of whom held valid immigration status, have faced violations of their rights to liberty, due process, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, religion and access to justice,” the letter reads. “Reports indicate a pattern of arbitrary detention, transfers to remote facilities, denial of medical care, religious discrimination and the use of unsubstantiated national security.”

In the letter, Special Rapporteurs Mary Lawlor, Farida Shaheed, Irene Khan, Gina Romero and Gehad Madi said they condemn the U.S. government’s financial pressure on universities and their research.

“We are equally concerned over the coercive measures taken by the U.S. government against universities and the consequent actions by, for instance, Columbia University,” the letter reads. “The State has a responsibility to respect and protect academic freedom, including the autonomy of academic institutions by virtue of their special role in society, which is underpinned by a range of human rights, including the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, association and peaceful assembly.”

The letter comes after changes in immigration policy and decreased research funding resulting from the downsizing of the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) under President Donald Trump. At a university town hall Dec. 12, Georgetown extended a series of budget constraints implemented last April to address the financial measures taken by the federal government.

The letter urges university officials to cease any ongoing potential violations, saying that the university must ensure a safe environment for peaceful expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people.

“While awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person(s) responsible for the alleged violations,” the letter reads. “We also urge you to uphold the fundamental right to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly in line with the international norms and standards and thus ensure a free and safe environment for all those peacefully expressing solidarity with Palestinian people, in particular regarding Dr. Badar Khan Suri.”

Groves said the university has multiple programs aimed at fostering an environment conducive to free expression among students and faculty.

“The University recognizes that we must balance our commitment to openness and international engagement with our obligations to comply with applicable laws, including those immigration laws and regulations that pertain to hosting international scholars and students,” Groves wrote. “Georgetown takes seriously its obligations to diligently serve and support the safety of all members of this community as they work toward expanding their knowledge and enhancing ours.”",https://thehoya.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/UN_Rapporteurs.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:57:55.174628

On Wednesday, an Arizona Daily Star reporter saw three agents wearing vests that read ""ERO,"" for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations branch, stationed just north of the pedestrian exit at the DeConcini port.

Taxi drivers who work near the port said the agents have been there almost every day, as well as in the southbound vehicle lanes, since the week of Dec. 8. Locals also report seeing ICE agents questioning travelers before they leave the U.S. through the Morley pedestrian crossing and the Mariposa port of entry.

""They ask where you're from, where you live, how many days you were here"" in Arizona, Rosario Díaz, 68, said in Spanish, moments after entering Arizona on foot through the DeConcini port on Wednesday.

The Nogales, Sonora, resident said she regularly visits her U.S. citizen son in Arizona, and the interrogations bother her.

""This has never happened before,"" she said.

Agents aren't stopping all travelers; a white Star reporter crossed on foot without being questioned. Regular border-crossers say agents seem to be targeting people who look Hispanic.

The presence of ERO agents in Nogales appears to be related to a recent ICE memo, reported this month by HuffPost and Texas Public Radio. The memo described a Department of Homeland Security plan to deploy ICE agents to the border this month, in order to detain undocumented migrants, or people who have overstayed their U.S. visas, as they try to return home for the holidays.

Agents will target commercial buses heading to Mexico, HuffPost's story said.

Neither ICE nor DHS have responded to the Star's requests for clarification of the new operation at the southern border.

A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said he had no information on ICE's mission at Nogales ports of entry. CBP employees typically handle operations in the border region — CBP officers man the ports of entry, and Border Patrol agents patrol between the ports — whereas ICE usually operates in the U.S. interior.

By formally deporting violators before they can leave voluntarily, ICE can boost its deportation statistics as the Trump administration seeks to fulfill its campaign promise of ""mass deportations."" ICE can also impose penalties or prohibitions on deportees' return to the U.S.

'Ghost town'

The heightened scrutiny at the ports is unnerving for residents of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, border towns commonly referred to as ""Ambos Nogales,"" especially as ICE agents' mission remains unclear, travelers and shop owners said Wednesday.

Business owners say Mexican shoppers have been staying away from Nogales, Arizona, this Christmas season, which some attributed directly to ICE agents' presence, as well as factors like inflation and heightened immigration enforcement broadly.

Nogales shopkeeper Lidia Lopez gestured around her empty dress store Wednesday morning. Normally, she said, it would be filled with families from Sonora and Sinaloa doing their Christmas shopping.

But since ICE agents started questioning travelers, ""There aren't any sales, there aren't people in the streets,"" said Lopez, an employee at Sam's Perfumes and Fashion on Grand Avenue, just north of the DeConcini port. ""The businesses here are becoming like a ghost town.""

Speaking in Spanish, she described the timing of the ICE operation during the holidays as ""cruel.""

""This is the high season,"" she said. ""People are afraid. They're afraid of not knowing how to answer (ICE's questions) and that they might use it as a pretext to take away their passports.""

La Cinderella and its sister store Kory's, both on Morley Avenue, have seen reduced foot traffic lately, employees said. Owner Sandra Kory attributes slower business not only to heightened enforcement, but also reported plans for mandatory facial scans at the southern border.

""There are so many new rules,"" she said.

In a plan that a CBP spokesman called ""completely unrelated"" to ICE agents at the ports, DHS will start doing biometric screenings for all non-U.S. citizen travelers on Dec. 26, scanning travelers' faces as they enter and exit the U.S., including at air, land and sea ports.

Even for international tourists and shoppers with their documentation in line, the surveillance is unnerving, Kory said.

""People are just so nervous to come in (to Arizona) because they’re afraid,"" she said. ""It's all over the news that people even with legal status are being taken (by ICE), and they don't know where they take you.""

Greater Nogales Port Authority board chairman Josh Rubin said this year, non-commercial border crossings — pedestrians, personal vehicles and bus passengers — at Nogales ports are on track to reach an estimated 10.5 million by the end of the year, about 300,000 fewer than in 2024, he said.

That's based on reported monthly data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for which the most recent reliable data is for September 2025. The projection wouldn't account for any fluctuations in December.

It's not a big drop, but will likely be felt by local businesses, he said. Multiple factors are at play in that slight decline, including lingering impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.

""I know it's crazy to continue talking about the pandemic five years later, but the pandemic really changed the way Mexican shoppers shop,"" he said. ""They were forced to find new ways to get what they wanted"" without coming to the U.S.

For the Port Authority board, safe and efficient operations at Nogales ports of entry are the top concern, and DHS is a partner in that goal, he said. As long as ICE's operations don't hinder cross-border flows, Rubin said he doesn't have a problem with their presence.

""At the end of the day, we live in an international border here in Nogales, and the laws are the laws,"" he said. ""From the Port Authority standpoint, our priority is to keep Nogales a reliable, efficient and welcoming port of entry for lawful travelers and trade. That consistency is what supports jobs, businesses and the regional economy on both sides of the border.""

Roberto Contreras lives in Nogales, Sonora and works just over the border, at Pinnacle Charter School on Morley Avenue. The slowdown in foot traffic there has been dramatic this month, said Contreras, who is a dual citizen and crosses the border daily.

He's noticed the ICE agents at the ports over the past two weeks, which he says contributes to the already rising hesitation among would-be border-crossers. Normally, there would be a line down the avenue of ""paisanos"" — people with Mexican roots who live in the U.S. — returning to Mexico to visit family for the holidays, but not this year, he said.

The nonprofit charter school helps students get their high school diplomas online and offers in-person English classes, mostly to U.S. citizens who live in Nogales, Sonora.

Fear is keeping many of the students away in recent months. Contreras' co-worker Jessica Leal said they're doing more outreach lately, ""to try to keep the place alive.""

Aggressive immigration enforcement 'is killing the economy,"" Contreras said.

Shop owners say they're hoping for a surge in last-minute holiday shoppers before the month is out. Kory said DHS oversight will continue to be front of mind for many local businesses.

Over the summer, La Cinderella was hit with an I-9 audit, in which DHS agents — likely from Homeland Security Investigations — asked for proof of store employees' legal status, Kory said.

Kory and her staff scrambled to gather all the documents, but didn't hear back from the agents for months, she said.

""We didn’t have anything to hide,"" she said, but the audit was especially stressful, as Kory was dealing with health issues.

""I'd just had surgery, and I had to be standing up trying to help my secretary to make all the copies they needed,"" she said. ""It was terrible.""

Gantchev had been held at the North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, a private prison contracted by ICE to hold immigrants without legal status, when he was found unresponsive in his cell during a routine check, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

His death was “suspected to be from natural causes,” but the official cause was still under investigation, according to DHS officials who said Gantchev had a pending bond appeal.

U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, called for an “immediate, transparent investigation into the circumstances” of Gantchev’s death, including reports from other detainees that Gantchev asked for medical assistance and did not receive it in time to save his life.

“To date, we are aware of at least 30 deaths at ICE detention centers this year, making 2025 the deadliest year for immigrants in ICE custody,” Ramirez said in a statement Thursday.

DHS officials said staffers provided treatment to Gantchev and that the agency “is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”

Officials also claimed Gantchev had been arrested four times since 1995, with charges dropped in two cases and the outcomes unknown in the others.

According to ABC7, Gantchev was among hundreds of immigrants that a federal judge in Chicago ordered released on bond last month. But the order was later blocked by the 7th Circuit Appeals Court.

Gantchev’s wife and friends told the news station he moved to Chicago 30 years ago on a student visa, received a work permit, owned a trucking company and was in the process of applying for a green card.

Officials at the detention facility made no diet accommodations for Gantchev’s type 2 diabetes, loved ones said.

“He’s paid taxes this whole time, he’s not a criminal,” Gantchev’s wife told ABC7. “Why do they treat him like this?”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/526a355/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F24%2Fe440d6c84aa79efbe46ac02b05a2%2Fbroadview-092325-18.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:57:59.962988

As my Cato Institute colleague David Bier explains in a thorough and insightful post, the new policy goes well beyond Trump's already expansive previous travel bans, causing great harm including separating many US citizens and permanent residents from spouses and children:

President Trump signed a new proclamation that bans nearly all legal immigration from about 40 countries, covering about one in five legal immigrants from abroad and nearly 400,000 legal immigrants over three years. Although it exempts some foreign workers and travelers from certain countries, this ban does not include any categorical exemption or waiver for spouses, minor children, or parents of US citizens or legal permanent residents, making it far harsher than his prior bans.

The ban repudiates the immigration system Congress created. The Trump administration is reimposing via executive order the national origins system that governed immigration policy from 1924 to 1965. After four decades of rigorous debate, Congress ended that system. In the Immigration Act of 1965, it allocated the caps on immigrant visas equally between countries and prohibited discriminating against immigrant visa applicants based on their race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.

David's post effectively outlines the enormous scope of the new ban, and the extensive harm it will cause. He also shows that the supposed security rationale for the policy is utterly indefensible, as immigrants from these countries actually pose little, if any, security risk.

From a constitutional point of view, this proclamation further underscores Trump's claim to virtually unlimited executive discretion to restrict migration, in the process abrogating legal migration pathways established by Congress, including even those for spouses and children of US citizens. In an article on Trump's earlier - already extensive - second-term travel bans, I explained why this violates the nondelegation doctrine, which constrains delegation of legislative power to the executive, and addressed various objections (such as the idea that immigration restriction is actually an inherent executive power; also, I note that Trump v. Hawaii (2018) doesn't preclude nondelegation challenges to executive immigration restrictions, because it did not consider that issue, or even mention it). I think this policy also likely violates the major questions doctrine, which requires Congress to speak clearly when it delegates to the executive the power to decide major economic or political questions.

Nondelegation and major questions are central issues in ongoing challenges to Trump's attempt to impose a $100,000 tax on H-1B visas, and in at least one case challenging the the less extreme travel ban he imposed in June. I hope litigants will raise these issues, here as well.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2020/02/TravelBan.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 18:57:20.060558

“Recent public reporting, including an NPR investigation, has highlighted DHS’s increasing reliance on facial recognition and third-party data systems with limited transparency or oversight.

Regional security and stability, enhanced coordination, and efforts to combat terrorism and organised crime were among the main items on the agenda.

Mirziyoyev said uniting efforts to preserve peace and strengthen stability is particularly important, adding that Afghanistan remains a key area for cooperation. He said he hopes to see Afghanistan peaceful, stable and focused on constructive development.

The Uzbek president also praised Japan’s assistance to Afghanistan, saying Uzbekistan highly values Tokyo’s consistent position. He noted that for many years Japan has been among the leading donors and partners supporting the Afghan people.

Mirziyoyev said he is confident that joint actions and partnerships will help improve living conditions, promote socio-economic and infrastructure development, and support Afghanistan’s active participation in regional economic projects.

Japan’s embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that Tokyo has allocated $19.5 million in humanitarian aid for people in need in the country, expressing hope that the assistance will make a tangible difference for vulnerable Afghans.

Although Uzbekistan, like most countries, has not formally recognised the Taliban administration, it maintains broad diplomatic and economic relations with it. Mirziyoyev has frequently highlighted Afghanistan in regional and international forums, describing stability in the country as being in the interest of Central Asia as a whole.

According to the report, published on Friday the attackers underwent professional training and demonstrated advanced weapons skills. The information was confirmed to TASS by a source at the Second Western District Military Court.

A person involved in the judicial proceedings said all of the defendants had received training and possessed professional-level proficiency in the use of firearms. The source said one of the accused, Shamsidin Fariduni, displayed a high level of marksmanship during questioning in court.

The source also suggested that two separate operational groups had been prepared for the attack and later merged. The defendants have denied this claim.

According to the TASS report, Fariduni had initially been expected to travel via mountainous routes from a base in Türkiye to Afghanistan to join Islamic State Khorasan Province. However, because those routes were closed during the winter, he was allegedly instructed instead to take part in the Crocus City Hall attack.

Based on court information cited in the report, Fariduni was tasked with recruiting accomplices inside Russia, conducting reconnaissance at the Crocus City Hall, purchasing a vehicle to transport the attackers and obtaining weapons. During initial interrogations, he reportedly said the group did not intend to kill children, though Russian judicial authorities said the evidence does not support that assertion.

The report added that the organisers of the attack promised the perpetrators a payment of one million roubles. After carrying out the assault, the attackers reportedly headed toward Ukraine, where the money was to be paid.

The attack took place on March 22, 2024, in the Moscow suburbs. Four armed assailants opened fire on the crowd shortly before a concert began and then set the venue on fire. At least 149 people were killed and more than 600 others wounded in what was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Russia in recent decades.

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. Court proceedings against the suspects began in the summer, with the four main defendants appearing in court after being arrested shortly after the assault.

Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi, spokesperson for the Taliban governor in Herat, said three Afghan nationals died near the Kahsan border area while attempting what he described as “illegal migration to Iran.” He told the Taliban-run Bakhtar News Agency on Friday that investigations are under way and that local authorities and emergency teams have been deployed to assist those affected.

Earlier, local sources in Herat told Afghanistan International that a group of Afghan migrants had died inside Iranian territory after being exposed to severe cold while travelling toward Iran. According to those sources, the bodies of at least 15 people were transferred to Kahsan and Adraskan districts in Herat province.

However, Afghanistan International also spoke with an Afghan migrant who had visited the morgues at the Shuhada Cemetery and Taybad Hospital in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province. That individual said the number of Afghan migrants who died could exceed 40.

Sources further reported that several Afghan migrants have gone missing along the Iran border. In recent days, hundreds of Afghans are said to have headed toward the border in an attempt to reach Iran, but encountered extreme cold weather en route.

According to these accounts, the migrants were trying to enter Iran through unofficial and smuggling routes from Islam Qala toward Taybad. Weather conditions in the border areas have been reported as snowy, rainy and extremely cold. Families of the victims are reportedly searching for the bodies of their relatives.

The exact number of casualties remains unclear.

In recent months, the Taliban have reported the arrest of hundreds of Afghans accused of attempting to migrate illegally to Iran. Following mass deportations of Afghan migrants from Iran and tighter visa restrictions, many Afghans have resorted to dangerous and irregular routes in an effort to return to Iran.

According to the sources, the bodies of at least 15 migrants have been transferred to the Kohsan and Adraskan districts of Herat. Some sources said the death toll could be in the dozens, though the figures have not been officially confirmed.

Afghanistan International spoke with an Afghan migrant who visited morgues at the Shuhada Cemetery and at Taybad Hospital in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province. He said more than 40 Afghan migrants had died.

Many Afghan migrants are also reported missing along the Iran–Afghanistan border, the sources said.

In recent days, hundreds of migrants are believed to have set out for Iran and encountered a wave of extreme cold along the route. The severe weather is continuing.

Sources said the migrants were attempting to enter Iran via an unofficial route from Islam Qala towards Taybad. Weather conditions along the border were described as snowy, rainy and extremely cold.

Families of the migrants are reported to be searching for the bodies of their relatives.

Iranian authorities and the Taliban have so far made no public comment on the incident.

This is a developing story.

In a letter addressed to the US secretaries of state and homeland security, the lawmakers said the administration had used a shooting by a former Afghan soldier against National Guard personnel to justify sweeping measures targeting Afghan migrants and asylum-seekers.

The lawmakers said policies such as refusing entry to Afghan migrants and denying asylum to former US military partners in Afghanistan were a mistake and risked portraying the United States as an unreliable ally.

“Exploiting this tragedy to sow division and inflame fear will not make America safer,” Democratic members of Congress wrote in the letter.

They said that following the shooting involving National Guard troops in Washington, the Trump administration not only halted the processing of Afghan asylum cases but also began re-examining cases of Afghans who had already been admitted to the United States.

According to the lawmakers, the administration has also barred the entry of Afghans holding Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) who worked with the US government and military in Afghanistan, removing them from exemptions to the president’s travel ban.

The Trump administration recently placed Afghanistan and 14 other countries on a full travel ban list, effectively preventing their citizens from travelling to the United States or applying for asylum. Under President Donald Trump’s latest order, SIV holders were no longer exempt from the ban.

Members of Congress described the policy as a form of collective punishment against Afghan migrants and citizens. They warned that the measures endanger the lives of innocent, law-abiding people, including those who assisted US forces during the war in Afghanistan.

“The horrific actions of one individual should not be used to vilify every individual from Afghanistan who legally seeks to live in the United States,” the lawmakers wrote.

The administration’s actions have heightened fear among Afghan migrants already living in the United States. Immigration lawyers and refugee advocates in the Sacramento area of California, home to the largest Afghan immigrant population, have reported an increase in detentions of Afghans by immigration authorities and the cancellation of asylum-related interviews.

The Associated Press reported that since November 26, at least 24 Afghan migrants mostly in Northern California have been detained. In the past week alone, at least nine Afghan men were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they appeared for routine case status checks.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/fa31267f487525b9063d8fa93f5b79071d17575e-1244x927.png?rect=0,138,1244,653&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-21 01:56:26.039370

This week, House Democrats on the committee released another batch of photos from Epstein’s estate, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files loomed.","The Department of Justice on Friday released a long-awaited and huge tranche of documents detailing its investigations into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major development in the lengthy saga that turned into one of the biggest political setbacks Donald Trump has suffered since his re-election last year.

While significant portions of the files are redacted, those that were viewable included images of Epstein socializing with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers such as Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker and Diana Ross, and the entrepreneur Richard Branson. Bill Clinton appears in several photos, including one in which he is in a swimming pool along with Epstein’s convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The images also show the former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Another cache of documents showed photos of evidence gathered including drives and computers but did not reveal details as to the contents. There was also a photo of what appeared to be a dog in a garbage bag, placed inside a box.

In a letter to Congress, Todd Blanche said the documents, which date back to 2006, when Epstein was investigated on child prostitution charges, were only the first set of what is planned for release. “The volume of materials to be reviewed … means that the department must publicly produce responsive documents on a rolling basis,” the deputy attorney general wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News.

He also acknowledged an array of redactions, including the identifying details of more than 1,200 victims and their family members.

Congressional Democrats accused the Trump administration of failing to adhere to the letter of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which requires the justice department to release all “unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” in its possession related to the financier’s cases by 19 December. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex-trafficking minors.

The law also requires the justice department to publish any materials from the investigations that relate to Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of aiding Epstein’s sex trafficking of teen girls and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

“Technically they’re not in compliance,” said Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, a leader of the push to get the legislation passed.

“The law calls for all the documents that are unclassified to be released. They have not done that. The law also calls for them to explain redactions. I haven’t seen yet whether they’ve done that or not. My initial read is that they have a lot of redactions without explanation,” Khanna said.

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, echoed his concerns, and said in a statement: “We will pursue every option to make sure the truth comes out.”

Thomas Massie, a Republican, also joined the chorus, writing on social media that the document release “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that [Donald Trump] signed just 30 days ago”.

Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy press secretary, said the documents’ release prove that “the Trump administration is the most transparent in history” and said it “has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have” by making the files public and cooperating with a separate congressional investigation.

Epstein’s case has captivated public attention for years, and been the subject of countless conspiracy theories – largely due to his connections to powerful and wealthy figures in the US and overseas, including Trump.

While he has the authority as president to make the documents public, Trump previously opposed doing so, and said the concern over his ties to Epstein was a “Democrat hoax”. As the House of Representatives neared approval of the bill in November, the president abruptly reversed his position and said Republican lawmakers should support it. It was later passed unanimously by the Senate, and Trump signed the measure into law on 19 November, triggering a 30-day countdown for the documents’ release.

Although the law mandates the release of unclassified materials, it may not provide the full transparency demanded by numerous Epstein victims, as it does include notable carve-outs, including a provision exempting materials “that would jeopardize an active federal investigation” from being released.

The legislation also states that “no later than 15 days” after the materials are made public, the justice department must provide Congress with a list of all categories of records released and withheld, a summary of any redactions made, and a list of “all government officials and politically exposed individuals named or referenced in the published materials”.

Before the release of the materials, experts also warned that the disclosure of records may not provide a full accounting of Epstein’s crimes or his network, and that it could still leave many Epstein questions unanswered.

Trump vowed to release Epstein-related files as he campaigned for president last year. This summer, his administration sparked backlash after the justice department announced it would not release any files related to the late financier, and said it had found “no incriminating client list” despite earlier claims from Pam Bondi, the attorney general, that such a document was sitting on her desk.

The announcement sparked bipartisan outrage – including from some Trump supporters – and reignited scrutiny of Epstein’s past ties to Trump, with whom he was friendly for at least 15 years before falling out in 2004. The president has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities.

In mid-November, several days before Congress voted to release the justice department files, Democrats on the House oversight committee released three email exchanges they received from Epstein’s estate in response to a subpoena that dated from 2011, 2015 and 2019, and included one email in which Epstein claimed that Trump “knew about the girls”.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, dismissed the emails, and accused Democrats of “selectively” leaking them “to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump”.

Later that day, Republicans on the committee released more than 20,000 documents they received from Epstein’s estate, including emails between Epstein and prominent figures.

In early December, House Democrats on the committee released several dozen photographs from Epstein’s estate that highlight his ties to prominent figures, including Trump, Clinton and Mountbatten-Windsor.

Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, said that the Epstein investigation wasn’t about the former president.

“There are two types of people here,” he said. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships after that. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”

The images represent a small number of the almost 100,000 images given to the House committee, and were released without context or captions.

This week, House Democrats on the committee released another batch of photos from Epstein’s estate, as the deadline for the justice department to release its files loomed.

Among the images were photographs of lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita – which is about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl – written on different parts of a woman’s body. It was reported earlier this year that photos from inside Epstein’s Manhattan mansion revealed that he kept a first edition copy of Lolita in his office.

The same batch also included photos of travel documents, and notable people such as Bill Gates, Woody Allen, Noam Chomsky and Steve Bannon, Trump’s former adviser.

The images provided by the estate were undated, and provided without context. The appearance of these people in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ded76e1e37e83ea78b983d7c2081f57978b05b1/281_0_3336_2669/master/3336.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f08b991abea82e33ada6b09fade37528",N,,2025-12-20 16:57:18.865838

Red flags over reported abuses There have been growing concerns over the conditions at the sprawling immigration detention center.","Immigrants held at the Camp East Montana detention center in El Paso regularly face injury, life-threatening illnesses and acute mental health crises, according to a review of 911 emergency calls placed at the nation's largest ICE immigration lockup.

The emergency call log data, in part, reads:

22-year-old male suicide attempt

89-year-old female chest pain

19-year-old male fall from bunk

32-year-old male kidney stone/pain

54-year-old female fainted

47-year-old male low blood pressure/swelling of legs (Inmate died Dec. 3, 2019)

The most common medical emergencies at Camp East Montana involved chest pain, seizures, suicidal attempts, abdominal pain, breathing problems and fainting episodes, according to 911 records obtained by the El Paso Times through a freedom of information request to the city of El Paso.

A handful of calls involve employees at the sprawling, soft-sided tent facility located on land owned by Fort Bliss.

U.S. Rep Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, immigrant rights advocates and civil rights groups have raised red flags about the physical and emotional treatment of immigrants and inhumane conditions at the detention center.

A Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary called the claims of abuse at the detention center ""categorically false"" in a statement. The official did not comment on the death.

ICE detention centers hold immigrants during civil immigration proceedings while await deportation. Many of the immigrants are not accused or convicted of any major or violent crimes. Detainment is not intended to serve as punishment.

There have been about 90 emergency calls at the facility between Aug. 17 and Dec. 1, according to the logs. That is about five calls per week in the 15 weeks since the facility opened.

The facility officially opened on Aug. 17, but began receiving detained immigrants on Aug. 1. It housed over 3,000 detainees as of Dec. 19, Escobar said in a social media post.

The emergency calls were for detainees aged 19 to 89. About 43 of the emergency-involved immigrants are 40 or older. The ages of about 20 immigrants and Camp East Montana staff were listed as ""unknown age.""

The administration of President Donald Trump has detained over 75,000 immigrants across the U.S. The vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been convicted of criminal charges, according to data from Deportation Data Project.

Emergency medical technicians are permitted into the detention center in cases where the facility's medical staff has made the call.

""El Paso Fire Department responds to all request for emergency services at the location,"" Assistant Fire Chief Gustavo Tavarez said. ""Upon arrival at the facility perimeter, the fire department unit will make contact with gate security. The fire department unit will then be escorted to the location of the emergency. If the gate security verifies that there is no emergency, the fire department will verify the information with 911 Communications.""

Escobar: DHS withheld data on ""detainees mental health'

There were five emergency calls related to attempted suicides in the call logs provided to the El Paso Times, including one from Dec. 1, when an ambulance was called for a 22-year-old. The report was made nearly 12 hours after Escobar and her office made a congressional oversight visit to the detention center.

Escobar said that her office has not been informed of any reports of attempted suicides or medical emergencies at the facility in their communications with the DHS and ICE.

“We have asked about detainees' mental health,"" Escobar said. ""Not once have staff at Camp East Montana informed me that there have been several suicide attempts at the facility. It speaks volumes that staff at the facility have not volunteered this information during those lengthy visits and conversations.""

Escobar's concerns follow her three congressional oversight visits to the detention center, including shortly after it was opened in August. At each visit, she has raised concerns about the conditions and management of the site.

The congresswoman made an unannounced visit to the site on Friday, Dec. 19, according to a post on social media.

""Contrary to the administration’s claims, ICE is not transparent and this facility is not meeting the minimum federal standards for care of human beings in their custody,"" she added. ""If the private contractor running the facility cannot be trusted to hold people, and if ICE cannot be trusted to be transparent with information about Camp East Montana, the facility should be shut down immediately.”

This is the second time that homeland security facilities have drawn congressional and national scrutiny. During President Trump's first administration in 2019, the little-known Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, was criticized for its inhumane management of migrant children in federal custody.

First death at Camp East Montana

A 911 call was made on Nov. 16 for requested assistance for a ""47-year-old male, low blood pressure and swelling to legs,"" according to the logs. Francisco Gaspar Cristóbal Andrés, the patient, would be pronounced dead on Dec. 3 at the Hospitals of Providence, eight days after his birthday.

Cristóbal Andrés' widow, Lucía Pedro Juan, told the El Paso Times that her husband had told his daughter that his legs were feeling numb in the weeks leading up to the call. ICE reported that Cristóbal Andrés died from ""natural liver and kidney failure."" His widow said he was healthy when he was detained on Sept. 1.

The medical staff at Camp East Montana and the doctors at the El Paso hospital treated Cristóbal Andrés at least five times. He was in ICE custody for nearly 90 days before his death.

Red flags over reported abuses

There have been growing concerns over the conditions at the sprawling immigration detention center.

Over $1.2 billion is allocated for the construction and management of the facility. It is operated by a private contractor who holds an agreement with DHS.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Texas-based human rights groups, including El Paso's immigration advocacy group Las Americas, have raised concerns about the conditions in the detention camp. The human rights groups sent a letter to ICE officials condemning the conditions based on 45 detainee interviews, including 16 sworn declarations.

Detainees held in the facility have told lawyers about the squalid conditions and human rights violations in the camps, the ACLU reports.

The letter details the horrid conditions in the facility, including ""beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, beatings and coercive threats to compel deportation to third countries, medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of meaningful access to counsel, among other rights violations.""

DHS response: 'No lawbreaker"" treated better

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin described claims of inhumane conditions and abuses as ""fear-mongering clickbait."" McLaughlin also said that immigrants are allowed to meet with lawyers and family members and are receiving dietitian-approved food.

""No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,"" McLaughlin said. ""Get a grip.”

Detainee shares mistreatment allegations

Pedro Juan, the widow of Cristóbal Andrés, was detained at Camp East Montana for nearly three months. During that time, she said that the guards were verbally abusive to detainees.

""Shut up, you can't say anything because you're eating dog and pig food,"" she recalled the guards telling them. ""You're dumb, stupid, burros.""

She also described unsanitary conditions and receiving food that was often rotten or foul smelling, if it arrived at all.

""Sometimes we get food, and sometimes we don't,"" Pedro Juan said, ""and since there are quite a few of us — 72 people in our detention center — we can't get enough.""

Women also fainted because of hunger and a lack of water, she said.

At night, detainees would cry out, she said. It made it difficult to sleep, which added to detainee's mental health conditions.

Escobar has sent three letters to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, including one sent on Dec. 18, detailing how conditions were ""dangerous and inhumane.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714823007-180820256-d-8-a-6338.jpg?crop=5485,3086,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-20 16:57:27.271206

Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files — mostly photographs — under a subset the Justice Department described as “DOJ Disclosures.""
Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees.
The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.
The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.","NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.

But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.

The file dump — dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions — comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.

President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.

On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department’s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday’s release of the files shows how the administration is the “most transparent in history.”

Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:

The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.

Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.

But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.

Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files — mostly photographs — under a subset the Justice Department described as “DOJ Disclosures."" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein’s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim’s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn’t authorized for release.

Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.

Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.

Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.

Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson, singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.

And another shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face is redacted. The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.

Nevertheless, senior White House aides quickly called attention to them on X.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote “Oh my!” and added a shocked face emoji in response to the photo of Clinton in the hot tub.

Angel Ureña, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, said in an X post that “this isn’t about Bill Clinton” and accused the White House of trying to protect others.

“There are two types of people here,” he wrote. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone’s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.

To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely — or not at all.

For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.

The release does include at least one photo of the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a tuxedo lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. One of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with men, including the prince.

Marina Lacerda, one of the women who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein, beginning when she was 14 years old, said Friday she wanted to see greater transparency from the Justice Department and expressed frustration over redactions and the incomplete release.

“Just put out the files,” she said. “And stop redacting names that don’t need to be redacted.”

Several lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for failing to produce all the documents required under the law.

Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticize the partial release.

Massie wrote that it “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.” Khanna called the release so far “disappointing.”

“We're going to push for the actual documents,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein's victims. He added he was “exploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people.”

If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.

Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5b718f77-4a97-49d2-a878-ec84db2fbbd2/wirestory_aad89f1ee1c37ac06b31234d07c01ec3_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-20 16:57:23.517929

The Trump administration argues the prospect of free housing encourages irresponsible behavior, and grant-making rules penalize groups like rescue missions that favor sobriety mandates.","A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a Trump administration homelessness plan that would have ended support for most long-term housing programs and required more people to seek treatment for addiction or mental illness.

The plan, released in November, sought the most significant changes in decades to policy affecting homeless people and would have governed $3.9 billion in awards to community organizations under a program called Continuum of Care.

Groups opposed to the move said that only Congress had the authority to shift the program away from its longstanding approach, called Housing First, and that the speed of the change could send as many as 170,000 people back to the streets.

Judge Mary S. McElroy of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction that prevents the sudden rule change. “Ensuring lawful agency action, continuity of housing and stability for vulnerable populations is clearly in the public interest,” she said.

Her ruling applied to two lawsuits raising similar issues, one by Democratic attorneys general and another by a mix of advocacy groups and local governments. Among those groups are the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

The groups said the ruling offered vulnerable people “respite from the government’s assault.”

About 90 percent of the annual spending typically goes to renew existing programs. But the administration’s efforts to end that practice and distribute the money under new rules have left most local programs uncertain if they can continue to house people next year.

The funding decisions are months behind schedule, and annual contracts start to expire as soon as next month. But Friday’s ruling may not be the last word amid some unusual legal maneuvering.

In a move that drew the judge’s complaint, the Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew its plan last week to make “appropriate revisions,” and government lawyers then suggested Judge McElroy should not rule on the withdrawn document because it was moot. Rejecting that argument, Judge McElroy said on Friday that HUD was trying “to evade court jurisdiction.”

John Bailey, a Justice Department lawyer representing HUD, said the department planned to reissue the rules, but by Friday evening it had not done so. It was not clear if the revisions would address Judge McElroy’s concerns.

While the machinations can seem esoteric, the stakes are high. Homelessness is at a record level, and the Continuum of Care program is the federal government’s main response.

Housing First provides chronically homeless people long-term housing and offers treatment for addiction or mental illness. But it does not require them to accept that treatment.

Proponents emphasize that a large body of research shows the approach works better than treatment mandates in getting people housed and hail it as “evidence based.” But the once-bipartisan policy has come under sharp conservative attack, and the rules HUD issued in November would have cut funding for long-term housing by about two-thirds.

The Trump administration argues the prospect of free housing encourages irresponsible behavior, and grant-making rules penalize groups like rescue missions that favor sobriety mandates. In issuing the new rules, Scott Turner, the HUD secretary, said Housing First had driven homelessness higher by neglecting the “root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.”

In the effort to impose new rules, HUD also sought to use homelessness money to advance unrelated priorities related to gender and race. The rules would have allowed the department to reject community groups that previously or currently embraced policies that “facilitate racial preferences” or “use a definition of sex other than as binary in humans.”

A HUD spokesman, asked about the legal developments, said the department was “committed to program reforms” and would proceed according to the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/21/multimedia/19-dc-homeless/19-dc-homeless-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:27.465183

And in other cases, a lack of training may be to blame, as seen within the New York City Department of Correction.
Even if “sanctuary” cities deny these detainer requests, ICE can learn the individual’s location from information available to them in such databases.
All partner agencies accessing city-owned data must formally agree not to share it with federal immigration enforcement.
That pressure helped push the Providence City Council to unanimously pass a resolution directing two city courts to accommodate remote-hearing requests.","In late September, Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) stopped Jose Bonilla Lopez, a gardener who lived in the city’s northwest. According to a police report, it was a case of mistaken identity. Instead of releasing him, they turned him over to masked federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, who seized him as neighbors chanted for his freedom.

The next day, MPD stopped a car missing a rear license plate and arrested the driver. Mayker Enrique Salas-Araujo was a passenger in the vehicle. Instead of releasing him, police transferred him directly to a masked Homeland Security agent, who led him in his neon yellow construction jacket to an unmarked car outside of a school. According to a bystander, the handover frightened students, who asked if they would be taken next.

More than 40 local organizations say MPD’s cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violates D.C.’s Sanctuary Values Amendment Act, which bars police from transferring individuals to federal immigration authorities unless they are awaiting trial or sentencing for a federal criminal charge or are serving a federal criminal sentence. Even after an executive order authorizing such cooperation expired in September, MPD continued the practice. Throughout this period, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser maintained that the department was no longer involved in immigration enforcement. After The Washington Post reported at least half a dozen such cases, Bowser admitted that local officers had continued to patrol with the Department of Homeland Security.

Truthout’s review of news coverage indicates that cooperation between ICE and local police in the district is among the most entrenched in the country.

But D.C. is not an isolated case: Police across the country face serious allegations of violating laws meant to protect immigrants. Truthout’s analysis found credible allegations in many of the largest U.S. cities with ordinances and laws meant to limit cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE, as well as in smaller jurisdictions from Providence, Rhode Island, and Rochester, New York, to Springfield, Oregon, Adams County, Washington, Loveland County, Colorado, and Mesa County, Colorado. In other cities, legal loopholes allow police and federal immigration authorities to collaborate without breaking similar protective laws. Philadelphia’s ordinance, for instance, restricts police from complying with ICE detainer requests, but does not limit transfers of migrants through other channels. Philadelphia officers have twice — potentially legally — escorted men to federal immigration authorities at courthouses, drawing condemnation from local activists.

The alleged violations reviewed by Truthout generally fall into two categories: illegal data sharing and assistance with immigration-related arrests.

In California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego law enforcement allegedly violated state law by sharing automated license plate reader data with ICE and Border Patrol. In Illinois, state police have been sharing some information from its gang database with ICE since 2008 despite a 2017 state law forbidding such data sharing. In New York City, the Department of Investigation has documented two violations of the city’s sanctuary laws. In one case, a New York City Police Department officer set up a system where he would be notified when a person of interest to federal immigration authorities interacted with the department. In another, a Department of Correction staffer who was part of a joint Homeland Security task force relayed sensitive information to ICE about two migrants in custody, unwittingly violating sanctuary laws, according to the report. In Chicago and Los Angeles, activists and some lawmakers report police assisting federal agents during immigration raids — though police claim they were only assisting with crowd control.

Truthout’s analysis of news coverage revealed that at least 18 jurisdictions allegedly unlawfully shared data and six may have illegally assisted with immigration-related arrests. None of the alleged violations were disclosed by police departments themselves. The public typically learned about them through bystander interventions or public records requests, indicating these violations may be a fraction of a widespread problem.

The pattern of collaboration reinforces a core abolitionist argument: that police departments are not neutral arbiters of the law, but political institutions with their own interests, norms, and value systems. In some cases, cooperation may stem from overlapping organizational ideologies, such as a shared commitment to enforcing social control through state-sanctioned violence. In others, loopholes persist because local ordinances fail to clearly define what constitutes “cooperation,” giving departments room to plausibly deny violations.

Individual politics also play a role. Many officers hold right-leaning political beliefs, which can increase their alignment with immigration enforcement priorities; in Adams County, Washington, for example, a sheriff who has repeated white nationalist talking points is being represented by a legal organization founded by Stephen Miller in a lawsuit alleging state sanctuary law violations brought by the Washington attorney general’s office. And in other cases, a lack of training may be to blame, as seen within the New York City Department of Correction. Together, these dynamics begin to explain why local police continue to bolster ICE operations illegally.

Even when abiding by “sanctuary” ordinances, the carceral system often acts as a “force multiplier” for ICE. Arrestees’ fingerprints are automatically sent to the FBI, which alerts ICE through federal databases. ICE may then issue detainer requests to local jails. Even if “sanctuary” cities deny these detainer requests, ICE can learn the individual’s location from information available to them in such databases. Courthouse proceedings, as matters of public record, indirectly assist ICE by allowing agents to track down and arrest people after criminal, family, immigration, or traffic court hearings.

As policing scholar Alex Vitale told Truthout, declarations of sanctuary are akin to political theatre. “They send a positive message — that local governments will not deny immigrants services,” he said. “But these pledges are a bit thin. They cannot in fact protect people from federal agents determined to pursue them, deny them services, and make them fearful.” Vitale pointed to legal indirect forms of cooperation, such as local police providing crowd control assistance during raids, and legal loopholes that allow police to turn over so-called “criminal aliens” directly to ICE, as examples of some policies’ limitations.

This close association between police and ICE is increasingly becoming a public relations problem for police departments.

“ICE is becoming a rogue police force with no accountability or transparency,” said William G. Lopez, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “I frankly think the escalation of ICE violence has happened so fast that many police departments [that] formerly supported ICE are not going to do so forever and have not come forward to say anything yet.”

Some police departments have attempted to confront potential public relations issues head on. InSan Jose, California, Police Chief Paul Joseph has gone door to door distributing flyers assuring residents that local police are not involved with immigration enforcement. The department even released an AI-generated video of Joseph speaking Spanish to spread the message.

But Vitale said it’s misleading for police to claim that “sanctuary” laws will protect residents and their neighbors from deportation. Because ICE routinely mines FBI criminal databases, gang databases, and court records, even brief contact with the criminal legal system can put people at risk.

Slowing the Deportation Machine

Across the country, activists and some lawmakers have been pushing to slow down what some describe as the police-assisted deportation machine.

In Providence, Rhode Island, organizers successfully pushed for amendments to the Community-Police Relations Act after members of the Rhode Island Deportation Defense Network (DDN) released a video showing a Providence police officer calling for “Ivan,” a man ICE was seeking, to come downstairs. After he complied, ICE immediately arrested him.

The footage sparked rallies and drew condemnation from local organizations including ACLU Rhode Island. The Providence police chief later claimed his officers did not participate in or assist with enforcement actions, and were present only to ensure the “wellbeing” of everyone involved, an explanation organizers emphatically reject.

“The only people whose wellbeing the Providence police were looking out for was that of ICE,” said Kate Hao, an organizer with Rhode Island’s DDN and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

A civilian oversight body later concluded that the department violated a local ordinance and its own policies during the encounter by establishing a perimeter, providing crowd control, gathering intelligence, and coordinating tactical positions for ICE.

Lawmakers in Providence hope the amendments will clarify ambiguities around cooperation by defining what constitutes assisting ICE operations and strengthening enforcement mechanisms. In particular, the amendment clarifies that the Providence Police Department may not provide non-public information to ICE; forbids them from using any city money, personnel, or resources to assist in immigration-related arrests; and prohibits them from establishing traffic perimeters or controlling public areas to assist immigration enforcement. It expands the definition of protected spaces in the city to include charter schools. It also clarifies data sharing policies, stating that police cannot collect demographic data with city-operated surveillance technologies such as the Real-Time Crime Center or Flock cameras. All partner agencies accessing city-owned data must formally agree not to share it with federal immigration enforcement. And the changes allow civil rights, human rights, and youth organizations to take civil action against the city, department, and officers for violating the Community-Police Relations Act.

The Long Beach City Council in California similarly strengthened its ordinance in August, adding measures that prohibit federal agents from access non-public city grounds, creating a certificate program for businesses offering safe spaces to undocumented residents, and establishing penalties for city workers and contractors who do not comply with its policies.

After securing strong protections, Rhode Island-based organizers are now turning their attention to cutting off indirect forms of assistance, such as courthouse arrests carried out by ICE. In July, the DDN launched a petition demanding a virtual option for hearings, trials, and conferences.

“We see ICE vehicles outside the courthouse every week,” said Hao, “literally waiting in ambush to kidnap community members as they leave the building.”

The petition quickly gained traction, drawing thousands of signatures. That pressure helped push the Providence City Council to unanimously pass a resolution directing two city courts to accommodate remote-hearing requests. “Now our petition is demanding that the rest of Rhode Island does the same,” she said, noting that the state already has the infrastructure and protocols from the COVID-19 era to make such accommodations routine.

Hao situated these policy changes as just one piece of a much larger struggle to build working-class power. “We have to fight back by building the organized power of our communities to defend our neighbors,” she said, “and make it clear that we won’t allow ICE to tear apart our families, no matter what the police and politicians decide to do.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/1-DSC08929-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:32.083339

See below for a full list of fiscal year 2025-2026 CBP and ICE contracts for companies based in Louisiana.","U.S. Border Patrol’s high-profile immigration crackdowns in North Carolina and Louisiana over the last two months have brought fresh scrutiny to the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on immigration raids and arrests under the Trump administration.

The massive spending bill pushed by Trump and passed by Congress this summer increased immigration enforcement by $170 billion, part of a broader push to reach the administration’s goal of deporting 1 million immigrants each year.

The new round of immigration spending includes $75 billion over four years for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, on top of the $10 billion the agency had already been allocated for 2025. The bill also gave $65 billion more to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), which had already received $20 billion for fiscal year 2025.

While CBP and ICE, which both operate under the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for immigration matters, Border Patrol has emerged as the leader in Trump’s anti-immigration crusade in recent months, according to immigration reporter Nick Miroff of The Atlantic. Under the bombastic leadership of Gregory Bovino, who grew up in western North Carolina, CBP has led a series of high-profile and militarized operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and New Orleans that have sparked widespread backlash due to their heavy-handed tactics and violations of due process.

Helping carry out Border Patrol and ICE’s immigration operations are an army of private contractors who have seen their fortunes soar as federal money has flowed into enforcement activities.

In the wake of the major operations in Louisiana and North Carolina, Facing South and the Institute for Southern Studies collected and analyzed data from USASpending.gov on more than 50 businesses headquartered in those states who are receiving CBP and ICE contracts for fiscal years 2025-2026. The contracts for companies based in Louisiana and North Carolina total more than $341 million.

North Carolina

The Facing South/Institute analysis finds 38 companies based in North Carolina receiving contracts from CBP and ICE. These contracts are currently valued at $61.7 million, with a potential to grow to $77.9 million once the work is completed.

One of the most notable contractors is Quantico Tactical, founded and owned by former Marine David Hensley. Based in Aberdeen, N.C., Quantico has received more than 50 contracts valued up to $19.3 million for fiscal years 2025-2026 providing a wide range of firearms, “less than lethal” munitions, restraints, communications equipment, and other supplies to both Border Patrol and ICE.

Other top contractors include Laboratory Corporation of America (Labcorp) in Burlington, N.C., which has contracts potentially valued up to $21.4 million for laboratory services, including at ICE detention centers, and TMC-TELESOLV of Battleboro, N.C., which has a contract valued up to $14.8 million for CBP’s Trusted Traveler Program.

Duncan-Parnell, Inc., in Charlotte has a $5 million CBP contract for drones, and MacGyver Solutions, Inc. has contracts valued up to $2.2 million for Polaris and Yamaha vehicles and ATVs.

In August, Hendrick Motorsports Technical Solutions of Concord, N.C. was given a $1.5 million no-bid contract to supply 25 Chevrolet Tahoe vehicles to ICE. The company is a spinoff of Hendrick Motorsports; both are owned by Rick Hendrick, a prominent Republican donor. Media attention about the deal during the North Carolina immigration raids led to calls to boycott Hendrick’s companies, which include car dealerships in the state.

Louisiana

In Louisiana, where Border Patrol’s “Operation Catahoula Crunch” is still underway, there are fewer contractors, but the total awards to companies based in the state is much larger.

Facing South/Institute analysis of contracting data finds 16 Louisiana-based companies receiving contracts from CBP and ICE in fiscal years 2025-2026. The current value of those awards is $50.3 million, but the total potential value is listed at $263.2 million for the state.

Topping the list are two companies which stand to bring in more than $208 million making emergency detention centers for ICE. LaSalle Corrections, which manages 18 private correctional facilities in Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, received a contract worth up to $125 million to build a new detention center. The company has a checkered history: In 2023, LaSalle agreed to a $7 million settlement over a wrongful death lawsuit, and the ACLU of Louisiana has frequently battled with the company over forced hysterectomies of ICE detainees and other alleged rights abuses.

Lemoine Disaster Recovery, LLC — a building and disaster services company headquartered in Lafayette, L.A. — was awarded a contract worth up to $83.8 million, also to build an emergency ICE detention facility.

Another major contract went to People Who Think, LLC — a marketing and political consulting firm founded by Republican political advisor Jay Connaughton. The firm’s $25 million contract is earmarked for an ICE recruitment campaign. Gulf South Research Group, based in Baton Rouge, pulled in several contracts totaling $21.6 million for environmental assessments and planning, including projects related to the border wall.

He and other members of the group asked ICE agents whether they knew the men’s identities so their families could be contacted.
The other man remained on the roof until about 1:30 p.m., when ICE agents left the scene.
ICE agents left around that time.","Immigration enforcement activity in Eden Prairie drew renewed scrutiny last week after federal agents detained a father outside an apartment complex while his 13-year-old son looked on, according to family members.

The Dec. 11 incident, along with a separate standoff involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a construction site in nearby Chanhassen on Dec. 13, prompted community members to gather at both locations to observe and document activity by ICE in the southwest metro.

Gomez and his 13-year-old son, Jose, went outside their Eden Prairie apartment building around 10:20 a.m. to move the family’s car so snow could be plowed, his wife, Karina, said. The property manager had emailed residents earlier that morning asking them to move their vehicles.

Watching from a window, Karina said she saw a group of people begin to run, then received a message that her son was being detained and placed in handcuffs.

Karina said she saw ICE officers throw her son to the ground and strike him. Gomez and Jose were then placed into a vehicle and driven away from the apartment complex.

Jose was later dropped off at his aunt’s home around the corner from the complex, Karina said, after Gomez told agents they could not take his son because he is a minor. Agents kept Gomez in custody and left with him.

Karina said she was on the phone with Gomez during the detention but has not heard from him since and does not know where he is being held.

After arriving at her sister’s home, Karina said Jose — who has a pre-existing heart condition — began feeling unwell. An ambulance and police were called. An Eden Prairie Police Department incident report states officers responded to a report of injuries following the incident.

Jose was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Shakopee, where medical staff treated his injuries and evaluated his heart after an abnormal heartbeat, Karina said. She said her husband has the same heart condition.

“I’m scared because I don’t know anything about where he is; he might get sick in jail and his heart might start racing too,” Karina said in an interview translated from Spanish.

Neither Karina nor Gomez are U.S. citizens, she said. Gomez arrived in the United States from Mexico in 2022. Karina and two of her children, including Jose, joined him late last year after seeking asylum through CBP One, a federal app used by migrants entering the country.

Gomez is the family’s sole provider, Karina said. She said she is worried about paying bills because she is afraid to leave the house and cannot work after recently giving birth to her daughter, who is 20 days old and the family’s only U.S. citizen.

Karina said the family fled Mexico after she and her children were threatened at gunpoint for money. She said she fears her husband could be seriously harmed or killed if he is sent back.

“I don’t want him to be sent back to Mexico because we came here fleeing crime,” Karina said. “The three of us came alone because they threatened my children with weapons.”

Karina said her son has been traumatized by the incident, waking at night screaming and crying, and that the stress has worsened his heart condition.

“He was there, he saw everything, he was traumatized by it. He keeps telling me, ‘Let’s go there, let’s go look for him.’ I tell him, ‘No, I can’t go out,’” Karina said. “What his father is going through is a source of distress for him.”

She said she does not think the agents’ actions were fair or right.

“They didn’t have the right to arrest my son,” Karina said. “I want justice for my son because this isn’t right.”

Karina’s sister, Yuri, said Gomez and Jose were treated like criminals even though they were not doing anything illegal when they moved their car, and that the violence they faced was unjustified.

“These aren’t criminals. They are people who work, people who support their families. What’s the justification for this?” Yuri said. “They are not criminals, they didn’t do anything wrong.”

People’s constitutional rights are being violated because of ICE’s presence in the community, Yuri said.

“Rights are not being respected, rights are being trampled upon,” Yuri said. “The Constitution is being violated, and there’s nothing we can do except for those who have documents to raise their voices for those who don’t.”

A family friend of Karina, Marion Vazquez, organized a GoFundMe to help cover the family’s living expenses, Jose’s medical bills and legal fees. As of Dec. 19, the fundraiser has raised nearly $7,800.

Eden Prairie Local News contacted ICE for comment. The agency said it needed additional identifying information to respond. That information was not available before publication.

ICE activity in Chanhassen

Immigration agents were also reported at a construction site in Chanhassen on Saturday, Dec. 13, where two men were working on the roof of a house, according to state Rep. Alex Falconer, a DFLer who represents District 49A in northern Eden Prairie and southern Minnetonka.

Falconer said he is part of a community group that monitors ICE activity and observes enforcement actions.

When he arrived around 10 a.m., Falconer said about 10 to 15 agents were positioned behind police tape around the house, with roughly 15 to 20 community members watching nearby.

“The two workers were up on the frame of the roof, we already had people reporting that they’re cold, they’re stranded,” Falconer said. “They can’t come down.”

Falconer asked several agents whether they had a judicial warrant to detain the men. He said many did not respond, but those who did told him they did not have a warrant.

He and other members of the group asked ICE agents whether they knew the men’s identities so their families could be contacted. Agents said they did not.

“They didn’t have a judicial warrant, they didn’t know who they were trying to find,” Falconer said. “They just saw two workers on a construction site and tried to detain them.”

Another woman at the scene, who requested anonymity, said an ICE agent told her the men were approached in what the agent described as a “consensual encounter” and fled when asked for their names. The agent said that gave officers probable cause to pursue them.

An ICE agent told the woman the area was being targeted because of a known criminal but said agents did not know whether either man was the person they were seeking.

Falconer said his primary concern was that no one in the crowd was injured and that no chemical agents were used.

Another attendee, who requested anonymity, said she saw an ICE agent shove a woman who was bringing blankets into a portable toilet.

Falconer said one of the men on the roof eventually succumbed to the cold and came down, and an ambulance transported him for medical attention. The other man remained on the roof until about 1:30 p.m., when ICE agents left the scene.

Onlookers asked ICE agents for permission to give the remaining man on the roof blankets, hand warmers or a warm drink to prevent hypothermia, Falconer said, but the requests were denied.

Falconer said two women later made their way to the back of the construction site and entered the building to give the man blankets and hand warmers. ICE agents left around that time.

After ICE departed, the man was able to come down from the roof, and members of the crowd helped him into a car to seek medical attention, Falconer said.

The Sahan Journal reported that the men were Edgar Chicaiza Dutan and Marco Chicaiza Dutan. Edgar Chicaiza Dutan came down from the roof first and was taken to a nearby hospital before being transported to the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center.

It was unclear whether Marco Chicaiza Dutan was detained, The Sahan Journal reported.",https://www.eplocalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1344-e1766085422554.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 16:57:39.786323

Virginia has two formal ICE detention centers, both located in Central Virginia: the Caroline Detention Center in Caroline County and the Farmville Detention Center in Prince Edward County.

As 8News has previously reported, the total detainee populations of these two facilities have steadily grown since President Donald Trump took office in late January, repeatedly breaking their own records.

However, as of Nov. 28, the Caroline Detention Center has surpassed its maximum capacity — and the Farmville Detention Center is less than two dozen detainees away from doing the same.

As of Nov. 28, the average daily detainee population of the Caroline Detention Center was 346, according to data compiled by TRAC Immigration. The facility’s maximum capacity is set at 336.

At the Farmville Detention Center, as of Nov. 28, the average daily detainee population was 712 — just 20 shy of its maximum capacity of 732.

TRAC Immigration also lists detainee information for Riverside Regional Jail, a Prince George County facility that entered into an agreement with ICE to house its detainees in May.

Riverside’s detainee population has ballooned since September. At that time, it held only an average of 9 detainees on a given day. As of Nov. 28, that average was 94 detainees.

What do we know about these detainees?

ICE’s own data reveals that the majority of the detainees held at Virginia facilities are not considered criminals. A similar number of these detainees have no “ICE Threat Level,” which means they have no criminal history.

Notably, most of the detainees held at Riverside are not considered criminals and have no ICE Threat Level.

More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next?","Each evening, drivers on the busy 101 freeway in downtown Los Angeles pass billboard-size portraits of Angelenos that flash across the side of a building with a simple message next to their faces: Am I Next?

Three Los Angeles institutions have teamed up to launch a response to federal immigration raids in the nation’s second-largest city, projecting illuminated images of everyday LA residents in support of the thousands of community members who have been detained this year.

Part of a protest art project entitled Am I Next?, the striking black and white images began appearing nightly on 6 November on the facades of the downtown buildings of the California Community Foundation, LA Plaza Cultura y Artes and the Japanese American National Museum in objection to the undermining of democratic norms and attacks on civil liberties.

Along with projecting portraits of Angelenos, Am I Next? highlights brief stories of people, including US citizens, accosted and snatched out of homes, cars, workplaces and the streets by federal agents, under the word “Taken”:

Mauricio, waiting for a bus.

Rosalina, at home with her children.

Juan, on lunch break from his construction job.

The campaign addresses the fear and trauma millions have experienced since Donald Trump and his administration began its violent and militarized approach to immigration enforcement in June – one that’s changed day-to-day life in a city where nearly half of its residents are Latino.

It also asks the question: if fellow residents are arrested without consideration of constitutional rights, then who is really safe?

“I carry my passport around, which I never imagined as a native Angeleno,” said Miguel Santana, president and chief executive of California Community Foundation, or CalFund. “I know people who are afraid to leave their homes, who don’t go shopping at Home Depot – because it doesn’t matter if you’re a US citizen or not. We’re putting up a mirror to what is happening.”

More than 65,000 immigrants across the US are confined in federal detention, a two-thirds increase since January, and recent data shows that 74% of those in custody have no criminal convictions.

A few of the faces in Am I Next? are familiar: the veteran actors and activists Edward James Olmos and George Takei, who was incarcerated as a five-year-old boy during the second world war, and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. The dozens of others are LA residents who Pulitzer-winning photographer Barbara Davidson met throughout city neighborhoods such as East LA, Venice and Echo Park.

“Some were too nervous to participate because they, or a family member, were in the process of becoming citizens and didn’t want to risk jeopardizing their application,” said Davidson. “Others were eager to take a stand against the ICE raids.”

A dedicated website allows people to submit their own photos in a show of solidarity.

“The photos draw contrast to the cowardice of the masked men who hide their faces because they know what they’re doing is wrong,” said Santana, whose own portrait appears on CalFund’s building, which is visible from City Hall and walking distance from ICE’s downtown LA detention center. “Courage is the best antidote to authoritarianism.”

For the Japanese American community, the use of force, dehumanization tactics, lack of due process and the racist targeting of immigrants feels all too familiar.

The Japanese American National Museum, or JANM, in historic Little Tokyo is not only a nightly canvas for protest art, but was where more than 37,000 Japanese Americans from Los Angeles boarded buses for American concentration camps in 1942. It’s also where about 75 armed federal agents conducted an immigration raid in August, during a news conference event with Gavin Newsom, a sight that caused widespread outrage.

“What’s at the heart of this campaign is a reminder to people that when we protect the rights of anyone in our community, we are really protecting the rights for everyone, including ourselves,” said James Herr, director of the Democracy Center at JANM. “The same kind of xenophobia, fear, prejudice and racism that Japanese Americans faced during world war two is what our current immigrant populations are facing.”

JANM’s evening projections also incorporate images of former incarcerated people with Angelenos standing against ICE raids.

At the nearby LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes, over 30 large-scale digital images and neon from 10 LA-based artists, including Brandy González, Lalo Alcaráz and Patrick Martinez are on view in addition to images from Am I Next? The bold and colorful works, entitled We Belong Here, reflect the immigrant experience and call for justice with messages such as “Invest in the oppressed“ and “It is the weak who are cruel”.

More institutions in Los Angeles and Long Beach plan to host Am I Next? on their walls, and Santana said he’s heard from colleagues in San Francisco and New York who are looking to project similar images to bring awareness.

“The violent way in which [immigration enforcement] is happening really needs to be exposed and not normalized,” said Santana, who said the project will run indefinitely. “We will keep it going until we can all sleep at night knowing that our core American constitutional rights are not going to be violated. We’re living in a moment where every American has to decide if those rights apply to all of us or some of us.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050396c33302b183c96c76b9d3d64e36f100b37b/0_0_1000_800/master/1000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd3b0919e20567f139395161314cb87d",N,,2025-12-20 17:57:12.955260

“The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.
The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.","The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.

The decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.

Immigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.

Trump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.

The Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.

The justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.

A union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.

Ramya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.

In recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.

The White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.

While the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.

A landmark 1992 lawsuit that reined in Border Patrol tactics around the campus is now colliding with a fresh policy shift in Washington and a recent Supreme Court order, and the combination has locals worrying that the protections they fought for are slipping away.

The 1992 case that shaped protections

Back in 1992, Bowie students, a coach, and school staff filed a class action against the Border Patrol after years of stops, searches, and detentions in the blocks surrounding the school. In Murillo v. Musegades, a federal judge certified the class and issued injunctive relief that told agents they needed reasonable suspicion and could not rely solely on a person’s race or appearance when deciding whom to stop. Case records show the lawsuit produced a preliminary injunction and pushed the agency to adopt training and other measures for agents. According to the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse, the suit was filed to halt what plaintiffs described as unconstitutional stops and searches around Bowie’s campus.

In El Paso, that ruling is still remembered as a turning point that helped seed the broader practice of limiting immigration enforcement at so-called sensitive locations, including schools. Advocates say the Bowie case was not just about legal doctrine; it was about giving students enough breathing room to walk to class in a border city where daily life and federal enforcement can feel uncomfortably intertwined.

Bowie memories and local fear

Former students and staff who testified in the 1990s recounted a tense routine outside the school: Border Patrol trucks pulling up to curbs, agents rifling through backpacks and questioning employees in front of students. Those encounters and threats have stuck with them for decades. Ernesto Muñoz, one of the students involved in the original case, told reporters that he and his family now take extra precautions, including carrying passports, because they fear being profiled. His experience, along with similar accounts from other alumni, has been detailed in recent coverage of how the Bowie case still echoes today, as reported by Texas Public Radio.

Policy reversal in Washington

On January 20, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive that revoked earlier guidance shielding so-called protected or sensitive locations, including schools, houses of worship, and hospitals. Instead, the department told agents to lean on enforcement discretion and “common sense.” In a statement that month, DHS declared, “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest,” language widely read as a sharp break from long-standing practice. The shift was announced by DHS and covered by national outlets, including Reuters.

Supreme Court stay and its aftermath

Over the summer and into the fall, lower federal courts in California imposed limits on certain roving immigration stops. In September, the Supreme Court stepped in and granted emergency relief, staying a district court order that had barred stops based solely on apparent race, language, occupation, or place. The unsigned stay drew a pointed dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote, “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” according to the Court’s published materials. The order is an interim measure while the underlying litigation continues in the lower courts, as documented by the Legal Information Institute.

Legal implications

Taken together, the DHS directive and the Supreme Court’s stay have narrowed the real-world protection that communities believed they had after the Bowie litigation, according to legal observers. The moves have also triggered a wave of new lawsuits and advocacy efforts. Several organizations and religious institutions have sued to block DHS’s rollback of protected-areas guidance, arguing that the change runs afoul of administrative law and religious-freedom guarantees. In those cases, plaintiffs have brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act and, in some complaints, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as tracked by Bloomberg Law and Public Counsel.

What it means for El Paso

Bowie High sprawls across roughly 60 acres, less than a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border, in a city that is more than 80 percent Mexican American. For many residents, the recent legal shifts have stirred up old worries about what can happen on a simple walk down the street. Former plaintiffs and alumni say the 1992 ruling created a sense of safety around the school that now feels tenuous under the new federal posture, a concern that has surfaced repeatedly in local interviews. “Even though I am an American citizen . . . I carry my passport with me everywhere I go,” one former student told Texas Public Radio.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/border-patrol-past-returns-to-bowie-high-as-new-crackdown-hits-el-paso.webp,N,,2025-12-20 18:58:27.758976

The backstory:

It all surrounds a 212c, which deals with convictions before 1997.

Alma Garza was supposed to periodically check in with ICE. When she did just that last month, she was taken into custody.

Garza has been a legal resident of the United States since 1978. Her United States permanent resident card doesn't expire until 9/23/2035.

In 1995, Garza plead guilty to felony marijuana possession and served three years' probation.

After the 212c became an issue, her daughter, Alma Torres, says her mother did everything she was supposed to do, yet she was detained when she went to the ICE office last month for her routine check-in.

Torres says her mother hasn't had any legal trouble since the 1995 conviction, and she doesn't understand why she's being detained.

She says her mother is diabetic and the stress of being held in the detention center is taking a toll on her health.

The mother of five adults could be deported. She has a trial set for sometime in 2026.

Nowhere does the agency provide statistical proof that these trained, federally authorized drivers are less safe than anyone else.
This hostility did not emerge spontaneously; it intensified after government statements portraying immigrant drivers as threats.
Lawfully present, federally authorized immigrant drivers meet the same safety standards as every other CDL holder.
Immigration status is not — and has never been — a proxy for risk.","Federal regulators have created a trucking crisis — and they did it by ignoring their own evidence, bypassing basic safeguards and targeting a workforce that has kept America moving through every national emergency of the past decade.

In September, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) issued an interim final rule that effectively bars most lawfully present, work-authorized immigrant drivers from obtaining, renewing or maintaining non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses.

The rule limits eligibility to just three visa categories — H-2A, H-2B and E-2 — while excluding refugees, asylees, DACA recipients and other federally authorized workers who have long been able to drive using a valid employment authorization document.

These drivers meet every federal safety requirement, pass the same tests, satisfy the same medical standards and comply with the same drug-and-alcohol protocols as every other CDL holder. Yet FMCSA is treating immigration category as a disqualifying risk.

The agency offers no practical evidence that immigration status predicts highway danger. Instead, it points to a handful of isolated crashes and speculative concerns about foreign driving records that some states may struggle to verify.

FMCSA’s own regulatory analysis acknowledges that the rule will force roughly 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders, about 97 percent of this workforce — to exit the freight market. Nowhere does the agency provide statistical proof that these trained, federally authorized drivers are less safe than anyone else.

The weakness of the rule becomes clearer when you examine the cases federal officials spotlighted to justify it. After August’s fatal accident involving a Sikh trucker in Florida, pundits and government voices rushed to portray the named driver as an “illegal immigrant,” using the tragedy to argue that states were recklessly licensing “dangerous foreign drivers.”

That narrative was false. He held a state-issued commercial license and a valid employment authorization document — the same credentials federal rules had long recognized as sufficient.

Those facts were in the government’s own files but were pushed aside in favor of a storyline that made immigration status — not the actual safety record — the focus of public outrage.

The pattern repeated in Ontario, California, weeks later. After a September crash involving another Sikh driver, speculation exploded across social media and cable analysis, including widely spread allegations that the named trucker had been driving under the influence.

Those claims were also false. Official toxicology results came back negative, countering sensational allegations that had already shaped public sentiment.

Rather than correct the record, critics folded the case into the same sweeping narrative, suggesting, again without evidence, that immigrant drivers posed a systemic threat despite having met every federal safety requirement.

Both tragedies were real, but Washington’s selective framing was a choice, one that turned isolated incidents into a manufactured rationale for a national crackdown on work-authorized immigrant drivers.

The result is a policy driven less by evidence than by politics. Courts have long held that agencies cannot rely on impermissible factors, such as nationality or immigration status masked as a safety metric, to justify sweeping rulemaking.

That is why on Nov. 10, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an administrative stay, pausing FMCSA’s rule while it evaluates whether the agency exceeded its authority and failed to justify its departure from longstanding federal practice.

Meanwhile, the human and economic fallout is unfolding now. Sikh and immigrant truckers — roughly 1 in 5 long-haul drivers — are reporting harassment, profiling and bias at levels that my organization, UNITED SIKHS, has not seen in years.

Drivers describe water bottles thrown at their trucks, insults shouted from passing vehicles and increased traffic stops solely because of how they look or the turbans and unshorn beards that are sacred markers of Sikh faith. This hostility did not emerge spontaneously; it intensified after government statements portraying immigrant drivers as threats.

The policy also destabilizes an already strained supply chain. The trucking industry is projected to face a shortage of more than 160,000 drivers by 2030. Removing nearly 200,000 trained, authorized drivers — without demonstrating any safety benefit — is reckless.

When experienced drivers are sidelined, those remaining face longer hauls, tighter schedules and greater fatigue. Federal safety research makes clear what that means: more exhaustion, more risk and less stability for the freight system that keeps hospitals, grocery stores and small businesses supplied.

Across the country, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow otherwise-eligible residents to obtain standard driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status because lawmakers understand a basic truth: licensed, trained and insured drivers make roads safer. FMCSA’s rule ignores that truth entirely.

Federal leadership cannot remain silent while misinformation shapes national policy. Lawfully present, federally authorized immigrant drivers meet the same safety standards as every other CDL holder. Immigration status is not — and has never been — a proxy for risk.

America’s freight system depends on these drivers. The real danger to our roads is not immigrant truckers, it is the willingness of federal officials to substitute political narratives for evidence.

“The [justice department] is breaking the law by not releasing the full Epstein files.","Donald Trump’s justice department was hit with legal threats and scathing outrage after authorities released a limited, heavily redacted trove of Jeffrey Epstein files in an apparent violation of the law mandating the near-complete disclosure of these documents by Friday.

“The justice department’s document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie and my Epstein Transparency Act,” Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure of all Epstein files by 19 December, said in a video statement.

“It is an incomplete release, with too many redactions. Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options,” he also said, among them possible impeachment of justice department officials, finding them in contempt of Congress.

Khanna also floated the possibility of “referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice”.

“Unfortunately, today’s document release by @AGPamBondi and @DAGToddBlanche grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law that @realDonaldTrump signed just 30 days ago. @RepRoKhannais correct,” Massie, a Kentucky member of Congress and co-author of this legislation, said on X.

“A future [justice department] could convict the current AG and others because the Epstein Files Transparency Act is not like a Congressional Subpoena which expires at the end of each Congress,” Massie said at another point.

Trump’s justice department was required to release all investigative files involving the late financier by 19 December under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The legislation does allow for records to be withheld or redacted if their disclosure would imperil present criminal investigations, threaten national security or identify Epstein’s victims – but otherwise it mandates disclosure of everything else.

The department’s initial disclosure on Friday afternoon, and subsequent releases throughout the night, did not abide by this requirement. Justice officials recognized as much on Friday morning, pre-empting this apparent slow walk on television. Todd Blanche, Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer turned deputy attorney general, said the justice department would not release all its files on Friday.

“I expect we’re going to release several hundred thousand documents today, and those documents will come in all different forms, photographs and other materials associated with all of the investigations into Mr Epstein,” Blanche said during a Fox News interview.

“I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,” Blanche also said. “There’s a lot of eyes looking at these and we want to make sure that when we do produce the materials we are producing, that we are protecting every single victim.”

Some new files, including transcripts, were released on Saturday.

Late on Friday, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among the bipartisan chorus of lawmakers slamming Trump’s justice department, including the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel, for the documents’ lackluster rollout.

“Now the coverup is out in the open. This is far from over. Everyone involved will have to answer for this,” Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said on X. “Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, whole admin. Protecting a bunch of rapists and pedophiles because they have money, power, and connections. Bondi should resign tonight.”

Fellow Democratic congressman Robert Garcia voiced similar sentiments.

“The [justice department] is breaking the law by not releasing the full Epstein files. This is not transparency. This is just more coverup by Donald Trump and Pam Bondi. They need to release all the files, NOW,” the Democratic oversight committee leader said on X.

“The [justice department] has had months and hundreds of agents to put these files together, and yet entire documents are redacted – from the first word to the last. What are they hiding? The American public deserves transparency. Release all the files now!” he also commented.

In a joint statement from House oversight committee Democrats, Garcia and Jamie Raskin said: “Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein’s decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring …

“We are now examining all legal options in the face of this violation of federal law,” the statement added.

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said the release violated both “the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law”.

“Senate Democrats are working to assess the documents that have been released to determine what actions must be taken to hold the Trump administration accountable,” Schumer also said. “We will pursue every option to make sure the truth comes out.”

Trump’s justice department has gone on the defensive over this criticism, insisting on social media that authorities are complying with the law. A justice department account on X pointed to the many photos of Bill Clinton released in the tranche, claiming their disclosure bolstered claims of accountability. (Clinton has denied wrongdoing related to Epstein and expressed regret for previously associating with him.)","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61b2984b93810628bd47c0b7af1ab09000b0d249/514_429_3079_2464/master/3079.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e30128fcb72d8b2c5e1106016b02e33f",N,,2025-12-20 13:57:16.286049

When unaccompanied immigrant children first arrive in the US, they are apprehended by CBP and remain in their custody for a maximum of 72 hours.
Meanwhile, the number of unaccompanied children arriving to the US across the Mexico border has significantly decreased this year, due to the Trump administration’s border policies severely restricting asylum.
Wyden wrote in his 8 December letter that the document is not only coercive, but “it intentionally misrepresents the US Government’s obligations to unaccompanied children under law”.","Border officials are pressuring unaccompanied children who arrive in the US as undocumented immigrants to quickly agree to return to their countries of origin, even if they express fear for their safety there – or else face “prolonged” detention and other consequences, a federal government document reveals.

The document, which emerged as an attachment in a court filing made by immigration attorneys, is understood to be presented or read to children within the first few days of them entering the US while they are still in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), before they can see any relatives in the US.

The document is termed an “advisal” and was attached as exhibit A at the bottom of a court filing by advocates. It says: “If you choose to seek a hearing with an immigration judge or indicate a fear of returning to your country you can expect the following: you will be detained in the custody of the United States Government for a prolonged period of time.” It goes on to say that the child’s sponsor – usually a family member residing in the US who will care for the child – “may be arrested, prosecuted and deported” if they do not have legal status, or prosecuted “for aiding your illegal entry”, and adds that if the child turns 18 in government custody they “will be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] for removal (deportation) …”

A US senator is now demanding “this cruel policy” be abolished, saying it “cynically exploits” unaccompanied children’s unique vulnerabilities as a way of pushing the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, a Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate’s finance committee, has written to CBP accusing the agency of trying to frighten children into abandoning their rights by showing them a document with choices that he describes as “shockingly coercive”.

He added in the letter, shared exclusively with the Guardian, that the policy was “clearly intended to frighten unaccompanied children into abandoning the legal relief and protections they are seeking”.

The document, titled the UAC [Unaccompanied Alien Children] Processing Pathway Advisal, was filed in court in Washington DC as part of a longstanding lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), opposing the detention of children immediately after they turn 18, brought by the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), an immigrants’ rights and legal organization based in Chicago, and other organizations. The advisal and the court filing were first reported by ProPublica last month, as part of a wider investigation by that outlet into immigrant child detention.

A CBP spokesperson sent a statement to the Guardian this week that said: “The advisal document provided to unaccompanied children explains options available under the Immigration and Nationality Act on their path forward. CBP’s duty is to follow the law and protect children. Many unaccompanied minors are brought to the border by smugglers and face real risks of exploitation, which is why providing a clear, lawful advisal is essential. It ensures they understand their rights and options – and for many who were trafficked or coerced, returning home to their family is the safest path.”

Wyden first wrote to CBP on 4 November about the policy change after reading US media reports about it, and then, after the advisal emerged, wrote to the agency again on 8 December. In the latest letter, he wrote: “Unaccompanied children are a uniquely vulnerable population, arriving in this country without guardians and often fleeing threats of violence, trafficking, abuse, and neglect. CBP’s new policy and the Advisal cynically exploit these vulnerabilities to remove unaccompanied children before they can access essential protections.”

The advisal offers an apparent incentive if children agree to return whence they came. “If you choose to voluntarily return to your country, there will be no administrative consequence, and you will still have the opportunity to apply for a visa, through legal means, in the future,” it says.

However, this is a “false carrot”, said Lisa Koop, the national director of legal services for the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC).

“It gives a suggestion that you can come back legally if you withdraw your request now,” Koop explained. “While there is perhaps some scenario where someone qualifies for a student visa or a family-based visa decades in the future, the suggestion that there’s going to be a legal path is a false one.”

CBP put the new policy in place earlier this year and it was previously confirmed in a 4 December letter to Wyden by the CBP commissioner, Rodney Scott, that the Guardian obtained.

Wyden’s letter comes as the Trump administration escalates its immigration enforcement operations aimed at immigrant children: this year, officials have sought out unaccompanied immigrant children to deport them or pursue criminal cases against them or their vetted sponsors; offered cash incentives for children to leave; and attempted to secretly and quickly deport dozens of Guatemalan children.

When unaccompanied immigrant children first arrive in the US, they are apprehended by CBP and remain in their custody for a maximum of 72 hours. Unaccompanied children are then transferred to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), where they are placed in shelters or foster homes or with vetted sponsors. ORR comes under the umbrella of the federal Department of Health and Human Services and also offers some legal assistance for children, through other organizations, to navigate the complicated immigration courts and asylum processes.

The document came to NIJC’s attention when an attorney, representing an unaccompanied child in an ORR shelter, discovered it among the child’s other records. The identity or other personal details about the minor in question have not been publicly disclosed.

Some children affected, who oftentimes have a limited understanding of the English language, are seemingly provided with the potentially intimidating advisal document without access to legal help, since they are still in CBP custody, before being transferred to the control of ORR.

Koop from NIJC says she and her team had never seen the advisal before they obtained it last month, despite having worked on hundreds of cases with unaccompanied minors.

“It’s not something that we’ve seen or that we were aware of in advance,” Koop said. “The most generous reading would be that it is extremely misleading.”

It is unclear whether the advisal is a piece of paper given to children or if it is just information that CBP officials verbally convey to children, Koop said. The short document, with its bullet points marking the different warnings, is in English and Spanish.

Meanwhile, the number of unaccompanied children arriving to the US across the Mexico border has significantly decreased this year, due to the Trump administration’s border policies severely restricting asylum.

“We know this administration is laser-focused on deporting children and preventing unaccompanied minors from accessing protection in the United States,” Koop said. “Even under the first Trump administration, we didn’t see this kind of coercion and threats. This is new and different.”

In mid-November, attorneys included the advisal in a court filing, as part of a longstanding lawsuit against DHS opposing the detention of children who turn 18.

It is unclear how many children the policy has so far affected.

Wyden wrote in his 8 December letter that the document is not only coercive, but “it intentionally misrepresents the US Government’s obligations to unaccompanied children under law”.

“While I have no difficulty believing the Trump administration intends to break the law, even at the expense of this vulnerable group, the Advisal blatantly misrepresents the rights unaccompanied children are entitled to in order to coerce them into voluntarily departing,” Wyden writes. “Further, the Advisal threatens immigration enforcement against family members to discourage children from seeking to reunify.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b473664ce8a9a033c7254ff69938d8a5bd5873df/331_781_4014_3212/master/4014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bb76f50fa652909cd8d8b19432c3237",N,,2025-12-20 11:58:16.858874

Each person who received such a ruling has 30 days to appeal it.

The rulings, immigration attorneys said, open the door for hundreds more immigrants across the Bay Area to be sent to countries like Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, which have agreements with the United States to take asylum-seekers. They can theoretically continue applying for asylum from there, but that would be up to the host government.

One mother, who appeared beside her husband, tearfully accepted the news that Judge Patrick O’Brien had granted the Department of Homeland Security’s motion to send her family to Honduras. Technically, this is called a pretermit.

At the hearing, she stood before O’Brien with only her husband as her two teenage sons were in school. All will be sent to Honduras if they are unable to successfully appeal the motion. Judge O’Brien also ruled in favor of the government’s motions against two other families and one man.

The rulings have broad implications. Blaine Bookey, the legal director at UC Law San Francisco, said hundreds of asylum-seekers in the region have received “pretermit motions” in recent weeks to move their cases to third countries.

All could now receive similar judgments, and be at risk for deportation.

Jorge Ramirez, an asylum-seeker from South America in court on Thursday, received a 30-day reprieve, but the possibility of being sent to Honduras lingers. “This situation has taken me by surprise,” he said in Spanish. “I came here in fear of my life, escaping my country … I came with trust in this country and understanding that it respects human rights.”

In response to a flood of cases like Ramirez’s, Bay Area attorneys have been working around the clock to help asylum-seekers respond to the new motions, using pre-written templates to help expedite the mass filings.

Filing a response is critical and preserves an asylum-seeker’s right to appeal a decision in favor of removal. If an asylum-seeker fails to file the mandatory response, judges can rule solely based on the government’s motion, said Nicole Gorney, an attorney for the nonprofit VIDAS LEGAL.

“Right now, it’s about trying to preserve any option for them, because we need time,” she said. Gorney and other attorneys are hoping for an injunction that will halt these motions altogether.

Until then, detentions are likely to spike for those without lawyers. “They’re not going to have a way to defend themselves and they’ll be detained and held in detention centers with nowhere to go,” said Milli Atkinson, head of the immigration unit at the Bar Association of San Francisco.

Another asylum-seeker on Thursday’s docket sat beside her attorney, who had filed a 134-page brief on her behalf in response to another motion to send the woman to Honduras.

The lawyer opened by reminding O’Brien that Honduras was under no obligation to allow the woman to seek asylum there. A March 2020 agreement with the United States, he argued, limits the quota of asylum-seekers to 240 over two years, or about 10 people per month.

O’Brien said his hands were tied. “The Board [of Immigration Appeals] has already told me that I can’t consider that,” he said.

Honduras is an extremely dangerous country, the lawyer continued, especially for women. “Honduras has one of the highest rates of violent deaths of women in the world,” the World Bank wrote in a 2023 report. O’Brien commended the attorney’s arguments but granted the request for her removal. “I understand that Honduras is a dangerous place for women,” he told the attorney. “But I can’t find that she is likely to be tortured there, despite the country’s conditions.”

“The law is not on your side,” he said in another asylum-seekers’ case.

Each asylum-seeker now has 30 days to submit an appeal. When Ramirez left the courtroom on Thursday, he felt hopeless.

“What will I do in Honduras?” he asked. “I feel discouraged, very sad, and very worried at this moment.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082625_MMG_SansomePrayerVigil-03-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:35.463825

The decision represents one of the most significant judicial challenges to the administration’s use of the offshore military installation as part of its broader immigration agenda.

U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, sitting in Washington, D.C., denied the federal government’s request to dismiss a class‑action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, allowing the case to proceed and sharply limiting the administration’s ability to rely on Guantánamo as a holding site for migrants awaiting deportation.

A legal setback for the administration

Judge Sooknanan concluded that federal immigration law does not authorize the executive branch to detain deportable migrants at overseas military bases, a finding that directly undercuts the administration’s justification for expanding operations at Guantánamo Bay.

The ruling prevents the government from shutting down the lawsuit and opens the door to further judicial scrutiny of the policy.

The ACLU indicated it will now seek a formal closure order requiring the government to halt migrant detentions at the base, a step the judge did not take in her ruling but left open for future litigation.

The decision follows Trump’s January directive instructing federal agencies to prepare the Guantánamo facility to hold up to 30,000 migrants.

Trump said, “We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people… we’re going to send them out to Guantanamo,” according to statements reported at the time.

How the Policy Developed

The administration began transferring migrants with final removal orders to Guantánamo in February, using the base as a staging point for deportations.

Court records cited by the judge show that between February and June, federal authorities held hundreds of migrants there as part of the expanded enforcement effort.

According to filings referenced in the ruling, immigration authorities housed approximately 710 male detainees in a tent‑based setup supported by U.S. soldiers and Marines.

The ACLU’s lawsuit centers on two individuals who were deported through the base and argues that the policy places migrants in a “legal limbo,” depriving them of access to counsel and procedural protections commonly available within the United States.

Immigrant‑rights groups and individual plaintiffs contend that the use of an overseas military installation for routine immigration detention violates statutory limits on executive power and undermines due‑process rights.

They argue that detainees transferred to Guantánamo face significant barriers to legal representation and judicial review.

Government response

The Department of Homeland Security has defended the use of Guantánamo, saying it falls within the agency’s authority to hold noncitizens with final removal orders at a U.S. military facility and arguing the policy targets severe criminal cases.

In public statements to reporters, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the government “look forward to a higher court’s vindication of our use of this facility to keep criminals off American streets.”

The government has signaled it will press its legal arguments on appeal if necessary.

Voices from civil-rights groups

Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said that the expansion of Guantánamo for immigration purposes resurrects the base’s “symbol of lawlessness and torture” and that courts must act to protect detainees’ rights.

Eunice Cho of the ACLU’s National Prison Project called offshore transfers “cruel, secretive and illegal,” warning that incommunicado detention violates constitutional protections.

The government has indicated that it may seek appellate relief if adverse rulings are upheld.

The plaintiffs are pressing not only to stop new transfers but to secure meaningful court oversight and, ultimately, to prevent the continued practice of warehousing immigration detainees at Guantánamo.",https://media.knewz.com/bdbyftnvpv/styles/card-social/2025/12/19/Untitled-design-85.png.webp?version=69460e2d7d9aa,N,,2025-12-20 17:57:48.682814

But with fewer and fewer legal pathways to enter the United States, asylum claims have proliferated in recent years.
In his first term in office, Mr. Trump, a vocal skeptic of asylum seekers, began an almost methodical approach to dismantling the asylum process.
But accelerating dismissals of asylum cases is a misguided way to address the backlog, he added.
The United States has had such an agreement with its close ally and neighbor Canada for more than two decades.","The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to deport people to countries where they have no connections.

Last month, lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security filed almost 5,000 motions to dismiss asylum cases and force applicants to seek protection elsewhere, a staggering increase from the few hundred such motions filed each month this summer.

The surge, documented in an analysis of public immigration court data, comes as federal officials have been working out new asylum agreements with a handful of nations, including Honduras and Uganda. Under these “safe third country” accords, foreign governments are offering to take in limited numbers of asylum seekers from the United States, promising that the U.S. deportees will be able to apply for asylum in those nations instead.

In immigration courts across the country, government lawyers are now increasingly asking judges to “pretermit,” or dismiss, asylum cases without hearings, asserting that applicants can seek asylum in those “safe third countries.”

Judges appear receptive to the requests, according to the court data analysis. In November, at least 230 asylum seekers who were not citizens of Honduras were ordered expelled to Honduras, as compared with 40 such people in October and one in September.

Homeland Security officials say the process will allow people to pursue asylum claims in countries where they do not fear persecution. “D.H.S. is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,” the agency said in a statement.

In some cases, an immigrant may be subject to multiple motions, and D.H.S. officials have told agency prosecutors across the country that they should list as many third-country agreements as possible for a given immigrant, according to agency guidance obtained by The New York Times.

But as this practice has been expanded, it has been coming under more scrutiny, with deportation to Uganda, more than 7,000 miles from Washington, faulted by some immigration lawyers as unduly harsh.

On Friday, D.H.S. lawyers were issued a new directive that motions seeking deportation to Uganda could be filed only for immigrants from most other African nations, according to the document obtained by The Times. For motions to Uganda that had already been filed, it instructed lawyers to “expeditiously move to withdraw” them. That included the high-profile case of Heng Guan, the Chinese national who sought asylum in the United States after recording the surveillance of Uyghurs.

Lawyers who represent immigrants and scholars who study the asylum system called the motions the latest attempt to dismantle international human rights protections that President Trump has denounced as a “scam.”

In the federal lawsuit filed during the first Trump administration and resurrected in September, several asylum seekers and immigrant rights groups contend that the third-country asylum agreements are unlawful and an attempt to shirk the United States’ international obligations.

For decades, a person who enters the United States and seeks asylum has been allowed to live and work in the country while the case moves through an overburdened and underfunded court system.

But with fewer and fewer legal pathways to enter the United States, asylum claims have proliferated in recent years. The backlog now totals almost four million cases, and wait times for hearings have tended to span about four years and in some cases longer. That in turn has made the asylum system a target for critics from across the political spectrum. They argue the broken system incentivizes migrants with claims that have little or no merit under international law to use the form of relief as the surest path to remain in the country for at least several years.

In his first term in office, Mr. Trump, a vocal skeptic of asylum seekers, began an almost methodical approach to dismantling the asylum process. In 2024, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prevented migrants from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border after crossings at the border reached record heights, a policy that led those numbers to later drastically drop.

Since Mr. Trump’s return to the White House, his administration has taken its most aggressive actions against the system yet. It has directed Homeland Security lawyers to request the dismissal of asylum cases en masse. It has urged immigration judges to deny relief without holding hearings. It has put all pending asylum applications on hold.

Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the asylum system had long been due for a reckoning because of the pressures it has been under for generations. But accelerating dismissals of asylum cases is a misguided way to address the backlog, he added. The administration has been pursuing the fast-track strategy while simultaneously underfunding the system, he said, meaning fewer resources to ensure petitioners are having their cases fairly resolved.

“Efficiency is one goal, but so is accuracy, and you can be very efficient but be very inaccurate,” he said.

The analysis that showed the surge in dismissal motions for asylum seekers was conducted by Joseph Gunther, an independent mathematician, and Brandon Marrow, a civic technologist, who teamed up to analyze immigration court data as part of an effort to make the asylum process more transparent. Their research is shared on a website that Mr. Marrow created to provide free immigration court insights for lawyers.

The analysis showed that Homeland Security lawyers began filing motions to dismiss in hundreds of cases in Omaha over the summer, shortly after the administration signed new asylum agreements with Guatemala and Uganda. The practice took off in November after the Board of Immigration Appeals — the Justice Department body that reviews rulings from immigration courts and sets their policies — overturned a judge’s ruling in one of those asylum cases and delivered a decisive victory for the Department of Homeland Security.

Under that decision, immigration judges are instructed to consider whether to dismiss asylum cases without hearings on the grounds that immigrants can instead be sent to other countries to pursue relief there. The United States has had such an agreement with its close ally and neighbor Canada for more than two decades. But the new agreements are with a host of less stable nations: Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras, all of which have endured high levels of gang violence, and Uganda, which has a checkered human rights record and borders conflict regions in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

For months, the Trump administration has been deporting migrants to troubled nations such as South Sudan, and to the tiny African monarchy of Eswatini. But the newer “safe third country” agreements are different in that they require that deportees from the United States be afforded access to a bona fide asylum process.

It remains unclear how many people the government will ultimately be able to deport to Uganda and elsewhere. Yet in courts, asylum seekers are already seeing their cases upturned.

Immigration lawyers say they are being given little notice of the new government motions and have not received copies of the third-country agreements, making it difficult to identify potential exceptions for their clients.

The board’s decision has left some asylum seekers and their lawyers to try to assess risks for several countries at once. “People are now in a position of having to show they fear persecution in five countries at the same time,” said Keren Zwick, a lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center, one of the groups that filed suit against the administration over its use of third-country agreements.

In an interview, Mauro, 43, an asylum seeker in Virginia, said he fled Ecuador and applied for U.S. asylum in 2023. He said he had been tortured and threatened with death by political operatives. But a day before his final hearing this November, his lawyers were notified that the U.S. government wants to send him to Honduras instead. Now, he and his lawyer are preparing to argue that he would fear persecution there as well.

“I’ve always believed that the United States is the only country where the values of free speech and democracy prevail, the only country where asylum is truly granted,” said Mauro, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from his persecutors.

At 26 Federal Plaza, the federal building that has become the epicenter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New York City, the new fast-track strategy was evident this past week in the churn of cases going before judges in immigration courts.

Excerpted From: Lindsay Nash, The Immigration Subpoena Power, 125 Columbia Law Review 1 (January, 2025) (504 Footnotes) (Full Document)

After a series of public losses in its war on “sanctuary” cities, the first Trump Administration deployed the immigration subpoena, a new and formidable weapon in this fight. It used these agency-issued subpoenas to retaliate against its political foes--cities and states that refused to participate in federal immigration enforcement--and demand they do what the federal government could not otherwise compel: provide confidential information that would allow ICE to arrest, prosecute, and deport their constituents.

Unlike President Donald Trump's prior efforts, this tactic proved effective. Of course, some cities initially resisted, but once the spotlight faded, that defiance was short-lived. Challenging these subpoenas, the cities seemed to conclude, was futile. And they stood down, quietly turning over the very information they had promised to protect.

Though brief, this battle had enormous implications. For the immigrants caught in the crossfire, it meant exposure to some of the harshest penalties in our legal system: arrest, detention, and exile from their families and homes. For cities and states, it exposed a major chink in the armor of local sovereignty, one that could undermine subfederal policy on policing, privacy, and control of local resources. And, for the effort to disentangle local government from immigration enforcement, it landed a trenchant blow. It showed how these subpoenas could jeopardize one of the most powerful immigrant-protective movements of the twenty-first century: the sanctuary policies that prevent state and local actors from providing confidential information and other resources to facilitate federal immigration enforcement. In other words, the immigration subpoena offensive worked as intended--and ICE suggested that this was only the beginning and that it might start using this tactic “much more broadly.”

But has it? And how else does ICE use these administrative subpoenas--issued without judicial sign-off, active litigation, or even probable cause--to demand that recipients provide confidential records, testify against others, or present themselves for interrogation? The problem--perhaps the biggest takeaway from this episode--is that no one knows. In short, this episode revealed major, unanswered questions about when, how, and with what constraints the massive immigration enforcement agency uses its subpoena power more broadly.

These questions are particularly pronounced because the immigration subpoena regime has long operated in darkness. Although the immigration subpoena power is over a century old, information about when and how the government uses it is virtually nonexistent in the public domain. Unlike the typical subpoena issued by a federal court, these “investigative” subpoenas issued by ICE are not part of public, ongoing legal proceedings, nor are they formally connected to any filed charge or complaint. And, since ICE may issue these subpoenas to obtain information about almost any matter related to the immigration domain without a reason to even suspect that a legal violation has occurred, these subpoenas may never make it into any public record or onto any litigant's radar.

Perhaps for these reasons, immigration subpoenas have largely escaped both the legal battles raging over other ICE tactics and the scrutiny of scholars, reporters, and courts. To be sure, scholars such as Professors Medha D. Makhlouf and Bridget Fahey have published important work identifying some of the concerns that ICE's subpoenas and other information-gathering tools could raise. But no scholar has examined the immigration subpoena regime as a whole or how the agency wields this power on the ground. Indeed, the government itself lacks the fundamental information necessary to study this regime because ICE has no functional system for even tracking--much less analyzing--subpoenas' use in the immigration realm. Thus, despite in-depth examinations of other aspects of immigration enforcement and administrative subpoenas in other contexts, the immigration subpoena regime remains unstudied, largely unchallenged, and, for many, entirely unknown.

The need to understand this regime has never been greater. While local governments have long played an important role in federal immigration enforcement in the nation's interior, the increased resistance to state and municipal collaboration has changed the enforcement landscape. Specifically, because so many local law enforcement agencies now refuse to arrest and detain for immigration purposes, ICE relies even more heavily on information gathered, generated, and retained by local governments. As the federal fury over sanctuary cities' refusal to provide this information shows, the interior immigration enforcement regime depends on this information at every stage, from identifying potential targets to executing arrests to effecting deportations.

While ICE has publicly focused on obtaining this information from police, jailors, and probation departments, its reach into local interactions does not end there. Because immigration arrests and prosecutions can implicate virtually every aspect of people's lives--including spouses' employment, children's schooling, and medical care--so too can ICE's investigative powers. In this way, these investigations can extend beyond the individuals under investigation to anyone--including U.S. citizens--with whom they associate. Thus, knowing how ICE uses its subpoena power to obtain this information is critical to understanding the extent to which local entities remain complicit in immigration enforcement, the practical and legal implications of the immigration subpoena regime, and the efficacy of constraints on this power in the civil immigration realm.

This Article begins to answer these questions, providing the first comprehensive account of the immigration subpoena power. Drawing on previously undisclosed agency records reflecting thousands of subpoenas used in investigations nationwide, it shows how the agency wields a power initially created to facilitate racial exclusion at the border to reach deep into some of the most intimate areas of people's lives, including schools, social services agencies, and other historically protected domains. Indeed, it shows that the agency has long used these subpoenas to obtain children's records from schools, compel sensitive records from local agencies, surveil people's movements, and more.

This Article also reveals the significant federalism implications of ICE's subpoena practice. It demonstrates that, contrary to the agency's own representations, ICE regularly used these subpoenas to compel state and local law enforcement to participate in federal immigration enforcement well before Trump and has continued doing so to the present day. But it also shows that ICE's practice of subpoenaing states and localities that refuse to participate in federal immigration enforcement has recently transformed and become embedded in ICE policy, creating a formal structure for waging an intersovereign subpoena battle that rages on, largely in secret, today.

This Article not only shows where the agency uses this power but also provides troubling new insight into how. It reveals that the agency has sought to broaden its subpoena power to make prospective demands for information and real-time surveillance, attempted to foist investigatory functions upon subfederal government entities, and tried to obscure its subpoena practices by imposing all-encompassing, indefinite--and unlawful--gag orders upon subpoena recipients. Ultimately, this study paints a troubling picture of how ICE uses this power to force subfederal governments and others to contribute to immigration arrests and detention.

In addition to this descriptive contribution, this Article makes two important analytical claims. First, it argues that this examination exposes patterns of unauthorized and unconstitutional conduct that permeate the immigration subpoena regime. It shows how ICE's use of immigration subpoenas implicates a host of constitutional questions--related to federalism, privacy, and free speech--that have gone unanswered and, in some respects, entirely unexplored. And it contends that this study helps raise and even resolve some of these questions by demonstrating the ways that ICE's practices impinge on core constitutional rights and constraints. These findings are important not only to identify these issues but also because they open three paths to agency restraint: They give rise to viable legal challenges in an area where judicial review is notoriously weak; raise troubling policy questions that, in other contexts, have prompted subregulatory self-constraint; and arm the public with information necessary to exert pressure through other means.

Second, this Article argues that understanding how the immigration subpoena power is implemented has doctrinal and normative implications that transcend the immigration field. As the first scholarship to date that examines a large set of primary administrative subpoena records--agency-level subpoenas and data offers new insights that apply to administrative subpoena use and investigations more broadly. Specifically, it argues that this ground-level view of agency practice suggests the need to rethink the presumption of administrative regularity and the application of internal administrative law principles in at least some similar contexts. These insights are especially important in considering enforcement regimes that, like ICE's, impose extraordinarily harsh penalties and bear most heavily on historically marginalized populations who often lack resources and political power. Ultimately, this Article makes the case for greater external constraints and more probing judicial review in the immigration subpoena regime and beyond.

The Article proceeds in four parts. Part I explores why the immigration subpoena power was created and what that power looks like today. It traces the history of the immigration subpoena from its origins as a mechanism for racial exclusion to the broad, uncanalized power of compulsory information-sharing and surveillance it has become. And it shows why, despite the general acceptance of administrative subpoenas in other regimes, the immigration subpoena power raises distinct and urgent questions--ones that demand a closer look at how it functions in practice. Part II illuminates the current immigration subpoena regime. It uses new agency data and records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act to show how ICE uses this authority in the nation's interior. Ultimately, it provides a first-of-its-kind view of how this tool is used in practice and of the unlawful conduct that permeates the immigration subpoena regime. Part III explores the constitutional and doctrinal implications. It argues that the findings in this Article raise a number of serious constitutional questions, help resolve some of those questions, and justify important doctrinal and procedural changes. Part IV argues that these findings offer valuable lessons about administrative subpoena doctrine and practice that transcend the immigration regime.

Pre-2019. In general, field office self-reports were consistent with the available data. As long as the data did not deviate by more than three subpoenas from the field office's self-report, I accepted (and used) the field office's self-report as a statement of its general policy and practice. In one instance, however, the data diverged by more than three subpoenas from the office's self-report; in that case, I relied on the practice reflected by the data.

The records produced did not contain a self-report from all field offices regarding the issuance of subpoenas to state and local law enforcement. When the record did not provide the field office's self-report, I concluded that a field office did “likely not” issue subpoenas pre-2019 if ICE produced records from that field office from that time period and there was no evidence that they issued subpoenas to state or local law enforcement during that time (and in consideration of ICE's statements that ICE had historically not issued subpoenas to state and local law enforcement). In some instances, the field office did not produce any data or self-reports for the pre-2019 period; in those instances, I coded the practice as “unknown.”

2019 to Present. For purposes of this table, I concluded that field offices did issue subpoenas if they issued two or more subpoenas to state or local law enforcement during this period. I concluded that field offices did “likely not” issue this type of subpoenas from 2019 on if (1) I had relatively comprehensive-appearing logs reflecting the field office's subpoena use for that period and there was no evidence that it issued such subpoenas in that period or (2) other information (such as the government's representations in litigation) indicated that the field office did not issue subpoenas in that period. In some instances, the field office did not produce any data or produced only obviously incomplete data for the post-2019 period; in those instances, I coded the practice as “unknown.”",https://racism.org/images/Portraits/lindseynash.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:39.532990

Bobby Nuñez, 33, was charged with theft of government property and faced up to ten years in prison before a jury found him not guilty on Friday.

In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's office said, ""The trial lasted four days. The jury deliberated for more than three hours. We have no further comment.""

ORIGINAL REPORT: Federal agents arrest man accused of illegally towing government vehicle during immigration raid

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) released a video in September showing a rogue tow truck driver snatching an immigration agent's government SUV in the middle of a raid in downtown L.A. in August.

The raid targeted a popular influencer, Tatiana Martinez, who was reportedly livestreaming the immigration enforcement activity to thousands on TikTok. The same video shows her being pulled from her car and arrested.

Federal immigration agents were sent scrambling when the tow truck operator took off with one of their vehicles as they were making the arrest.

Acting U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles Bilal ""Bill"" Essayli posted the video of the arrest to X, writing, ""Apparently he thought it would be funny to interfere with our immigration enforcement operations. Now he can laugh behind bars while he faces justice.""

According to a news release from Essayli's office, law enforcement officers used two vehicles to block Martinez's vehicle and prevent her from escaping. The government vehicles reportedly had their emergency lights on.

During Martinez's arrest, Nuñez reportedly pressed the passenger side door of her vehicle on an officer, who then threatened Martinez with arrest. After he was told what was happening, Essayli's office said the man told them, ""Something was going to happen.""

While officers addressed a second man accused of intervening with the arrest, Nuñez allegedly got into his tow truck and towed one of the government vehicles away.

Among the tens of thousands arrested in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown are many convicted of violent crimes, but nearly three-quarters of those held by ICE have no criminal record. That's according to TRAC Reports, a nonpartisan data gathering platform.

Amna Nawaz spoke recently with the family of a young — one young woman who has been detained by federal immigration officers in North Carolina.

Amna Nawaz:

Last month, 23-year-old Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio was arrested by Border Patrol at her worksite in Raleigh, North Carolina. This is the video showing that moment shot by a family friend.

Despite having a legal work permit and no criminal record, she remains in ICE custody in Lumpkin, Georgia, today. After both of her parents died, Fatima left Honduras at the age of 14, entering the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor and seeking asylum. Her family is choosing not to do interviews due to fears over their own immigration status.

But they have asked Gene Smith, her aunt's boyfriend, to speak on their behalf. He joins us now.

Gene, welcome to the ""NewsHour."" Thanks for joining us.

Gene Smith, Family Friend of Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio: It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me.

Amna Nawaz:

So it's been over a month now that Fatima has been held. When is the last time you or anyone in the family was able to talk with her? And what can you tell us about how she's doing?

Gene Smith:

I was able to speak to her over the weekend. And she was in good spirits. I know she's been in contact today with her boyfriend and other family members. And she's just — she's worried. She's locked up. She's confined and she wants to come home. She doesn't really know her legal future and what's going to happen tomorrow.

So she's really concerned. And, for the most part, she's worried about her family. She wants them to be happy and to know that she's — she knows that they're on her side and they're praying for her. And she's just supporting them, which is ironic since she's the one that needs our support.

Amna Nawaz:

Let me ask you about the day that she was arrested back in November, because we have seen federal agents showing up at a number of worksites across the country in different places.

On the day that she went to work, was there any reason to think that the same thing would happen to Fatima?

Gene Smith:

No. Not on my side, no.

But, that morning, her aunt, which is my girlfriend, she owns a business. And she said, ""Gene,"" she said, ""some of my employees can't make it or can't work today.""

I said: ""Why not?""

They — she said they're — they have a fear of getting arrested by ICE. And nonchalantly just blew it off, said, if — ""You can't let anyone dictate how you run your business.""

And then, a few hours later, five, six hours, she gets a call that says Fatima's locked up. Now it just hits me broad right in the face. So I feel really, really ashamed and apologetic. And what she said to her family that day, she said, crying, she was locked up — not that day, but when they finally was able to talk to her, she told them, she said: ""I'm glad it was me, not you.""

Amna Nawaz:

Knowing her as you do, why do you think she said that?

Gene Smith:

Because she's a good kid and she loves her family. And if anyone could wear the brunt of this administration's messed-up policies, I think she would be willing to take that bullet for her family.

Amna Nawaz:

Tell us a little bit more about her, so we know who we're talking about here. As I mentioned, she came here when she was just 14. She'd lost both of her parents.

Gene Smith:

Yes.

Amna Nawaz:

Why did she come to the U.S.? And tell us about the life that she's built in the years she's been here.

Gene Smith:

Well, as you know, she lost her mom when she was around 12. I think her mom died of cancer. Her dad was murdered by gang members around the age of 14.

She sought asylum here in the United States to the only country that she felt secure in, and to her family, which resides in North Carolina. And since she's been here — she came as an unaccompanied minor, as you said. She's created a life for herself. She did exactly what the government asked her to do. She graduated from high school.

She got a valid work permit, Social Security card. She pays taxes. She had gainful employment. And she just bought a home with her boyfriend a few months ago. That is a heck of a feat at age 23. And so she's just a good kid. She loves her family, her nieces and nephews, her cousins. And she just enjoys life.

She's a blessing to be around. And I think, if anyone deserves a pass, it's this young lady.

Amna Nawaz:

And I just want to be clear on this point, Gene. Our understanding is that she doesn't have any criminal record. She does have a couple of traffic violations, which would be civil infractions, in the years. Is that correct?

And, if so, what is your understanding of why she was arrested and why she's still being held?

Gene Smith:

That is correct. She has no criminal history whatsoever, other than minor traffic violations. ICE came to North Carolina under a sweep, starting Charlotte, and the next day they were in Wake County.

She got arrested in Cary. They interviewed her that day. I think the video shows that she has a valid work permit. That day, she grabbed the wrong one, but she does have a valid one. And they ruled that, because her paperwork was not correct right then, they're going to detain her.

Since then, we have tried to get her released on bond. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has ruled that detainees can't get a bond right now.

Amna Nawaz:

Gene, I have to ask you, because I know from your previous conversations with my colleague that you have supported, and I think — I understand you still support President Donald Trump, that you did vote for him.

This is someone who campaigned on mass deportations, who said anyone who is here illegally will be removed and deported. And though she is seeking asylum, Fatima did enter the country illegally. So I guess the question is, did you not expect that someone like her would be targeted by this administration?

Gene Smith:

I can't fathom that his policies were targeted at someone such as her.

And, unfortunately for me and probably for a lot of Americans, we really don't realize the extent of what the immigration and how that system is broken. And I didn't. I certainly didn't. Now that it's hitting close to home, I see how broken that system is.

I did vote for Trump. And I still support Trump. I understand you need — we have a safe border, sure.

And I will reach out to Trump right now. President Trump, if you listen to this and then you see this, please release her. She is a good kid. I still support you. And I support your policies. I think our immigration system is flawed and it's broken. And we need to fix that, because the only one that's penalizing is young ladies such as her that deserve to be home with their family.

Amna Nawaz:

Gene, I just have to ask, in saying you support his policies, the administration will say, this is their policy. It is to arrest and deport anyone who is here without legal status.

What would you say to that?

Gene Smith:

I believe our law says that she's not to be detained while her — she is waiting adjudication of her case. She came as a minor. She hasn't committed a crime. She did everything the U.S. government asked of her.

And I don't think that Trump meant for that to take place, for her to be deported. I do support his policies. I just don't support this one.

Amna Nawaz:

Let me just put to you what the Department of Homeland Security shared with us when we asked them about her case.

They said in part that she admitted to officers that she was in the country illegally. They say: ""All of her claims will be heard by a judge. She will receive full due process."" They also blame the Biden administration for using discretion to, they say, indefinitely delay many illegal aliens,"" including her case.

They also say, Gene, that she has a choice to either leave voluntarily or be arrested and deported. Are you worried that she may end up deported back to Honduras?

Gene Smith:

I have faith in God, and I believe that God is in control. She's not a flight risk. She's not a danger to society. So I am hopeful that she will be granted her day in court and be released on bond, and so that she can remain with her family in the community during the adjudication process, so that she can become a United States citizen.

So I don't think she will be deported. I hope and pray she does not. If she did get deported, that would be a travesty, in my opinion.

Amna Nawaz:

That is Gene Smith speaking on behalf of the family of Fatima Issela Velasquez-Antonio.

Gene, thank you for your time.

The week prior, on 2 September, the committee released 33,000 pages of records, a lot of which was already public, including years-old court filings related to Epstein and Maxwell, as well as what appeared to be bodycam footage from police searches and police interviews.

It also included flight logs from Customs and Border Protection showing travel to and from his private island, and a video of Epstein’s cell block from before his death that included the so-called “missing minute” from earlier videos, contradicting the assertion of attorney general Pam Bondi that it was recorded over.

And on 8 September, the House oversight committee released another tranche of material from Epstein’s estate, including the now-infamous birthday book.

The 238-page scrapbook was given to Epstein as a present on his 50th birthday and featured contributions attributed to high-profile figures including Trump, Bill Clinton and the then UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson (Mandelson was sacked a few days later).

The most explosive section was an apparent birthday note from Trump, contained within a sketch of a naked woman’s torso. The drawing has “Donald” signed below its pelvis, along with an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein.

A cryptic message quotes Trump as saying: “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” wishing that “every day be another wonderful secret” and adding: “Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?”

Trump has denied drawing the figure or writing the note.

Another image showed Epstein standing among palm trees and holding an oversized cheque for $22,500 with a “Trump” signature on it. Partly redacted writing below the image says Epstein showed “early talents with money + women” and had sold a “fully depreciated [redacted] to Donald Trump”.

Going back further, on 12 November the committee released damning emails that suggested Donald Trump knew about Epstein’s conduct, including one in which Epstein said “of course [Trump] knew about the girls” procured for his sex-trafficking ring, and another that said Trump “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

In one of the memos, Epstein alleged to his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell in April 2011 that Trump had had a lengthy engagement in the company of one of the disgraced financier’s sex-trafficked victims.

“I want you to realize that that dog that hasn’t barked is trump.. [victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned,” the message reads.

In her reply, Maxwell said: “I have been thinking about that.”

A second message, sent by Epstein to Trump biographer Michael Wolff in January 2019, indicates that Trump had asked him to resign from Mar-a-Lago, the president’s exclusive members-only club in Florida.

But, Epstein says, he was “never a member ever” and adds “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”.

Later that day, the committee’s Republican majority countered by releasing its own tranche of 23,000 documents, accusing Democrats of “cherrypicking” the memos “to generate clickbait”.

On 3 December, Democrats on the committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein’s private island home, where he is alleged to have trafficked young girls.

The images and videos showed Epstein’s home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appeared to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which the words “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Times reported that Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies. The videos appear to be a walk-through of the property.

The materials were from law enforcement authorities in the US Virgin Islands. They were taken in 2020, the year after Epstein died by suicide in jail.

As well as the new batch of 68 photos released yesterday from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein’s estate (see my recap here), Democrats on the House oversight committee have published tens of thousands of documents over the past year.

In a previous drop from 12 December, the committee released a tranche of what they called “disturbing” photographs – some of which had been seen before – featuring prominent figures including Donald Trump, former British prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former president Bill Clinton, former treasury secretary Larry Summers, film director Woody Allen, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Trump’s former political adviser Steve Bannon, and Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin empire.

A reminder that there is no suggestion of wrongdoing and the photos do not implicate any of the individuals pictured in Epstein’s crimes.

Other photos showed construction work on the exterior of Epstein’s island home, and included more photographs of the yellow dentist’s office that was featured in a similar release of images and videos by the committee on 3 December, as well as a bathroom, a “Trumpkin” (a pumpkin decorated as Donald Trump), and Epstein in a bathtub.

Trump features in three of the 19 images initially released in that drop. In one, he is photographed with six women, some in Hawaii dress, and whose faces are blacked out. In the second, he is seen alongside Epstein listening to a woman with blond hair who appears to be sharing a joke. In the third, apparently taken onboard an aircraft, he is sitting alongside another woman with longer blond hair, and whose face is also blacked out.

The president’s face in cartoon form, and the words “I’m huuuuge”, appear in another image on square packets with a sign advertising a “Trump condom” for $4.50. The novelty items were on sale before Trump’s first election win in 2016, and earned a place in the Smithsonian Institution’s political satire collection.

A collection of sex toys, including restraints, a catalog and a guide to the Japanese art of shibari (a form of bondage), appear in three more images. Epstein was accused of hosting sex parties for clients at his homes in New York, Florida and at his private Caribbean island retreat, Little Saint James in the US Virgin Islands.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has joined the chorus of US legislators reminding the justice department of its legal obligations after it said this morning it won’t meet its deadline to release all the Epstein files today.

The Republican representative wrote on X:

My goodness, what is in the Epstein files? Release all the files. It’s literally the law.

As I reported earlier, her colleague Thomas Massie, who co-led the discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the files, also stressed that he wanted all the documents released today.

He shared a picture of the text of the law in a post on X this morning, highlighting the part that says “all” of the files must be released within 30 days.

Wisconsin Republicans have threatened to impeach Judge Hannah Dugan unless she resigns following her conviction on charges of obstructing federal officers who were trying to arrest an undocumented immigrant outside her courtroom

Dugan faces up to five years in prison after a jury on Thursday found her guilty of felony charges. Federal prosecutors alleged that she distracted agents trying to arrest the man and led him out through a private door.

Conviction in the high-profile case represents a boost for Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant deportation agenda.

While the Wisconsin constitution bars convicted felons of holding public office, state law also lays down that a convicted office holder’s seat does not become vacant until they have been sentenced. No sentencing date has been set for Dugan.

However, Wisconsin’s Republican state assembly speaker, Robin Vos, and majority leader, Tyler August, called on her to resign immediately or face impeachment.

“

“Wisconsinites deserve to know their judiciary is impartial and that justice is blind,” they said in a joint statement. “Judge Hannah Dugan is neither, and her privilege of serving the people of Wisconsin has come to an end.”

Trump announces deals with another nine drugmakers to lower prices

A short while ago, Donald Trump announced deals with nine major pharmaceutical companies that will lower the prices of some medicines.

It brings the total number of drugmakers the administration has reached deals with to 14, with Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi all participating in today’s announcement.

“This is the biggest thing ever to happen on drug pricing and on healthcare. This will have a tremendous impact on health care itself,” Trump said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, flanked by the pharmaceutical companies’ chief executives.

“They’re going to pay our country the lowest price paid anywhere in the world, and they will list their most popular drugs on TrumpRX.gov,” he added.

Trump previously announced agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk after he sent letters out in July to all 17 companies, urging them to offer so-called most-favored-nation prices to Medicaid and ensure new medicines launch at prices no higher than those in other wealthy countries. In return, the companies that reached deals secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs Trump might slap on imported pharmaceuticals in the future.

AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron are the last major drugmakers that have yet to announce deals with the administration. Trump said he would be meeting with them in the coming weeks in an effort to get them to sign on to lowering their costs.

A judge in Texas has ordered the unsealing of documents in the divorce case of the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, in a move with potential implications for a forthcoming Senate race.

Paxton’s wife of 38 years, is suing him for divorce on “biblical grounds” and “recent discoveries”, having previously stood by him in a 2023 impeachment trial, which exposed an extramarital affair, and a succession of other legal troubles.

The judge’s order followed an agreement between lawyers for Paxton and a coalition of news outlets to make the records public.

Their disclosure could provide fodder for opposition attacks on Paxton in the campaign leading up to the Republican primary scheduled for 3 March, in which the attorney general is seeking to unseat the sitting GOP senator, John Cornyn.

Groups supporting Cornyn, who has been criticized for a willingness to work with Democrats, have already spent $21m on television campaign adverts aimed at warding off the threat from Paxton, who is seen as a loyal acolyte of Donald Trump.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke about Russia-Ukraine peace efforts and defended the Trump administration’s increasing military pressure on Venezuela during an end-of-year news conference today.

“There’s no peace deal unless Ukraine agrees to it. But there’s also no peace deal unless Russia agrees to it,” Rubio said. ″So our job is not to force anything on anyone. It is to try to figure out if we can nudge both sides to a common place.”

The US proposal has been through numerous versions with Trump going back and forth between offering support and encouragement for Ukraine and then seemingly sympathizing with Putin’s hardline stances by pushing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to territorial concessions. Kyiv has rejected that concession in return for security guarantees intended to protect Ukraine from future Russian incursions.

Rubio has also been a leading proponent of military operations against suspected drug-running vessels from Venezuela that have been targeted by the Pentagon in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since early September.

In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Trump would not rule out a war with Venezuela. Rubio sidestepped a direct question about whether the US wants “regime change in 2026” in the South American country.

“We have a regime that’s illegitimate, that cooperates with Iran, that cooperates with Hezbollah, that cooperates with narco-trafficking and narco-terrorist organizations,” Rubio said, “including not just protecting their shipments and allowing them to operate with impunity, but also allows some of them to control territory.”

Senator Adam Schiff of California has joined a wave of lawmakers today who are demanding that the Trump administration honor the law by releasing the full Epstein files after deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the justice department won’t meet its Friday deadline for full disclosure.

“The Epstein Files Transparency Act is clear: while protecting survivors, ALL of these records are required to be released today. Not just some,” Schiff wrote on X. “The Trump administration can’t move the goalposts. They’re cemented in law.”

Two rightwing influencers have clashed at the annual youth conference of Turning Point USA, the conservative pressure group founded by the late Charlie Kirk.

The fissures within the movement were laid bare on the stage in Phoenix when Ben Shapiro, a prominent podcaster, attacked the former Fox News host, Tucker Carlson, and other figures on the right as grifters and charlatans who mislead their followers with conspiracy theories and false narratives, AP reported.

Shapiro also accused Carlson of “an act of moral imbecility” over his recent podcast interview with the far-right provocateur Nick Fuentes, who has peddled antisemitic views and voiced admiration for Hitler.

Carlson responded with mockery less than an hour later, saying he “laughed” at what he called Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform” him.

“To hear calls for deplatforming and denouncing people at a Charlie Kirk event, I’m like, what?” Carlson said. “This is hilarious.”

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, only the best of the best will be allowed to serve.","WASHINGTON – Today, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) year-end accomplishments, celebrating one of the most consequential periods of action and reform in American history.

Under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Secretary Noem, DHS is restoring the rule of law, delivering the most secure border ever, removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens, creating safer communities, strengthening cyber defense, fixing disaster response, launching initiatives that are reshaping American travel and national security, and making America safe for generations to come.

“In less than a year, President Trump has delivered some of the most historic and consequential achievements in presidential history—and this Administration is just getting started,” Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first. In record-time we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels, and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens. Though 2025 was historic, we won’t rest until the job is done.”

In President Trump’s first year back in office, more than 2.5 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, including an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations.

Since President Trump took office, fentanyl trafficking at the southern border has been cut down by half compared to the same period in 2024. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) alone has seized enough cocaine to kill more than 177 million Americans.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has saved taxpayers more than $13.2 billion at DHS and returned key agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Secret Service back to their core missions.

Countless lives have been saved, communities have been strengthened, and the American people have been put first again. These are only a few examples of DHS’s accomplishments under Secretary Noem that have positioned the U.S. to enter a new era of national strength and a better future for all U.S. citizens.

Below are more examples of DHS’s accomplishments since President Trump took office on January 20th, 2025:

Most Secure Border in American History

In a matter of weeks, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) delivered the most secure border in American history. It has stayed secure ever since. Now, the wins keep piling up:

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

Border crossings are down 93% year-over-year.

Illegal alien apprehensions at the southwest border are down to an average of 245 per day.

From May to November, seven consecutive months, the United States Border Patrol (USBP) released ZERO illegal aliens into the country.

Under the Trump administration, there have been 73,329 total apprehensions along the southwest border, which is 53% less than the monthly average of 155,485 during the Biden administration.

USBP nationwide apprehensions have averaged under 10,000 per month since President Trump took office – a level of sustained deterrence unmatched in modern border history.

Fiscal Year 2026 has seen the lowest start to a fiscal year ever - 60,940 total encounters nationwide in October and November – lower than any prior fiscal year to date.

CBP has seized 539,984 pounds of drugs—a nearly 10% increase compared to the same time frame in 2024.

CBP awarded more than $5 billion in new border wall contracts, funded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in record time. It also awarded a $37 billion acquisition vehicle to support this work to seal the border wall.

CBP led the deployment of more than 130,000 feet of temporary barriers, to include concertina wire, along with the Department of War and the State of Texas, to secure critical gaps.

CBP published 24 critical waivers, allowing the agency to cut through the bureaucratic red tape to expedite border wall construction.

Since January 20, 2025, the Trump Administration has significantly increased CBP hiring, with monthly averages showing a 42.5% increase in CBP officer new hires, and an 84% increase in Border Patrol agent new hires, compared to the same time period last year.

CBP implemented 41 Presidential Actions on trade, addressing illicit drugs, public safety threats, and critical imports.

CBP assessed over $190.7 billion in tariff revenue and $266.7 billion in total customs revenue.

CBP conducted 387 audits from January 20–November 7, 2025, identifying $1.43 billion in trade revenue and collecting $225 million.

CBP ended de minimis duty-free treatment on August 29, closing loopholes exploited for narcotics and contraband.

In August 2025, CBP created the National Targeting Center’s Trade Fraud Targeting Cell to combat trade fraud schemes in support of current presidential actions.

Arresting and Removing the Worst of the Worst Criminal Illegal Aliens

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, DHS has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers, thanks to the brave men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), CBP, and other law enforcement immigration enforcement agencies. Seventy percent of those arrested by ICE are criminal illegal aliens who have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S.

DHS has removed more than 622,000 illegal aliens and 1.9 million illegal aliens have self-deported.

And, nationwide, ICE, CBP, and other immigration law enforcement are targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens for arrest and deportation through targeted enforcement operations in cities throughout the country:

Operation Midway Blitz was launched in Chicago and the Midwest in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by a criminal illegal alien.

Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 illegal aliens.

In the Minneapolis area, DHS has arrested more than 670 as part of “Operation Metro Surge.”

In Florida, Operation Criminal Return, AKA “Operation Dirtbag,” has led to the arrests of more than 220 illegal aliens, including more than 150 sex offenders.

In Massachusetts, Operations Patriot 1.0 and Patriot 2.0 have resulted in over 2,860 arrests.

In New Orleans, Operation Catahoula Crunch has resulted in the arrest of approximately 370 illegal aliens since early December.

In Los Angeles, more than 10,000 illegal aliens have been arrested.

In Portland, Oregon, Operation Black Rose has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,240 illegal aliens to date.

DHS has also empowered state and local law enforcement to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets.

DHS secured more than 1,255 signed agreements with state and local partnerships under Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g).

Operation Tidal Wave, the first-of-its-kind 287(g) enforcement operation coordinated with state and federal law enforcement partners, resulted in 1,100 arrests in six days.

Thanks to the 287(g) program, DHS partnered with the State of Florida on Alligator Alcatraz, the State of Indiana on the Speedway Slammer, the state of Nebraska on Cornhusker Clink, and the State of Louisiana on Louisiana Lockup to expand detention space by the thousands.

DHS also launched the critically acclaimed, groundbreaking new web page, “Worst of the Worst” (wow.dhs.gov), which allows visitors to search through some of the hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens arrested during enforcement operations since the start of the Trump administration.

DHS Smashes Recruitment Records

Launched Defend the Homeland; a historic nationwide campaign aimed at recruiting Americans to join ICE and help President Trump and Secretary Noem remove criminal illegal aliens.

Since the campaign took off, ICE has received more than 220,000 applications.

ICE is on target to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025. Some of these new officers are already on the job.

Since January 20, 2025, the Trump Administration has significantly increased the velocity and volume of CBP hiring, with monthly averages showing a 42.5% increase in CBP officer (CBPO) new hires, and an 84% increase in Border Patrol Agent (BPA) new hires, compared to the same time period last year.

USCIS has begun recruiting new “Homeland Defenders,” who will better support the agency’s mission and bolster efforts to combat fraud and other threats.

Since launching the hiring campaign on September 30, USCIS has received more than 50,000 applications — the highest in agency history. The first Homeland Defenders began reporting for duty in early December 2025.

Since January 20, United States Secret Service received over 91,000 applications to join its ranks.

That is a 46% increase over the same period in 2024.

In Fiscal Year 2025, the Coast Guard surpassed its recruiting goals with 121% of its target for the fiscal year, totaling 5,204 new members – the highest since 1991.

DHS Locates Biden’s Missing Children

Under President Trump, DHS and Department of Health and Human Services have located more than 129,143 unaccompanied children that the Biden Administration lost.

Secretary Noem Reopens Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office

President Trump and Secretary Noem reopened the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office so that Americans harmed by illegal alien crime have a voice in the government and a place to turn to for help. Shockingly, the Biden administration closed this office.

Fixing Our Immigration System so that the American People Come First

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is restoring integrity to our nation’s immigration policies and has instituted dynamic changes to ensure that only individuals who love America, align with our culture, and share our values, are welcomed into the country.

USCIS made history with its fraud investigation, Operation Twin Shield, the agency’s largest enforcement operation to date.

Launched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, USCIS focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, attempted over 2,000 site visits to homes and workplaces, and completed nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with aliens during the operation.

USCIS found evidence of fraud, non-compliance with immigration law, or public safety or national security concerns in more than 500 of cases.

Operation Twin Shield has so far led to the denial of immigration benefits, the issuance of numerous Notices to Appear, and nearly a dozen arrests by ICE.

Within hours of the November 26 attack where an Afghan national murdered one National Guard member and severely wounded another, USCIS slammed the doors shut on asylum processing for aliens from every country, implemented a full-scale reexamination of every Green Card for aliens from every presidentially designated high-risk country, and placed a hold on the processing of immigration applications and petitions for all Afghan nationals and aliens from 19 high-risk countries of concern.

USCIS has also revamped U.S. immigration policy that had been weakened and lobotomized by previous administrations to realign it with American values, issuing policy guidance emphasizing that there is no room in America for aliens who espouse anti-American ideologies or support terrorist organizations.

Since January 20, USCIS has referred more than 14,400 aliens to ICE for public safety, national security, and fraud concerns, including 182 aliens who were confirmed or suspected to be national security risks.

Since January 20, the agency has been actively collaborating with other agencies on immigration enforcement and public safety efforts, resulting in more than 2,400 arrests at USCIS field offices.

Under an updated policy confirming USCIS’ role as an immigration enforcement agency, the agency’s officers are once again empowered to enforce immigration law by issuing Notices to Appear (NTAs).

Since January 20, USCIS officers have issued approximately 196,600 NTAs to place aliens in removal proceedings.

Since January 20, USCIS officers have made over 29,000 fraud referrals to the USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) Directorate.

FDNS has completed investigations on more than 19,300 fraud cases and identified fraud in 65% of them.

The agency has also strengthened policy guidance to ensure there is no legal defense for a false claim of U.S. citizenship.

In a pivotal move to protect American workers, USCIS changed regulation to ensure that aliens will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization when seeking renewal in certain employment authorization categories.

The agency also reduced the maximum validity period for certain employment authorization documents from 5 years to 18 months to ensure more frequent vetting and screening of aliens.

USCIS is advancing the administration’s goal of ending the abuse and exploitation in certain immigration programs.

This includes stopping broad abuse of humanitarian parole authority and terminating the family reunification and the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole programs.

DHS is returning parole to a case-by-case basis as intended by Congress after the Biden Administration abused Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to flood our country with hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals.

Secretary Noem ended TPS for Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, and Venezuela, and issued orders for these foreign nationals to self-deport.

On September 17, USCIS announced a revised version of the citizenship test that expanded the question bank from 100 to 128 questions, increased the number of questions on each test from 10 to 20, raised the passing score from 6 to 12 correct responses, and revised the questions to ensure the test provides a more meaningful assessment of the alien’s knowledge and understanding of U.S. history and government.

USCIS launched enhancements to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) service that allow states to verify citizenship using the last four digits of Social Security numbers and run queries in bulk at no charge. This enhancement has provided federal officers and employees with a critical tool to verify legal status at a moment’s notice.

DHS proposed a rule on November 19 to rescind the 2022 Public Charge final rule and restore USCIS’ discretion when making a determination on whether an alien seeking legal status in the United States would become reliant on government assistance. Our nation will no longer import foreign nationals who will become a drain on the American taxpayer.

Ushering in the Golden Age of Travel

The Transportation Security Administration is ushering in the Golden Age of Travel.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem:

TSA ended the Obama-era “Quiet Skies” program, which was used to spy on Americans, including Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, as well as members of Congress.

TSA launched the “Shoes On” Campaign, allowing travelers to keep their shoes on while passing through security screening at TSA checkpoints.

TSA successfully implemented REAL ID on May 7th and achieved 94% compliance, which continues to steadily increase.

TSA launched two targeted campaigns including the “Serve with Honor, Travel with Ease” campaign and the “Families on the Fly” campaign, and the first-ever TSA PreCheck Buy One, Get One Discounted offer.

TSA initiated historic hospitality training for the TSA workforce to improve customer experience.

TSA kept wait times at an average of 3 minutes for PreCheck and 5-6 minutes in standard, far below operational limits during the 43-day long shutdown.

Secretary Noem awarded $10,000 bonuses to TSA officers and personnel who displayed exemplary service, overcame hardships, and displayed the utmost patriotism during the Democrat shutdown.

Securing the High Seas, Defending Our Maritime Borders, And Saving American Lives

The U.S. Coast Guard is smashing records and being revitalized into one of the world’s most elite fighting forces that can meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Since January 2025, Coast Guard seizures of illegal narcotics are up 200%.

Since January 20th, the U.S. Coast Guard seized nearly 470,000 pounds of cocaine — enough to kill up to 177 million Americans at a 1.2g lethal dose.

Interdictions, deterrence events, and transportation of illegal aliens are up 120%.

In July, during catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country, the Coast Guard’s immediate response helped save countless American lives.

Rescue Swimmer Scott Ruskan and his aircrew coordinated the rescue of 169 people.

In August, the Coast Guard launched Operation Pacific Viper, surging forces to the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations—interdicting drugs and illegal aliens before they reach American shores.

Coast Guard crews seized over 100,000 pounds of illegal narcotics, averaging approximately 1,600 pounds of cocaine interdicted daily.

Operation Pacific Viper yielded the Coast Guard’s largest-ever drug offload in its history.

The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Hamilton offloaded over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs, valued at $473 million, at Port Everglades, which included approximately 61,740 pounds of cocaine and approximately 14,400 pounds of marijuana.

During Operation Pacific Viper, USCGC Stone offloaded approximately 49,010 pounds of illicit narcotics worth more than $362 million at Port Everglades, Florida.

This offload marks the largest amount of cocaine seized by a single cutter in one patrol in Coast Guard history.

On December 2nd, USCGC Munro seized over 20,000 pounds of cocaine in a single interdiction.

This was the Coast Guard’s largest at-sea interdiction since March 2007.

During Operation Pacific Viper, the Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) conducted its 1,000th counter-narcotics interdiction, successfully using airborne use of force to disable a narco-smuggling vessel in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

In October, the Coast Guard launched Operation River Wall to control, secure, and defend approximately 260 miles of the Rio Grande River by deploying response boats and shallow watercraft, command and control assets, and tactical teams to the region.

In August, the Coast Guard commissioned USCGC Storis, the Coast Guard’s first polar icebreaker commissioned in over 25 years.

Restoring Excellence at Secret Service

The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is getting back on track. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, only the best of the best will be allowed to serve.

Since January 20th:

Secret Service has supported approximately 6,524 protective visits both domestically and overseas for 38 full-time protectees.

Secret Service successfully developed and executed the security plan for four National Special Security Events:

The 2025 Inauguration of President Trump, President Trump’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress, the 2025 UN General Assembly (UNGA, 80th Session), and the Army’s 250th Birthday Celebration.

Secret Service provided Presidential protection during multiple major events, including:

Super Bowl LIX (New Orleans, LA), Daytona 500 (Daytona Beach, FL), Charlie Kirk’s Funeral (Glendale, AZ), Ryder Cup (Farmingdale, NY), Washington Commanders Game (Salute to Service) (Landover, MD), and the 126th Army-Navy Game (Baltimore, MD).

The National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) continues to advance their mission of violence prevention. In 2025, the NTAC delivered more than 364 trainings and briefings to more than 56,713 participants – both the highest calendar year totals in NTAC history. NTAC training recipients included law enforcement agencies, schools, mental health providers, faith-based organizations, government agencies, and private sector entities.

Secret Service completed 21 anti-card skimming and electronic benefits transfer fraud outreach operations in various locations around the United States. These outreach operations prevented an estimated $407 million in fraud loss.

Secret Service launched the agency’s new Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit (ATIU). The ATIU provided advanced threat detection and mitigation capabilities for evolving threats and the USSS protective mission nexus.

Ending the Censorship of Americans and Defending our Critical Infrastructure

Under Biden, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was used to censor and target Americans. It was shameful, wrong, and unconstitutional. Now, thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem:

CISA is back on-mission and focused on doing its job: Protecting critical infrastructure from cyber and physical threats.

CISA personnel are deployed across 10 regions in support of all 56 states/territories and are actively working with local, federal, and international partners to identify emerging threats and issue alerts, advisories or provide guidance to mitigate these threats.

CISA has issued three emergency directives to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure strong cyber defenses across the federal government ecosystem.

CISA has co-sealed 37 joint cybersecurity advisories that continually demonstrate operational collaboration in action.

CISA continues to equip cyber defenders with essential tools to secure their systems including the Eviction Strategies Tool, a no-cost resource for incident response, and Thorium, an automated, scalable platform for malware and forensic analysis.

On August 1, CISA and FEMA announced the availability of over $100 million in cybersecurity grant funding to strengthen state, local, and tribal government community cybersecurity.

In September, CISA released CISA Strategic Focus: CVE Quality for a Cyber Secure Future, a roadmap outlining key priorities to enhance the CVE quality and better serve the global cybersecurity community.

CISA launched the new Industry Engagement Platform (IEP) designed to facilitate two-way communication between the agency and companies developing innovative and security technologies.

CISA has issued more than 1,000 pre-ransomware notifications and cataloged 220 known exploited vulnerabilities.

CISA added 38 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) to the national catalog, enabling faster remediation across public and private sectors.

Executed Emergency Directives to address zero-day vulnerabilities in F5 devices and Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) which were exploited by nation-state Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This resulted in thousands of federal devices or public-facing devices being patched and secured.

Published the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Detection Technology Guide to support critical infrastructure operators address increasing drone threats in support of Executive Order 14305 on airspace sovereignty.

Supported 19 pre–World Cup 2026 exercises to ensure operational readiness.

Improved data ingestion tools, saving $6.5 million annually while enhancing speed and scalability.

Deployed automated communication for the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), expanding real-time communications to more than 20,000 state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners.

Fixing Disaster Response to Streamline Resources to Communities in Need, Cutting Off Illegal Aliens

For decades, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was bloated by waste, fraud, and abuse. Now, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, FEMA is being transformed, empowering disaster response that is federally supported, state led, and locally executed:

At Secretary Noem’s direction, FEMA has conducted a critical evaluation of all grant programs and recipients to root out waste, fraud, and abuse and deliver accountability for the American taxpayer.

FEMA returned nearly $3.5 billion to American communities for emergency preparedness.

Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, recipients of FEMA grants are no longer permitted to use federal funds to house illegal aliens at luxury hotels, fund climate change pet projects, or empower radical organizations with unseemly ties that don’t serve the interest of the American people.

In February, Secretary Noem fired four FEMA workers who attempted to send $59 million in funding to the notorious “Roosevelt Hotel” to continue paying for housing illegal aliens.

Following President Trump’s emergency declaration for New Mexico’s June 2025 storms and flooding, FEMA rapidly deployed Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) capabilities to support state and local operations.

FEMA’s search and rescue team seamlessly integrated into state-led efforts, working to locate and assist individuals who were in danger due to flooding and landslides, helping to protect lives and stabilize affected communities.

In response to the flooding in Texas in July, DHS and FEMA delivered one of the fastest, most coordinated federal disaster responses in Texas history – approving a major disaster declaration within hours, deploying FEMA staff and incident support teams within five hours, deploying US&R within 24 hours, and surging Coast Guard water rescue assets to the impacted areas, saving hundreds of lives.

Governor Abbott called FEMA an “exceptional” partner and praised the response as the fastest and most coordinated he has seen, as FEMA rapidly fulfilled all state requests to support life-saving operations and recovery efforts.

In October, following the severe flooding in Alaska, Secretary Noem approved $1 million in expedited FEMA Public Assistance funding to Alaska, providing immediate resources to stabilize dangerous conditions and support critical storm recovery operations.

President Trump and Secretary Noem approved $59 million in expedited FEMA Public Assistance funding to support Missouri’s tornado recovery, focusing on debris removal and demolition of tornado-damaged properties in St. Louis.

This funding accelerated overall recovery efforts – enabling the state of Missouri to lead this effort with technical support from FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

FEMA implemented Rapid Assessment with Public Infrastructure Data (RAPID), an accelerated approach to Public Assistance grant formulation that helps states get the funds they need to rebuild infrastructure at historic speeds.

With RAPID, FEMA uses geospatial data and publicly available information to develop cost estimates for facilities that are damaged beyond repair instead of traditional site inspections. This significantly reduces the burden on applicants and accelerates the availability of grant assistance.

Since national implementation in July, RAPID has been used in 105 infrastructure recovery projects representing more than $374 million in recovery funding.

This streamlined approach cut program processing time from an average of 396 days to 135 days – and, in some cases, achieving unprecedented permanent work obligations in as few as 47 days.

FEMA modernized how the agency interacts with disaster survivors – with improvements to the online application on DisasterAssistance.gov, clearer letters, and short explanation videos that walk people through the process step by step. These improvements included:

A new application status tracker that visually shows and describes where survivors are in the application process. Survivors no longer need to solely rely on the FEMA Helpline to get updates on the status of their application – cutting down on calls to the Helpline.

Guided videos to help inform survivors on what to expect during and after they complete an application for disaster assistance.

In alignment with President Trump’s Executive Order to modernize federal payments, FEMA partnered with the U.S. Treasury to provide new options for survivors to receive their disaster assistance money faster and more securely.

In 2025, FEMA launched the Direct-to-Consumer Flood Insurance Quoting Tool to expand ways that people can access flood insurance quotes.

DHS is just getting started under President Donald Trump and Secretary Noem. The best is yet to come.

U.S. District Judge Nina Wang ordered the bond hearing to occur earlier this week.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, but individual judges can limit attendance or close hearings at their discretion.","Immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra went before a judge Friday for a bond hearing at the detention facility in Aurora where she has been detained for nine months.

Immigration Judge Brea Burgie, citing the complexity of the case, did not immediately make a decision and will release a written order soon.

U.S. District Judge Nina Wang ordered the bond hearing to occur earlier this week.

Vizguerra, a prominent activist originally from Mexico, has been held at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center since March. She has a pending habeas corpus petition in federal court over her arrest and detention, arguing that she was targeted for arrest because of her constitutionally protected political speech against the Trump administration.

Vizguerra rose to national attention during the first Trump administration when she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation. She was arrested this year as the Trump administration undertook aggressive mass deportation efforts that have faced repeated rebukes by federal judges.

In September, her lawyers claimed that her prolonged detention goes against legal norms and precedent and that she should be released on bond while her case progresses.

Wang wrote in her order that the federal government must prove that Vizguerra is a flight risk or danger to the community to justify continued detention. Government lawyer Shana Martin said that Vizguerra’s past criminal conviction demonstrates Vizguerra’s “inability and unwillingness to follow the law” and “lack of respect for authority.” Vizguerra entered the country without authorization in 1997 and was convicted of having a fake Social Security card in 2009, which prompted the deportation efforts against her.

In the 16 years since then, however, Vizguerra has received bond and multiple stays of removal with that conviction, her lawyer Laura Lichter said. The conviction for a “common status-related necessity” of using a false Social Security number to work and obtain housing, Lichter said, does not indicate flight risk or danger, and the government made that same determination multiple times before.

“There is no evidence during any of that time that she was at risk of flight. Or that she was a danger,” Lichter said. “There’s no history of failures to appear, and again, going back to the burden of proof, what the government has said, is they don’t like Ms. Vizguerra. What the government has shown is they have treated her differently than almost any other noncitizen in the United States, in the way they targeted her.”

Lawyers said the government did not bring any new evidence showing why Vizguerra should not receive bond and did not meet the legal burden to keep Vizguerra at the ICE detention facility.

“At the end of the day, all the government had were just kind of playground level insults about who Jeanette was and what she stands for, none of which was actually backed up by solid evidence in the record,” Lichter said after the hearing.

The bond hearing started over two hours late. Journalists and supporters were originally blocked from entering the court by officials with GEO Group, the private company that runs the facility, who said they had a directive from ICE to close the hearing to media. A Colorado Newsline reporter was ordered to leave by a GEO official and threatened with action from the Aurora Police Department for taking a photo of courtroom access rules posted in the lobby. Eventually, press was allowed into court and onto the court livestream.

Immigration court hearings are open to the public, but individual judges can limit attendance or close hearings at their discretion. Burgie at the start of the hearing affirmed that press was welcome.

Vizguerra’s supporters gathered on the sidewalk outside the facility during the proceedings.

“Her record speaks for itself,” Lichter said. “Her support speaks for herself, and we expect to see a positive decision hopefully in the next few days.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lichter-dec-19-1-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 13:57:19.892637

While Dugan was found guilty of obstructing federal agents, she has not yet been sentenced.

The attack on Dugan is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration against democratic rights.
The Trump administration has seized upon virtually any violent incident to intensify its assault on immigrants and democratic rights.","In a split decision on Thursday, a Wisconsin jury convicted Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan of felony obstruction while acquitting her of a related misdemeanor charge. Dugan was arrested by the FBI this past April as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to establish a political dictatorship and subordinate all branches of government to the White House.

Dugan is facing up to five years in prison for the crime of instructing Eduardo Flores Ruiz, a Milwaukee resident at the time, to use a side door to exit her courtroom as a gang of federal agents waited outside. After exiting the courtroom, Flores Ruiz and his attorney proceeded down a public hallway where two federal agents were waiting and arrested him. Prosecutors argued that even though Flores Ruiz did not evade arrest, Judge Dugan intended for him to avoid federal agents by using a stairwell and exit not typically accessible to the public.

Under previous administrations, courts and other so-called “sensitive areas” were generally off limits to ICE kidnapping operations in part because the government sought to ensure immigrants would appear for court hearings without fear of arrest.

The arrest and conviction of Dugan is one of the most consequential actions taken by the Trump administration in its drive to erect a presidential dictatorship. The Trump White House, which directed Dugan’s arrest, has demonstrated its willingness to imprison political opponents, including members of the judiciary, who take any action that impedes the ongoing mass deportation operation.

While Dugan was found guilty of obstructing federal agents, she has not yet been sentenced. Her attorney has already stated that the conviction will be appealed. If the verdict stands, Dugan faces up to five years in prison.

Dugan’s conviction comes nearly 11 months after Trump, in one of his first official acts after returning to office, pardoned more than 1,500 fanatical supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 in an attempted coup. Many of those pardoned had been convicted of obstructing a federal proceeding for conspiring to block Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote.

While Trump’s fascist foot soldiers walk free, Judge Dugan now faces the prospect of imprisonment.

Underscoring the political character of the prosecution, Trump administration officials and Republican politicians responded to the verdict by gloating and issuing threats. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X, “NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW. No one can obstruct law enforcement as they carry out their basic duties. This Department of Justice will not waver as our agents and law enforcement partners continue to make America Safe Again.”

FBI Director Kash Patel echoed the same slogan, posting, “No one is above the law” alongside a Fox News headline about the trial.

On Friday, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August released a joint statement demanding that Dugan immediately resign or face impeachment proceedings.

As Republican officials circle, no prominent Democrats have spoken out in defense of Dugan. At the time of her arrest, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer described the prosecution as an attack “on the separation of powers” and pledged to “fight this with everything we have.” As of this writing, more than 24 hours after the conviction, Schumer has issued no further public statement. Wisconsin Democratic Governor Tony Evers, who previously denounced Dugan’s arrest and Trump’s assault on the judiciary, has also remained silent.

The attack on Dugan is part of a broader campaign by the Trump administration against democratic rights. The Guardian, citing records obtained by Property of the People, reported that the FBI has initiated domestic terrorism investigations into anti-ICE activity in 23 regions across the United States. Some of these investigations were launched under Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” issued on September 25.

The memorandum asserts, without evidence, that “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti Americanism, anti capitalism, and anti Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”

Although the FBI document provides few specifics, an accompanying chart shows that 54 percent of pending investigations related to anti-ICE activity concern “civil unrest,” meaning the FBI is investigating individuals for protesting illegal, violent and brutal immigration kidnapping operations.

Further escalating this campaign, Thursday marked the first deadline in a memo issued earlier this month by Attorney General Pam Bondi ordering all federal domestic law enforcement agencies to submit intelligence files on “Antifa” and “Antifa related” activities to the FBI. The December 4 memo outlines how federal agencies are to implement NSPM-7 against those who oppose capitalism and fascism and express support for socialism.

Defending these actions, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Washington Post that “Left wing organizations have fueled violent riots, organized attacks against law enforcement officers, coordinated illegal doxing campaigns, arranged drop points for weapons and riot materials, and more,” a claim made without evidence.

The Trump administration has seized upon virtually any violent incident to intensify its assault on immigrants and democratic rights. Following the shooting at Brown University and the murder of MIT Professor Nuno Loureiro at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts by Claudio Neves Valente, a former Brown grad student and Portuguese national, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced on Thursday night the suspension of the diversity visa lottery program, even though DHS does not administer the lottery.

The lottery program is run by the State Department. DHS’s role is limited to issuing green cards to individuals already granted legal permanent resident status. By halting the issuance of green cards under this program, DHS is effectively placing legal residents at risk of detention by ICE for failing to carry documentation.

Hundreds of thousands of people have entered the United States through the diversity visa lottery since Valente did in 2017. Suspending the program will do nothing to address gun violence but will instead expose hundreds of thousands of people to immigration raids and detention.

The Democratic Party, which has just voted to provide Trump with a $1 trillion war budget, has demonstrated that it is both incapable and unwilling to defend democratic rights. As Trump launches daily attacks on the Constitution, the judiciary and the working class, Democrats have supplied the votes needed to keep the government and the detention camps operating.

This is a government of the oligarchy waging war on the working class. It is dismantling vital social programs on which millions depend. This week Republicans confirmed there would be no vote to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, ensuring that health insurance costs for millions will rise sharply in the coming year.

The decisive question is one of political leadership and organization. The Democratic Party will not oppose Trump’s drive toward dictatorship because, like him, it represents the financial aristocracy and is committed to the defense of the capitalist state and the wealth of the super-rich.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/73e2362a-89ba-4b0d-93ce-9e93aebba4d6?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-12-20 09:56:56.898108

Federal prosecutors charged Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan with obstruction, a felony, and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, in April. The jury acquitted her on the concealment count, but she still faces up to five years in prison on the obstruction count.

The jury returned the verdicts after deliberating for six hours. Dugan faces up to five years in prison when she’s sentenced, but no date had been set as of late Thursday evening.

The case inflamed tensions over Trump’s immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration was trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.

Dugan and her attorneys left the courtroom, ducked into a side conference room and closed the door without speaking to reporters. Steve Biskupic, her lead attorney, later told reporters that he was disappointed with the ruling and didn’t understand how the jury could have reached a split verdict since the elements of both charges were virtually the same.

U.S. Atty. Brad Schimel denied the case was political and urged people to accept the verdict peacefully. He said courthouse arrests are safer because people are screened for weapons and it isn’t unfair for law enforcement to arrest wanted people in courthouses.

“Some have sought to make this about a larger political battle,” Schimel said. “While this case is serious for all involved, it is ultimately about a single day, a single bad day, in a public courthouse. The defendant is certainly not evil. Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.”

U.S. Deputy Atty. Gen. Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges.

According to court filings that include an FBI affidavit and a federal grand jury indictment, immigration authorities traveled to the Milwaukee County courthouse on April 18 after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.

Dugan learned that agents were in the corridor outside her courtroom waiting for Flores-Ruiz. She left the courtroom to confront them, falsely telling them their administrative warrant for Flores-Ruiz wasn’t sufficient grounds to arrest him and directing them to go to the chief judge’s office.

While the agents were gone, she addressed Flores-Ruiz’s case off the record, told his attorney that he could attend his next hearing via Zoom and led Flores-Ruiz and the attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.

Prosecutors worked during Dugan’s trial to show that she directed agents to the chief judge’s office to create an opening for Flores-Ruiz to escape.

An FBI agent who led the investigation testified that after agents left the corridor, she immediately moved Flores-Ruiz’s case to the top of her docket, told him that he could appear for his next hearing via Zoom and led him out the private door.

Prosecutors also played audio recordings from her courtroom in which she can be heard telling her court reporter that she’d take “the heat” for leading Flores-Ruiz out the back.

Her attorneys countered that she was trying to follow courthouse protocols that called for court employees to report any immigration agents to their supervisors and she didn’t intentionally try to obstruct the arrest team.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a00a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4755x2496+0+535/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2F16%2Fbbec46064c5cbd27266a4a23642d%2F6112550c73d54cc088b52eeb07092766.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 11:58:24.674298

The court ruled that the government’s action violated the law, restoring access to bond hearings for a class of people arrested and detained throughout New England.
Later that month, the court certified a class of individuals arrested by ICE inside the United States and held in New England detention facilities.","BOSTON – A federal court today ruled that the Trump administration is unlawfully denying bond hearings to potentially thousands of people in New England who were arrested and detained by ICE and deprived of the opportunity to challenge their ongoing detention. The court granted a motion for partial summary judgement and declared that it was unlawful for the government to deny bond hearings to class members.

The class action lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, the ACLU of New Hampshire, the ACLU of Maine, the law firm Araujo and Fisher, the law firm Foley Hoag, and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic.

""Everyone in the United States is entitled to due process,” said Daniel McFadden, managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “The government cannot arrest and detain people inside the United States without providing them with strong procedural protections, including a hearing before a judge. But a few months ago, the Trump administration broke the law and reversed the government’s longstanding practice of providing bond hearings to people arrested on civil immigration charges. This reversal deprived countless people of the right to challenge their detention in immigration court. Federal courts around the country have almost universally rejected the Trump administration’s unlawful action. We are grateful that the federal court in Massachusetts has now restored due process rights to thousands of people arrested and detained throughout New England.”

As the lawsuit argued and this ruling affirms, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice abruptly began to misclassify people arrested by ICE inside the United States earlier this year. These people may generally be detained, if at all, under the statutory authority of 8 U.S.C. § 1226, which usually allows for the opportunity to request bond during removal proceedings. However, starting in July, the Trump administration began misclassifying many of these people and placing them in no-bond detention under the provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1225. The court ruled that the government’s action violated the law, restoring access to bond hearings for a class of people arrested and detained throughout New England.

“When the administration began routinely denying bond hearing to members of our class, it upended 30 years of standard practice and signaled a dark new strategy designed to demoralize our clients and close off well-established avenues for legal relief,” said Annelise Araujo, founding principal and owner at Araujo & Fisher LLP. “We’re pleased the court recognized the essential injustice at the heart of this matter. This ruling restores hope for thousands of immigrants.

The original complaint was filed in September on behalf of named plaintiff, Jose Arnulfo Guerrero Orellana, and a class of similarly situated individuals. In October, the court granted a preliminary injunction and ordered a bond hearing for Mr. Guerrero Orellana, who was later released on bond. Later that month, the court certified a class of individuals arrested by ICE inside the United States and held in New England detention facilities. Today’s rulinggrants relief to that class and holds that the Trump administration does not have the statutory authority to detain class members without access to a bond hearing.

This ruling for the New England regional class is consistent with a ruling issued yesterday in Maldonado Bautista v. Santacruz, in which a District Court in California declared that the government's policy of subjecting a nationwide class to no-bond detention violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, and vacated that DHS policy.

The President of the United States poses with a lightsaber flanked by the American flag and eagles. Taylor Swift offers free cookware sets due to a packaging error. Ukraine’s former Foreign Minister calls a United States Senator to gather political information. While no one was fooled into believing President Trump owns a lightsaber, scammers are using AI-generated photos, videos, or voices to trick people into providing confidential or sensitive information. These schemes now target employers seeking to hire for remote jobs.

In January, the FBI warned that North Koreans were posing as candidates for remote jobs to access employers’ confidential information and systems. Nearly every major company has hired or received applications from North Koreans using AI-generated interview answers or deepfake applicants to participate in video interviews. According to the Financial Times, one quarter of all job applicants in the global market will be fake by 2028.

To avoid falling prey to these scams, hiring managers do not need a computer science degree from Stanford.

Disparate Impact: The Law of the Land?

By Peter R. Rich and Carrie H. Grundmann

Disparate impact is a long-standing theory of liability recognized under laws like Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and many state employment laws. First recognized by the United States Supreme Court in 1971 in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., the Supreme Court held that facially neutral employment practices can violate Title VII where they disproportionately exclude protected groups unless the employer can show the practices are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431–36 (1971). Disparate impact claims are assessed by courts under the burden-shifting framework known as the “effects test.""

Executive Actions on Immigration Impacting Employers

By Eric E. Kinder

The last several federal administrations have gone back and forth regarding how to define a joint employer under federal law and specifically under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). For the uninitiated, a joint employer exists where two separately incorporated entities are treated as a single employer with respect to an employee or group of employees. Joint employers are jointly and severally liable for FLSA compliance, including any wages, damages and penalties owed to the employees. Importantly, this can be true even where the two entities are, by outward appearances, separate.

New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania are suing the Trump administration over funding for electric vehicle chargers, as part of a coalition of 17 Democratic attorneys general, and Gov. Josh Shapiro. They are alleging the White House is acting unlawfully by withholding funds approved by Congress.

“Without any notice or explanation, the United States Department of Transportation just quietly refused to approve any new funding under the programs which had already been appropriated by Congress and awarded to the states,” said New Jersey Attorney General Michael Platkin.

“This is consistent with how this administration has treated congressional appropriations. They’re not optional. They’re laws,” said Platkin. And the Constitution says that only under limited circumstances can the president, after money has been appropriated by Congress and passed into law, can he restrict those funds from going to their intended recipients.”

New Jersey is waiting on $16 million from the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program and the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program. Both programs are part of the Biden-era bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Congress passed in 2022.

Platkin said the funds would create new jobs and provide EV drivers greater access to the roads.

“At a time, again, when we’re trying to make energy costs go down,” Platkin said. “We’re trying to make people’s lives easier and more affordable. This makes no sense. It’s illegal, but it also just makes no sense.”

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s actions violate the Constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said in a statement that the funds would support “EV construction projects in Pennsylvania and … new, good paying jobs.”

“I will not let the federal government break their word at the expense of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said.

Pennsylvania was awarded funds to construct three charging stations along I-78 and I-81. The joint project involving Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia was awarded $18.6 million.

The effort was part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to tackle climate change.

This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the effort. “While the Administration is busy finding ways for their Big Oil donors to profit, California will continue to fight for its people, environment, and innovation.”

The Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment.

But President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’s not a fan of electric vehicles. Trump signed a law that ended EV tax credits and recently weakened fuel efficiency standards, saying that Americans prefer gas-powered vehicles.

Bobby Nuñez, 33, was arrested and charged with theft of government property in connection with the mid-August arrest captured on video outside a downtown Los Angeles apartment complex.

The four-day trial concluded Friday afternoon with Nuñez being acquitted of the single charge. The 33-year-old was free on bond before the trial, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.

""We are pleased to confirm that the jury exonerated our client Bobby Nunez. We thank the jurors for their service as an essential backstop against prosecutorial overreach in our constitutional system,"" wrote Nuñez's attorney in a statement to NBC4.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob’s attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn’t rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.

Trump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.

Trump’s attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.

“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.

The lawmakers’ lawyers argue Trump can’t prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And the U.S. Supreme Court has held that office-seeking conduct falls outside the scope of presidential immunity, they contend.

“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs’ attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn’t come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”

At the end of Friday’s hearing, Mehta said the arguments gave him “a lot to think about” and he would rule “as soon as we can.”

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.

The civil claims survived Trump’s sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege. Over 100 police officers were injured while defending the Capitol from rioters.

Halpern said immunity enables the president to act “boldly and fearlessly.”

“Immunity exists to protect the president’s prerogatives,” he said.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers argue that the context and circumstances of the president’s remarks on Jan. 6 — not just the content of his words — are key to establishing whether he is immune from liability.

“You have to look at what happened leading up to January 6th,” Sellers said.",https://www.advocate-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25353653177403.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-20 15:57:44.403114
