IN THE NEWS

A federal appeals court ruled that the federal government is allowed to take command of Illinois National Guard troops but affirmed a ban on sending them on operational assignments. The dispute stems from “Operation Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement push by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that Illinois and Chicago argue exceeds federal authority. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security requested National Guard support after clashes near an ICE facility outside Chicago. The Trump Administration then approved the deployment of about 300 Illinois Guard members and 200 Texas Guard members for 60 days. While the temporary court order is in place, these troops cannot do law enforcement work.

World leaders met in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, to discuss President Donald J. Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted. The plan includes provisions for a ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the Gaza Strip, and deployment of an “International Stabilisation Force.” The plan specifies a timeframe for restarting humanitarian aid, proposes a special economic zone, and outlines a strategy for short-term governance by a “Board of Peace,” headed by President Trump, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, other heads of state, and qualified Palestinian experts. The leaders of Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey joined President Trump and signed a broad memorandum outlining shared commitments for peace in the region.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that lets certain visa holders’ spouses work in the United States. The 2015 rule allows H-4 visa holders, the spouses of H-1B visa holders, to obtain work authorization if their spouse is pursuing permanent residency. Save Jobs USA, an organization representing U.S. technology workers, argued that the rule unlawfully gave work permits to non-citizens who should not be eligible under federal law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected that claim last year, citing to circuit precedent that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows DHS to authorize employment for certain nonimmigrants. By refusing to hear the appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court left the rule in place.

Most major news outlets—including the New York Times, Washington Post, and The Associated Press—reportedly say they will not sign the Pentagon’s new press-access policy ahead of a Tuesday deadline. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended the policy—which requires visible badges and tighter rules such as a ban on encouraging illegal acts—saying reporting access is a “privilege.” The Pentagon Press Association reportedly said that the rules will discourage routine reporting by warning Defence Department staff not to talk to journalists without approval. So far, only One America News has reportedly signed the new policy agreement.

A federal judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated a prior court order by reimposing immigration-related grant conditions on states. The court’s earlier order, issued in September, vacated those conditions, finding that they exceeded the agency’s statutory authority and coerced states into enforcing federal immigration policy. In the new ruling, Judge William E. Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island found that DHS violated that order by requiring states to assist in federal immigration enforcement to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency funding. He ordered DHS to remove all contested conditions and “Compliance with Federal Immigration Law” clauses from grant award documents and to reissue them within seven days.

A federal district court temporarily prohibited the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted the request made by the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Government Employees, finding the unions would likely prove that OMB’s use of reduction-in-force procedures was illegal and beyond statutory authority. Prior to the court’s decision, OMB’s counsel stated that approximately 2,751 layoffs were anticipated across several agencies, with the most planned for the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The U.S. Department of Energy (Energy Department) approved a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to American Electric Power Transmission (AEP) to replace and upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of power lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, aiming to bolster grid reliability amid rising data center and artificial intelligence demand. The Energy Department said it was the first loan under the Energy Dominance Financing program and requires utilities to pass savings to customers. Supporters—including the Energy Department and AEP—reportedly claimed the financing would save customers money, add capacity, and create about 1,100 construction jobs. Critics pointed to the Energy Department’s recent cancellations of $7.6 billion in clean energy grants and a $4.9 billion loan for a wind and solar energy project as favoring fossil fuel upgrades.

A federal judge vacated the U.S. Department of Defense’s (Defense Department) cap on university research “indirect cost” rates. Judge Brian E. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled for the university plaintiffs and declared the Defense Department’s 15 percent “Rate Cap Policy” was contrary to regulation, exceeded statutory authority, and was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The policy directed the Defense Department to limit what portion of research grants universities can apply toward recovering administrative and facility costs. The ruling requires the Defense Department to stop enforcing the cap and to redesign its policy in line with federal rules.

WHAT WE’RE READING THIS WEEK

In a recent report, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the ongoing struggle of the U.S. Patient and Trademark Office (USPTO) to balance speed and rigor and found that USPTO examiners still feel pushed to hit production targets over doing deeper reviews. GAO notes the agency has made changes, such as revising performance plans, but has not assessed whether those changes improve quality. GAO also flags a gap in USPTO’s quality metrics: even though each legal requirement shows 92 to 98 percent compliance, only about 84 percent of patents meet all four requirements at the same time. To close these gaps, GAO urges USPTO to set an overall patent-quality goal and add measures that capture the economic or scientific value of patents.

In a Brookings Institution essay, Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, argued that recent court decisions have grown the courts’ tax-making authority. In Loper Bright v. Raimondo, the U.S. Supreme Court ended court deference to federal agencies’ legal interpretations, making Treasury and Internal Revenue Service regulations easier to challenge, while in Moore v. United States the Court left unresolved whether Congress may tax unrealized income, Patel observed. She also noted upcoming litigation over whether Presidents may invoke emergency powers to impose broad tariffs that function like taxes. Patel contended that these decisions place courts at the center of defining taxing authority and increase uncertainty for agencies, businesses, and households.

In an article in the Yale Journal on Regulation, Lisa Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown Law School, found that Loper Bright v. Raimondo, a landmark Supreme Court ruling on administrative law, may not apply to the Clean Air Act (CAA). Loper Bright ended Chevron deference, which is judicial deference to a federal agency’s statutory interpretation. Heinzerling argued that because the decision targeted a specific section of the Administrative Procedure Act, other statutes which do not rely on that section may not actually be bound by Loper Bright. Heinzerling claimed that because the CAA “kicks out the Administrative Procedure Act in favor of an alternative framework for judicial review,” and excludes the statutory language at issue in Loper Bright, Chevron deference may still apply to the Environmental Protection Agency for the CAA. Heinzerling concluded that in spite of lack of support through statutory language, courts have incorrectly applied Loper Bright to the CAA.

In an essay in The Regulatory Review, Paul C. Light, professor emeritus at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, summarized some of the lessons learned on the federal service during the 2019 government shutdown. Light argued that the shutdown humanized federal employees and contractors, demonstrated the benefits provided by federal agencies, explored the increased risks to the public during funding lapses, and exposed issues with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Light also argued there was a “silver lining” to the shutdown—it offered an opportunity to implement bipartisan and publicly-supported reforms to “strengthen ethics in government, discipline the presidential appointments process, reduce campaign spending, improve fiscal efficiency and accountability, and streamline the bureaucracy.”",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WIR.jpeg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:56.272381

These voices are not partisan. They are principled. Having served on the bench with fidelity to law over politics, these jurists now step forward—not to advocate for any party or agenda but to illuminate the constitutional architecture that protects liberty and equality for all.

Their reflections are rooted in experience, not ideology. Their warnings are grounded in precedent.

At a time when threats to judicial independence are growing more frequent and more brazen, The Fulcrum offers this series as a civic resource and a moral compass. We believe that understanding how our courts function and why their integrity is essential to preserving the democratic experiment our founders envisioned is crucial.

Today, Judge John S. Martin Jr, who served as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 2003, answered several important questions for the Fulcrum.

Judge Martin’s distinguished legal career has spanned more than six decades. Before his judicial appointment, Judge Martin served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1980 to 1983, leading one of the nation’s most prominent prosecutorial offices. Earlier in his career, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Chief Appellate Attorney in the SDNY. He also served as an Assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General from 1967 to 1969. Judge Martin additionally held positions in private practice at several prominent firms, including Debevoise & Plimpton and Schulte Roth & Zabel, and was a founding partner of Martin & Obermaier.

Following his retirement from the bench, Judge Martin remained active in legal practice, serving as an arbitrator and consultant in matters involving commercial contracts, executive compensation, insurance coverage, and construction claims—routinely handling disputes valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Judge Martin is a graduate of Manhattan College (B.A., 1957) and Columbia Law School (LL.B., 1961).

His words are a reminder that the judiciary is not a tool of power; it is a bulwark against its abuse.

Why did the framers enshrine an independent judiciary—and how does that safeguard our democracy today?

The genius of the Constitution lies in the fact that it created three separate coequal branches of the government, each with an independent responsibility. Congress was to pass laws; the president was the chief executive who would execute and enforce those laws, and the judiciary was to provide a forum for citizens and others to litigate disputes arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Most important, it was for the courts to have the final say as to whether either Congress or the president had overstepped their bounds and engaged in conduct that was either contradictory to or unsupported by something in the Constitution and laws of the United States. Thus, an important function of the federal courts is to ensure that neither Congress nor the president exercise power not granted by the Constitution.

Why are retired judges speaking out now—what compels you to break tradition and raise your voice?

The current political atmosphere has given rise to both physical threats to judges and efforts to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

Those who adopted the Constitution recognized the importance of having judges who were truly independent and who would act free from any pressure to do anything other than that which the law required. For that reason, the Constitution provided that federal judges should serve for life and could only be removed by impeachment and also provided that their compensation could not be diminished.

Why is using impeachment to challenge judicial decisions a threat to constitutional balance?

The Constitution prohibits removing a federal judge from office except by impeachment for ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Thus, there is no grounds for an impeachment proceeding based solely on a judge's good-faith decision in a particular case.

Even though a judge cannot be impeached for a particular decision, the commencement of such a proceeding impinges upon the independence of the judiciary for two reasons. 1) it causes the judge to have to spend time and money defending a baseless proceeding, and 2) it inflames public reaction to such a decision and thereby creates a threat that someone will seek to injure the ""offending"" judge either physically or financially.

What do you wish more Americans understood about the role of judges in preserving liberty and equality?

Because of their independence, federal judges have the freedom to decide cases solely on the merits. That gives them the ability to protect the rights of each of us from any type of prohibited discrimination or from an unwarranted criminal or civil litigation.

What moment from your time on the bench best captures the weight—or wonder—of serving justice?

For me, the most difficult and most rewarding part of my work involved sentencing individuals for violation of criminal law. It was difficult because sentencing anyone to a substantial term in prison is an awesome responsibility. Federal law requires use of a sentencing guideline system, which in many cases can result in an unjust sentence if the guideline is literally applied. However, there are cases in which a judge can impose a sentence less than that set by the guidelines if the judge can articulate the existence of some factor that was not adequately considered by the commission that set up the guidelines. I think I did my best work as a judge in several cases where I dramatically reduced the sentences the guidelines established, using this exception. I think, for example, of the case in which I reduced the sentence of the mother of three young children from 3 1/2 years to seven months, and another in which I reduced the sentence of a low-level drug dealer from 19 to 12 years. Feeling that you are doing justice to those who may not have otherwise received it is one of the greatest satisfactions you can have as a judge.

While Claudia is a naturalized citizen with full legal status to be in the United States, in April, she started carrying her passport in her car in case ICE agents confronted her. Claudia works for herself, cleaning houses and individual apartments, and has never been in trouble with the law. Still, because she “looks” Latina, with darker features than some fair-skinned Latinos, she believes ICE agents would target her for questioning and even detainment if their paths should cross.

“They (ICE agents) are racial profiling,” Claudia tells palabra. “I feel this about people who are in office trying to make this country white. Every week, something happens to good people who are just trying to work. At this point, I don’t feel safe even with my passport. They’ve picked up citizens. ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it. They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Asked for a response about the fear experienced by many people who are in the country legally, the ICE press office provided this comment via email:

“In the United States, immigration laws mandate that all non-U.S. citizens carry proof of their authorization to be in the United States. This requirement, rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, emphasizes the importance of having immediate access to documentation that verifies one’s right to be in the U.S. Whether you are a visitor, a student, or a permanent resident, understanding and complying with this law is crucial for navigating daily life in the United States without legal complications. Stating that a fear of law enforcement is the main reason for carrying such documents, which are required by law, is like saying the reason you carry a driver’s license on your person while driving a vehicle is because you are afraid of the police. Bottom line: it's the law. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview earlier this year that ICE agents don’t need probable cause to detain people briefly, explaining that an individual’s appearance is reason enough for immigration officers to detain someone.

“People need to understand, ICE officers and Border Patrol do not need probable cause to walk up to somebody, briefly detain them, and question them,” Homan said on “Fox and Friends.” “They just go through their observations, get articulable facts, based on their location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions.”

There are countless examples on YouTube, on X (formerly Twitter), and on TikTok of ICE agents aggressively questioning – and sometimes handcuffing and detaining – people who are in the country legally.

ICE agents have detained U.S. citizens as well as permanent legal residents.

Some examples:

In early August, ICE agents conducting a raid at a car wash in Anaheim, Calif., about 26 miles southeast of Los Angeles, tackled and detained U.S. citizen Isaac Domínguez. Domínguez told the local NBC affiliate and KCAL News that he was driving to the car wash when he saw ICE agents and pulled over. “That’s when I got upset because I think to myself, they’re just attacking Hispanic people. They tackled me to the floor and put the cuffs on me, hands behind my back.”

A Department of Homeland Security official released a statement accusing Domínguez of tossing an object at a government law enforcement vehicle and of trying to punch ICE agents who approached him, which he denies. After several hours, authorities released him without any charges.

In June, ICE agents in Los Angeles detained U.S. citizen Andrea Vélez. The woman said her mom and sister dropped her off on a downtown street where masked, plainclothes men were “going after” people. One of them grabbed her, and when she tried to tell him she’s a U.S. citizen, he accused her of impeding him. When she asked for his badge number or identification, he responded that she didn’t need to know any of that, she said in an interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Vélez said she told other ICE officers she is a U.S. citizen and showed them her real ID, but they didn’t believe her. A report on the news program Democracy Now! showed video of an ICE agent carrying Vélez, who is 4’11. She spent two days in a detention center and had nothing to drink for 24 hours. In a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors alleged Vélez stepped into an agent’s path and extended an arm in an apparent attempt to prevent an ICE agent from catching a man he was chasing. Authorities released her after 48 hours, and prosecutors dropped the charge against her.

In April, at the request of federal immigration officials, authorities in Florida held Juan Carlos López-Gómez in a local jail in Leon County, which is in the Florida Panhandle region. Local authorities detained him even after his mother presented his birth certificate and Social Security information to a local judge. Florida Highway Patrol officers, who have been deputized by Gov. Ron DeSantis to conduct immigration enforcement, acted on a request by ICE and took the 20-year-old to jail following a routine traffic stop for speeding - he was a passenger in the car and was coming to Florida from Georgia for work. López-Gómez was born in Georgia.

He was released after the case received widespread media coverage.

ICE’s aggressive tactics have even sparked fear among some non-Hispanic, white immigrants who are in the country legally.

For example, Katia, a white South African immigrant who is a naturalized citizen and lives in Fairfax County, Va., says ICE’s approach prompted her in recent months to always carry her U.S. passport inside her bag. (Katia is not her real name; like Claudia, she asked to be identified by a pseudonym because she fears retaliation from ICE). She worries about how an ICE agent would react if they heard her speak and noticed her South African accent.

Katia, who is in her 50s, works in communications for a social justice organization. She came to the U.S. in the early 1990s and became a naturalized citizen in 1994.

She says that the type of tactics ICE is currently using was common in South Africa, which had an apartheid government at the time she emigrated to the U.S. “It was common practice for (South African) authorities to pull people off the street and ship immigrants off to their home countries. I didn’t think I’d ever see that happen in the U.S.”

When she became a U.S. citizen, “Americans were so lovely to me. People I would tell would give me a hug,” she says. “Randos would congratulate me. It seemed they were touched that I would want to become an American citizen. I don’t feel that way anymore.”

The Trump administration’s mass deportation program is not the first time the U.S. government has carried out a campaign to expel immigrants on a mass scale.

In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched “Operation Wetback” to send Mexican immigrants, including some who were American citizens, to their native country. Border Patrol officers carried out the program, which lasted several months. At the time, Border Patrol officers claimed that 1.2 million people of Mexican descent were either arrested or left the U.S. on their own, but some researchers believe that number was exaggerated, and that the true number was in the hundreds of thousands.

The federal government at some point will pay a steep price in court for the overzealous tactics of ICE and the Border Patrol, a civil rights attorney says.

""The U.S. government will face significant financial liability in court for ICE’s aggressive tactics, says Cary J. Hansel, a civil rights attorney in Baltimore. Hansel adds that civil lawsuits on behalf of those unlawfully detained by ICE, alleging ICE is violating the 14th Amendment – which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and provides “equal protection under the law” in addition to prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of due process – will lead to large jury verdicts or settlements.

“There will be a tremendous price to pay for this kind of lazy and unconstitutional conduct. In a democracy that values freedom, people should not have to show their papers to prove they belong. This conduct turns the Constitution on its head.”

We start today's other headlines in Chicago.

A judge says federal immigration officers operating there will be required to wear body cameras. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said today she was a little startled by clashes like these between ICE agents and protesters from earlier this week. Tensions are running high. Federal officials say they have arrested more than 1,000 immigrants there since September, and the Trump administration is trying to send in the National Guard.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker warned President Trump that Illinois, in his words, is not a place you can conquer and lashed out against the federal forces on the ground.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL):

Masked federal agents from ICE and CBP are on the ground terrorizing our communities with tear gas and rubber bullets. And some are wearing camouflage uniforms that could easily be mistaken for the military.

Geoff Bennett:

In response to the judge's order, an attorney for the Justice Department blamed the anger over the unrest in Chicago on — quote — ""one-sided and selectively edited media reports."" He added that it's not possible to get body cameras for ICE agents right away.

President Trump says he will meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss ways to end the war in Ukraine, though he did not say when. Mr. Trump announced the plan on social media following a two-hour call between the two leaders that he described as very productive.

But, first, President Trump will host Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House tomorrow. Zelenskyy is pushing the president to sell Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, which would enable Kyiv to strike deep into Russia. Meantime, Ukraine's energy operator announced nationwide power cuts today after Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike overnight.

On Capitol Hill today, the Senate failed to pass a measure to reopen the government for a 10th time. And in a separate vote, lawmakers also voted down an effort to fund the Defense Department for one year. Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor afterwards.

Sen. John Thune (R-SD):

This is politics. If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.

Geoff Bennett:

The 50-44 vote marked the first attempt to restart partial funding, even as the stalemate continues over reopening the government as a whole. The Senate stands adjourned until next Monday, ensuring that the shutdown will stretch into next week.

President Trump announced a deal today with drugmaker EMD Serono to cut the cost of a common fertility medication related to in vitro fertilization treatments, or IVF.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: The initiatives I have just announced are the boldest and most significant actions ever taken by any president to bring the miracle of life into more American homes.

Geoff Bennett:

The president also announced guidance that would encourage employers to offer fertility coverage separate from their regular medical insurance, much like dental and vision plans. It's unclear whether employers will indeed choose to offer that coverage and whether the deal announced today will result in cheaper IVF treatments.

A number of states are showing progress in the nation's battle against obesity. That's according to an analysis of CDC data by the nonpartisan group Trust for America's Health. Last year, 19 states reported adult obesity rates of 35 percent or higher. That's down from 23 states the year before, and it's the first such decline in more than a decade.

But, nationwide, rates remain high, with roughly four in 10 American adults considered obese.

Nestle is slashing 16,000 jobs as part of its broader cost-cutting efforts. The maker of Nescafe, Kit Kats and other brands said today that the cuts will take place over the next two years as it battles rising costs and President Trump's tariffs.

Meantime, stocks struggled on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average lost around 300 points. The Nasdaq gave back just over 100 points. The S&P 500 also ended in negative territory.

And the final surviving member of the team that conquered Mount Everest has died. Kanchha Sherpa was part of the 1953 expedition that saw Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reach the top of the world's highest peak. Kanchha was born in 1933 in the foothills of Everest and started his mountaineering career when he was just 19.

He joined many Everest climbs over the years, but never reached the summit himself. In his later years, he warned against overcrowding on Everest and urged people to respect the famous mountain. Kanchha Sherpa was 92 years old.

And NPR's Susan Stamberg has died. As an original staff member, Stamberg, along with Linda Wertheimer, Nina Totenberg, and the late Cokie Roberts, was considered one of the founding mothers of NPR. From humble tasks like cutting tape, Stamberg rose quickly to become co-host of ""All Things Considered"" in 1972.

She was known for making connections with listeners, famously sharing her mother-in-law's recipe for cranberry sauce or cranberry relish, as she called it. Stamberg spoke with ""News Hour"" for NPR's 50th anniversary and told us about the opportunities and challenges of those early days.

Susan Stamberg, Journalist:

NPR was a start-up. So there weren't 1,000 people ahead of you in the job you were dying to get. That makes it tough for anybody, men or women, but particularly difficult for a woman.

Cameron Arnold of Dallas and Zachary Evetts of Waxahachie, Texas, were charged on Wednesday with providing support to terrorists for their alleged role in the nonfatal shooting of a police officer at an immigration detention facility. Both were arrested in July with eight others and charged with attempted murder and weapons offences.

None of the defendants has entered a plea in the case, court records show, but Arnold and Evetts are set to do so at an October 22 court hearing.

Arnold’s lawyer, Cody Cofer, said in an email he looks forward to defending his client at trial.

Evetts’s lawyer, Patrick McLain, said his client is innocent and accused prosecutors of adding the terrorism charges for political reasons.

Trump and his Republican allies have accused antifa followers of fomenting political violence following the September assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and amid protests against federal immigration authorities in cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon.

Trump signed an executive order in September calling antifa a “terrorist” organisation, although some national security law experts said the designation was legally questionable because antifa, short for “antifascist”, has no official leadership or organisational structure.

In an indictment filed in Texas federal court on Wednesday, prosecutors allege that Arnold and Evetts were part of an antifa “cell” that carried out a July 4 attack on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Alvarado, Texas.

There had been no mention of antifa in the original charging documents or accompanying announcement by prosecutors.

Prosecutors said the alleged attackers at the Prairieland Detention Facility shot fireworks and vandalised cars before an unnamed co-conspirator allegedly opened fire on officers defending the site, striking a local police officer in the neck.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25289644515043-1760661775.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:43.157573

At least three people were detained in Woodburn and Salem on Oct. 15, according to Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste — Oregon's farm workers union and a Latino organization. Another post from Latinos Unidos Siempre, a Salem nonprofit led by youth, said it confirmed ICE activity in northeast Salem on Oct. 16. One person was detained after ICE waited for them to leave their home around 5 a.m., according to LUS.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request from the Statesman Journal for details about the law enforcement activity or arrests.

Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition said on Facebook that the coalition is seeing an increase in ICE activity across the state.

On Oct. 16, Innovational Law Lab filed a lawsuit on behalf of PCUN and Clear Clinic against ICE, CBP and DHS, challenging what they said is the agencies' practice of denying people in custody access to legal counsel before their transfer out of Oregon.

ICE, CBP and DHS on Oct. 15 ""launched a wave of coordinated assaults on the people of Oregon with arrests that swept through the Willamette Valley. Individuals caught up in these arrests were detained and swiftly transferred out of state,"" the complaint said.

The complaint stated that lawyers trying to meet clients at the Portland and Eugene field offices were denied access, and that attorneys in Portland observed federal officers loading people into vans with Washington state plates before driving away.

CLEAR Clinic immigration attorneys have responded, or tried to respond, to the detentions of 20 people over the past four or five months, according to the complaint.

In a court declaration, PCUN President Reyna Lopez said two young men were detained outside their apartment complex on Oct. 15 in Woodburn and a senior was detained on the street the same day.

The agents did not have a warrant and were not specifically looking for them, Lopez said.

Lopez said part of PCUN's team also witnessed agents parked around the block from Washington Elementary school in Woodburn. Lopez said the presence alarmed school officials and community members, worried about parents or children being detained at pick up or drop off.

“Federal agents are targeting schools, workplaces, and homes and spreading fear across Oregon,"" said Innovation Law Lab legal director Jordan Cunnings.

""Oregonians do not support ICE’s unlawful tactics. The Trump administration and its agents must abide by the same rules as everyone else,"" Cunnings said.

Cunnings reiterated that federal agents are blocking attorneys from meeting with detained Oregonians. She said they are asking the courts to ensure that ICE follows the law.

“Masked agents are snatching people from our communities and denying Oregonians their fundamental rights. We are suing today because our members are getting arrested and swept up by masked ICE agents in unmarked vehicles. All of the people detained still have due process rights and should be allowed to exercise them,"" added Lopez.

Innovation Law Lab asked for a temporary restraining order to pause the transfer of anyone arrested without a valid judicial warrant on or after Oct. 15 out of the state for three business days.

Attorneys with Innovation Law Lab are still awaiting a decision from U.S District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut in their motion for a reversal of an Aug. 22 ruling around the detention of a Woodburn farmworker. The 25-year-old, identified only as LJPL in court records, has been detained since Aug. 7 when he and three other farmworkers were arrested on their way to work at a Canby blueberry farm.

""I am concerned about our community,"" said state Rep. Lesly Muñoz, D-Woodburn.

Muñoz said she had not personally witnessed ICE activity but had received credible reports about federal agents in the area.

""Now is the time for Oregon to live up to our collective values — to stand with immigrant and refugee Oregonians and reaffirm that every person in our state deserves safety, dignity, and fairness,"" Muñoz said.

“We responded, and ICE agents detained an individual, and a crowd started to gather,” Cook said.
The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.
The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.
A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery.","Video that appears to show federal immigration agents using their vehicle to ram the truck of an immigrant rights activist has sparked controversy and public outrage in the city of Oxnard, an agricultural town that has been the frequent target of immigration raids.

At the center of the controversy is a claim by federal agents that the activist was the aggressor, ramming into their vehicle.

The incident began shortly before 8 a.m. Thursday when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents notified the Oxnard Police Department that their vehicle had been rammed by a civilian’s vehicle near the intersection of 8th and A streets, according to Sgt. Martin Cook.

“We responded, and ICE agents detained an individual, and a crowd started to gather,” Cook said. “We were there to keep the peace and prevent any type of altercation with ICE or any other federal agency.”

Cook said that federal agencies took control of the investigation. He did not know if the person arrested by agents requested a police report and referred all questions to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees agencies including ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

VC Defensa, an immigrant rights group that has been documenting immigration raids in the region, said on Instagram that one of its volunteers, whom the group identified as Leo Martinez, had been arrested.

The group also released video taken by witnesses that they said showed that federal agents’ allegation against Martinez was false.

“ICE intentionally struck Leo’s truck and blocked his exit while Leo was exercising his right to observe ICE activity,” the group stated in one of its Instagram posts.

The video starts with a Jeep Cherokee with tinted windows tailing a dark gray truck before ramming the passenger door on the driver’s side. The driver of the truck then pulls into a dirt lot, where the group says Martinez was arrested.

“This shameful escalation by ICE is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate those of conscience who are standing up against Trump’s assault on immigrants,” the group said on Instagram. “We will not be deterred, and we will continue to keep our communities safe.”

The incident is the latest controversy involving federal immigration agents that has not only sparked outrage among activists and residents but also raised questions about some of the claims agents made previously.

Two months ago, federal immigration officers stopped Francisco Longoria in San Bernardino. During the encounter, Longoria, who was in his truck with his 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law, said he feared for their safety and drove off after masked officers shattered his car window and an officer fired several rounds at the truck.

Homeland Security officials have said officers were injured during the encounter when Longoria tried to “run them down,” prompting one officer to “discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

Attorneys for Longoria dispute that their client injured the officers or attempted to hit them and have called for an investigation of the shooting.

In June, Arturo Hermosillo was accused of ramming his van against a federal agent’s vehicle when he was instructed by the agents to move his van back to make room for an ambulance for a woman who had been injured during an immigration sweep.

Hermosillo was reversing when he said a federal agent standing near the vehicle pushed in his side view mirror, blocking his view; Hermosillo subsequently bumped into a vehicle behind him. Shortly after, agents pulled him out of the van.

Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told The Times in an email at the time that a person “rammed his vehicle into a law enforcement vehicle” during the June 19 operation

“CBP Agents were also assaulted during the operation and verbally harassed,” she said.

Videos that day did not capture any assaults; they showed residents yelling at agents.

The incident in Oxnard echoes a level of aggression by federal agents seen on the streets of Chicago.

A Chicago-area mayor said ICE agents used excessive force when making arrests at a cemetery. A pastor who was protesting at a detention center was shot in the head with a pepper ball. Troubled by the clashes between agents and the public, one federal judge is considering ordering agents to wear body cameras.

Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from The Times. In a statement to CNN, however, the department said claims that the agency is using “harsher approaches” are “smearing” federal agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

In downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, just outside the Metropolitan Detention Center where people had gathered with signs that say “Free Leo Now!” and “ICE out of L.A.,” members of the crowd listened to Martinez as he thanked them for their support and their work.

“I knew I didn’t do anything f— wrong; that’s why they released me with pending charges,” he told the crowd. “That’s what they do with pretty much a lot of our volunteers cause we didn’t do s— wrong.

“They smashed into me,” he continued as people clapped. “And then they tried to accuse me of assaulting them, what kind of bulls— is that?”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/63062ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5173x2716+0+367/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F06%2F7d0628464c1c8c74d4d6d0eade85%2F1510124-me-dhs-press-conference-lj-5156.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:01:26.079228

Federal agents detained several people at a Swap-O-Rama flea market located near 41st Street and South Ashland Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood.

""If anyone was running, that's who they grabbed,"" Swap-O-Rama vendor Noe Ochoa said. """"I saw one lady just look half-fainted, I guess. Just shocked, like, 'Why me?'""

Alderwoman Julia Ramirez of the 12th Ward says several vendors were among those detained.

The Thursday morning operation happened not far from a clash between federal agents and demonstrators near a BP gas station at West 47th Street and South Western Avenue.

Video showed multiple immigration officers wrestling a man to ground. One person appeared to be detained. The crowd then grew as federal vehicles drove off.

But, according to Bremer, Garay has legal permission to work in the U.S. through 2029, up-to-date paperwork and no criminal record.
He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban. ""
However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.
Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing.","As the weeks tick by, Ihsanullah Garay’s health is deteriorating inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention cell.

The 38-year-old asylum seeker and Afghan national has been battling stage II brain cancer, according to his cousin and lawyer, and was detained last month in eastern Massachusetts by federal agents after a chance encounter revealed he had an expired student visa.

Garay fell ill a couple years ago, following his doctoral studies in New York, and last winter, he moved to Lowell to be closer to his only local family member and his radiation therapy appointments at Boston Medical Center.

But to afford his medical bills and ensure he could attend doctors’ appointments, Garay needed flexible work. He started delivering food for apps like Grubhub and DoorDash.

His lawyer, Hans Bremer, told WBUR that Garay got lost while out on a delivery in Methuen on Sept. 14 and stopped to ask someone he thought was a police officer for directions. Bremer said the man turned out to be an ICE agent.

Garay, whose student visa expired in 2021 according to ICE, was arrested immediately. But, according to Bremer, Garay has legal permission to work in the U.S. through 2029, up-to-date paperwork and no criminal record. He also has applied for political asylum, Bremer said, citing threats from the Taliban.

"" He has an exceptionally strong asylum claim,” Bremer said. “He's doing everything correctly that we have always required for somebody who wants to seek asylum.”

Bremer said he “had every belief” Garay would be released from ICE custody at a bond hearing scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 16, in Chelmsford immigration court. However, Bremer said ICE transferred Garay to a facility in Georgia unexpectedly, and the hearing was canceled.

It “baffles” Bremer that Garay was detained at all, but he said that what’s more striking is that the federal government has kept someone so sick in detention.

Robin Nice, former chair of the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England, said Garay’s case reflects how the Trump administration’s immigration agenda has reshaped detention policies.

In recent months, the federal government has adopted new rules that allow agents to repeatedly relocate detainees and make it harder to get out on bond.

“ Where's the accountability?” Nice said. “Who's to say they can't transfer someone to like five different detention centers and effectively make [posting bond] impossible?”

She argued the government also can simply move detainees into jurisdictions with stricter bond standards.

""It's the government's burden [in Massachusetts] to show that someone is a flight risk or a danger to the community, but in other jurisdictions, that's not the case,” she said.

Boston ICE spokesperson James Covington said Garay will remain detained until his hearing’s outcome but did not answer questions about his medical treatment or transfer. Under ICE’s own policy, the agency has 48 hours to reschedule a canceled bond hearing. As of Thursday afternoon, it was not clear when his next hearing would take place.

When Garay entered ICE custody, he was well enough to stand. But he now uses a wheelchair, according to his lawyer.

“ He is not a flight risk. He's not a danger,” Bremer said.“There's no reason for him to be held.”

Outside the immigration system, Garay’s cousin, Abdul Ahad Storay Niazi, has been left trying to keep track of Garay’s detainment and worrying about how he is being treated.

Storay said his cousin had major brain surgery in 2022 and often suffers from seizures.

A medical document sent to immigration officials and shared with WBUR shows Garay’s doctors say he must return in the coming months to Boston Medical Center for blood tests and scans to treat and monitor his cancer.

Storay said he hasn’t heard from Garay since Saturday, a few days before he was moved down South.

“He said, ‘I have a seizure attack every day, almost every day,’ ” Storay recalled, “ ‘so please help me.’ ”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/garay_afghan_detainee-crop-1000x742.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 01:56:52.444505

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters.
The Steady State assessment is echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses.
A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017.
On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.","The United States is “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule, according to a sobering new intelligence-style assessment by former US intelligence and national security officials, who warn that democratic backsliding is accelerating under the Trump administration – and may soon become entrenched without organized resistance.

The report, titled Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline, was released on Thursday by the Steady State, a network of more than 340 former officers of the CIA, the NSA, the state department and other national security agencies.

To conduct the assessment, the authors applied the same analytic methods used by US intelligence agencies to assess the fragility of democracies abroad but turned them inward for what the group called a “first-of-its-kind” analysis of domestic democratic decline.

“We wrote it because the same tools we once used to assess foreign risks now show unmistakable warning signs at home,” the group said in a statement upon its release.

The authors conclude with “moderate to high confidence” that the US is moving toward what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections and courts continue to function, but are “systematically manipulated” to consolidate executive power and weaken checks and balances. According to the assessment, these trends are increasingly visible in the US, as part of a broader effort by Donald Trump in his second presidential term to “ensure loyalty and ideological conformity” across the federal government.

“The speed with which we have devolved away from a fully functioning democracy is startling to me,” Gail Helt, a former CIA analyst and a member of the Steady State, said on a call with reporters after the assessment was published on Thursday. “In most cases, it takes longer than nine months to get where we are.”

Since returning to the White House, the president has pardoned January 6 rioters who assaulted police, fired independent watchdogs, purged career officials viewed as disloyal, publicly urged his attorney general to prosecute political opponents, deployed troops to US cities, attacked judges who ruled against him, threatened universities and restricted press freedom – all while testing the boundaries of executive power in ways federal courts have repeatedly deemed to be unlawful and unconstitutional.

Just last week, Trump’s justice department indicted Letitia James, the New York attorney general who successfully sued him for fraud, and separately charged the former FBI director James Comey, a longtime political adversary. He has also called for jailing the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, both Democrats who opposed his deployment of federal troops there.

The speed at which the administration was moving made it difficult to complete the assessment, Steven Cash, executive director of the Steady State, told reporters. “We would finish a draft and then five things would happen,” he said, adding that the document was published as a “baseline” that could be updated with new developments.

While the report mirrors the “finished intelligence” model used by the US intelligence community, the assessment was prepared by former analysts who no longer work in government and relied entirely on open-source material such as news reports, public statements and independent watchdog analyses, as opposed to classified intelligence. Its authors also emphasize that they were not driven by politics, but by what they saw as a need for a “cold, analytic look” at how the indicators of democratic backsliding applied to the US.

“These are people who have seen these indicators develop in countries that shifted dramatically away from democracy towards authoritarianism,” Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior intelligence official who spent two decades at the NSA, told reporters on Thursday. “And we’re seeing those things happening in our country today.”

Among the key indicators of democratic decline identified in the report: the expansion of executive power through unilateral decrees and emergency authorities; the politicization of the civil service and federal law enforcement; attempts to erode judicial independence through strategic appointments and “noncompliance” with court rulings or investigations; a weakened and increasingly ineffective Congress; partisan manipulation of electoral systems and administration; and the deliberate undermining of civil society, the press and public trust.

“We judge that the primary driver of the US’s increasing authoritarianism is the increased frequency of executive branch overreach,” the assessment states. It also cites a “worrying” shift in public opinion among Americans, pointing to surveys that show a growing share who think “having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections” is a “very good or fairly good system”.

Political scientists and human rights activists have increasingly drawn comparisons between the US and countries like Hungary or Turkey, where elected leaders retained power by weakening institutional checks while preserving a democratic facade. Helt also drew a comparison to Italy under Benito Mussolini “because of the relationship between organized religion and the state”.

The Steady State assessment is echoed by democracy scholars and other analyses. A September Bright Line Watch survey found that expert and public assessments of US democracy have dropped to their lowest levels since 2017. On a 0–100 scale, the public rated American democracy at just 49; experts rated it 54.

“Absent organized resistance by institutions, civil society and the public, the United States is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad,” the assessment concludes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72fee4f7a0e64df0d8620012c6bef4e69072ab45/512_0_3544_2835/master/3544.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=802095bd6b6320948eb94a2b41b53936",N,,2025-10-16 21:56:36.540016

“Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds,” wrote Kaplan in his 28-page decision.
The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11.
NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Crain’s on whether it will comply with the judge’s ruling.","A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Department of Homeland Security to send the MTA $33.9 million in counterterrorism funds that the Trump administration tried to claw back.

Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York said in his ruling that DHS had overstepped its authority late last month when it attempted to revoke Transit Security Grant Program funds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on the grounds that New York has not aided the Trump administration’s efforts to ramp up immigrant deportations.

“Congress did not authorize the DHS Secretary to fix immigration-related terms or conditions on the disbursement of TSGP funds,” wrote Kaplan in his 28-page decision. “To the contrary, Congress prohibited DHS from imposing such terms by requiring the selection of grant recipients to be ‘based solely on risk.’”

New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked Kaplan to require the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, to reinstate the grant dollars. In court papers, the Acting Deputy Administrator for Resilience at the FEMA, David Arnold, argued that the MTA had the grants pulled “because the applicant is based in New York City, a designated Sanctuary Jurisdiction city.”

But Kaplan flatly rejected that argument as “making very little sense” because the MTA’s board is appointed by the governor. “The MTA is not an instrumentality of New York City,” he wrote.

The judge’s ruling also notes that FEMA has not withheld funding from other TSGP applicants that are located in sanctuary cities, including New Jersey Transit in Newark and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority in Philadelphia. During a Thursday news conference on the ruling Gov. Kathy Hochul said the federal government's attempt to revoke the funds is purely political.

""These are punitive measures to stick it to Democratic states,"" said Hochul. ""It's a damn shame that our efforts have to be spent on playing defense instead of offense to protect our people.""

Federal officials created the TSGP in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks in Lower Manhattan and have traditionally awarded it based on the risk of terrorism agencies face.

The MTA has received the grant funds every year since 9/11. This year, $13 million of the $33.9 million the MTA expected to receive would pay for New York Police Department units to detect explosive and chemical weapons, active shooter training and counterterrorism patrols in the subway, among other things. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the funds have helped foil eight terrorism attacks in the subway since 9/11.

Trump has pointed to immigration-related protests in Chicago and other cities to justify his attempts to use the guard. But the 7th Circuit judges rejected that rationale.

A protest does not transform into a “rebellion” just because protesters are well-organized, advocate to overhaul the structure of government or use civil disobedience, Judges Ilana Rovner, David Hamilton and Amy St. Eve wrote. Nor do isolated incidents of criminality or violence convert a protest into a rebellion or generalized lawlessness, they added.

“We emphasize that the critical analysis of a ‘rebellion’ centers on the nature of the resistance to governmental authority,” the court wrote, adding that there must at least be deliberate, organized violence in opposition to government authority. “Political opposition is not rebellion.”

They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.
First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.
“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases.
Labour has proposed replacing the current tribunals with a new system of “professional adjudicators” to limit the number of appeals and speed up decisions.","Sir Keir Starmer is facing a legal challenge by the House of Lords to end the secrecy over judges’ rulings on migrant deportation appeals.

Senior peers have tabled a proposed new law that would require first-tier immigration tribunals to publish their judgments on whether foreign criminals and rejected asylum seekers should be allowed to remain in Britain.

They say the public scrutiny of the decisions would “hold judges to account” and ensure they were “doing their job properly” after controversies over rulings where courts have prioritised the human rights of migrants including foreign criminals over public safety.

The Telegraph has revealed multiple cases, including a first-tier tribunal that backed an Albanian criminal’s right to stay in the UK partly because of his 10-year-old son’s distaste for eating foreign chicken nuggets. This became public only because it was overturned by an upper tribunal, which published its verdict.

‘No coherent basis for not publishing decisions’

The move comes as Labour, Reform and the Conservatives have pledged to overhaul the asylum appeals system and either quit or reform the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has been repeatedly cited by migrants in their appeals against removal from the UK.

The amendments to change the law have been put forward by Lord Murray, a former home office minister, and are backed by the Tory party as well as the Liberal Democrats. They would require all judgments of first-tier tribunals to be published on a government website within three days of being made, as is the case with upper tribunals.

Supporters of the plan believe it could be backed by the House of Lords when it is put to a vote at the end of this month, despite opposition from the Government, which is seeking to maintain the status quo.

“There is absolutely no coherent basis for not publishing these decisions, and this is made all the worse because there is very significant public interest in this decision-making,” said Lord Murray.

Other similar courts dealing with tax, property, land and employment cases all routinely publish their decisions even though most deal with fewer cases. First-tier immigration tribunals have dealt with between 38,000 and 41,000 appeals in each of the past three years, said Lord Murray.

“Not only would it be open to a journalist or researcher to analyse the methods by which decisions are taken by the judges of the first-tier tribunal; they could analyse it by reference to the individual judge,” he said.

“Allegations of bias may be rebutted, or indeed it may be found that particular judges are refusing all cases. It does not favour one side of the argument or the other; it is simply fair and appropriate that these judgments be published.”

Other backers include Lord Faulks, a former justice minister and chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, and Lord Sandhurst, a Tory whip and former chair of the General Council of the Bar, and Lord Alton, the veteran Liberal Democrat peer.

Lord Sandhurst said: “The Human Rights Act has become a tool which forces our courts not simply to interpret UK law through the changing lens of the so-called living instrument of Strasbourg, but to change the meaning of some laws entirely.

“It is a matter of very real concern. This sort of lawfare puts our national security and sovereignty at risk. As long as these courts and tribunals exist, transparency in respect of their judgments is absolutely necessary.”

Responding to the calls for transparency for Labour, Lord Katz said the judiciary was responsible for deciding whether to publish individual judgments and the Government did not consider it necessary to legislate to change the current situation.

He said members of the public and media could still apply to the first-tier tribunal for a decision, which would be decided by the president of the immigration and asylum chamber. However, Lord Sandhurst noted that the public would be unable to make such a request if they did not know the name of the case.

The goal of the fee is to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” according to a statement from the department’s public affairs office. The fee would also improve oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

“Through the implementation of this new fee, President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are guaranteeing that foreign nationals, who wish to stay here, have skin in the game and do not exploit the system,” McLaughlin continued. “This immigration parole fee notice is another tool to stop the degradation of our immigration system and restore law and order to our country.”

Fees will be collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Fees are triggered once the grant is approved, not once a parole request is filed, the statement read.

The change comes as Trump has sent the National Guard to parts of the country to handle crime in some cities or help protect ICE officers while they conduct their own operations.

On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to approve an emergency declaration in response to the Trump administration’s immigration raids.

“We have residents afraid to leave their homes, we have constituents contacting my office because their family members never came home and they don’t know if they’ve been taken by ICE or where they’ve been taken,” County Supervisor Janice Hahn said, according to The Associated Press.

Also on Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration for trying to raise the fee for H-1B visa applications to $100,000. The chamber called the proclamation to raise the price “not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful,” according to the lawsuit. Trump signed the proclamation last month with the intention of having companies hire American workers instead of migrant labor.

The suit contends that the government is using AI and other methods to watch the social media posts of virtually every single non-citizen who is in the United States legally and on a valid visa, as well as many people who have obtained permanent resident status. The U.S. government is, according to these allegations, looking for posts that express views that the current government disfavors.

The lawsuit states that the list of forbidden posts include those that criticize the American culture and the U.S. government; that express antisemitic/pro-Palestine support, including support of university protests on the matter; those that rationalize or make light of Charlie Kirk’s murder; or that criticize the Trump administration or its actions.

The EFF also alleges that the government is threatening non-citizens with punishments, which includes revoking their visas to immigration confinement.

The lawsuit points to posts on the State Department’s X account. This includes the currently pinned thread documenting the visas that the department revoked over comments about Charlie Kirk.

While the chamber concedes that U.S. presidents have significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the country, Mr. Trump's Sept. 19 proclamation regarding H-1B visas exceeds his authority and ""blatantly contravenes the fees Congress has set"" for the program, the group said.

According to the lawsuit, ""The Proclamation is not only misguided policy; it is plainly unlawful.""

White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said the administration's actions are ""lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step toward necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The Allies of Knoxville’s Immigrant Neighbors (AKIN) is calling for the release of one of their members who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Alejandro Guizar Lozano was detained by ICE in Putnam County Jail on Wednesday while reporting for a routine appointment near Nashville. AKIN said that Lozano is an “undocumented immigrant” from Mexico. It said he was “following the process and complying with all obligations.”

6 News reached out to ICE who said that Lozano was convicted of driving under the influence and possession of methamphetamine. It said his first arrest was in Knox County in 2011, but he was not convicted of a crime until later, according to criminal records.

6 News obtained a background check through the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which said he was charged with meth possession in January 2024 and convicted in February 2025. The TBI also said he was convicted of driving under the influence in 2022. He was on probation until last week, ICE said.

“He is being held pending proceedings and recalendaring of a notice to appear,” ICE said.

“I have known Alejandro since he was 18,” said De Ann Pendry, a founding member of AKIN. “He came to the U.S. when he was about 12, and did all of his middle and high school here in Knoxville. As a young person, he helped organize young immigrants. Alejandro is such a positive person – always willing to help out – and very focused on social justice. He has a big heart.”

AKIN added that Lozano has medical needs requiring care that they were concerned he would not receive in custody. Around noon, State Representative Gloria Johnson said he had received his medicine.

“Alejandro is not a ‘violent criminal,'” Johnson said. “He is a young man who works to help people in our community access the services they need.”

They filed suit with the backing of a former lawmaker who helped pass the law directing the state’s use of the facility.

The 24-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Red Willow County District Court, argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system, are named in the case.

“Nebraska state law is clear: The governor does not have the unilateral authority to change the purpose of any public building,” said Robert McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the case. “That’s the Legislature’s job.”

Nebraska Appleseed is a nonprofit organization advocating for people in need, including immigrants.

The district court judge assigned to the case dismissed an immediate request for a temporary restraining order on Wednesday.

‘Supreme executive power’

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said Thursday that the governor “greatly appreciates” that “prompt and well-reasoned” decision.

“We expect and believe that the lawsuit is legally and substantively without merit, and we are confident that it will receive the scrutiny it deserves in our court system,” Strimple said. “Beyond that, this office has no further comment at this time on this pending legal matter.”

Pillen and state and federal officials announced plans on Aug. 19 to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp from a state prison offering rehabilitative programming for low-risk felony offenders to a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have sought to rebrand the facility as the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Pillen, at that time, said the facility would remain state-owned and operated and be operational by mid-October. Earlier this week, he said it would instead be operational by November.

“There’s some little details, but everything’s been moving in great progress,” Pillen said Tuesday, according to reporting by KETV. “We’re really excited about it.”

Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

Spokespeople for the Nebraska Governor’s Office, Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate comment on the lawsuit Thursday.

Following the money

The lead plaintiff, DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.

The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and since then, the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.

As of last year, the facility had a state budget of at least $9.5 million and about 85 staff, according to September 2024 state budget documents.

Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Corrections Department has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.

The Corrections Department contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month, with at least $187,500 already spent, according to the lawsuit.

To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”

Lawyers on behalf of Schimek and the McCook residents sent a demand letter Tuesday to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, asking that the “unlawful” actions stop. The plaintiffs had threatened to sue by Wednesday if those demands were ignored or rejected.

“Without an injunction, the plaintiffs will suffer substantial, irreparable harm, which is a hardship that outweighs any hardship the defendants may face,” the lawsuit states.

While many public records requests seeking information about the state-federal plan have been denied, documents released to a government watchdog group indicated that negotiations between Nebraska and federal officials started in March or sooner, while the Legislature was still in session.

McCook residents speak out

In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.

“I am concerned about the community that I live in becoming a more toxic environment as a result of the WEC being repurposed to become an immigration detention center,” Catherine McDowell of McCook said in her affidavit.

Dale Dueland, a 49-year resident of Red Willow County, said he is an active volunteer for community and civic organizations in McCook. He said his focus has been on building McCook into a “thriving rural community.” He wrote that he worried about “irreversible damage to the economic development and community growth that I have spent my whole life working to build.”

“Specifically, I am concerned that the repurposing of the WEC to be an immigration detention center will negatively impact local businesses, home values and create reputational harm to the organizations that I have served,” Dueland continued.

Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”

Many inmates work in the community, and multiple residents said they appreciate those connections. Will Branham, a member of the McCook Arts Council, said inmates have contributed to the growth of McCook’s arts scene. Matt Sehnert said he’s spoken with men at Work Ethic Camp about career prospects and that they appreciate being seen as “valuable human beings.”

“It was clear to me that the men took great pride in working to improve our community,” Sehnert said in his affidavit.

State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, also submitted an affidavit as part of the lawsuit regarding information he had gathered from the executive branch.

The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the state-federal plan and prevent officials from pursuing a similar plan or contract without proper legislative authority.

The second is qualitative: selecting who among the world’s 42.7 million refugees would be chosen for rescue.
Refugees are defined not only as people with well-founded fears of being persecuted, but also as people who have fled their countries.
Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan.","The Trump administration is poised to mount a two-pronged attack on refugee resettlement. The first prong is quantitative: refugee admissions would be slashed from 125,000 in the fiscal year that just ended to 7,500. The second is qualitative: selecting who among the world’s 42.7 million refugees would be chosen for rescue.

The US refugee resettlement program historically rescued persecuted people from all racial and religious backgrounds, but according to documents obtained by the New York Times, the administration may now prioritize resettlement for “refugees who can fully and appropriately assimilate.” What does that mean? Well, the only groups specifically identified are white, Afrikaner South Africans, who have already been prioritized for admission, and now, specifically, Europeans supposedly persecuted because of their “opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.”

In other words, the Trump administration will prioritize the immigration of people who oppose the immigration of other people. And the racial implications of these policy shifts are easily inferred.

Refugees are defined not only as people with well-founded fears of being persecuted, but also as people who have fled their countries. But have they? US officials looking for 7,500 refugees to resettle will be hard pressed to find teeming camps in Namibia overflowing with white South Africans or right-wing xenophobes from Germany huddled for safety in Swiss camps. That’s because there aren’t any.

Such camps do exist, but they hold Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh, Sudanese refugees in Chad, and Afghan refugees in Pakistan. What has stopped many countries of first arrival from forcibly returning refugees to danger has been third-country resettlement programs that relieve some of the pressure on local host states and remind them that the world is watching.

A prime example is what is happening to Afghan refugees in Pakistan. The Washington Post recently reported on Mursal, a 28-year-old Afghan woman who had a protection letter and resettlement offer from the US government. She is one among the many Afghans who the Pakistani authorities have forced back into Afghanistan since President Trump suspended resettlement. Now in hiding, she told the Post: “Everyone knows we worked with the U.S. … We fear what will happen if someone informs the Taliban’s intelligence unit.”

It’s bad enough that the refugee lifeline has been cut, but the insertion of nonrefugees into the few remaining refugee admission places adds deep insult to even deeper injury.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510usp_us_south_africa.jpg?h=a4573c9b&itok=wUPNMy0L,N,,2025-10-16 19:04:24.414009

Typically, many government workers are furloughed when federal funding lapses, while others in vital roles, including law enforcement, must report for duty without pay.
Broadly, the White House has also looked to provide pay for federal law enforcement during the shutdown, potentially including agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
With the military, in particular, lawmakers from both parties had proposed legislation to pay them during the shutdown before Mr. Trump acted on his own.
The decision to pay ICE may prove far more controversial, given the administration’s tactics in seeking to deport people it believes to be in the United States illegally.","The Trump administration plans to pay many immigration enforcement officers during the government shutdown, drawing from funds approved as part of a recent Republican package of tax cuts.

The payments mark the latest in a string of unorthodox budget maneuvers by President Trump, who has stretched the limits of his power to advance his agenda and blunt the impact of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its third week.

Typically, many government workers are furloughed when federal funding lapses, while others in vital roles, including law enforcement, must report for duty without pay. Only after Congress strikes a deal do these employees receive their lost wages.

But Mr. Trump has looked to rearrange the budget to issue paychecks only for certain federal personnel, a set of maneuvers totaling billions of dollars that Congress has not authorized.

Employees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement received an email this week saying that “law enforcement officers are to be paid through the One Big Beautiful Bill (OB3) appropriation for the duration of the furlough period,” according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.

The bill mentioned in the message is Mr. Trump’s signature tax law, which Republicans approved this year. Along with its large tax cuts, the package allocated vast new sums to pay for the president’s mass deportations, including $31 billion for ICE to hire new agents, train them and increase enforcement.

The message, sent by agency leaders, applied to “excepted” employees, who are required to work without pay during a government shutdown.

An official at the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the plans to pay more ICE employees, and congressional aides said they believed that the payments would include a wide range of ICE workers, including investigators and deportation officers.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the payments, or how long they might last in a shutdown with no end in sight.

Broadly, the White House has also looked to provide pay for federal law enforcement during the shutdown, potentially including agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The president similarly ordered the Pentagon to rearrange its budget to pay wages to active-duty troops, and dipped into other funds for the military members of the U.S. Coast Guard.

With the military, in particular, lawmakers from both parties had proposed legislation to pay them during the shutdown before Mr. Trump acted on his own. The decision to pay ICE may prove far more controversial, given the administration’s tactics in seeking to deport people it believes to be in the United States illegally.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/16/multimedia/16dc-shutdown-ice-05-mpct/16dc-shutdown-ice-05-mpct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 18:02:39.062799

Sara Ellis, a US district judge, who had previously required immigration agents to wear badges and banned them from using riot-control techniques such as tear gas without warning, railed on Thursday against the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) continued aggressive tactics, many of which have been caught on camera, and which appear to violate her order.

“I live in Chicago if folks haven’t noticed,” she said on Thursday. “And I’m not blind, right?”

Ellis added: “I’m getting images and seeing images on the news, in the paper, reading reports where I’m having concerns about my order being followed.”

Her new requirement of immigration officers using body cameras comes as Chicago has become the latest focal point of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in recent weeks, with forceful federal enforcement, led by Ice but also including other agencies, and as DHS has been relying on extreme strategies against immigrants and citizens alike, in the Chicago area and elsewhere.

At the same time, locals in Chicago have been organizing to prevent arrests within their communities, while DHS has compared those efforts to “rioting” and said it “is taking reasonable and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers”.

On Tuesday, after federal agents led a car chase and caused a multi-car collision, protesters chanted “Ice go home” and threw objects at the agents, who, seemingly without warning, threw tear gas in the direction of the protesters – and 13 Chicago police officers who were also on the scene.

Elsewhere on Tuesday, a masked agent cursed at protesters, ordering them to back away while pinning a 19-year-old, Warren King, to the sidewalk, while a witness shouted “he’s a citizen,” and it was unclear why King was under arrest, the New York Times reported.

On Sunday, when attorney Samay Gheewala tried to ask agents for a warrant as they detained an immigrant in his neighborhood, he was shoved to the ground so hard his hands bled. Agents later threw tear gas toward the crowd of protesters that had amassed.

Meanwhile, some local schoolchildren ended up obliged to stay indoors for recess after tear gas filled the streets near their playground.

Similar anecdotes have emerged across the country, even as former immigration officials warn that arrests appear to be indiscriminate and sweeping under the pressure that the Trump administration has imposed on officers to deport as many people as possible.

“They don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety,” John Sandweg, a former acting Ice director, told Politico. “They just say, ‘If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.’”

The Trump administration plans to withhold $40 million from California over its refusal to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday.

The move came weeks after an investigation found that an illegal immigrant truck driver, Harjinder Singh, killed three people after making an illegal U-turn on a Florida road in August. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.

Duffy cited failures by California to enforce English proficiency rules following one of President Donald Trump’s executive orders.

DUFFY RESPONDS WITH 'CROCODILE TEARS' COMMENT ON BANNED CALIFORNIA TRUCK DRIVER CASE

""California is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America’s roads,"" Duffy said.

""The Golden State thinks it’s OK to ignore @USDOT English language requirements for truckers. You can play all the games you want, but not at the expense of American lives,"" Duffy wrote on X.

Duffy said the truck driver in the Florida crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status.

Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told Fox News Digital that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.

""It seems the Secretary of Transportation needs a lesson about the laws of his own roads,"" Crofts-Pelayo said. ""The reality is simple: Commercial driver's license holders in California had a fatal accident rate nearly 40% LOWER than the national average. Texas, the only state with more commercial driver's license holders, has a rate nearly 50% higher than California's.""

""The facts don't lie, although for the Trump Administration, they seem optional,"" she added.

Singh, an Indian citizen, is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

Investigators said he failed an English proficiency test but was still issued a license to drive trucks. Duffy and Florida officials have blamed California as well as Washington state for issuing him a commercial driver’s license.

However, California officials said Singh had a valid work permit at the time. Authorities said he entered the United States illegally from Mexico in 2018.

October 16, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced he secured a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented demand that states turn over personal and sensitive information about millions of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients. Despite the Trump Administration’s claim to the contrary, this demand is likely for the purposes of immigration enforcement. Today’s preliminary injunction comes in the lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and a coalition of 22 states filed against the Trump Administration on July 29, alleging that USDA’s demand violates multiple federal laws and the U.S. Constitution and calling the scheme an “Orwellian surveillance campaign.”

“I’m gratified the court continues to find that this outrageous and unprecedented demand for the private and sensitive information of tens of millions of Americans should not be allowed to go ahead,” Attorney General Ellison said. “I’m proud to fight for hungry Americans who just want to feed their families and fight against Donald Trump’s inhumane, mass-surveillance agenda.”

SNAP is a federally funded, state-administered program that provides billions of dollars in food assistance to tens of millions of low-income families across the country. SNAP applicants provide their private information on the understanding, backed by long-standing state and federal laws, that their information will not be used for unrelated purposes. In an attempt to bully states into compliance, USDA has repeatedly threatened to withhold administrative funding for the program if states fail to comply with its unprecedented demand for data — effectively forcing states to choose between protecting their residents’ privacy and providing critical nutrition assistance to those in need. Minnesota receives roughly $1.4 billion a year to administer the program to over 400,000 hungry Minnesotans.

In May 2025, USDA made an unprecedented demand that states turn over massive amounts of personal information on all SNAP applicants and recipients, including social security numbers and home addresses, dating back five years. Even a year’s worth of SNAP recipient data contains sensitive, personal identifying information on tens of millions of individuals — including over 400,000 in Minnesota. The federal government’s stated justifications for its unprecedented data demands, to “prevent fraud and abuse,” are directly contradicted by their own findings. Attorney General Ellison and the coalition sued to block the demand and keep the funds flowing to low-income and hungry Minnesotans.

On September 18, Attorney General Ellison and the coalition won a temporary restraining order that temporarily blocked USDA from withholding the funding. The preliminary injunction that they won, which comes after a court hearing last week, now blocks the Trump administration from withholding the funding for the duration of the coalition’s litigation.

In a release regarding the lawsuit on Thursday, the Chamber called the new fee unlawful since it ""overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.""

""The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.,"" said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber in the release.

A White House representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The steep fee was expected to be a big blow to companies in the technology sector, particularly startups and venture capital-backed companies, which often rely on skilled workers from India and China.

Big Tech companies, including those that donated heavily to the Trump campaign, have been beneficiaries of the program.

Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing.
They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate left for its customary long weekend Thursday afternoon, following a brief three days in session despite the ongoing government shutdown.

The House remained on an extended break from Capitol Hill, where neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed motivated to talk to each other despite mounting repercussions from the funding lapse.

Federal courts, for example, reported just as the shutdown began Oct. 1, they could use “fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday, Oct. 17.

“If the shutdown continues after Judiciary funds are exhausted, the courts will then operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers,” the announcement stated. “Under this scenario, each court and federal defender’s office would determine the staffing resources necessary to support such work.”

A spokesperson for the courts wrote in an email to States Newsroom there were no updates to offer on funding or operations as of Thursday but signaled there could potentially be an announcement Friday.

Trump spending cuts, layoffs

The shutdown has had widespread ramifications across all three branches of government, including the Trump administration’s decision to cut spending approved by Congress and lay off thousands of federal employees, though that was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week.

Federal workers who are categorized as essential will not receive their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. Furloughed employees may never receive the back pay authorized in a 2019 law if the Trump administration reinterprets it, as officials have said they might.

None of the consequences produced any real sense of urgency this week on Capitol Hill, where West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice organized a birthday party for his dog, or at the White House, where President Donald Trump held a ball for donors to his ballroom and focused on foreign policy.

Just as they have for the last several weeks, members of Congress and administration officials continued holding separate press conferences and TV news appearances, lambasting their political opponents, none of which will help move the two sides closer together to reopen government.

Failed vote No. 10

Senators failed for the 10th time to advance the stopgap government spending bill on a 51-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to move forward under the chamber’s legislative filibuster. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.

The Senate was also unable to move past a procedural hurdle on the full-year Defense Department funding bill after a 50-44 vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this summer on a broadly bipartisan 26-3 vote.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that Democrats want some of the other annual appropriations bills added on to create a larger bill, though he didn’t say which of the dozen he prefers.

""It’s always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety,” Schumer said.

He added later that leaders from both political parties “have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way. Once again, they’re just going at it alone.”

Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, appeared to offer a package of bills negotiated between the parties before the vote on the defense bill.

“We want this to be an open process with an opportunity to add additional bipartisan bills that address vital domestic priorities, including biomedical and scientific research and infrastructure,” Collins said. “And we want members to have a voice in the funding decisions that affect all of our states and constituents back home.”

Stopgap bills in 2025

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a floor speech earlier in the day the short-term government funding bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to negotiate final versions of the full-year spending bills.

“We're simply asking them to extend current funding bills for a few weeks while we work on full-year appropriations,” Thune said.

Congress is supposed to work out a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate on those bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but hasn’t finished on time since the 1990s.

So every September, once back from their August recess, the House and Senate write a stopgap spending bill that typically keeps the lights on until mid-December.

Those short-term measures, sometimes called continuing resolutions or CRs, were traditionally negotiated among Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers until earlier this year.

House Republicans, bolstered by a sweep in last year’s elections, decided in March to write a six-month stopgap spending bill on their own, after two bipartisan short-term bills were approved earlier in the fiscal year.

Senate Democrats voiced frustration with the process but ultimately helped Republicans get past a procedural vote that required the support of at least 60 lawmakers, allowing the March stopgap to advance toward a simple majority passage vote.

House Republicans repeated their previously successful maneuver last month, writing a stopgap spending bill on their own that would fund the government through Nov. 21.

Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing.

Health care standoff

Democrats maintain that Republican leaders must negotiate to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.

Republican leaders have said publicly over and over that they will, but cannot guarantee Democrats a final agreement will be able to pass both chambers. They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens.

“Despite the fact we’re only in this position because of Democrats’ poor policy choices, Republicans are ready for that discussion,” Thune said. “But only once we’ve reopened the government.”

Thune also raised concerns over what message it would send for GOP leaders to negotiate during the shutdown, which he said would endorse the use of funding lapses to achieve policy or political goals.

Shutdowns in history

Republicans forced the last two government shutdowns; the first in 2013 over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the second in 2019 over Trump’s insistence lawmakers approve more funding for the border wall. Both were unsuccessful.

Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech Thursday that Republicans drafting the stopgap spending bill on their own is a stark contrast to how things have worked for years and that they can’t expect Democrats to vote for something in which they had no say.

“For the last month, the Republican leader’s favorite number has been 13. He keeps citing 13 CRs that we passed when I was majority leader. Of course we did,” Schumer said.

“What he fails to mention — I'm not sure if he forgets, or he’s deliberately trying to ignore it — is that those 13 CRs were the product of bipartisan negotiation, of serious conversation. We had to make changes in those bills when our Republican colleagues suggested it,” he added. “They were in the minority, but they had the right to be heard, a right that has been completely shut out for Democrats under this new Republican majority.”

Schumer warned Republicans about open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace beginning on Nov. 1, saying tens of millions of Americans will soon realize what congressional inaction means for their family budgets.

He said Republicans’ unwillingness to negotiate before the shutdown began or since shows they “either don’t understand it or they’re brutally callous.”

‘I want to be happy Mike’

House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Thursday morning press conference that Republicans “have no idea” how the government shutdown will end, and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not voting to advance the stopgap bill.

House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew R. Garbarino of New York said the government shutdown is undermining the day-to-day operations of the Department of Homeland Security.

“This shutdown is making our country less safe,” he said.

Garbarino said roughly 90% of federal employees at the Department of Homeland Security are required to continue working because they have essential roles such as vetting customs at ports of entry and monitoring air space at airports.

He said those working without pay include 63,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees; more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration agents; and 8,000 Secret Service agents.

Garbarino added that he was grateful Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was using funds from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to pay the roughly 49,000 Coast Guard personnel.

In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS said it would be able to continue hiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and “deploy law enforcement across the country to make America safe again” due to funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued its aggressive immigration crackdown.

Johnson expressed his frustration that some Homeland Security employees were working without pay.

“We should not have Border Patrol agents not (being) paid right now because Chuck Schumer wants to play political games to cover his tail,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I don’t like being mad Mike, I want to be happy Mike … but I am so upset about this.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-10/shutdownzoo.jpg?h=2d6e2349&itok=3rDZnEqe,N,,2025-10-16 21:56:44.217133

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times.
Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons.
Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.
Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""","CHICAGO – A federal judge in the Northern District of Illinois ordered on Oct. 16 that immigration enforcement agents in the area will have to begin using body-worn cameras, according to local reports.

U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis gave the order in federal court in downtown Chicago following reports that immigration agents had clashes with residents on the city’s Southeast Side that ended with agents deploying tear gas and other chemical weapons. Ellis' decision comes after she issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 limiting how immigration agents used non-lethal weapons on civilians.

""I am profoundly concerned about what has been happening over the last week, since I entered this order,"" Ellis said, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times. ""I live in Chicago, if folks haven't noticed. And I'm not blind. … I tend to get news.""

The decision out of federal court comes amid President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area that the administration says is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Critics say innocent people are targeted and that Homeland Security’s aggressive tactics have upended life for many people in the region.

Ellis’ order was aimed at bringing down the temperature by ensuring the immigration agents warn protesters ahead of deploying chemical weapons. However the scene that played out on the city’s Southeast Side left her with ""serious concerns.""

Photos of the scene taken by the Sun-Times and shared by the office of Gov. JB Pritzker show federal agents in fatigues pointing non-lethal weapons directly into the faces of unarmed young people protesting enforcement actions.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin has shrugged off the optics of the photos.""This is a U.S. citizen who, along with his cousin, was arrested for assaulting and throwing rocks at law enforcement. That is a 40mm launcher that fires beanbags and rubber projectiles,"" McLaughlin said in a post on X. ""But keep making this thug your poster child.""

According to local reports, Ellis ordered a top Homeland Security official to appear in court on Oct. 20 to address the issue.

Homeland Security officials said Ellis' order was ""not constitutional"" and said some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents already used body-worn cameras.

""Body-worn cameras are currently in use in ICE areas of responsibility where the agency has issued cameras and provided appropriate training,"" the statement said. ""In these areas, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy mandates the use of body-worn cameras during pre-planned enforcement actions by ICE law enforcement officers in support of the agency's mission, with limited exceptions for specific investigative operations. Agency-wide expansion of body-worn cameras is dependent on the availability of appropriated funding resources.""

An agency spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether agents in the Chicago area were using body-worn cameras.

What else does the judge’s order make ICE do?

Ellis’ order on Oct. 16 amends an order she made on Oct. 9 in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of clergy, protesters and journalists saying federal agents unreasonably deployed chemical weapons on people outside an immigration enforcement facility in the suburbs.

The immigration enforcement facility has become a hotbed of protests where agents have deployed around $100,000 worth of non-lethal weapons to stop ""rioters"" from hindering immigration enforcement, Trump administration attorney Eric Hamilton said in an Oct. 9 hearing regarding the deployment of National Guard troops to the region.

Clergy, protesters and journalists filing suit said agents fired without provocation. Among moments cited was a high-profile video of a federal agent shooting local pastor Rev. David Black in the head with a pepper ball.

Ellis in court filings said the chemical weapons use likely ""constituted excessive force"" and referred to the attack on Black as an ""unprovoked use of force.""

The original court order compels agents to wear identification, a significant step in the city where many people have chafed against masked men detaining people; and to give two warnings before using chemical weapons.

Ellis’ ruling applies throughout the Chicago area where immigration enforcement agents have used tear gas ""without any warning or apparent justification.""

""The TRO essentially directs agents and officers to follow the training they have already received on crowd control, as well as what the Constitution demands of them,"" Ellis wrote.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers.
The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted.
Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.
To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.","When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.

So ProPublica created its own count.

We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.

Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.

These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.

Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agent pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery. In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)

In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.

The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”

A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.

Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.

We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.

Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.

In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.

When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”

Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”

When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.

Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.

Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”

Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.

Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.

This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.

DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.

Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.

Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.

“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”

George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.

The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.

Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.

Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.

Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.

“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”

Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.

Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”

DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.

The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twice ordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.

But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.

Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.

“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”

Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)

The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.

Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.

DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.

Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.

The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police. And that’s if agents can even be identified. What’s more, the administration has gutted the office that investigates allegations of abuse by agents.

“The often-inadequate guardrails that we have for state and local government — even those guardrails are nonexistent when you’re talking about federal overreach,” said Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA School of Law.

More than 50 members of Congress have also written to the administration, demanding details about Americans who’ve been detained. One is Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. After trying to question Noem about detained citizens, federal agents grabbed Padilla, pulled him to the ground and handcuffed him. The department later defended the agents, saying they “acted appropriately.”

How We Did This

Americans have reported a wide range of troubling encounters with immigration agents. To get a wider sense of agents’ conduct, we cataloged all incidents we could find of citizens being held against their will by immigration officers.

Critically, there is no way to know the complete scope of these stops since the government itself does not track them. But we were still able to fill in the picture a bit more.

We reviewed more than 170 cases overall, which we sorted into two categories.

The first is Americans who were held because agents questioned their citizenship. We found more than 50 such cases. The second category is Americans arrested by immigration agents after being accused of assaulting or impeding officers at protests or during immigration arrests of others. In that category, we tallied about 130 Americans, including more than a dozen elected officials. In many of these cases, the government never charged these individuals or the cases were dismissed.

We also tracked another nine citizens who reported being concerned about racial profiling after being extensively questioned by immigration officials. This includes a Mescalero Apache tribal member who was pulled out of a store and asked for his passport, and a California man who was previously deported by mistake and got another deportation order in the mail.

We did all this by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We compiled cases from the beginning of the current Trump administration through Oct. 5. Our accounting of arrests in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago is particularly limited, since the events there are still unfolding.

We did not review cases of Americans detained in airports or at the border, where even citizens are more likely to encounter increased questioning. We also did not review cases of Americans arrested at some point after alleged encounters with immigration agents since those involved a judicial process. We similarly excluded arrests of immigration protestors by local police who, unlike many of the federal agencies, booked protesters into a local jail where they could access the legal process and their families could find them.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238859233-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 17:03:13.032761

Why Monteiro Matters Before the EFAA, employers routinely compelled arbitration of sexual harassment claims, rendering the allegations and proceedings confidential.
Therefore, Judge Talwani’s decision substantially narrows the circumstances in which employers can rely on pre-EFAA arbitration agreements for sexual harassment disputes.","The US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Monteiro v. RAC Acceptance East, LLC issued an early federal interpretation of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA), which became law in March 2022.

In Monteiro, the court held that the EFAA can render pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers unenforceable in sexual assault and sexual harassment cases even where much of the alleged misconduct occurred before the EFAA became law, so long as the dispute or claim “arises or accrues” on or after that date. Although the statute is not retroactive by its terms, the court’s application gives it practical retroactive effect in many employment cases.

What Is the EFAA?

The EFAA, a response to the #MeToo movement, amended the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class or collective action waivers in disputes related to sexual assault and sexual harassment. By its terms, the statute applies to “any dispute or claim that arises or accrues on or after [March 3, 2022].”[1] In other words, if an employee signed a pre-dispute agreement requiring arbitration or waiving joint or class proceedings, that agreement will be void and unenforceable for sexual assault or sexual harassment claims after March 3, 2022.

Case Background

The plaintiff in Monteiro, a former assistant sales manager at a rent-to-own retailer, alleged that a co-worker subjected her to repeated inappropriate and sexually suggestive remarks, physical contact, and explicit messages over the course of her employment. While many of the alleged incidents occurred prior to March 3, 2022, at least one incident and the plaintiff’s subsequent termination occurred after the EFAA’s enactment.

After reporting the harassment to management and subsequently being terminated, the plaintiff filed suit in state court alleging sexual harassment, sex discrimination, and retaliation. However, because the plaintiff had signed a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims as part of her onboarding process, the defendants removed the case to federal court and moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the pre-dispute arbitration agreement.

Court’s Analysis

Judge Indira Talwani denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding that the EFAA applied to the plaintiff’s claims. The court emphasized that under the EFAA, claims of sexual harassment or sexual assault that accrue on or after March 3, 2022, are not subject to mandatory arbitration, even if some alleged misconduct occurred prior to that date.

Applying the “continuing violation” doctrine, the court determined that the plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim fell under the protections of the EFAA because at least one act contributing to the claim occurred after the statute’s effective date. The court further noted that the retaliation claim, based on the plaintiff’s termination, constituted a discrete act that accrued after March 3, 2022, and was therefore also subject to the EFAA.

The court rejected the defendants’ argument that the “primary allegations” of harassment predated the EFAA, holding that hostile work environment claims may span a series of acts over time, and the statute of limitations resets with each new act of harassment. As a result, the arbitration agreement was deemed invalid and unenforceable at the plaintiff’s election.

Why Monteiro Matters

Before the EFAA, employers routinely compelled arbitration of sexual harassment claims, rendering the allegations and proceedings confidential. Monteiro underscores that the EFAA’s protections turn on when a claim “arises or accrues,” not when the alleged underlying conduct occurred. Therefore, Judge Talwani’s decision substantially narrows the circumstances in which employers can rely on pre-EFAA arbitration agreements for sexual harassment disputes.

Takeaways and Next Steps

Arbitration agreements may be valuable risk-management tools, but employers should take special care to ensure these agreements are enforceable and aligned with the EFAA. Employers should review their arbitration clauses, update acknowledgment forms and dispute resolution policies to reflect the EFAA carve-out, and ensure internal training, reporting, and investigation protocols are robust to mitigate exposure.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:02:38.426440

The group led by lawyers Omer Shatz and Juan Branco filed a 700-page legal brief on Thursday. The Associated Press has obtained a copy of the brief.

Their case is based on six years of investigation, interviews with more than 70 senior European officials, minutes of high-level European Council meetings and other confidential documents. It follows a previous request to the ICC’s prosecutor’s office to investigate European officials for migration policies they argued led to the interception, detention, torture, killing and drowning of tens of thousands of people trying to reach European shores.

That request, filed in 2019 and admitted in 2020 as part of the ICC’s Libya investigation, did not cite any specific suspects by name.

Now, lawyers say they have identified dozens of European individuals, from high-level heads of state to lower-level bureaucrats, as “co-perpetrators” alongside Libyan suspects for the death of 25,000 asylum seekers and abuses against some 150,000 survivors who were “abducted and forcibly transferred to Libya, where they were detained, tortured, raped, and enslaved.”

European leaders, officials called out by name

“We did the work of the office of the prosecutor, we managed to get to the inside of this apparatus of power and deconstruct it to see which offices, which ministries and which individuals (are responsible),” Shatz said. “We feel confident to say that at least 122 are criminally liable.”

ICC’s prosecutor Karim Khan stepped aside earlier this year pending the outcome of a sexual misconduct investigation against him.

Lawyers published an online database with parts of their case and their “suspect list” naming each of the 122 individuals, their roles and why they believe the person to be liable. Among them is NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who was then prime minister of the Netherlands, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, then former president of the European Council, European former foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini and former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri, to cite a few.

Shatz and Branco are not the only ones to have urged the ICC to investigate abuses committed against migrants in Libya and the Mediterranean Sea. In 2023, a U.N.-backed investigation also concluded the EU’s support to Libyan forces contributed to crimes against migrants and called on EU authorities to review their policies with Libya.

“The law of the ICC was born out of European crimes but only applied so far to crimes committed outside of Europe,” Shatz told the Associated Press. “Our request is simple: to apply the law impartially, also upon European nationals.”

EU says cooperation with Libya on migration still a priority

Despite repeated calls from human rights experts for Europe to refrain from supporting Libyan forces in stopping migrants from crossing the Mediterranean, European officials remain determined to continue doing just that.

Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the chaos that followed, the country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. In recent months, there has been an increase in migrant departures from eastern Libya to Greece, which European officials have been trying to address.

The EU says it has been working with Libyan authorities “to protect migrants and refugees” in Libya, “while taking action to reduce irregular departures through border management and anti-smuggling and trafficking in human beings.”

It has repeatedly defended its cooperation with Libya and its migration policy and blames migrant deaths on people smugglers and human traffickers who profit off their misery.

“The situation in Libya is critical,” EU Commission spokesperson Markus Lammert told journalists last week. “We will continue our engagement with all actors involved.”

Rival Libyan officials visit EU border agency

Just yesterday, the EU hosted both eastern and western Libyan officials for a technical visit of the bloc’s border and coast guard agency’s headquarters in Warsaw. The visit was remarkable for bringing both sides of Libya’s rival governments into the same room.

“The atmosphere was open and constructive, and the Libyan side showed real curiosity about how Frontex and the EU work,” Chris Borowski, a spokesperson for Frontex told AP in writing. “It was a good first step toward building mutual understanding.”

Human rights groups, including non-governmental organizations that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean, criticized the visit. In the past few months, Libyan patrols have been caught on camera in several incidents of aggression, including shooting at both rescue ships and migrants themselves.

“With the support of the EU and its member states, the Libyan militias have turned into a brutal border force that acts with aggression and impunity at sea,” said a statement issued this week by Alarm Phone, a network of activists who operate a hotline for migrants in distress.

Questioned last week about the recent incidents at sea and the scheduled Libyan visit to Frontex, Lammert, the EU commission spokesperson, insisted border cooperation with Libya would be “in line with human rights standards.”

There was no immediate reaction to the ICC filing.

Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion.
Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.","On Aug. 27, 2025, Rigoberto Hernandez, an Oregon firefighter, was arrested by Border Patrol agents while actively battling the Bear Gulch fire in Washington's Olympic National Forest. The arrest made national news—and occurred just 12 days before the Supreme Court would issue its Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo decision, dramatically illustrating the stark gap between legal theory and enforcement reality.

According to a habeas corpus petition filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (NWIRP), a nonprofit that provides free legal representation in immigration law, Border Patrol blocked the only exit, holding 40 firefighters under armed guard. Agents were ""whistling at them like they were dogs"" and forcing them into lines. When Hernandez was held for ""nearly three more hours,"" then handcuffed on the ground and held for over four hours at the initial site of his arrest.

Transported 200 miles to a Bellingham Border Patrol station, Hernandez was denied phone calls and attorney contact for over 48 hours, then transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, where he remained until Sept. 23, 2025 — 27 days in custody.

NWIRP attorneyse successfully secured a Temporary Restraining Order that the government chose not to contest, resulting in his release on Sept. 23.

""Hernandez has been living here since he was 4! He has family members who are U.S. citizens and has a pending U.S. visa application,"" Mozhdeh Oskoulan, an attorney with NWIRP, said. ""He was released due to a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) that NWIRP filed and the government did not want to respond, so they released him.""

This detention occurred during the largest fire on the Olympic Peninsula since 1951, which as of October 2025 remained only 5% contained. Hernandez worked as a federal contractor whose specialized skills were urgently needed to protect Washington communities from this massive blaze. Yet agents made no inquiry about his community ties, flight risk, or dangerousness — despite his pending U-visa application as a crime victim. The arrest also violated DHS's own policy against enforcement during disaster response: ""Absent exigent circumstances, immigration enforcement will not be conducted at locations where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided.""

How the Supreme Court Greenlit Racial Profiling

Just 12 days after Hernandez was arrested in the middle of fighting a wildfire, on Sept. 8, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled on Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo. The Supreme Court’s decision allows ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain people based solely on four specific factors: their apparent race and ethnicity, whether they speak Spanish or accented English, whether they're at worksites associated with unauthorized immigrants, or the type of work they perform (such as landscaping or construction). The Court's 6-3 decision allowed ICE to resume these racial profiling enforcement operations.

The Shadow Docket Process

Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo was decided through the Court's ""shadow docket"" — emergency orders issued without oral arguments and detailed briefings, including amicus curiae briefs (friend of the court briefs by interested parties). Shadow docket rulings prioritize speed over transparency.

The Trump administration's use of the shadow docket has been unprecedented. In the first 20 weeks of 2025, the administration filed 19 emergency applications — matching what the Biden administration filed over four years. According to Reuters, the George W. Bush and Obama administrations combined filed only eight emergency applications across 16 years. Their reporting concluded that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court has sided with Trump entirely or in part in 21 out of 24 shadow docket cases brought this year — an 87.5% success rate.

In a recent interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, confirmed that the Trump administration used the emergency docket far more frequently than previous administrations. When Colbert asked why, Justice Sotomayor explained: ""You know, success breeds new attempts, and to the extent that we have altered the natural course of history by granting more consideration of emergency dockets, of the emergency cases, we invite more of them.""

After Colbert noted the increase was ""significantly more,"" Sotomayor agreed. ""You know, in the past, the court was loath to grant emergency intervention most of the time. We figured if two courts below had given careful consideration to something, we shouldn't intrude until the case ended, which is the normal course of things. That has changed.""

ICE's Arrest Quota

NWIRP's lawsuit revealed a troubling context for Hernandez's arrest. According to their petition: ""In late May, Respondent Secretary Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller met with ICE leadership, setting a new arrest quota of 3,000 arrests per day and reportedly threatening job consequences if officials failed to meet arrest quotas.""

The petition continues: ""Following the directive from Noem and Miller, ICE agents were instructed in an email to 'turn the creativity knob up to 11' and aggressively 'push the envelope' in arrests, including by pursuing 'collaterals' — individuals who by definition would not have warrants. As another email put it: 'If it involves handcuffs on wrists, it's probably worth pursuing.'""

This focus on arrest quotas represents a dramatic departure from campaign promises. While Trump vowed to deport the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, ABC News reported in July 2025 that the reality looks very different: ""In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges.""

Many of those being arrested are working people whose only immigration violation may be overstaying a visa — which is a civil infraction, not a crime.

The Constitutional Standard and the Brignoni-Ponce Precedent

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo relied heavily on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce (1975), despite the fact that this case actually undermines his position. In Brignoni-Ponce, Border Patrol officers conducting a roving patrol near the Mexican border — not at a border checkpoint or the border itself — stopped a vehicle solely because the occupants ""appeared to be of Mexican descent."" The Supreme Court unanimously ruled this violated the Fourth Amendment, establishing that apparent Mexican ancestry alone cannot justify an immigration stop.

The Court in Brignoni-Ponce held that officers must have ""specific articulable facts, together with rational inferences from those facts, that reasonably warrant suspicion that the vehicles contain aliens who may be illegally in the country."" The Court emphasized that ""large numbers of native-born and naturalized citizens have the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry"" and that ""even in the border area a relatively small proportion of them are aliens."" The Court noted that in California, approximately 20% of persons of Mexican origin were unauthorized immigrants, meaning about 80% were U.S. citizens or legal residents who would be affected by stops based solely on ethnic appearance. The Court stated, ""a set of facts cannot constitute reasonable suspicion if it 'describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent' people.""

This exact concern animated Justice Sotomayor's dissent in Noem. She emphasized the scale of innocent people who would be affected, noting: ""Never mind that nearly 47 percent of the Central District's population identifies as Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Never mind that over 37 percent of the population of Los Angeles County speaks Spanish at home, and over 55 percent speak a language other than English."" Just as Brignoni-Ponce recognized that profiling would ensnare ""large numbers"" of innocent citizens near the border, Sotomayor warned that ""countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.""

Justice Kavanaugh's Flawed Distinction

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledged constitutional limits, stating: ""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court's case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a 'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors."" The ""salient factors"" he identified include: that there is an ""extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area;” that individuals ""tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work;” that they ""often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork;” and that ""many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.""

In Kavanaugh's view, these circumstances ""taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion"" that would allow immigration officers to ""briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status.""

However, this distinction is constitutionally meaningless. The factors Kavanaugh relies upon are no more probative of immigration status than the ethnic appearance that Brignoni-Ponce rejected. Both involve sweeping generalizations about where undocumented immigrants might be found, casting suspicion on millions of citizens and legal residents based on their appearance, language, workplace, and occupation.

David Montes, an attorney with the ACLU of Washington, explains how profoundly Kavanaugh's reasoning departs from established Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections.

Kavanaugh's concurrence suggests that immigration stops are harmless because U.S. citizens can simply prove their status and continue on their way. But this fundamentally inverts constitutional protections. Under traditional Fourth Amendment doctrine, the government cannot stop someone unless they already have reasonable suspicion based on specific facts of criminal activity. Kavanaugh's approach reverses this: the government can stop you first, and then you have an obligation to prove you're not violating the law.

""That is the radical shift from where we were before,"" Montes explains. ""Not only is it a radical shift in terms of the Fourth Amendment — the government was supposed to have information before they stopped you — but also in terms of the Fifth Amendment. I was supposed to not have to say anything to the government, right?""

Montes warns that under Kavanaugh's reasoning, exercising your Fifth Amendment right carries a penalty: ""If I don't provide information, then they can detain me for longer.""

Montes, who conducts educational presentations for the ACLU, finds this departure unprecedented: ""I mean, I've given a hundred Know Your Rights trainings at the ACLU. It's just not what the Constitution said in any context previously. It's a wild departure from what the Fourth and Fifth Amendment have previously said.""

He summarizes the reversal: ""What Kavanaugh seems to be saying is reasonable suspicion now means the police stop the person...and [that person] has to prove to them that [they] didn't commit a crime to be released. This inverts the traditional understanding where ‘reasonable suspicion’ meant that the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe someone committed a crime and therefore they could investigate further. Kavanaugh seems to put the burden on the person being stopped to prove they are not here illegally.""

Montes concludes that Kavanaugh's error is twofold: ""I think he's both wrong in terms of what constitutes reasonable suspicion and wrong in terms of what is supposed to happen after a police officer has reasonable suspicion.""

The District Court's Actual Findings

Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence repeatedly characterized ICE operations as brief stops, where individuals would be promptly released after clarifying their legal status. Yet the district court's extensive factual findings directly contradicted this portrayal. The court documented that during Operation At Large raids across Los Angeles, ""teams of armed and masked agents pulled up to car washes, tow yards, farms, and parks and began seizing individuals on sight, often before asking a single question.""

One case involved Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen working on his car at a tow yard. Despite answering that he was American three times, masked ICE agents armed with 'handguns and military-style rifles' continued their interrogation. When he couldn't immediately recall his birth hospital, agents 'racked a rifle' — audibly preparing the weapon to fire — 'grabbed his phone, shoved him against a fence while twisting his arm and forcing his hands behind his back.' He was released only after surrendering his REAL ID, which was never returned.

This bears no resemblance to the 'brief encounter' where citizens would be 'promptly' released that Kavanaugh described.

The Reality Behind ""Brief Detention""

Justice Kavanaugh acknowledges the Fourth Amendment's reasonable suspicion standard, noting that immigration officers ""may briefly detain"" an individual only if they have ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts"" of illegal presence. He assures that ""if the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Yet Kavanaugh's legal standard contradicts his own factual assertions. As attorney David Montes explained, Kavanaugh allows stops based on factors — ethnicity, language, location, type of work — that describe millions of law-abiding citizens and legal residents. These are not ""specific articulable facts"" about an individual; they are broad demographic generalizations that Brignoni-Ponce explicitly prohibited.

Kavanaugh's reassurance about ""brief"" stops and ""prompt"" releases contradicts the documented reality on the ground. NWIRP attorney Mozhdeh Oskoulan challenges both Kavanaugh's legal reasoning and his factual assumptions: ""I can tell you that the idea that a brief stop for questioning is ok is ridiculous. Modern day stop and frisk practice without individualized reasonable suspicion. It is unlawful."" ""This is not what we are seeing,"" she emphasizes.

ICE Training: A Dangerous Gap in Professional Standards

ICE deportation officers previously received about 21-22 weeks of training, but The Atlantic reported in August 2025 that ""administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses."" This dramatic decrease in training helps explain the troubling incidents of violent treatment of unarmed individuals during immigration raids that are being recorded daily on cell phones.

ICE's use of masked agents in unmarked vehicles has created additional dangers for immigrant communities. The Atlantic reported that these tactics make it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement officers and criminals posing as agents, enabling impersonators to commit crimes including kidnapping, sexual assault, and extortion. These represent only reported cases; many victims likely do not report such crimes to local law enforcement.

Justice Sotomayor's Dissent

The enforcement reality — masked agents with reduced training conducting violent stops based on ethnic appearance — is exactly what Justice Sotomayor warned the Court was authorizing in her Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo dissent.

Cutting through the legal sophistry, Justice Sotomayor stated: ""Based on the evidence before it, the court held that the Government was stopping individuals based solely on four factors: (1) their apparent race or ethnicity; (2) whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent; (3) the type of location at which they were found (such as a car wash or bus stop); and (4) the type of job they appeared to work.""

She emphasized that the District Court found these four factors, ""even when taken together, could not satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonable suspicion."" Sotomayor argued that the District Court should have been allowed to review ""these troubling allegations in the normal course,"" but the majority felt compelled to stay the order.

""That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.""

Not the Final Word

Despite the troubling implications of the shadow docket ruling, Montes emphasizes that the fight continues: ""It's worth noting that this isn't a final decision on the issue. It's just a decision on the stay... it's back down with the Central District [of California] being litigated, and so it's possible to adjust that litigation to what Kavanaugh said, and to fully flesh out those issues to show how wrong Kavanaugh was, because this isn't ultimately a decision on the merits. It's only a decision on the stay.""

Montes explains that Kavanaugh's reasoning was preliminary — essentially his ""first blush"" assessment that doesn't bind the lower court's full consideration of the constitutional issues. The case returns to the Central District of California for continued litigation, where the ACLU will continue fighting to demonstrate the flaws in Kavanaugh's analysis.

Oskoulan similarly notes: ""Justice Kavanaugh's concurrence was just one opinion out of 9. This shadow docket ruling is unclear and not the final word on the matter as the case is now sent back to lower court.""

Montes adds: ""I hope they see that when it's more fully fleshed out in front of them and not on this very quick shadow docket and reverse themselves, but if they don't, it is a massive departure from where we were before.""

Know Your Rights — And the Risks

Despite the legal setbacks, immigrant rights attorneys like those at NWIRP and the ACLU continue working to protect vulnerable communities.

""Our Know Your Rights presentations are basically to remind our immigrant communities of their Fifth Amendment right to silence and their Fourth Amendment right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures,"" Oskoulan explains. ""For example, how ICE needs a judicial warrant, or permission of the individual, to enter a house.""

However, the current reality requires acknowledging the risks involved in asserting constitutional rights.

""In this day and age when ICE breaks car windows and doors to community members' homes and drags them out and assaults them we also make sure to tell people to gauge the level of risk of physical harm they are willing to take if and when they want to exercise their constitutional rights. But to assert them verbally nonetheless,"" advises Oskoulan.

From Constitutional Theory to Enforcement Reality

If looking Mexican near the Mexico border was insufficient for reasonable suspicion in Brignoni-Ponce, then looking Latino while working on your car at a tow lot in Los Angeles cannot possibly meet that standard. Justice Kavanaugh's additional factors are merely proxies for the same ethnic profiling that Brignoni-Ponce prohibited.

The immediate impact is devastating. The Court has effectively gutted the Fourth Amendment's protection against racial profiling in immigration enforcement. The constitutional crisis became undeniable when federal agents arrested firefighter Rigoberto Hernandez while he was battling flames to protect American communities, simply because of how he looked and because he dared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right.

Yet as both Montes and Oskoulan emphasize, this shadow docket ruling is not the final word. The ACLU of California continues to litigate the case in the Central District, working to demonstrate the constitutional flaws in Kavanaugh's reasoning. Individual victories like Hernandez's release show that legal challenges can succeed. The fight for Constitutional protections continues — and communities don't have to face it alone.

""They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats.","Washington — Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as ""lawless"" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.

The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.

""This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,"" Khanna told CBS News. ""We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.""

The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.

Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.

On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was ""a little startled"" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. ""I live in Chicago,"" Ellis said. ""And I'm not blind.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has ""not seen them cross the line yet."" Johnson told reporters that ""ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,"" adding that Republicans ""stand for law enforcement.""

Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles ""fuels impersonation of immigration officers"" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who ""understand the importance of not having government overreach.""

On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. ""CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers ""are authorized to defend themselves and others"" and that DHS ""reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.""

Nonprofits like universities and hospitals also hire H-1B visa holders.
Flashback: The Chamber also sued over this issue during the first Trump administration, arguing that a ban on entry for H-1B visa holders the White House sought to impose in 2020 was illegal.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday sued to block the Trump administration's plan to charge a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a move businesses say could deprive them of skilled foreign workers.

Why it matters: For all of the actions taken by the administration that pressured corporate America, from DOGE to tariffs, the proposed visa changes proved a bridge too far for the influential business lobby.

The big picture: Big businesses have been extremely reluctant to pursue litigation over Trump's policies, even as behind the scenes new regulations and orders are causing widespread discontent.

Trump's tariffs, for example, were challenged in court by a group of small businesses.

What they're saying: The Chamber, in a petition for an injunction, said the new fees would keep many American businesses from being able to hire talented foreign workers.

""These harms to American businesses will also be a boon to America's economic rivals, who will surely welcome the talent no longer able to accept work in the United States. That is a competitive edge that foreign employers might never cede back,"" the group wrote.

Of note: This is the first suit filed against the Trump administration this year by the Chamber.

The group sued the Biden White House on multiple occasions, frequently arguing the administration overstepped its statutory authority.

Catch up quick: In a September executive order, Trump said that employers hiring workers through the H-1B visa program would be subject to a $100,000 fee.

Prior to the announcement, it cost about $3,600 to sponsor a visa holder, and companies large and small said it was a crucial mechanism for hiring hard-to-find tech and science talent. Nonprofits like universities and hospitals also hire H-1B visa holders.

The announcement set off a panic inside American companies and among foreign workers.

Many small businesses and startups said they're unable to pay such a fee. Bigger companies were considering offshoring the work, lawyers told Axios recently.

Zoom in: The Chamber, which represents around 300,000 members including big and small employers, argues that the order is unlawful, and directly contradicts laws passed by Congress.

They're asking the court to stop the fee from taking effect.

The suit was filed in the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C. against the Department of Homeland Security and State Department. DHS secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are named defendants.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

""The Administration's actions are lawful and are a necessary, initial, incremental step towards necessary reforms to the H-1B program.""

Flashback: The Chamber also sued over this issue during the first Trump administration, arguing that a ban on entry for H-1B visa holders the White House sought to impose in 2020 was illegal.

In that case, a federal judge ruled that the administration overstepped its authority.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has locked arms with fellow Democrats nationwide in using the courts to push back on President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The potential 2028 presidential candidate has filed or joined more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the president’s efforts to reshape the federal government and slash previously allocated spending. The ones he’s joined have been championed by other Democratic officials.

Under Pennsylvania law, Republican Attorney General Dave Sunday is in charge of representing the commonwealth. But Shapiro can ask Sunday in writing to allow the governor’s Office of General Counsel to take over legal representation for the governor or other executive branch officials.

If Sunday declines Shapiro’s request — which he has not done this year, according to Shapiro’s office — the general counsel can intervene in the lawsuit to represent Shapiro and his interests as the state’s chief executive anyway.

Here is a timeline of Shapiro’s lawsuits, listed in order of filing date:

Federal funding freeze, Feb. 13

One of Trump’s first actions upon reentering the White House this year was to issue a sweeping executive order freezing the distribution of billions of dollars in federal grant money, including $2.1 billion allocated to Pennsylvania largely for environmental programs.

Shapiro then sued five federal agencies over those funds in Pennsylvania’s Eastern District Court. Since the funds were released, Shapiro has touted this case as demonstrative of his success in combating the Trump administration.

On Aug. 12, Shapiro’s office voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit “(b)ecause all previously-withheld funding at issue in this case is currently available” to Pennsylvania.

The case was Shapiro v. U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, No. 2:25-cv-00763.

Public health grants, April 1

Shapiro joined a multistate lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for their cancellation of public health grants meant to assist states in combating infectious diseases. Those funds included $500 million for the Pennsylvania departments of Human Services, Health, and Drug and Alcohol Programs.

A Rhode Island federal judge ruled in May that Kennedy’s agency must release those funds, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected Kennedy’s appeal in July. Defendants have until Oct. 28 to respond.

The case is State of Colorado et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, No. 1:25-cv-00121.

Post-pandemic education funds, April 10

Sixteen states, including Pennsylvania (represented by Shapiro’s office), and Washington, D.C., sued the U.S. Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon over rescinded funding the agency provided to school districts after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared over.

The funding — of which $185 million was allocated to 116 Pennsylvania school districts to boost student mental health resources, support access to high-speed internet and fund HVAC installation — was reinstated by a New York federal judge in May.

The case is ongoing. In an Oct. 1 filing, Jay Clayton, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the parties “have made additional progress in reaching a consensual resolution but require additional time to finalize an agreement.”

The case is New York et al. v. U.S. Department of Education et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:25-cv-02990.

AmeriCorps, April 29

Shapiro joined more than two dozen states in suing the Corporation for National and Community Service over its cancellation of AmeriCorps, which promotes volunteerism in nonprofits, schools, faith-based organizations and public agencies.

Pennsylvania was to receive more than $6 million to support its AmeriCorps workers, and a Maryland federal judge ruled in June that the federal agency had to return those rescinded funds to the state. The case is ongoing.

The case is State of Maryland et al. v. Corporation for National and Community Service, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland, Case No. 1:25-cv-01363.

Food purchasing program, June 4

Shapiro filed a lawsuit in the Middle District of Pennsylvania demanding that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins pay over $13 million in canceled federal funding to a program for farmers who sell products to food banks.

The case is ongoing, with Rollins’ attorneys fighting to have the lawsuit dismissed.

The case is Governor Josh Shapiro et al. v. U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Case No.1:25-cv-00998.

Broad grant cancellations, June 24

Shapiro joined 19 other states and Washington, D.C., in a wide-ranging lawsuit in the U.S. District of Massachusetts challenging Trump’s authority to cancel U.S. grant funding previously awarded, based on the federal administration’s argument that the grants “no longer (effectuate) the program goals or agency priorities.”

On Aug. 4, Judge Indira Talwani issued a partial summary judgment in the states’ favor, ruling the Trump administration could not cancel the grants. But on Sept. 11, Trump’s administration filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The case is ongoing.

U.S. Sen. John Fetterman weighed in on Sept. 18, joining twelve other senators in filing an amicus brief urging the court to rule against the Trump administration.

The case is State of New Jersey et al. v. U.S. Office of Management and Budget et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-11816.

Education funds, July 14

The federal Education Department canceled roughly $230 million in federal funds the Shapiro administration said would assist Pennsylvania schools with buying student technology supplies, providing after-school activities and organizing family literacy programs.

Shapiro joined another highly publicized multistate lawsuit challenging the $6 billion decision in Rhode Island’s federal court. The federal agency last month said it would release $1.3 billion of those funds. The case was dismissed on Sept. 12.

The case is State of California et al. v. McMahon et al., U.S. District Court, District of Rhode Island, Case No. 1:25-cv-00329.

Natural disasters, July 16

Shapiro announced on social media last month that he joined an 18-state lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s cancellation of disaster mitigation funds, including $130 million intended for 47 projects in Pennsylvania.

On Aug. 5, Judge Richard Stearns ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the defendant in the case, to not spend those dollars on any programs other than the disaster relief program it was intended to fund, until a final ruling in the case is made.

Citing the federal government shutdown, the agencies on Oct. 10 sought a pause in the case due to a lack of funding. On Oct. 14, Stearns denied the request. He ruled that resolving the issues are too important to delay

The case is State of Washington et al. v. Federal Emergency Management Agency et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12006.

Affordable Care Act changes, July 17

Shapiro and 20 states claim that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services illegally changed rules surrounding the Affordable Care Act’s state and federal health insurance marketplaces, including shortening enrollment periods and implementing a monthly $5 fee for patients.

The officials also challenged a rule barring transgender health care from the essential benefits requiring Affordable Care Act coverage.

The case is ongoing. It’s titled State of California, et al. v. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12019.

Planned Parenthood, July 29

Trump’s tax and spending megabill from July included a provision that would bar Planned Parenthood, the country’s largest provider of abortions, and its members from accessing Medicaid funds. Shapiro and 22 other state officials say that blockade of funds is illegal because the language of the provision is written so narrowly that it targets Planned Parenthood.

The Democratic officials’ challenge came a day after Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled to block the Trump administration’s barring of funds in a similar lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood. Talwani is also overseeing Shaprio’s lawsuit.

On Oct. 8, Talwani denied the Trump administration’s request to pause court proceedings during the government shutdown.

The case is State of California et al. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al., U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12118.

Gender-affirming care, Aug. 1

Shapiro and 16 other Democratic state officials sued Trump and his administration in Massachusetts over the president’s efforts to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, arguing there is no federal law banning medical care for minors.

On Oct. 1, federal Judge Angel Kelley granted the Trump administration’s request to pause proceedings while the federal government is shut down.

The case is Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Trump et al., U.S. District Courts, District of Massachusetts, Case No. 1:25-cv-12162.

Electric vehicles, Aug. 1

The Trump administration froze some $5 billion to create a national network of electric vehicle charging stations just weeks into his second term in the White House. In May, several Democratic officials across the country filed suit attempting to unfreeze those funds.

In an amended complaint filed Aug. 1, Shapiro signed onto the lawsuit, which is ongoing.

However, both Mamdani and Cuomo have stated that they would defend the city’s sanctuary city status.

As a sanctuary city, New York City agencies are barred from sharing information regarding immigrants with federal authorities unless a crime has been committed. Immigration officials cannot arrest immigrants at city or state facilities such as courthouses or shelters. City law enforcement agencies are also prohibited from honoring “detainer requests” from ICE in most instances in the event of a conviction of a violent crime.

New York’s status as a sanctuary city dates back to executive orders issued by the Koch administration in 1989, but the status became official city law in 2011.

Immigrants are vital to New York’s mosaic as the city is home to 3.1 million foreign-born residents, who speak over 800 languages. Affordability, transportation, and public safety all impact immigrants, however, the Trump administration’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda has pushed the question of immigration and the treatment of immigrants to the forefront of city politics.

Recent high-profile arrests of city and state elected officials at immigration courts and the 400% spike in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers in New York City have left many asking how the next mayor will respond.

In June, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against New York City in an effort to dismantle the city’s sanctuary policy. Following the Trump administration’s suit, Mayor Eric Adams called for the city to modify its sanctuary protections for immigrants.

“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council — but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,” said Kayla Mamelak Altus, the mayor’s spokesperson, in a statement to The City in July.

The federal lawsuit is ongoing, and the City Council has continued to support the city’s sanctuary policies. In September, the City Council successfully blocked the Adams Administration from allowing ICE to open a field office on Rikers Island.

With New York’s status as a sanctuary city subject to intense debate and the looming threat of the Trump administration possibly deploying National Guard troops across the five boroughs, New York’s mayoral candidates have taken varying stances both in support and opposition.

Zohran Mamdani

Mayoral frontrunner and Democratic Party nominee, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, has vowed to preserve the city’s sanctuary status. A Ugandan immigrant himself, Mamdani moved to New York City with his family when he was 7 years old. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2018, and if elected, he would become the city’s first immigrant mayor.

“We are fighting to keep this city a sanctuary city,” he said during a rally on Staten Island in August. “We will continue to uphold that status and ensure that we do not allow ICE agents entry.”

Mamdani’s rise has added fuel to President Trump’s growing threats against the city, including the threat to deploy troops to the city if Mamdani became mayor.

However, when asked how he would deal with a hostile Trump administration last week on The New Yorker Radio Hour, Mamdani vowed to be strong — but his answer was vague.

“It’s not about Donald Trump versus myself,” he said. “It’s about Donald Trump versus the city. And that’s why you need someone leading the city that can build a front of New Yorkers who have a wide variety of politics, but are united on the question of this city, and the importance of it, and the fact that the federal government shouldn’t be attacking the very existence of it.”

As an Assemblymember from Astoria, Queens, Mamdani has co-sponsored several bills aimed at strengthening the legal rights of immigrant New Yorkers. In January, he co-sponsored a bill that would provide the right to legal counsel in immigration court proceedings. He also co-sponsored another bill, which would prevent state, county, municipal, and local government agencies from entering into or renewing immigration detention agreements or receiving payments related to immigrant detention.

Both bills are still pending.

Andrew Cuomo

Trailing behind Mamdani in the polls by 13 points is former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent on the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Like Mamdani, Cuomo also defends the city’s sanctuary status.

On June 10, Cuomo announced his 6-Point plan in response to the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles on June 8. In his plan, he vows to guarantee immediate legal defense for those targeted by ICE as well as monitoring the NYPD to ensure they enforce the city’s sanctuary laws.

During his time in Albany, Cuomo had a proven track record of supporting immigrants. In 2017, he issued an executive order prohibiting state agencies from inquiring about individuals’ immigration status. The order also restricted state agencies from sharing immigration status between state and federal authorities, as well as using state resources in immigration enforcement. A year later, in 2018, Cuomo issued another executive order prohibiting ICE from entering state facilities to arrest undocumented immigrants without a judicial warrant.

In addition to his executive orders, while governor, Cuomo suspended New York’s participation in the federal “Secure Communities” program in 2011. The federal program, which began in 2008, shared personal data of every person arrested and fingerprinted from local jails with federal immigration authorities. As a result, the program led to the deportation of over 450,000 people between 2008 and 2014.

Yet, despite his track record of supporting undocumented immigrants while he was governor, Cuomo has been criticized by the Mamdani campaign for courting the Trump base to win the election. In August, The New York Times reported that during a fundraiser with business leaders, Cuomo said he did not“personally want to fight Trump.” The story also reported that Cuomo had several phone calls with the President, discussing the race — a claim that Cuomo denied.

Curtis Sliwa

Unlike Mamdani or Cuomo, Guardian Angels founder and Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa opposes the city’s sanctuary laws. While he maintains that New York should remain a “city of compassion,” he also believes that sanctuary laws shield violent criminals from deportation.

However, Sliwa has pledged that he would not unilaterally revoke the city’s sanctuary status. Instead, he favors putting the question of the city’s sanctuary status directly to the voters through a ballot initiative, asking them if they want to repeal the city’s sanctuary status.",https://documentedny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/46639167082_e4c1bc912d_k-jpg-e1738168047802.webp,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:36.479929

She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.","OCILLA – Just four years after the Biden administration’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement severed ties with an Irwin County Detention Center over abuse, the facility is once again receiving immigrant detainees.

The Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) in Ocilla,, a south Georgia town about 60 miles east of Albany with about 3,000 residents, ended its ICE agreement in 2021 after repeated reports of abuse and medical misconduct. In 2022, Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., unveiled a nearly two-year bipartisan investigation that found female detainees at the ICDC were subjected to “invasive, and often unnecessary gynecological procedures.”

On Tuesday, Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant public affairs secretary, confirmed to The Albany Herald that there is an intergovernmental agreement with the U.S. Marshals and Irwin County to use up to 1,200 beds at the county detention center. It has already begun taking male, adult detainees. It will not be used for families.

In the days since finding out about the resumption of detaining migrants at ICDC, Georgia immigrant advocacy groups, many of whom fought for the ICDC’s closure, have condemned the decision.

“The re-opening of ICDC should alarm us all,” Amilcar Valencia, the executive director of El Refugio, a Stewart County hospitality home, wrote. “People at this … immigrant detention center have been subjected to horrific abuse, and their fundamental human rights have been systematically violated. We cannot let more be put at risk.”

Advocacy groups are calling upon members of Congress, local officials and community members to reject the decision.

Leeann Culbreath, an Episcopal priest and immigrant rights advocate in Tifton, called the decision to restart immigrant detention at Irwin unconscionable.

For years, Culbreath was face-to-face with immigrant detainees at ICDC and their families. She began visiting detainees in 2016 with a group of other volunteers. She said many people had been transferred from Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin and had no family or friends to visit with them in Ocilla.

“So we just started to listen to their stories,” Culbreath said. “The conditions there were inhumane for all of the years that I visited people there, and I don’t know anybody there who did not experience some kind of neglect of their rights or actual abuse: medical, physical, emotional, psychological.”

She also learned from detainees that there was no support system for their family members.

“It was a very difficult and stressful experience for people to make that trip to such a small community in the middle of nowhere with no public transportation,” Culbreath said. “They don’t know where to stay, if they’re safe, if they can get a meal.”

So Culbreath and others opened Casa Colibrí,, a hospitality home where families of immigrant detainees could rest, eat and get connected with resources. It also housed pro bono attorneys and social workers who commuted back and forth to ICDC. The group worked with a chaplain to provide deportation or release bags with clothing and toiletries.

While Casa Colibrí closed in 2020, this level of closeness with immigrant detainees and their families meant Culbreath heard first-hand tales of abuse, and she and others began advocating for ICDC’s closure.

She said when the ICE contract was severed in 2021, advocates felt a mix of emotions.

“There was elation because we believed at the time that no more people would suffer that kind of abuse at that place and that there might be a chance for justice for those who suffered abuse in that facility,” Culbreath said. “We felt like we had been screaming at a brick wall for years and finally felt heard.”

However after the closure, ICE quickly began transferring people from Irwin to the Stewart Detention Center, a privately owned prison about 100 miles away where at least 13 people have died since 2006.

“The justice that we hoped for and the care for survivors never materialized,” Culbreath said.

She said some people are still fighting cases and still do not have permanent status in the U.S., and they face the possibility of being detained again or deported.

“Women are still suffering trauma with PTSD, struggling economically, trying to rebuild their lives,” Culbreath said. “They did all the speaking out and testifying, and they haven’t gotten anything for putting themselves out there and reliving the trauma over and over again.”

She said restarting immigration detention at the ICDC just “re-traumatizes everybody.”

“The wounds are still open,” Culbreath said.

She said it’s too early for immigrant advocates to know how they will respond to the new immigrant detainees housed at Irwin.

“What we do know is that advocates and formerly detained persons and their loved ones in Georgia and beyond will continue to speak out about abuses that they experience,” Culbreath said. “We want to continue to try to provide whatever support is needed for those who are detained.”

She said advocates will continue to ensure detainees have access to legal support and will work with legislators in addressing the needs of those who have been harmed.

“We’ll be monitoring it as best as we’re able,” Culbreath said.

McLaughlin said the Irwin facility will be subject to inspection by the ICE Professional Responsibility Office of Detention Oversight and additional oversight by ICE’s Enforcement Removal Operations custody management.

Culbreath said immigration detention and prolonged imprisonment shouldn’t be a part of the U.S. immigration system.

“Detention … it’s not criminal, but people are housed in prisons and they wear prison jump suits and they’re shackled when they’re transported, so they’re treated as criminals,” she said. “To not meet very basic needs, to use solitary confinement as a form of punishment or to silence dissent – that’s not humane and it can’t be made humane.”",https://d2mq8ajyfy4fws.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16134054/casa-colibri.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 15:02:04.566436

The letter also underscores that the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, operated by the GEO Group, has been repeatedly cited for unsafe, unsanitary, and life-threatening conditions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, Rep Judy Chu (CA-28) led 31 Members of Congress in a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)Acting Director Lyons demanding answers and accountability regarding the untimely death of Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old resident of Westminster, California, who died while in ICE custody on September 22, 2025, after his repeated pleas for medical care were ignored at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Mr. Ayala-Uribe came to the United States when he was four years old and had lived here his entire life. While detained at Adelanto, he became ill and reported having fever, pain, and worsening symptoms. Yet instead of receiving care, he was dismissed by Adelanto’s medical staff and sent back to his dormitory. For three days, his condition deteriorated without proper treatment. By the time he was finally transported to the hospital, it was too late. At just 39 years old, he died before receiving the surgery that could have saved his life.

“Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s untimely death while in ICE custody was a preventable tragedy. His pleas for help were ignored by those responsible for overseeing his care until it was far too late. This was an inexcusable failure to uphold even the most basic standards of medical care for people in federal custody,” said Rep. Chu. “But what happened to Mr. Ayala-Uribe is sadly not an isolated incident. It reflects a horrific, well-documented pattern of neglect at Adelanto, where detainees have been forced to endure conditions so dangerous and inhumane that they have led to multiple deaths. That’s why we are demanding full transparency and accountability to ensure tragedies like this never happen again.”

The letter presses DHS and ICE for a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ayala-Uribe’s death, including the medical decisions made at Adelanto and what corrective actions are being implemented. The letter also underscores that the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, operated by the GEO Group, has been repeatedly cited for unsafe, unsanitary, and life-threatening conditions. Since January 2025, at least 15 people have died in federal immigration custody, marking a sharp increase from previous years, including during the first Trump administration. For more than a decade, Rep. Chu has called for the closure of Adelanto and continues to urge DHS to immediately shut down the facility, citing the long history of abuse, medical neglect, and human rights violations.

Rep. Chu’s letter was signed by 31 Members of Congress: Reps.

And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.
New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.
In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice.
Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.","Four months ago, Yessenia Ruano put her home in Wisconsin up for rent, packed a few bags and left for her native El Salvador. She had fled gang violence in her homeland, and said she had survived forced labor on her journey north. But after living and working in the United States for 14 years as she fought a deportation order, Ms. Ruano seemed to be out of options.

Legal protections that had allowed her to stay while she sought permanent residency began falling away when President Trump expanded his mass deportation effort. Even though her petition to obtain a special visa available to victims of human trafficking was still pending, federal immigration officials refused to delay their efforts to remove her from the country.

Now, Ms. Ruano and several other immigrants say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is violating the law by detaining and deporting victims of domestic violence or human trafficking who have applied for protection.

In a lawsuit filed this week in federal court in Los Angeles, lawyers for Ms. Ruano and the other plaintiffs say that the Trump administration’s policies violate the immigration relief provisions of the Violence Against Women Act and other measures that Congress established to safeguard victims and encourage them to work with the authorities.

Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, one of the nonprofits leading the case, said the government was breaking its legal bargain with vulnerable people who had taken “a dramatic and courageous step in coming forward.”

“Our government is turning its back — arresting, punishing and deporting those individuals — and what we’re going to be left with is an even more traumatized, less open membership in our community, and it’s going to make us all less safe,” Mr. Perez said in an interview.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that every unauthorized immigrant whom ICE has removed from the country has “had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

The lawsuit filed in federal court late Tuesday is one of at least five that challenge the practices of ICE agents and other officers as the federal government has intensified its immigration crackdown in major cities including Chicago; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C.

Under prior administrations, ICE agents were directed to focus on protecting victims when they were questioning unauthorized immigrants who had endured serious or violent crimes. And agents were generally required not to take civil enforcement actions against immigrants who were applying for legal relief as crime victims.

But the agency rescinded those policies early this year. An ICE memorandum told agents to follow an executive order issued by President Trump on the day he was sworn in for his second term, calling for “total and efficient enforcement” of immigration laws.

Anti-immigrant groups and activists have long argued that some kinds of victim-based immigration relief was ripe for fraud and exploitation, and that it tied the hands of law enforcement agencies in pursuing criminals. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for Mr. Trump’s second term called for the elimination of U and T visas, which protect immigrants who are victims of domestic violence or human trafficking.

Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, said the administration’s policy changes gave “ICE more flexibility to proceed with removal proceedings, whether that is for a crime or a prior order of removal.”

Lawyers and immigrant rights groups counter that under the new ICE policies, federal officers have been putting victims in expedited removal processes, detaining them for long periods or deporting them before they have had a chance to plead their case. New policies also have expanded the ability of agents to operate in “sensitive zones,” areas that had been considered off limits for immigration enforcement, like women’s shelters, schools and churches.

Prosecutors and victim services providers say that T and U visas provide important protection for people who testify in court to help hold traffickers and abusers accountable. Those prosecutions can take years to complete and involve extensive, invasive questioning, they say, and the fear stirred up by the Trump administration has made it even harder for them to persuade victims to cooperate.

“It creates more dangerous situations, because the longer the abuse goes unreported, the more we find that it escalates,” said Erin Aiello, an assistant district attorney and chief of the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit at the Northwestern District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts.

Another plaintiff, Kenia Jackeline Merlos, 43, a native of Honduras, has been held at a federal detention center in Washington State since June. Ms. Merlos applied for a U visa in March 2024, citing an episode about a year earlier in which she and her husband were threatened by a man with a gun. They reported the crime and cooperated with the investigation, the lawsuit says.

Ms. Merlos and her four children, who are U.S. citizens, were rounded up over the summer at a park near the Canadian border, where they were spending time with relatives including her parents, who were visiting from Honduras on tourist visas.

Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they endured physical or sexual abuse at the hands of spouses, relatives or others, the court papers say.

In an interview, Ms. Ruano, 38, said she had sought safety in the United States twice. The first time ended in 2011 when she was deported without being given a chance to plead for asylum. She returned that same year, fleeing gang violence in El Salvador, and on the way north, was victimized by a labor trafficking operation. Mr. Perez said the details of the trafficking case would be filed under seal to protect her against retaliation.

When she reached the United States the second time, a judge granted her permission to remain in the country and work while she pursued her asylum case, she said. She worked at a pizza factory in Milwaukee and eventually became a teacher’s aide. She married, and she and her husband, who is not a U.S. citizen, bought a small three-bedroom duplex with a yard for their white poodle mix, Copitos.

The school where she worked was so short of teachers that she was often called upon to substitute in social studies and Spanish classes, she said. “I felt really useful,” she said.

Years later, though, with her petition for asylum still unresolved, a lawyer suggested that she withdraw that petition and apply instead for a T visa, the type that protects trafficking victims.

She applied in February and requested that deportation proceedings be delayed, but that request was denied. Worried about being separated from her children — 10-year-old twin girls — she felt she had no choice but to self-deport.

With the permission of a judge, she left the country with the girls in June, she said, and her husband followed with their dog a month later.

“My hope now is that we can return,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp/15nat-immig-violence-01-jqbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 14:02:54.014407

In May, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order pausing Judge Chen’s temporary injunction while the case was being litigated.","This post is part of Challenging Precedent, a blog of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice examining race, law, and regulation in the Trump era.

In recent news, a federal judge temporarily blocks the deployment of National Guardsmen to Portland following ICE protests, the Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to end deportation protections for Venezuelans while a ruling vacating the termination is appealed, and a federal judge prohibits ICE from detaining unaccompanied minors in adult detention facilities upon reaching the age of 18.

On October 5th, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut of Oregon temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guardsmen from anywhere in the U.S. to Portland. Yesterday Judge Immergut extended the temporary orders for another 14 days. The court’s initial ruling came just one day after temporarily enjoining the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to the city. After receiving a request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in putting “an end to the migrant invasion and these lawless riots,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the deployment of Oregon Guardsmen to the city against the wishes of Governor Tina Kotek. Though increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in June had led to protests in Portland, the court’s opinion noted “it had been months since there was any sustained level of violent or disruptive protest activity” in the city. Judge Immergut further held that Trump’s deployment “exceeds the constitutional authority that Congress granted him,” and “undermine[s] the sovereign interest of Oregon as protected by the Tenth Amendment.” Despite the injunction, the Trump administration mobilized hundreds of California and Texas National Guardsmen to Portland without an official announcement, prompting the second, more expansive restraining order. The White House plans to appeal the decision.

On October 3rd, The Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans while the government appeals a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that blocked DHS Secretary Kristi Noem from ending that status. Created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990, TPS protects eligible migrants from being detained and deported to countries that have been designated as having conditions that make it unsafe or inadequate for people to return. The Biden administration first granted TPS for Venezuelans in March 2021 and extended protections for an additional 18 months just two weeks before Trump took office. In February, the Trump administration subsequently vacated the extension and terminated TPS early for over 300,000 Venezuelans.

In May, the Supreme Court issued an unsigned order pausing Judge Chen’s temporary injunction while the case was being litigated. The case reached a final judgement on September 5, when Judge Chen ruled DHS did not have the lawful authority to terminate the designation and extension. After the Ninth Circuit declined to block Chen’s ruling and the administration sought emergency relief, the Supreme Court issued another unsigned order allowing DHS to terminate TPS for Venezuelans while the Government appeals. The court noted “the parties’ legal arguments and relative harms generally have not” changed so “[t]he same result that [the Court] reached in May is appropriate here.” Justice Jackson dissented, criticizing the Court for leaving “300,000 human beings…vulnerable to job loss, family separation, and deportation” and for using its “equitable power (but not [its] opinion-writing capacity) to allow this administration to disrupt as many lives as possible, as quickly as possible.”

On October 4th, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras in the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining migrant children past their 18th birthdays. The ruling rests on an earlier case decided by Judge Contreras in 2021, which found ICE’s migrant children detention policy was a “pervasive violation” of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and issued a five-year permanent injunction. The ICE policy at issue in that case permitted unaccompanied minors, held in shelters by the Department of Health and Human Services, to be transferred to ICE adult detention facilities upon reaching their 18th birthdays. There, the court held that federal law required unaccompanied minors who reach the age of 18 to be released to the least restrictive setting available. In most cases, that setting is in the home of a relative. On October 1, 2025, ICE purportedly changed its policies to no longer allow unaccompanied minors who turn 18, even those with approved release plans, to be released and instead required them to be transferred to adult detention facilities. Responding to an emergency motion, Judge Contreras found this automatic detention contravened the earlier permanent injunction and enjoined ICE from “implementing any new directive regarding age-outs.”

Jayapal played an instrumental role in the original closure of the facility.

“It is deeply disturbing and dangerous that the Trump administration is choosing to reopen the private, for-profit Irwin Detention Center. In 2020, during the first Trump administration, I was the first member of Congress to speak to attorneys representing women who were detained at Irwin and subjected to forced medical procedures, including full or partial hysterectomies, without their knowledge or consent. These invasive and unnecessary procedures left multiple women without the ability to have children. Following the passage of a bipartisan resolution I led in October 2020, the Department of Homeland (DHS) Security ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

“The idea that this administration would now actively choose to detain individuals there again is unacceptable. The administration has already gutted any existing oversight mechanisms that were at least bare bones guardrails of unaccountable private, for-profit detention centers and their abuse of existing standards of care. Today, the growth of these for-profit immigrant incarceration facilities has only ballooned, with no-bid contracts being awarded to entities that have no experience, no ability, and no desire to ensure humane standards of care.

“The Trump administration’s move to reopen a facility that was the site of so many horrors, with zero oversight in place, is malicious and negligent. The reported death of the 20th person in ICE detention in just nine months of this Administration’s rule shows exactly how deeply we need to completely reform and rein in an abusive for-profit detention system.

“I call on Secretary Noem and the Trump administration to reconsider this dangerous and cruel decision.”

In September of 2020, Congresswoman Jayapal led 173 lawmakers in urging the DHS Inspector General to open an immediate investigation following a whistleblower allegation of mass hysterectomies being performed on women detained at the Irwin County Detention Center. She was also the first member to speak with attorneys representing women, during which she learned that at a minimum, 17 women had been subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures, often without appropriate consent or knowledge. Later that month, she traveled to the facility, and following that visit led 181 lawmakers in introducing a resolution to condemn the forced procedures. The resolution passed the House in early October 2020 with bipartisan support. The DHS ended its use of the facility in May 2021.

Federal agents arrested a man after an alleged crash involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicle in Oxnard Oct. 16.

Officers with the Oxnard Police Department stopped a Nissan Frontier truck in the area of Eighth Street and A Street around 7:48 a.m. after ICE alleged that the truck driver had collided with a Jeep Grand Cherokee and driven away, according to a written statement by Police Chief Jason Benites.

Assistant Police Chief Rocky Marquez previously said that one vehicle was an ICE vehicle and the other was not.

A video shared on Instagram by VC Defensa, a volunteer group that helps provide immigration information, showed the Jeep Grand Cherokee, allegedly belonging to an ICE agent, crashing into the Nissan Frontier, which the group said belonged to one of its volunteers.

The video shows the Nissan making a U-turn and the Jeep following close behind. As the Nissan pulls out of the turn and straightens out, the Cherokee appears to speed up, pull up along the driver's side of the Nissan and ram the truck.

While both vehicles appear close to each other at the start of the clip, it's not clear what interaction, if any, preceded the collision. A message left with ICE was not immediately returned.

Benites said federal authorities alleged that the crash was intentional and asserted a crime had been committed on a federal officer.

Oxnard Police was also asked to help keep the peace between the ICE agents and the growing crowd of about 80 protesters that gathered at the scene, authorities said.

In videos shared on social media, an empty lot in the area had been cordoned off with yellow caution tape to keep protesters out during the investigation. The live stream after the crash also shows multiple vehicles, some unmarked and some Oxnard Police SUVS with lights flashing in the lot and a number of Oxnard police officers standing in the area.

No injuries were reported to the police department, and they were not assisting DHS in the investigation, Assistant Police Chief Rocky Marquez said.

A wrongful arrest occurs when a person’s rights are potentially violated when arrested by law enforcement, for example, if someone is not given a chance to contact an attorney or told why they’ve been arrested.

Several people have also used habeas cases to win their release from the Tacoma detention center, cases with similarities to an arrest this summer that impacted a family in West Seattle.

It was late July, and Cheryl Eugenio was in the parking lot of the Department of Homeland Security building in Tukwila with her three children when she checked her phone. She had a missed call and a voicemail from her husband, Alan Phetsadakone.

“Hey, I’m getting taken in,” he said. “I’m going to be in Tacoma, the Tacoma detention center. I’ll try to call later, OK? Alright, I love you guys. Bye.”

Phetsadakone had gone in for a routine check-in with ICE, as he had done for the past few decades. Eugenio said there was no notice, no indication at all that they were going to detain him — a red flag that a lawyer would later key in on, and a common thread in other unlawful arrest cases.

But in the moment, Eugenio didn’t know what was happening.

“I've replayed it, like, ‘Did I hear that right?’” she said.

Moments after she heard the voicemail she went into the Tukwila federal facility to find out why her husband had been arrested. Eugenio said ICE agents wouldn’t answer her questions or provide more information.

Phetsadakone was brought to the U.S. at the age of 3 as a refugee from Laos. More than 20 years ago, he was convicted of a nonviolent felony for bank fraud, for which he got a deportation order. At that time, Laos refused to accept deportees, so he was released on the condition that he check in regularly with ICE.

Sponsored

Earlier this year, the federal government began attempting to deport former refugees like Phetsadakone. Eugenio saw the stories, but didn’t expect it could happen to her husband.

“At first, I was still in shock,” she said. “It's like all these thoughts running through your head. Like, what's my next step? What do I have to do?”

Word about Phetsadakone's case spread through their community in West Seattle, and he was able to get help from the Seattle Clemency Project.

“The government [was] trying to expeditiously deport him,” said Jennie Pasquarella, the organization’s legal director.

Sponsored

Pasquarella and her team allege Phetsadakone’s arrest was unlawful, because ICE didn’t notify him of their intention to suspend his supervised release and attempt to deport him.

“He's been dutifully checking in with ICE as required under his order of supervision, and so, when he went for his check-in just this past July, he thought it would be the same as it always has been,” Pasquarella said.

Pasquarella also said Phetsadakone’s attorney during his original federal case failed to properly represent and advise him about the immigration consequences of his felony conviction. That finding could lay the groundwork to potentially throw out that conviction, the foundation of Phetsadakone’s deportation order — and he could get legal status again, this time through family members who are citizens.

In court, government attorneys argued Phetsadakone had a standing deportation order, and that they had the required documents to re-detain him and send him to Laos.

But Phetsadakone’s lawyers said those documents weren’t signed by any immigration official, and the deportation papers were only presented after he was detained — another red flag.

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle said the inconsistencies raised serious questions of due process, suggesting ICE didn’t follow its own rules of supervised release.

“These disputed facts and gaps in the Government’s evidence undermine its claims that it followed the procedures required by its own regulations,” Whitehead wrote in a court document. “While the government has an interest in executing removal orders, agencies cannot act unlawfully even pursuing legitimate ends.”

In that same document — a temporary restraining order against the federal government — Whitehead ordered ICE to release Phetsadakone.

Before he was arrested, Phetsadakone and his wife had been taking stock of their life, putting things into their garage for donation and organizing kitchenware and home goods into piles.

They do this every time their kids move forward in a stage in their lives. One of their oldest children has started college. Their youngest is now a teenager.

Standing in front of a garage full of donations, a truck his father-in-law gave him to fix up, and a grill, Phetsadakone was clearly proud of the life he and his wife had created. Despite everything he's been through, he said he remains excited about the future.

“I don’t know how to explain it,” he said. “It’s like America in a sense.”

He’ll have to check in with ICE again this week and in the coming months. Phetsadakone still has to fight his deportation in court. But, he said, that will be a lot easier from outside of detention.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/9da526136df13c554eee770af6079f50.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-10-16 14:03:06.563579

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates?","By Howard Fletcher

In recent years, the discourse surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States has become increasingly polarized and disturbingly opaque. While policymakers tout “law and order,” the actual data on who is targeted, detained, and deported remains elusive—raising troubling questions about transparency and racial bias.

Why are comprehensive numbers on European or Asian immigrants so challenging to find? It’s a fair question to ask when the focus of enforcement seems disproportionately concentrated on Black and Brown populations, especially those from Africa and Latin America.

Reports and data often highlight the surge in deportations of nationals from Mexico, Central America, and increasingly, Venezuela and other South American nations. Meanwhile, European immigrants—whether asylum seekers or tourists overstaying visas—rarely seem to be a focus of enforcement, and comprehensive data on their numbers and treatment are notably absent.

This discrepancy is not accidental. It underscores a persistent pattern: enforcement efforts are directed more aggressively toward Black and Brown communities, reflecting racial biases rather than a balanced approach to immigration control. The lack of transparent, publicly available data on European or Asian immigrants suggests a clear double standard.

Why does this matter?

For one, it erodes trust in the fairness of immigration policies. When enforcement appears to be based on racial profiling, it fuels fear and division, undermining the very ideals of justice and equality. Moreover, the focus on Latin American and African immigrants often ignores the broader economic, cultural, and humanitarian contributions these communities make, instead framing them as “problems” to be solved.

Without proper data, policymakers and the public are left in the dark about the scope and impact of enforcement on different communities. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security does not publish detailed breakdowns of arrests and deportations by race or country of origin beyond a handful of Latin American nations. That absence makes it nearly impossible to assess whether ICE is targeting migrants equitably or disproportionately focusing on specific groups.

Consider a 2025 congressional inquiry led by Representatives Juan Vargas and Darren Soto, which revealed that nearly 90% of ICE street arrests involved people of Latin American descent—even though migrants from Europe, Asia, and Canada also make up a significant share of the undocumented population in the U.S. Though we may have our suspicions, without comprehensive demographic data, it’s impossible to determine whether or not that figure reflects accurate population proportions.

This lack of transparency doesn’t just obscure potential bias—it also prevents meaningful policy reform. If ICE and DHS released comprehensive, disaggregated statistics on all immigrant groups, the public could hold the system accountable and identify inequities early, rather than relying on scattered reports, whistleblowers, or civil rights lawsuits to reveal them years later.

Are European immigrants being detained and deported at similar rates? Are they being subjected to the same level of scrutiny? (We know they’re not.) The silence suggests that enforcement is not applied evenly but is instead used as a tool to publicly target those perceived as “other.”

This selective enforcement echoes historical patterns of racial discrimination that have long plagued our immigration policies. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the targeting of Mexican workers, the United States has a troubling legacy of marginalizing non-white populations under the guise of national security or economic necessity. The Trump administration’s policies continue this pattern, prioritizing deportations that disproportionately impact communities of color, often without transparent justification or data to support such focus.

Furthermore, the rhetoric used to justify these policies often dehumanizes the targeted populations, perpetuating racial stereotypes and undermining America’s commitment to human rights and the rule of law.

The question then becomes: why is there such a lack of transparency? The answer likely lies in political convenience. Focusing enforcement on Black and Brown communities provides a narrative that aligns with certain political agendas—one that emphasizes “securing borders” and “cracking down” on specific populations, often at the expense of truth and fairness.

To move toward a more equitable immigration system, transparency must be prioritized. Data should be publicly accessible, comprehensive, and disaggregated by country of origin, race, and ethnicity. Take California’s Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA), for example. After the state began requiring police departments to collect and publish data by race and ethnicity, analysis revealed stark racial disparities in traffic stops and searches. Those findings prompted several departments—including Los Angeles and San Francisco—to revise training protocols, limit pretextual stops, and increase oversight of enforcement practices.

If America truly aspires to be a nation of laws, it must first be a nation of truth. Transparency in data isn’t a bureaucratic demand—it’s a moral one, a measure of whether our justice system serves equality or enforces hierarchy. Until we confront who is being targeted, and why, we cannot claim that our immigration system reflects the values we so often preach to the world.",https://couriernewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/257/CHR_Thumbnail_-_2025-10-16T092732.569_2000x1125-1024x576.png,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:36.849407

“It’s having serious consequences on the American people.” On Tuesday, Milei had visited the White House to meet with Trump.
“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.","House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday hammered the Trump administration’s effort to provide $40 billion to help Argentina’s conservative leader weather that country’s financial crisis.

Jeffries wondered why Republicans in Washington are willing to secure so much funding for a foreign government but are balking at Democratic demands to subsidize health care for working class people at home.

“It’s perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the health care of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina,” Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol.

Hours earlier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the administration is seeking $20 billion in new funding for the government of Argentine President Javier Milei, a right-wing populist allied with Trump. That’s on top of $20 billion the administration has already provided to help Milei prop up a crumbling economy.

The first round of funding came earlier in the month, in the form of a direct currency swap. The second, Bessent said, would originate from sovereign funds and the private sector, not U.S. taxpayers.

“Many banks are interested in it and many sovereign funds have expressed interest,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

Argentina has come under fire from lawmakers in both parties for increasing its soybean sales to China after Beijing stopped purchasing American soybeans in response to Trump’s tariffs. Jeffries is among those lawmakers, and he criticized the administration for propping up the Argentinian economy but not U.S. farmers.

“That’s outrageous. This is corruption in real time,” Jeffries said. “It’s having serious consequences on the American people.”

On Tuesday, Milei had visited the White House to meet with Trump. Afterward, Trump said he might withhold the billions of dollars earmarked for Argentina if Milei’s party loses in national elections slated for later this month.

“If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump told reporters.

“I think he’s going to win,” he continued. “And if he wins, we’re staying with him, and if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.”

The comments were criticized by opposition leaders in Argentina, and Democrats on Capitol Hill, who accused the president of dangling the funds in an effort to influence the outcome of a foreign election.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/jeffrieshakeem_101425gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:32.569291

David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, predicted that the court would ultimately gut the Voting Rights Act.","WASHINGTON (CN) — The Supreme Court appeared likely to further erode the Voting Rights Act on Wednesday as the justices debated how to remedy racial discrimination in elections.

“You’re saying sometimes it’s acceptable for a federal district court to order a map that intentionally discriminates on the basis of race?” Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Donald Trump appointee, asked voting advocates.

Louisiana added a second majority-Black district after multiple courts concluded that its congressional maps likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory vote dilution. The conservative justices were concerned about how race played into Louisiana’s new maps, questioning whether they violated the 14th and 15th Amendments.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another Trump appointee, said that courts can use race to create remedial maps “so long as it’s not excessive,” but he questioned whether that practice should cease.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time — sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases — but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” Kavanaugh said. “What exactly do you think the end point should be for the intentional use of race to create districts?”

Louisiana’s first set of new maps only included one majority-Black district despite Black voters making up 30% of the adult population in the state. Civil rights groups sued Louisiana for diluting the votes of Black voters, and after a protracted legal battle and federal court ruling, the state Legislature drew new maps in 2024 with a second majority-Black district.

Litigation continued, however, after a group of “non-African American voters” sued the state — so far unsuccessfully — claiming the new maps are unconstitutional because they considered race.

In March, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether the Legislature relied too heavily on race when redrawing Louisiana’s maps. Instead of issuing a decision in June, the justices delayed a decision and scheduled an additional argument this term.

The conservative justices looked likely to throw out Louisiana’s 2024 maps. Justice Samuel Alito, a George W. Bush appointee, was one of several justices to note that Louisiana’s remedial map was drawn based on a preliminary decision in the lower courts.

“Under protest, we drew [the 2024 map] because the threat was that the federal courts were going to do it if we didn’t,” J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, said.

To avoid violating the equal protection clause, legislatures have a compelling interest to use race when drawing maps. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee, questioned whether the state’s reasoning qualified.

“The state would have to say at that point: ‘Well, we’re weighing race heavily because we have a compelling interest in avoiding a Section 2 violation,’” Barrett said. “The state’s position might be we don’t actually really think that we violated Section 2, but we have a litigation risk.”

Barrett suggested that the court clarify its prior rulings that created the standard for when race could be used to remedy a Voting Rights Act violation.

Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that the court’s prior rulings already provided exacting and robust requirements for litigating Section 2 claims. Nelson noted that the court recently reaffirmed those precedents in a 2022 case regarding redistricting in Alabama.

“This court [has] said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one,” Nelson, who argued for the voting advocates, said. “That calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a new unique way.”

Because many states have used Section 2 to draw their districts, the voting advocates warned that removing its protections would lead to a resurgence of discrimination. One report estimated that if the Supreme Court sides with Louisiana, Republicans could secure an additional 19 safe seats in the House of Representatives and cement GOP control for at least a generation.

While all the conservatives seemed to take issue with Louisiana’s 2024 maps, there wasn’t a consensus on how to fix them. The liberal justices were concerned that their colleagues’ solution would gut what’s left of the landmark law.

“The bottom line is just get rid of Section 2,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Barack Obama appointee, said, describing one potential solution.

Sotomayor said the conservative justices were only looking at the use of race in a negative context.

“Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn’t deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor said.

Justice Elena Kagan, another Obama appointee, said that race was only used in response to discrimination.

“The race-based redistricting that you’re now objecting to is redistricting designed to remedy a specific, identified, proved violation of law; more, a specific, identified, proved racial discrimination by the state,” Kagan told Louisiana’s solicitor general.

The Trump administration has suggested that the justices consider whether a state’s maps depart from race-neutral principles. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Joe Biden appointee, worried that solution prevented remedies for discrimination in places with a history of segregation, like Louisiana.

“I hear your test not allowing us to solve that problem when the state is continuing to present the same map under circumstances in which people are not actually able to have equal electoral opportunity,” Jackson said.

David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, predicted that the court would ultimately gut the Voting Rights Act.

“This idea that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments — added to the Constitution to ensure that Black Americans would be full members of the body politic — bars legal remedies for racial vote dilution designed to cancel out Black voting strength turns the Constitution on its head,” Gans said in a statement.

He continued, “In this morning’s oral argument, the court’s conservative justices turned a blind eye to this core part of the Fifteenth Amendment’s text and history.”",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-16 12:58:15.177584

A Bucks County judge upheld Sheriff Fred Harran’s decision to partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, rejecting a legal challenge that sought to block the controversial 287(g) agreement.

The ruling, issued Tuesday by Judge Jeffrey G. Trauger of the Bucks County Court of Common Pleas, allows the sheriff’s office to proceed with the ICE cooperation agreement — at least for now — despite opposition from county commissioners, immigrant rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania.

The decision comes as Harran, a Republican, seeks reelection as he fends off a challenge by Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler.

Harran released a statement shortly after the decision, calling it “a victory for the law-abiding residents of Bucks County and a validation of a common-sense approach to public safety which fully leverages partnerships and resources to keep our communities safe.”

“This decision affirms our ability to use this simple tool to ensure individuals who commit crimes in our county are held fully accountable – regardless of their immigration status,” he wrote.

Stephen Loney, senior supervising attorney at the ACLU, said the “fight is far from over.”

“It’s unfortunate that the judge in this case failed to appreciate what the law clearly states; the sheriff does not have authority to sign onto a 287(g) agreement with ICE,” Loney said in a statement. “We will appeal this decision and, in the meantime, we will continue to work to hold Sheriff Harran accountable to the rule of law.”

Harran signed the 287(g) “task force” model agreement with ICE in April. Under that model, trained local deputies may act in a limited immigration enforcement capacity, including serving ICE warrants and checking individuals in custody against ICE databases.

That led to a series of protests by local activists and contentious court proceedings.

No standing

The lawsuit, filed in June, argued that Sheriff Harran lacked legal authority to enter into a 287(g) agreement without approval from the county’s Board of Commissioners. Plaintiffs, including Make the Road, NAACP Bucks County, Buxmont Unitarian Universalist Fellowship and Juan Navia, a Bucks County resident who claimed the arrangement violated Pennsylvania law and posed risks to civil rights and public trust.

However, in the 13-page decision, Judge Trauger found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the case at this stage because of a lack of harm from an agreement that is not yet in effect.

“Plaintiffs here are alleging injuries that are not immediate or substantial,” Trauger wrote. “Rather, in their complaint, they allege what are clearly only speculative future injuries based on speculative future events.”

The decision singled out Navia, who was asked to join the plaintiffs and argued in court that he and his family feared they would be subjected to an increase in racial profiling. During cross-examination, Navia said he did not know of anyone who was already affected.

Traugher wrote that Navia “baldly alleges that he is at an increased risk of profiling” but “alleges wholly subjective fears of possible future incidents, including racial profiling, warrantless searches and arrests.”

As a result, the judge said, “none of the Plaintiffs have proper standing to bring this action.”

On whose authority?

Traugher’s decision did find that the Bucks County Board of Commissioners had standing to pursue their challenge. In May, the board passed a resolution reaffirming its sole contractual authority and declaring the 287(g) agreement invalid, citing concerns about liability costs. Commissioners Diane Ellis‑Maresiglia and Bob Harvie supported the resolution; Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo dissented, voicing confidence in Harran’s approach.

The commissioners separately challenged Harran’s agreement with ICE, arguing that Harran was legally required under state law to seek approval from the county commissioners before entering into binding agreements on behalf of the county and that the sheriff cannot unilaterally bind the county to a federal partnership.

However, the judge disagreed, finding that “the documents signed by the Sheriff are not an enforceable contract and therefore were not subject to the approval” of the commissioners.

He also cited earlier agreements with federal agencies that the sheriff entered into without objection, such as those with the U.S. Marshals and ICE Homeland Security Investigations, which “did not include or require any County Commissioner approval.”

The decision also notes that Harran signed the memorandum of understanding with “limited intent,” designating only three officers to take on the outlined duties and keeping those duties limited.

What’s next?

Critics warn that the 287(g) task force model has a history of racial profiling, overreach and misuse in other jurisdictions. They argue that immigrant victims of crime may be less willing to report crimes or cooperate with law enforcement if local deputies are seen as ICE proxies.

However, Harran has emphasized that the agreement would be targeted, not sweeping. He said the program will only involve those already in custody on criminal or warrant charges and not routine traffic stops, and that he is not seeking to deputize deputies to police immigration status generally.

He has also asserted that the program would come at zero cost to county taxpayers, with ICE reimbursing equipment, vehicles and personnel expenses, though commissioners and others have expressed concern over potential liability costs borne by the county if a raid or arrest goes wrong.

The debate intersects directly with the race for sheriff, between Harran and Ceisler, the Democrat.

Ceisler has been critical of Harran’s ICE collaboration, arguing that it diverts resources, reduces trust and harms public safety. He contends that deputies should focus on county law enforcement duties rather than carrying out federal immigration tasks.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ICE-officer-immigration-immigrant-detainees.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:48.347221

NEW BEDFORD — In response to an uptick in immigration activity and “some community pushback,” Police Chief Jason Thody has issued interim guidance on how the department’s officers should interact with and respond to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when they’re in the city.

“One of the main topics right now is immigration enforcement,” Thody said. “The question was, what do we do as the New Bedford Police Department? What’s the direction to the troops on what we do [during] ICE operations?”

‣ Coming tomorrow: How county sheriffs interact with ICE

Among the guidelines, the three-page document states officers must activate their body cameras when responding, and must “fully document” each incident by noting key aspects: whether NBPD was notified by ICE before the operation, what officers observed on scene, and whether any arrests occurred.

It’s a stopgap measure until the department publishes a formal policy, which it is developing with city attorneys.

The guidance addresses how police should interact with protesters who may be on scene or nearby during an ICE operation. It affirms that protesters are allowed to voice their opinion and film (activities protected by the First Amendment), but states New Bedford police must “restore order” if demonstrators interfere with law enforcement operations, block vehicles, create safety hazards, or turn violent.

“Officers should prioritize the safety of everyone involved, including agents, protesters, and bystanders, while balancing lawful order with the public’s right to observe and speak,” it says.

When responding, NBPD will send a supervisor and at least two officers. The supervisors would then be expected to verify the agents are with ICE. If federal agents do not provide that information, Thody said the department will document that, too.

Thody issued the guidance to all police personnel on Sept. 21 and published a public facing FAQ on the police website on Sept. 24.

Chief says ICE has rarely communicated with NB police

The transparency on the Police Department’s end comes amid a lack of transparency from ICE, according to local elected officials — and Thody.

Communication has been inconsistent and the department doesn’t hear much from the federal agency, Thody said. Most of the time, police learn of immigration arrests through the news or social media.

Between July and October, Thody saw one or two calls from ICE to the department’s communications division to inform them that federal agents would be in the city that day. Since July, The Light has confirmed at least 17 ICE arrests in the city. Most arrestees are originally from Guatemala.

Across Massachusetts, ICE has targeted Guatemalans. They rank second, after Brazilians, in the most arrests by country of origin from January through July in the state, according to ICE data.

“It is frustrating to not be able to have conversations that could put our community and our officers in a safer place,” said Thody, who spoke with The Light before and after the guidance was published. “There are a lot of ways I think we could be helpful to both sides without enforcing immigration laws and getting involved.”

Thody said he contacted ICE Boston Field Office Acting Director Patricia Hyde in hopes of having a conversation. He has not heard back.

“We know that they’re going to do what they’re going to do… I can’t control that. But is there a way we can — not work together — but we could create a situation that’s safe for our residents and put our immigrant population at ease,” Thody said, “whether that’s running interference or using deconfliction training.”

Communication with ICE could enhance public safety, Thody argues. Citing the window-smashing incident involving Juan Francisco Méndez in New Bedford in April, Thody said New Bedford police could assist in de-escalating similar situations. They can also offer language skills if ICE officers cannot effectively communicate with the person.

The department employs a K’iche’-speaking officer, as well as those who speak Spanish. The guidance notes this, stating officers can provide “translation services.”

But New Bedford officers may not be able to do that if they are not informed of where and when ICE agents will be operating in the city.

Ondine Gálvez Sniffin, Méndez’s attorney, challenged Thody on this in July when, just after starting the job as chief, he spoke before the immigrant community during a gathering at Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, where Méndez was in attendance.

Gálvez Sniffin said that when New Bedford police officers responded to the scene after Méndez was taken, they told her that “they would not get involved, they would not interfere, in an enforcement action.”

“How are they going to de-escalate the situation?” she asked Thody.

Thody said there is no perfect answer: ”I don’t know that we will be able to help in every situation.”

Still, it’s worth trying, he said.

Critics react

Adrian Ventura, executive director of the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, said the police guidance may well backfire.

“Now, the people are worried that the police are working with Immigration,” he said. “I don’t know anymore if they are protecting the feds or the community.”

The Light has confirmed that ICE has taken nearly 60 immigrants into custody in the New Bedford area since the start of the current presidential administration.

Thody has acknowledged that some members of the city’s Guatemalan community are fearful.

“My philosophy is still not to cooperate with them in their enforcement. I think it is important to know them and have a working relationship with them so that we can be present to help protect our residents,” Thody told a full room at the Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores event in July.

New Bedford is not the first or the only police department in Massachusetts to put guidance about ICE interactions in writing. Framingham issued guidance in 2017 and Natick in 2024. Most recently, Georgetown, a town of about 8,000 people in the North Shore, and Easthampton, in Hampshire County, issued their own documents in May and June respectively.

Peter Mancina, a cultural anthropologist and visiting scholar at Rutgers Law School, said local police can exercise discretion in how they cooperate with federal agents.

“There are legitimate public safety concerns and reasons” for police to respond to an operation, Mancina said.

“Nonetheless, it makes it easier for ICE to arrest the person,” he continued. “De-escalation makes people more safe, but it affords ICE a more efficient immigration event, and one that saves their face. They don’t have to look like the aggressors.”

Amy Grunder, director of state government affairs at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA), said she viewed the transparency around Thody’s guidance as a good thing on the whole.

“Some police departments, especially those in immigrant communities, have worked really hard to earn the trust of immigrant residents and are seeing that work undermined by aggressive ICE enforcement,” she said.

Nonetheless, Grunder does have questions about the Police Department’s guidance, particularly about the portions where it emphasizes protecting ICE agents.

“It is concerning, because it does kind of give credence to the idea that ICE agents are at risk from the public,” she said.

“It’s a needless addition that sends a bad message,” added Grunder, “especially given the well documented brutality of these enforcement actions against targeted immigrants and bystanders, including journalists.”

From Thody’s perspective, though, officers on the force will have some expectations and guidance they can refer to, which they didn’t before.

“The important takeaway is that the New Bedford Police Department is not taking a political position on this,” he said. “We don’t pick and choose who to keep safe.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2448.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:31.007885

Nothing that I could see would have attracted the attention of the agents, except for the fact that the men had brown skin. After questioning them, the agents let them go.

This scene is now unfolding across Chicago every day.

Federal immigration agents have been asking people about their legal status outside churches, homeless shelters, apartment buildings, parks and even a cemetery. Officers have questioned both U.S. citizens and legal residents, asking for passports and visas as proof of identity.

The presence of officers from Border Patrol and ICE has brought forth an intense backlash. Chicagoans are shouting at immigration agents, calling them fascists and Nazis, throwing objects at them and chasing their unmarked S.U.V.s or minivans, honking their horns to warn bystanders of ICE’s presence.

In response to what a Homeland Security official called “a surge in assaults,” the officers are using increasingly aggressive tactics. In recent days, they’ve hurled tear gas, pepper balls and smoke bombs at the public, protesters, journalists and even Chicago police officers, often without warning. Today’s newsletter is about the conflict on the streets of Chicago.

The intervention

The Trump administration began a crackdown on illegal immigration here five weeks ago, promising to help the city by arresting “criminal illegal aliens.” But the tactics are unusual.

Schools. Officers are lingering just off campus in some places. So principals have ordered “soft lockdowns,” keeping students in classrooms until the agents are gone. Last month, ICE tried to arrest a father after a day care drop-off; in the confrontation, he was shot and killed. Now some schools use neighborhood volunteers, at parents’ request, so white adults can walk Latino children home.

Restaurants. Kitchens are often staffed by undocumented immigrants, and ICE knows it. Workers are afraid to leave their homes, and many have cut their hours. One Mexican spot I like keeps its door locked — even when it’s open — as a shield against ICE, allowing customers in one at a time.

Public spaces. Many people, even those with legal status, are asking friends to do their grocery shopping for them. Streets are quieter. One man with legal residency got a $130 ticket for not having his papers, The Chicago Tribune reported.

Why here? It is not surprising to people here that the administration has focused on Chicago, which calls itself a sanctuary city. That means it doesn’t help the federal government deport undocumented immigrants. Half a million Chicagoans, nearly one-fifth of the population, were born outside the United States, and support for immigrants is generally strong in the area. Local police officers won’t ask suspects about their immigration status.

Trump and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, have an adversarial relationship, and Trump regularly criticizes Chicago’s Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson. The president wrote online that they “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” City and state leaders said they were receiving no communication from the Department of Homeland Security or the White House about the operations.

The fury over immigration enforcement has expanded in the last few days. After a car chase and crash involving agents, more than 100 people came out of their homes and shouted, “ICE go home.” At least one person threw eggs at the agents, hitting an agent directly in the head. (Trump ordered National Guard troops into Illinois over Pritzker’s objections, but a federal judge blocked their deployment last week.)

In response, federal officers released tear gas on the crowd, including 13 Chicago police officers who had been called to the scene. For weeks, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have dispersed people filming and shouting at them by shooting pepper balls and tear gas.

This is very different from norms of modern policing: Officers typically release chemical agents only in extreme situations, and only after warnings. Agents have pointed guns at people who get in their way.

On Wednesday, Pritzker complained that ICE was causing “mayhem” and warned that other cities would face the same fate. In the Oval Office yesterday, Trump named San Francisco. He said, “We’re just at the start. We’re going to go into other cities.”

ASSAD’S ENFORCERS

No dictator rules alone. For two decades, and amid a 13-year civil war that left half a million people dead, the Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad relied on a network of henchmen to support his rule, writes Christiaan Triebert, a reporter on our Visual Investigations team.

These men tortured civilians. They built and used chemical weapons. They ran drugs that helped fund the government. They ordered the bombing of hospitals. And when the regime fell in December 2024, many of them simply vanished. My colleagues and I set out to uncover evidence of their alleged crimes and find out where they might be now — in Russia, for instance, or plotting revenge from Lebanon.

We chased down fragments of information — a photo of a lavish Damascus home posted to a neighborhood Facebook page, the name of a small village mentioned in a sanctions document, a phone number with a Russian country code discreetly shared with reporters — and added the normal journalistic legwork of reading legal filings, knocking on doors, calling people’s friends, family and co-workers.

This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education…opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

The term “287(g)” refers specifically to section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The law created a mechanism to facilitate collaboration between federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and local police.

These agreements allow state and local authorities to assume federal immigration control functions and were once rare—as of 2016, at the end of the Barack Obama administration, only 32 law enforcement agencies had active agreements. Today, more than 1,000 state and local agencies have signed on.

Some campus police departments are now also participating in the 287(g) program. This expansion of immigration enforcement into higher education through local law enforcement, although still limited, opens a new chapter in the debate about universities’ responsibility to protect their students.

Campus Police in Florida Join ICE Program

Implementation of section 287(g) requires a memorandum of understanding between ICE and the interested agency, which must agree to training, federal oversight, and specific protocols.

A 287(g) agreement deputizes local agents to verify the immigration status of detained individuals, issue administrative detentions, and assist in deportation proceedings.

Immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies.

There are different models of application, including the Jail Enforcement Model, which operates within detention centers, and the Task Force Model, which enables local police to undertake specified ICE functions. Both have raised civil rights concerns due to their potential to encourage racial profiling and the criminalization of immigrant communities.

According to available information, Miami-based Florida International University’s campus police department applied to join the 287(g) program in April 2025 and executed an agreement on July 2. As of July 12, 13 universities in Florida have done the same, including the state’s flagship university, the University of Florida in Gainesville.

Mounting Internal Campus Resistance

Given the risk of surveillance on campus, exacerbated by 287(g) agreements, immigrant rights organizations and sectors of the university community are coordinating collective protection strategies in response.

“Right now, our anti-ICE efforts are pretty new,” said Kassandra Toussaint of Florida International University (FIU), when asked how students and the community have sought to raise awareness about the immigration enforcement role university police would play.

Toussaint, a political science undergraduate student and grassroots organizer at FIU, told NPQ, “Currently, we’re working with the ACLU of Florida for students to get training on being legal observers.”

The purpose of this ACLU-supported training is to ensure that students are equipped to legally observe and document an incident if they see someone being detained by ICE or campus police. Ideally, they can also help facilitate communication between the person being detained and their family.

Toussaint also noted that organizer training sessions are being offered to help students develop practical skills that effectively raise awareness about ICE and the impact of immigration enforcement on campus.

In September, FIU students and faculty gathered in front of the Graham Center, where the university’s President’s Council was meeting, to demand that the agreement not be implemented.

Similar demonstrations took place at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. Students argued that the agreement transforms their campus into an environment of surveillance and suppression. Signs with phrases such as “No one should be afraid to learn” accompanied the protests, which were covered by media outlets such as Univision and Telemundo.

Faculty members have also expressed strong opposition to the implementation of these agreements, warning that they will erode trust in campus police and expose students to racial profiling. Immigration advocacy groups and legal experts, such as the ACLU of Florida, concur.

One effect of 287(g) agreements, the ACLU of Florida notes, is to discourage people from reporting crimes, as immigrant victims avoid contacting police out of fear that their immigration status might be questioned or revoked. Even legal residents and people holding valid international student visas still face the very real risk of arrest or deportation.

Tania Cepero López, an associate professor in the FIU English Department and president of the faculty union, told NPQ that building bridges with campus police and leaders to discourage cooperation with ICE can be valuable, even if authorities are initially resistant.

“We have made every effort to maintain consistent communication and collaboration with our chief of police, our students, and our faculty,” she said.

At a public rally in September, Cepero López told the student newspaper Panther NOW, “[The agreement is] creating safety issues on campus that are completely unnecessary. What we’re asking the FIU Police to do is withdraw from the ICE 287(g) agreement, and that the FIU Police does the work of FIU Police, and ICE agents can do the work of ICE agents—there’s no need to conflate the two.”

Thomas Kennedy, an Argentine immigrant graduate student at FIU and spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, emphasized that the agreements are voluntary, telling NPQ that Florida universities are free not to sign them.

“State law is actually quite clear—it only requires counties that operate jails or detention centers, like Miami-Dade or Broward, to sign this type of agreement. Other institutions, such as cities or universities, are not obliged to do so,” Kennedy explained.

An Opportunity Missed

Organizations such as the ACLU, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), and United We Dream have long documented the impacts of 287(g) agreements on immigrant communities and have publicly denounced the program’s contribution to racial profiling, the detention of people without criminal records, and the erosion of trust between residents and local authorities.

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice.

In June 2023, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 100 organizations—including the ACLU, NILC, and United We Dream—wrote a joint letter to then–Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, calling for all 287(g) agreements to be revoked. The letter noted that “the history of the program is riddled with unlawful forms of racial profiling and stereotyping.”

A year before that, in 2022, the ACLU published a report titled License to Abuse, detailing how the 287(g) program had empowered sheriffs with histories of racism and civil rights violations, becoming a tool for immigration persecution that undermined racial justice and community safety. The report noted that the ACLU had sought to end the 287(g) program for more than a decade due to “the racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and erosion of community trust that it spawned.”

Unfortunately, the Biden administration didn’t heed this call. Since Donald Trump’s inauguration as president in January 2025, the number of agencies participating in 287(g) agreements has increased sixfold.

The Struggle Continues

Educational exclusion based on immigration status violates fundamental principles of equality and justice, but it also affects the quality of education.

As Cepero López emphasized, maintaining academic standards requires that students be safe on campus, free from fears tied to immigration status or documentation.

“We’re trying to communicate to our university that, in order to remain on a path of academic excellence, we must adopt policies that support our international students,” she said. “Policies that allow us to engage with the global community and maintain a safe learning environment.”",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Florida_University_ICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:03.153022

PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.","In Chicago’s Little Village, the Trump administration’s sweeping deportation push has paralyzed the economy.

Business owners in Little Village, which is 81% Hispanic, said customers are too frightened to walk the streets of Chicago’s second busiest commercial corridor. Sales have plunged, employees are staying home, and stores have temporarily closed since the administration’s deportation push in Chicago began on September 8. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in the Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The economic fallout from deportations is typically focused on the impact to industries with large unauthorized immigrant workforces, such as construction and agriculture. But undocumented immigrants aren’t just people who simply go to work each day. They’re consumers, too. They spent roughly $300 billion in 2023, buying goods and services that power the economy.

“It’s killing business,” said Mike Moreno, the owner of Moreno’s liquor store and speakeasy bar. His father opened the store in Little Village in the 1970s, and it was the first Latino-owned liquor store in Illinois.

He said sales have dropped 60% since September. Local residents and longtime business owners alike have been traumatized by immigration agents roaming around the neighborhood, Moreno said, arresting both unauthorized immigrants and US citizens.

“They’re going up and down the streets around in loops to scare us,” he said. “I never thought in a million years I’d see something like this.”

Marcela Rodriguez, a franchise operator of Los Mangos, a small Mexican-style ice cream chain, said “people are not stepping outside. Kids are not going to school. It’s unbelievable.”

Her business “just completely went downhill” beginning in September, and several fearful employees changed their schedules to prepare food when the store is locked and closed to customers.

Ice cream sales now correlate with how visible immigration agents are in the neighborhood, she said.

“On quiet days with not a lot of detainments, we see an uptick in customers.”

‘Economic lifeline’

The Trump administration said last month it’s on track to deport 600,000 unauthorized immigrants this year.

But that push is hurting businesses and local economies that rely on immigrants, both legal and undocumented, who buy everything from food to cars to homes.

A record 14 million unauthorized immigrants, roughly 5.6% of total households, lived in the United States in 2023. Twenty-six million people live in a household with at least one person who lacks legal status.

Not only does this group spend hundreds of billions annually, they also paid more than $90 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2024, helping fund social services and programs like Social Security. Sales, property, business and other taxes they paid help prop up municipal and state budgets.

That’s why a slowdown in Little Village threatens to have a spillover effect on Chicago. The city may see lower tax revenues from retail sales, as well as store closures, reduced orders along the supply chain, and a hit to the real estate market, said Teresa Córdova, the director of the Great Cities Institute at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Little Village became a landing spot for Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. They helped stabilize the neighborhood, which had emptied out as Chicago lost manufacturing jobs and people left for the suburbs.

“Were it not for Latinos in Chicago, we would not be able to revitalize like we did,” Córdova said.

A similar story of immigrants reviving areas in decline played out in many northern industrial cities during the mid-twentieth century and later in the South, said A. K. Sandoval-Strausz, a history professor at Penn State University and author of the book “Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City.”

“The influx of immigrants to these neighborhoods has been an economic lifeline,” he said.

But White House spokesperson Kush Desai called looking at how much unauthorized immigrants spend and pay in taxes in isolation an “idiotic exercise” because “the costs that Americans pay due to illegal immigration are incalculable: crime, strained healthcare systems, inflated real estate costs, and schools being overburdened with costly ESL students.”

The White House pointed to research from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration levels, that said American taxpayers spend at least $182 billion annually to cover costs for unauthorized immigrants.

Mazola corn oil and subprime car loans

Immigrants and families unsure of their future in the United States are sending more money to their home countries — remittances to many Latin American countries are seeing double-digit increases — and they’re tightening their wallets.

TD Bank estimated that undocumented workers who are spending less will subtract 0.7 percentage points from consumer spending growth this year.

When Tricolor, a subprime auto lender primarily for unauthorized immigrants in the Southwest, filed for bankruptcy last month, analysts said it was a sign of the pressure on the economy catering to undocumented immigrants.

Major food brands and retailers are also noticing an impact.

PepsiCo, Constellation Brands, Mondelez, Wingstop and Ross said Hispanic customers are spending less, particularly at stores concentrated in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods.

Sales of Mazola corn oil have dropped among Hispanic consumers in the South, parent company Associated British Foods said last month on an earnings call.

“We have a very large share of Hispanic consumers in Mazola, and there’s a lot of fear in that community,” CEO George Weston said. “We really hope that that’s temporary for all sorts of reasons.”

But the administration is ramping up its detention capabilities to reach its goal of one million deportations a year, and Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act triples the budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The further the Trump administration goes, the larger the blow will be to consumer spending, employment and taxes that boost cities and states, said Eric Rodriguez, the senior vice president of policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, a Hispanic civil rights group. Mass deportations have been found to reduce employment and wages for native-born citizens, too.

“There’s no sign that what we’re seeing right now is going to stop or de-escalate,” he said. “As the government builds up mass deportations, the economic effects will be greater.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2233925342.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 12:03:13.309876

CHICAGO — If there is one thing to draw hope from amid the descent of federal agents into Chicago over the past month, it’s how Chicagoans far and wide are showing up in support of one another.

Across the city, neighbors are stepping up to help kids get to school safely, picking up groceries for families who fear leaving their homes and raising money to support street vendors and others whose livelihoods have been threatened by the swarm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement patrols.

While it remains unknown how long the increased ICE presence will last — Russell Hott, ICE’s field director in Chicago, told Block Club last week that there was no planned end date — the effect of people showing up for one another will continue to reverberate for just as long, neighbors and organizers said.

Here are a few ways neighbors are supporting their communities — and how you can help, too.

Blowing The Whistle

Residents are equipping themselves with whistles by the thousands, readying neighbors to alert one another if they see ICE agents nearby.

The Little Village Community Council began handing out bright orange whistles during “know your rights” workshops in June, after getting the idea from Los Angeles residents who were reacting to their own city’s immigration raids earlier this year.

“We had the idea of coming out with a whistle so people could hear that noise, and if they don’t have legal status, go the other way — run as quickly as possible to safety and to make sure they don’t open their doors,” said Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council.

Since then, the idea has spread to other neighborhoods as well; Ravenswood Community Services gathered volunteers Monday evening to assemble 600 whistle kits to pass out to parents and students. Pilsen Arts & Community House has a tutorial how to publish and distribute its one-page whistle zine, which is available along with other printable resources online, and has been handing out whistle kits to local businesses to distribute.

Belmont Cragin United distributed 5,000 whistles at a recent event and is looking to hand out more than 12,000 by the end of October, said organizer Alonso Zaragoza. The organization recently launched Whistlemania, where volunteers assemble and distribute whistle kits across multiple Northwest Side neighborhoods. Each packet includes information on recognizing federal agents and advice from the ACLU, as well as a whistle to alert others in emergencies or during ICE encounters.

Street Vendor Support

The familiar jingle of bells from a paletas cart or a roadside offering of produce have become rarer as Chicago street vendors stay home to protect themselves from ICE.

Vendors around Chicago — from Laura Murillo of Laura’s Tamales to a tamalera in Rogers Park — have been arrested by immigration agents over the past month. In late September, neighbors and organizers pledged they would keep Murillo’s Back of the Yards stand going to support her daughters.

In a matter of weeks, the Street Vendors Association of Chicago has raised $184,000 of its $300,000 goal to provide emergency support to street vendors who are too fearful of ICE raids to go out and sell their wares.

Through her nonprofit organization The Mural Movement, Delilah Martinez launched Operation Buyout, where she and other organizers are “buying out” a vendor’s supply — giving them $500 to $1,000 along with groceries and other necessities. Since July, Operation Buyout has supported Matello’s Bakery in Pilsen, a neighborhood paleta seller, and a woman who sells chocolate in Pilsen.

How you can help: Donate to the Chicago Street Vendor Relief Fund (donations to the nonprofit organization are tax deductible); grab your bike and join CyclingxSolidarity for the Saturday’s Street Vendor Bike Tour in Little Village; attend the Kafecito with Kathy fundraiser Sunday at Latina-owned Tasa Coffee Roasters, 4136 W. North Ave. in Humboldt Park; Donate to Operation Buyout on Venmo (@TheMuralMovement), CashApp ($VaultGallerie) or Zelle or QuickPay (delilah@themuralmovement.org).

Grocery Runs

Monica Gutierrez has called Pilsen home for the majority of her life, but she’s never seen the streets of her neighborhood this empty. It’s disheartening to see the fear, violence and disrespect her community is facing, said Gutierrez, who was raised in an immigrant household.

“ICE is everywhere and doesn’t even allow us a second to breathe or to get where we need,” she said.

When Gutierrez came across Sin Título’s Neighbor to Neighbor program a few weeks ago, she jumped at the opportunity. As a volunteer, Gutierrez goes on grocery runs for community members who are afraid to leave their homes to get the basic necessities.

Sin Título co-founder Iraís Sosa started the program in hopes of creating “more moments of peace” amid the chaos.

But Sosa didn’t anticipate that 100 people would sign up within the first couple hours of opening the volunteer application. Now almost 400 people have applied, Sosa said. It was a “good problem” to have and she quickly figured out a system. The program has been capped at 200 volunteers across the Chicago area to keep it manageable.

After seeing a raid at a bus stop, Sosa also started offering Lyft gift cards for those who don’t feel safe commuting using public transportation.

Applications to receive help or nominate a loved one are still open and available in English and Spanish, Sosa said. Recipients are paired up with a volunteer and can get groceries on a recurring basis as long as funds are available. They have measures in place to ensure privacy, like confirming addresses verbally over the phone as opposed to text or email, she said.

How you can help: While Sin Título isn’t taking more volunteers right now, it is still accepting donations. They’ve raised more than $11,000 since launching the program to cover the cost of groceries and Lyft gift cards.

Cleansing Charity

Cristina Puzio is a curandera — a folk healer — born and raised in Pilsen. After seeing news of Funston Elementary being tear-gassed by federal agents in Logan Square in early October, she felt a need to do something that would honor her community and her culture.

Inheriting practices that were passed down to her from ancestors and mentors, she reached out to Evelyn Medina, owner of the Logan Square gift shop Espacio 3628, to offer “limpias” to the community.

As Puzio puts it, a limpia is a way of cleansing a person’s energy. By removing a person’s negative energies, she hopes to help them let go of burdens they carry.

“Whatever we’re carrying, whether it’s an emotion, a fear, worry,” she said. “If we don’t know how to process it, it can linger, and it can start to affect us on a deeper level.”

The specific limpia she offers is for those living with shock and fear — particularly resonant during the heightened ICE activity. Incorporating obsidian, epazote, basil, Copal, lemons and sacred waters, the ritual lasts for 10 minutes.

Cristina will continue to collaborate with Espacio 3628 and provide limpias to Logan Square residents and surrounding communities — the next event is set for Tuesday.

How you can help: Attend the next limpias fundraiser at the Logan Square shop, 3628 W. Armitage Ave., from 2:30-6 p.m. Tuesday. Espacio 3628 is also accepting donations to continue handing out whistles and Know Your Rights cards, and organizing watch patrols during neighborhood school drop-offs and pickups.

School Safety

In Belmont Cragin, school attendance has dropped by as much as 10 percent as families worry that ICE agents will show up during drop-off and pickup, said Alonso Zaragoza, who serves on a Local School Council along with his work with Belmont Cragin United.

A new “walking school bus” program aims to provide a sense of security for families as they go to and from school, Zaragoza said. Seven or eight volunteers will position themselves along school routes, mirroring Safe Passage routes established by Chicago Public Schools. Similar corner watches have launched in Irving Park and Albany Park on the Northwest Side, as well.

“It’s about having bodies out around the school, keeping an eye out and making sure everybody’s safe,” Zaragoza said. “So that the kids who haven’t been going to school in the last couple weeks feel comfortable enough to come back and finish their education.”

After early challenges, the community-led effort is gaining traction as educators and parents work together. “Now the pieces of organizing are starting to fall into place,” Zaragoza said. “Everybody’s clicking together.”

To maintain a sense of community and safety, Belmont Cragin United is continuing with events like its seventh annual “Trunk or Treat,” while also training neighbors through the Rapid Response Network to verify reports of ICE presence. He said the effort is about accuracy and care, as the group doesn’t publish anything unverified and works to keep neighbors informed.

He emphasized that all of this work is entirely community-led. “There’s no taxpayer money being involved in this. No elected official has offered to pay for this,” he said. “People need to be informed.”

How you can help: Volunteer with the Belmont Cragin United Rapid Response Network to help verify ICE activity and distribute know your rights materials; donate safety whistles, candy, or printing materials for the upcoming Trunk or Treat community event.

Turning Art Into Action

As reports of ICE raids began spreading through Chicago’s Latino neighborhoods, photographer Mari Trancoso said she felt a growing urgency to help.

“I just keep feeling this burn in my chest,” she said. “Like this angry cry wants to come out, and I just feel like I’m not doing what I need to do.”

Trancoso lives about 1½ hours west of Chicago in Dixon, but she has been photographing weddings and families across Chicago for nearly a decade.

Using her photography business and online following, she created a fundraising campaign called Art as an Offering. Proceeds from mentoring sessions, photo editing customizations known as presets and educational PDFs were given to five Chicago organizations: Instituto del Progreso Latino, ICIRR, Pilsen Food Pantry, Street Vendors Association of Chicago, and Sin Título.

“I wanted to offer something reachable for other people, not just photographers,” she said. Lower-priced resources, starting at $15, were designed to make donating accessible, and clients booking future photo sessions with Trancoso can also opt to have part of their payment directed toward the groups.

Though she has mostly used her platform for awareness in the past, this effort feels more personal — and more urgent — than before. “My family is from Mexico — my grandma is from Zacatecas, and I have cousins who are not white-passing, and are in fear,” she said. “I felt like I had this privilege that I could do more things since I don’t have that same fear as they do.”

For others who want to help, Trancoso encourages using social media to share verified information or volunteering for organizations already embedded in neighborhoods. She cited Sin Titulo as an example, noting that “even simple things like running errands for Latino families who are too scared to go out in public are very valuable.”

Wallet Warriors

Pilsen streets have been emptier than usual, and Becky Lehmann took note during a recent visit to the neighborhood. At times, she was the only customer at some of the businesses she stepped in, she said.

Lehmann, who lives in Edgewater, wanted to help, so she posted an Instagram video calling on people to support the businesses in Hispanic neighborhoods still reeling from the increased ICE presence.

“When I boil it all down, it’s just what I can do to be kind,” she said.

In the video, Lehmann encourages people to pick a neighborhood that they know is being targeted and go and contribute to the local businesses that are hurting. If they see something happening, they can record and share.

She frames it as something anyone can do. “Resistance doesn’t have to be big and noisy,” she says in the video. “It can be walking into a shop and buying a cat figurine from a neighbor.”

Others have also made the call for Chicagoans to support immigrant-owned businesses. The Hermosa Belmont Cragin Chamber of Commerce shared a list of neighborhood businesses to support. Lost Girls Vintage put out a call for commenters to share their favorite South and West side businesses. Zaragoza said Belmont Cragin has been slowly recovering from the pandemic, rebuilding its business community. But the ICE raids have caused renewed fear and kept many from dining out or even leaving their homes, he said.

“The dining scene in our neighborhoods has been decimated because of it,” he said. The neighborhood will host a Taste of Belmont Cragin event Oct. 28, with a route through four restaurants and participating street vendors.

How you can help: Many neighborhoods have chambers of commerce listing local businesses to help you plan your visit. You can also sign up by Oct. 24 to participate in the Nov. 8 Abuelita Hot Chocolate 5K Walk/Run in Riis Park in Belmont Cragin on Nov. 8 — money raised will go toward neighborhood businesses.

Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside court has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July. Representatives said they’ve seen U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed a petition this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations. It also has drawn lawsuits from some states and the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Asked about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done, because what’s happening with these ICE agents and courthouses and territories around courthouses is unacceptable,” Welch said. “People are afraid to go to court. They’re afraid to comply with subpoenas. We can’t allow that. These should be safe spaces.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed street chase on Chicago’s South Side.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events citywide and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three detained recently.",https://minnlawyer.com/files/2024/09/generic-legal-image-gavel-and-books-dark-brown.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 16:03:57.483053

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.","A 39-year-old man died in hospital alone, miles from his family, after being detained by US immigration officials.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, who had lived in the US since he was four, fell ill while in an immigration detention centre in California.

He complained of a fever and had a persistent cough in the weeks before he died, according to his mother Lucia.

She said he was initially treated by medical staff inside the detention centre but was returned to his cell.

He was eventually taken to hospital for a scheduled surgery to remove an abscess on his buttocks, but died before he was able to have the operation.

His family were never told he was in hospital, learning of his death via a knock on the door from police.

""They're the ones that notified us that he had passed,"" his brother, Jose Ayala, told Sky News.

""We were not even aware that he was in the hospital or even had a scheduled surgery. Then we got a knock on our door a little after 5.30 one morning.

""I believe he would still be alive today if he was never detained. He got sick while in detention, and they did not seem to take care of him.""

Why was he detained?

Mr Ayala-Uribe's death raises questions about the conditions inside the centre he was held in, and if a sudden surge of immigrants being detained by this administration has left the system stretched beyond breaking point.

He had moved to the US from Mexico with his family as a child.

He did have DACA - deferred action for childhood arrivals - status, granted to those who have arrived while under the age of 18. But this was removed in 2016, after he was convicted of drink-driving.

In August, he was arrested by immigration agents at a car wash in California where he had worked for 15 years.

He was held for five weeks at Adelanto, a privately owned, run-for-profit, immigrant detention centre. A lawyer for his family said he was, as far as they are aware, a healthy man before he was detained and had no medical need.

But Mr Ayala-Uribe's mother, who was visiting him every eight days and speaking to him on the phone a couple of times a day, said she noticed him getting progressively unwell.

""He started with lots of fever,"" Ms Ayala said. ""He said they weren't listening to him. The last time I saw him his face was drained, he told me he was not OK, he told me he couldn't take it any more.""

Beginning to cry, wiping away tears, she added: ""I feel powerless that I couldn't do anything to help my son.

""I never imagined I was going to bury one of my sons. It feels terrible, they took a piece of my heart away.

""I would like something to change. If we cannot save him, at least we can save others that are still inside.""

ICE defends detention treatment

The cause of Mr Ayala-Uribe's death is still under investigation.

Sky News requested comment from the company which owns the detention centre where he was held, and they deferred to ICE, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency.

In a statement, ICE said: ""Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.

""At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergency care.""

The Trump administration says it's targeting criminals and people in the US illegally. But campaigners say Mr Ayala-Uribe's death should not be viewed in isolation.

Since Donald Trump took office, at least 15 people have died in immigration detention.

Democrat senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote a letter to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, asking for more information about these deaths.

The senators claimed 10 people had died between January and June, and that it was the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

Sarah Houston, a lawyer for the Immigrant Defenders Law Centre, claims immigrants are being mistreated in custody.

""This administration's main goal is to harm, to torture individuals and to try to force them out,"" she said.

""The great increase we see in human rights abuses, in deaths, is a direct result of the administration's decision to pack these detention centres as much as they can.""

Mr Ayala-Uribe's funeral was held this week. Dozens of extended family and friends wore t-shirts bearing his face. A mariachi band played as his casket was lowered into the ground and his mother heaved with sobs.

Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, this week demanded an investigation into Noem’s use of public resources to create and promote a partisan video.","Since Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has embraced camera-ready tactics and performative politics to an almost cartoonish degree, few were surprised when she started airing taxpayer-financed ads earlier this year, starring the South Dakota Republican and thanking Donald Trump for his administration’s anti-immigration crackdown.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a sequel of sorts: The new video — also paid for with American tax dollars and also featuring Noem in a starring role — was designed to run in domestic airports. But instead of focusing on immigration, this clip blames congressional Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown.

Almost immediately, the DHS secretary confronted a problem she should’ve seen coming: Airport administrators said they wouldn’t show Noem’s partisan video to air travelers. The list of airports refusing to go along with the Republican’s plan continues to grow. The Associated Press reported:

Airports big and small around the country are refusing to play a video with a message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on Transportation Security Administration operations. Airports in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Phoenix, Seattle and more say the video’s political content goes against their policies or regulations prohibiting political messaging in their facilities.

In fact, there are dozens of airports of various sizes in the state of New York, and according to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, Noem’s video has been “banned” from all of them.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, this week demanded an investigation into Noem’s use of public resources to create and promote a partisan video.

In a letter to acting special counsel Jamieson Greer, Cantwell wrote, “When viewed in its totality, Secretary Noem’s video can only be reasonably interpreted as a partisan message intended to misleadingly malign the Trump Administration’s political opponents, convince Americans to blame ‘Democrats in Congress’ for the ongoing government shutdown, and influence their future votes — all while omitting the fact that Republicans currently control the White House, U.S. Senate, and U.S. House of Representatives.”

It’s easy to imagine a hypothetical video in which a homeland security secretary offers the public worthwhile information about how the shutdown might affect air travelers. That sort of message might actually help the public at a difficult time.

But Noem apparently didn’t want that. Rather, she used taxpayer money to make what amounts to a propagandistic attack ad — that a growing number of airports are rejecting anyway.

The Office of Special Counsel, which is an independent watchdog agency responsible for investigating ethical lapses like these, has not yet said whether it will examine the DHS video.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

WASHINGTON — United We Dream (UWD), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Abundant Futures Fund (AFF), have joined forces to launch the Defending Our Neighbors Fund: a bold new initiative that will scale up crucial financial support to legal organizations all across the country. Housed within AFF, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund will help ensure immigrant families facing the threat of separation and wrongful detention and deportations have access to lawyers.

Already, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has raised over $10 million with the goal of raising a total of at least $30 million in emergency response funding. With more than 11 million U.S. citizens living in households with an undocumented family member, countless American families face imminent risk of being torn apart. Many are forced to navigate a complex and punishing system alone, without access to legal counsel. Even young children, the most vulnerable members of our communities, are facing trained prosecutors without anyone by their side. Access to legal support is a vital lifeline for families facing the threat of being separated from their loved ones.

By surging much-needed financial support to trusted organizations already providing legal assistance to communities in need, the Defending Our Neighbors Fund helps protect everyone’s right to due process, ensure families can stay together, and increase access to high-quality legal representation and, when possible, bond assistance.

Greisa Martinez Rosas, Executive Director of United We Dream, said:

“When I was 17, my father was deported and my family separated forever. That loss isn’t just personal — it is systemic and intentional, with thousands of people rendered vulnerable to mass deportation and family separation with zero access to the legal representation they deserve. I’ve spent every day since organizing and building our community’s collective power so we can protect the future of millions of American families that, just like my own, face the threat of separation.

""The Defending Our Neighbors Fund is about more than fighting for legal representation — it’s a vehicle for everyday people to move from empathy to action, from charity to solidarity in defense of their immigrant neighbors. This Fund is an opportunity for neighbors to stand with neighbors in fighting for a democracy that protects all of us.

""Together, we must invest in the infrastructure of justice - collective power, collective care and legal support. We invite everyone — philanthropists, organizers, and all our neighbors— to build with us. Donate to the Defend our Neighbors Fund.”

Anthony D. Romero, Executive Director of the ACLU, said:

“Deportations without due process, unjust detention, and family separation are attacks on bedrock Constitutional rights and all of our communities. The current moment calls for bold, innovative solutions to meet the most urgent needs of our immigrant neighbors and loved ones, and the Defending Our Neighbors Fund is doing just that. The Fund is the antidote to these harmful attacks, and now more than ever, we, the people, must take action to fight back.”

Chiqui Sanchez Kennedy, Executive Director of the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project (GHIRP), said:

“In March, we faced a comprehensive attack on immigrant children when legal lifelines were eliminated. In a single week, the government abruptly shut down funding for lawyers for unaccompanied children and placed children on “rocket dockets” where toddlers to pre-teens were forced to appear alone in court on an unprecedented, expedited timeline. With no notice, we were forced to halt representation for hundreds of children who depend on our advocacy. We were faced with the impossible choice of continuing to represent our clients without funding or abruptly withdrawing representation, leaving our clients vulnerable to further harm, exploitation and trafficking. Funding from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund was a lifeline for our clients, our staff, and the organization. It enabled us to find a path forward which included meeting the needs of our young clients and upholding our ethical duties as lawyers.”

Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Américas Immigrant Advocacy Center:

“As hostility towards immigration groups continues, Las Américas lost major funding and faced difficult layoffs. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund arrived at a critical moment. It helped us avoid deeper cuts, keep experienced staff on board, and respond quickly to urgent cases, including access to people detailed at new sites like Camp East Montana at Ft. Bliss.

""This funding came at a moment when everything felt uncertain. It meant we could keep showing up for people in detention, for families navigating impossible systems, and for a community that depends on us. In this environment, staying open isn’t guaranteed. Support like this lets us keep the doors open when our community needs us most.”

Mary Meg McCarthy, Executive Director of the National Immigrant Justice Center:

""The National Immigrant Justice Center has fought to continue providing life-saving legal services since this year's termination of federal programs that reached some of the most vulnerable people in the immigration system, including children who came to the United States alone to seek refuge. Support from the Defending Our Neighbors Fund has been critical to ensure NIJC can still provide counsel for immigrants who face a growing threat of being disappeared into the detention system and removed from the country without due process. In this midst of widespread family separations, the need for new funding streams for legal services is more urgent than ever.""

During the 2024 campaign, Kelly, other top generals who worked for Trump and other former aides issued a series of stark warnings.","Since Donald Trump first became president in 2017, I have written many articles — and even a book — that focused on the efforts by his aides to contain his impulses and stop him from waging a retribution campaign against his enemies.

Throughout my reporting, I — like many journalists in the midst of an intense and complex story — wondered: Was I accurately capturing the facts? I knew that the people around Trump often justified working in his administration by saying they would serve as guardrails against his most extreme impulses, but how could I know for sure that these checks on his power were actually the force holding him back?

I had those doubts because we, as reporters, very rarely get to see the counterfactual, to test our reporting by witnessing how the world would play out if the circumstances were different.

But Trump’s second term has given us that unique opportunity.

The people who sought to restrain the president back then, like his former chief of staff John Kelly and his White House counsel Donald McGahn II, are gone, and so are the hypotheticals. We are now seeing how a truly unshackled Trump uses his power.

Nine months into Trump’s second term, he has done several things he was stopped from doing during his first term. He has exerted more direct pressure on the Justice Department to bring charges, apparently spurring prosecutors to secure an indictment against at least one target who eluded him during his first term. And he has greatly expanded presidential powers, including by deploying the military on domestic soil in more sweeping ways than he did during his first term.

In tonight’s newsletter, I’ll explain what Trump’s second term has taught us about his first: The guardrails worked, up to a point. (See: Jan 6.)

And many of the stark warnings about what would happen without them — which were issued loudly during the presidential campaign by the very people who had once sought to restrain the president — have proved true.

An eye on the Justice Department

As early as 2017, Trump tried to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prosecute his rivals, like Hillary Clinton. But Sessions and top administration aides managed to distract Trump for months. Sessions held onto his job for nearly two years, and no charges were brought against Clinton.

At the time, Trump himself was under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller III for obstructing the F.B.I.’s inquiry into his campaign’s ties to Russia. Trump complained endlessly about why his own Justice Department was investigating him, casting a cloud over his presidency, without looking into his perceived enemies.

As the pressure built on Trump, he became more fixated on the idea of not only prosecuting his rivals, including the former F.B.I. director James Comey, but siccing the I.R.S. on them.

Repeatedly, Kelly and McGahn managed to stop Trump. They refused to order the Justice Department to investigate his rivals, telling him that what he wanted to do was potentially illegal. McGahn even wrote Trump an extraordinary memo in which he warned him that he could be defeated at the ballot box — or impeached — if he tried to meddle in prosecutions.

The Justice Department’s prosecutorial decisions remained insulated from the president. While many of his perceived enemies came under investigation, none were ever charged. This left Trump angry, convinced that his aides and political appointees had wrongly constrained him.

Trump’s allies pledged that if he ever returned to the White House, he would not have guardrails like Kelly around to try to stop him.

During the 2024 campaign, Kelly, other top generals who worked for Trump and other former aides issued a series of stark warnings. They said that not only would Trump follow through on prosecuting his rivals but he would use the military domestically on Americans. And, they said, Trump would use his power in audacious and potentially illegal ways to achieve his political goals and erode the independence of bedrock institutions of American democracy.

Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, echoed those warnings on the campaign trail.

Republicans pooh-poohed the warnings, saying that the former officials were just castoffs suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.

An expansion of power

Since returning to office, Trump has largely done exactly what Kelly and the former aides warned he would. He has engaged in an aggressive retribution campaign. He has pierced the Justice Department’s prosecutorial decision-making process by publicly and privately telling Attorney General Pam Bondi — including in an apparently accidentally sent private message on Truth Social — whom to charge, including Comey.

Bondi’s department charged Comey five days later, shortly after pushing out a prosecutor who had raised concerns about a potential case against Comey. An indictment against the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, a Democrat who sued Trump for fraud, followed soon after.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to several American cities run by Democratic mayors over their objections. He has dismantled large parts of the federal bureaucracy and work force, challenging Congress’s control over spending. And his administration’s responses to some high-profile court rulings related to immigration issues have raised questions about whether they are following judges’ orders.

For this piece, I reached out to Kelly to see if he would talk about how his warnings lined up with the way Trump has governed. But Kelly declined to comment. Since Trump won, he has said little publicly, believing he already warned the country and there is nothing left for him to say.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.
Last month, investigators said a shooter targeted ICE officers at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and injuring another.
Johnson said he’s concerned the impact will undercut the legitimacy and authority of local and state agencies long after federal agents leave communities.
For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust.","A masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent grabbed Monica Moreta-Galarza’s hair as she clung to her husband, pleading with the agents who were detaining him. She was wrestled away from him as her crying children were held back by other agents.

Moreta-Galarza was taken to a nearby room for an unknown period before she was seen in videos captured by onlookers in the hallway of an immigration courthouse in Manhattan in late September, telling a different federal agent in Spanish: “You guys don’t care about anything!”

The agent, wearing a flannel shirt and baseball cap, replies, “Adios, adios,” as he grabs the mother and forces her several feet down the hallway, shoving her into the wall before pushing her to the ground.

Moreta-Galarza was rushed to the hospital for possible head trauma.

Her experience is a snapshot of an array of incidents nationwide caught on camera by bystanders, revealing heavy-handed tactics by federal agents since President Donald Trump took office in January, experts told CNN. Videos over the months have shown ICE agents wearing face coverings and plainclothes, driving unmarked cars and swarming worksites and streets during their deportation operations. Tensions flared again in Chicago this week when an immigration operation resulted in a crash, bringing anger from residents and tear gas.

Many of the incidents in this story, including Moreta-Galarza’s, have been reported by CNN and authorities confirmed ICE agents were involved, with eyewitness videos showing the sometimes violent nature of the arrests.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to CNN federal agents are facing “smearing” by claims the agency is using “harsher approaches,” and said they “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law.”

Echoing past statements DHS has made after many of the incidents, the agency said it is targeting arrests of the “worst of the worst” and agents are facing a surge in attacks against them. Last month, investigators said a shooter targeted ICE officers at an ICE field office in Dallas, killing two detainees and injuring another.

ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.

Pressures to meet deportation goals are fueling aggressive tactics, experts say

Former Homeland Security officials and immigration experts argue the aggressive tactics are a result of the immense pressure on immigration agents to ramp up arrests of undocumented immigrants as the administration tries to meet its deportation goals. Historically, the agencies charged with those arrests, like ICE, have been strained, making White House-imposed goals more difficult to meet. The administration says it’s a whole government effort.

Officers from other federal agencies, such as the FBI and CBP, the agency responsible for border security, have also been pulled into immigration enforcement efforts, flooding the streets of blue cities such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC and Chicago.

Law enforcement sources told CNN the increasingly aggressive tactics they’ve observed from immigration agents in recent months have led to confrontations between DHS and agents from other federal agencies working on joint task forces.

John Sandweg, former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, said the tactics are not aimed at fighting criminality – they’re designed to increase overall arrests.

“You don’t arrest people in immigration court … who are on stays of removal unless you’re looking for cheap, fast and easy arrests,” said Sandweg, who remains in contact with current ICE and DHS personnel.

In cases like Moreta-Galarza’s, a good agent can still carry out their mission while treating people with “dignity and respect,” said Sandweg.

“Of course she’s going to have that reaction,” he said, “you just arrested her husband and the father of her children … maybe not to be seen in this country ever again.”

While DHS has largely doubled down on its defense of the tactics ICE agents have been using in many of the incidents captured on video, the agency condemned the actions of the agent who shoved Moreta-Galarza and “relieved him of his current duties,” calling his actions “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE.”

It’s unclear whether the officer is still employed by ICE. The agency did not respond to CNN’s questions about disciplinary actions against the officer, his current status or his name.

ICE and CBP resources freed up after drop in border crossings

Illegal border crossings reached “all-time lows” in July, DHS said, which allowed resources at ICE and CBP to be freed up, according to Sandweg. ICE has also referenced the steep decline in border crossings as a reason its agents are now “focused on the core mission.”

ICE is slated to receive a landmark $75 billion in federal funds through 2029 from the president’s sweeping agenda bill for detention expansion and enforcement and removal operations, including hiring new agents, CNN has reported.

The surge in agency resources comes at a time when ICE is aggressively trying to recruit more agents. This could make even more agents available, as they were previously tied up dealing with border cases or spending hours, sometimes days, pursuing one arrest and quietly working with local authorities to target “truly the worst of the worst,” said Sandweg.

Over the past decade, Sandweg said enhanced border activity and asylum claims were “an incredible strain on ICE resources,” as agents had their hands full with taking people into custody, processing, supervising and removing many of the migrants who were apprehended at the border.

Now, ICE and CBP resources are more available to bolster non-border operations, Sandweg said.

Both agencies have been involved in large-scale deportation efforts unfolding in areas previously protected from immigration enforcement, such as schools, churches and courthouses, which hinge on the Trump administration’s decision to roll back a 2011 policy preventing immigration enforcement in sensitive areas.

None of those operations would be possible, according to Sandweg, if border crossings hadn’t fallen drastically since last summer when former President Joe Biden issued an executive action barring migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a threshold of average daily crossings is met.

Trump officials have said the differing tactics stem from so-called “sanctuary policies” that have been around since the 1980s in many Democratic-controlled areas that limit prisons and jails from cooperating with ICE, so immigration arrests take place in the community rather than at a detention facility.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly cited sanctuary policies as disruptive to immigration enforcement – and threatened to have an increased presence in those cities. Homan, a veteran of immigration law enforcement, also served under the Obama administration.

Most detained immigrants don’t have serious criminal convictions, data shows

As the second Trump administration shifts how ICE has traditionally operated, Sandweg says the range of ICE’s tactics aimed at hiking up arrests and driving migrants to self-deport is working to build an agency “designed to amp up immigration enforcement to levels we’ve never seen in this country.”

While DHS did not specifically address CNN’s request for comment about whether its tactics are designed to maximize arrests, the agency said in its statement it was targeting violent criminals, including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists.

Federal data reveals most immigrants taken into custody don’t have serious criminal convictions, according to a report by CNN Investigates. More than 75% of people booked into ICE custody in fiscal year 2025 had no criminal conviction other than an immigration or traffic-related offense, according to ICE records from October through the end of May.

ICE has launched large-scale raids at worksites like Home Depot parking lots in various cities and the Hyundai Metaplant in a small southeast Georgia community last month – assisted by CBP and other federal and state agencies. Nearly 500 people, mostly Korean nationals, who worked at the manufacturing plant were arrested on suspicions they were living and working illegally in the US.

Undocumented people who have not been convicted of any crime and have been arrested in raids like the one at Hyundai have become “collateral” in the larger mission to fight criminality, says Jerry Robinette, former ICE Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge during the Obama administration who also worked for the agency under President George W. Bush.

These people get caught when an officer checks their status and discovers they’re in the country illegally, which is a civil – not criminal – offense, he added.

“As much as they want to target the worst of the worst, you look at who you end up arresting. You’re not being as successful as you would like,” Robinette said. “You are getting a lot of collateral.”

More extensive immigration raids, like the one at Hyundai, are coming, Trump’s border czar told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union: “The short answer is yes, we’re going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan replied.

Protests over immigration actions escalate into clashes

Children and adults were pulled from their homes as federal agents raided an apartment complex in Chicago last month, arresting 37 undocumented immigrants in another recent, large-scale raid.

DHS said gang members and violent criminals were among those arrested, the agency said in its statement.

It’s just one example that shows the tactics fueling protests for weeks outside the ICE facility in Broadview, near Chicago, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear protesters, putting tensions on full display.

Protests at the site this month again turned into heated clashes between protesters and armed agents from CBP and ICE, leading to at least 18 arrests, including five who were charged with aggravated battery to a police officer and resisting and obstruction.

In the Chicago apartment raid, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is investigating claims children were separated from their parents and “zip-tied,” as well as elderly people who were detained for three hours, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN’s Jake Tapper.

DHS rejected Pritzker’s claims in a news release, saying children were never zip-tied in the raid and added the agency has “routinely debunked the absurd claim” that it’s targeting US citizens.

The type of aggression from federal agents the public is witnessing in many of these recent incidents has some similarities to the 1950s-era federal program aimed at mass deportations, known as “Operation Wetback” under then-President Dwight Eisenhower, according to Jean Reisz, co-director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic.

The Trump administration is echoing rhetoric from that era, referring to immigrants “as being ‘the worst of the worst,’ as being dangerous, as being invaders,” Reisz said, which empowers agents in the streets to “use aggression toward those who could be viewed as resisting.”

The public fury this year over how ICE is operating is rooted in how the Trump administration is pushing the boundaries of various individual rights — such as birthright citizenship — that have been protected for over 60 years, Reisz said. Just last month, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the president’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.

DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about the comparison with the 1950s-era federal program.

This summer, tensions reached a tipping point during weeks of protests in Los Angeles after a wave of detentions in the city, when protesters’ confrontations with local police and federal officers escalated into violent clashes that prompted a controversial, federal deployment of National Guard troops. Federal agents used flash-bangs and tear gas to disperse crowds, with some hitting demonstrators, as well as protesters setting fire to self-driving cars.

Robinette said the “optics” of the tactics federal immigration agents have been using are “not good for us as an agency,” but they are a result of officers having to follow orders from top administration officials and confrontations with people resisting as they execute the orders.

The political pressures on ICE have caused “a lot of headaches” as it deals with protesters who don’t just have issues with the agency but are also driven by political grievances related to the Trump administration, Robinette said. “The job is getting difficult.”

The sweeping raids have instilled a “persistent mental anxiety” within the immigrant community when encountering local police or National Guard troops who might report them to federal immigration officers, said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock with the National Immigration Law Center.

“Even if you’ve got your papers, even though you’re a US citizen, you kind of have to check over your shoulder and that’s having a pretty negative impact on people mentally,” Whitlock said. “And then that translates to a fear or flight response that happens when you do encounter them.”

Officer anonymization fuels public mistrust

Scenes from some of the incidents captured on video in recent months have shown federal agents wearing masks or plainclothes while arresting people — something they have historically done only while performing undercover work or arresting some of the country’s most dangerous criminals, experts say.

In Los Angeles, masked agents were seen yanking a Colombian immigrant out of her vehicle and detaining her on the ground. In Washington, DC, video showed masked federal agents struggling to arrest a man before he appears to be tased and subdued on the pavement. In Massachusetts, Turkish national and Tufts University grad student Rümeysa Öztürk was physically restrained by six plainclothes officers, most of whom were wearing face coverings.

There is no federal policy dictating when officers can or should cover their faces during arrests. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said federal officers are covering up to protect their families after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.

“I am sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, and their family on the line, because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is,” Lyons said.

But there is a risk of escalating encounters when people can’t identify them as federal agents, said Jeffrey Swartz, a Cooley Law School professor and former prosecutor and judge.

“We’ve never tolerated people who are engaged in law enforcement, who keep who they are and their identification secret from the people who might have complaints about the way they’re being treated,” said Swartz. “Police officers have always identified themselves.”

DHS said the “vilification” of ICE “must stop,” claiming its agents are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since Trump took office in January. ICE noted “criminal illegal aliens” have targeted its federal agents in the past.

A review of federal court records by Colorado Public Radio, however, revealed a 25% increase in people facing charges for assault against federal officers through mid-September, as compared to the same period last year.

When asked by CNN whether ICE is giving any directives for its agents to wear face coverings, DHS said: “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves and their families from being targeted” by gangs, murderers, rapists and other violent criminals.

Strong federal presence in cities impacts public ‘psyche’

The Trump administration is on pace to deport nearly 600,000 people by the end of Trump’s first year of his second term, DHS said late last month. It is not clear what the breakdown of deportations is by agency.

Including the 71,400 deportations recorded by ICE between October 2024 and the end of December before Trump took office, ICE was already on pace to surpass 300,000 deportations by September 30 – the highest number recorded in a single fiscal year since the Obama administration, when around 316,000 people were removed in fiscal year 2014, CNN reported. CBP recorded more than 132,000 deportations this year.

The agency said 70% of ICE arrests are “of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges in the US.”

Former ICE officials, like Sandweg and Robinette, worry about the long-term impact on the agency because of the pressures they’re facing this Trump term.

Sandweg says the lasting impact could be “devastating” for an agency that has historically worked as a close and quiet partner of state and local law enforcement.

With agents now working side-by-side with local agencies participating in the revived 287(g) program – allowing ICE to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to perform specific immigration enforcement duties under its supervision – it’s fueling tensions with local leaders, who have expressed concerns about ICE overstepping or keeping them in the dark.

“My biggest concern is … what’s going to happen for the future of the agency?” Robinette said. “This agency, since its birth, has never gone through anything like this.”

The strong presence of federal officers in communities has “impacted the psyche of the American public,” deterring people from engaging with local and federal authorities, fracturing trust and instilling fear and uncertainty, said Thaddeus Johnson, a former law enforcement official in Tennessee and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, an independent nonpartisan organization.

Johnson said he’s concerned the impact will undercut the legitimacy and authority of local and state agencies long after federal agents leave communities.

For people on the receiving end of harsher ICE tactics – such as Moreta-Galarza in New York – the experience can be re-traumatizing and fuel mistrust. After she was pushed and shoved by the ICE agent, the mother told reporters she fled violence in Ecuador only to suffer “the same thing” in the US.

She and her family have open asylum claims, according to US Rep. Dan Goldman, who added they are here “lawfully but are being targeted by ICE regardless.”

“They encircled us, then they slammed me against the floor, they grabbed my kids and dragged them away,” Moreta-Galarza told CNN affiliate WXTV. “They slammed me against the floor and caused my head to slam against the floor. Everyone from ICE fell on top of me.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2236977421-blurred.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-16 10:04:13.585879

He contends that his release under conditional parole means he is no longer subject to expedited removal proceedings and that his detention under §1225(b)(1) is therefore unlawful.
The act of parole extinguished the legal fiction that a non-citizen who is physically present in the United States has, in fact, not effected an entry into the United States.
Congress provided a mechanism for paroling applicants for admission into the United States without changing their status.","Where a petitioner has requested habeas corpus relief, the petition should be granted because the petitioner is being detained without lawful authority, as non-citizens who have been conditionally paroled into the United States are entitled to discretionary detention and a bond hearing under 8 U.S.C. §1226(a), not mandatory detention under 1225(b).

“This is a habeas petition that concerns the government’s authority to hold a non-citizen pending removal proceedings. Petitioner Carlos Roberto De Andrade is a citizen of Brazil who entered the United States illegally in 2021. He was arrested, detained, and placed into expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1). He was then — in apparent violation of that statute, which requires mandatory detention — released on conditional parole under §1226(a).

“Petitioner later moved to Massachusetts and married a United States citizen. In 2025, ICE arrested him when he reported for a routine check-in. The government contends that he is subject to mandatory detention under §1225(b)(1), notwithstanding his parole four years ago under §1226(a) and his undisputed compliance with the conditions of that parole. He contends that his release under conditional parole means he is no longer subject to expedited removal proceedings and that his detention under §1225(b)(1) is therefore unlawful.

“For the reasons that follow, the Court agrees with petitioner, and that he is therefore being detained without lawful authority. …

“By releasing petitioner under conditional parole, the government failed to reserve its right to treat petitioner ‘in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.’ 8 U.S.C. §1182(d)(5)(A). The act of parole extinguished the legal fiction that a non-citizen who is physically present in the United States has, in fact, not effected an entry into the United States. And once having entered, petitioner can no longer be treated as an ‘applicant for admission’ subject to expedited removal and mandatory detention under §1225. He must be treated like any other unlawfully ‘present’ non-citizen — and the lawfulness of his detention is governed by 8 U.S.C. §1226.

“In substance, the government asks the Court to turn a blind eye to the circumstances of petitioner’s release and the events of the last four years. It contends that his ‘release was not an admission to the United States and did not change his status as an applicant for admission subject to expedited removal.’ … But petitioner has been residing in Massachusetts since 2021. He is not seeking parole into the United States. He was already conditionally paroled into the United States. And he is still here. Congress provided a mechanism for paroling applicants for admission into the United States without changing their status. … The government elected not to use that mechanism. It cannot now turn back the clock, and neither can the Court. …

“In short, this Court joins the many other courts in this district and across the country that have found that non-citizens who have been conditionally paroled into the United States are entitled to discretionary detention and a bond hearing under §1226(a), not mandatory detention under 1225(b). …

“Here, the petitioner does not seek — at least in this petition — the right to stay in the country. He instead seeks release pending further immigration proceedings. And while he may ‘remain subject to arrest, detention, and removal’ under §§1226(a) and 1229a(e)(2), he is not subject to detention under §1225(b)(1).

“‘The burden of proof of showing deprivation of rights leading to unlawful detention is on the petitioner.’ Espinoza v. Sabol, 558 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2009). The Court finds petitioner has met his burden. Because he cannot be detained under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1), and respondents have not established an alternative authority for detention, he is being held unlawfully. The Court will therefore grant his petition for release. …

“Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2241 is granted. Respondent Antone Moniz, the warden of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, is hereby ordered to release petitioner from custody immediately.”

“As brief background, Petitioner, a citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection in 2020. He has since lived in Massachusetts. In September 2024, a U.S. Border Patrol agent apprehended Petitioner driving a passenger who had just unlawfully crossed the border from Canada into the United States. Petitioner was charged in federal court with knowingly transporting a noncitizen unlawfully present in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii). Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge and, on August 21, 2025, was sentenced to time served.

“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’) arrested Petitioner immediately following his sentencing and issued an arrest warrant. DHS also served Petitioner with a notice to appear charging him as inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) for being present without admission or parole and under 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(7)(A)(i) for lacking valid entry documents. Petitioner has been detained since his arrest at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. At Petitioner’s request, an immigration judge held a bond hearing on September 15, 2025. The government argued that Petitioner was statutorily ineligible for bond because, having entered the country without admission or parole, he is an ‘applicant for admission’ subject to mandatory detention during his removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2)(A). The immigration judge agreed and refused to release Petitioner.

“Petitioner’s primary argument in support of his habeas petition is that his detention during removal proceedings is governed by 8 U.S.C. §1226, not §1225(b)(2)(A). The government disagrees. The statutory authority for Petitioner’s detention matters because §1225(b)(2)(A) ‘mandate[s] detention … until [removal] proceedings have concluded’ in almost all cases while §1226 generally permits the government to release the noncitizen on bond or conditional parole. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 288, 297 (2018).

“This Court addressed the interplay of these two detention provisions in its recent decision in Guerrero Orellana v. Moniz. See __ F. Supp. 3d __, __ (D. Mass. 2025) [2025 WL 2809996, at *4- 9]. The Court concluded that §1226, not §1225(b)(2)(A), governs the detention pending removal proceedings of a noncitizen who entered the United States without admission or parole, was apprehended while residing in the country, and is not subject to the expedited removal process under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1). … For the reasons stated in Guerrero Orellana, the Court agrees with Petitioner that his detention is governed by §1226.

“This conclusion does not, however, fully resolve the question of whether Petitioner is eligible for release on bond or conditional parole. …

“The parties disagree as to whether Petitioner is subject to discretionary detention under §1226(a) or mandatory detention under §1226(c). The government contends that Petitioner’s criminal conviction under 8 U.S.C. §1324(a)(1)(A)(ii) constitutes an aggravated felony that triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c). Petitioner denies that his conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.

“The Court leaves the question of whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction triggers mandatory detention under §1226(c) to the immigration judge to address in the first instance. … No immigration judge has yet addressed whether Petitioner’s criminal conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony, so the Court declines to resolve the matter. …

“Accordingly, the Court allows the habeas petition (Dkt. 1) and orders the government to provide Petitioner with a hearing before an immigration judge to consider his request for release from detention under the framework of 8 U.S.C. §1226 within seven business days from the date of this order.”

Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president.","Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges.

In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.

The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.

“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.

Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.

The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.

The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.

The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions.

Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.

Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019.

The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.

Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”

Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.

They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.
Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.
Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate.
At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.","Several airports in California have refused to play a video featuring U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for delays due to the federal government shutdown.

The video, playing for travelers waiting in Transportation Security Administration security lines at airports across the country, comes as the government entered a third week of a shutdown after Congress failed to reach an agreement on funding legislation.

“It is TSA’s top priority to make sure you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” Noem says in the video. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government and because of this many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Officials at multiple airports in California say they are not playing the video at their locations. They include: John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Hollywood Burbank Airport, San Diego International Airport, San José Mineta International Airport, Sacramento International Airport, Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport and San Francisco International Airport.

Officials from Los Angeles International Airport did not respond to questions on whether the video was being played there.

Some airport officials have refused to play the video, calling it inappropriate. On Tuesday, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation called for Noem to be investigated for possibly breaking the Hatch Act by asking airports to play the video.

“Recent reports indicate DHS is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air a video message featuring Secretary Noem, in her official capacity, making political attacks against Democratic Members of Congress,” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) wrote in a letter addressed to the Office of Special Counsel and reviewed by The Times. “This message is not just false; it appears to violate the prohibitions contained in the Hatch Act.”

The act, according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, is to “ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,” as well as protect federal employees from political coercion at work.

Noem’s video was received by airports on Thursday and was followed up by a verbal request from DHS officials to play it at security checkpoints, multiple airport officials told The Times.

The reasons the video is not being shown for California fliers varies.

In Orange County, airport spokesperson AnnaSophia Servin said that Homeland Security requested, to the airport’s director, that the video be played, but a final decision has not yet been made. In Burbank, political messaging is prohibited, officials said. In San José, an airport spokesperson said there have been no shutdown impacts and therefore no reason to play the video.

At San Francisco International Airport, officials determined that the video wasn’t helpful.

“SFO limits messaging at our security checkpoints to information intended to help passengers be prepared to go through the security screening process,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Any content, whether in video or print form, which does not meet this standard, will not be shown.”

When The Times asked Homeland Security officials to respond to airports not playing Noem’s video, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded with Noem’s video statement blaming Democrats.

But California airports aren’t the only locations choosing not to play Noem’s message.

Airports in Oregon, Las Vegas, Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle have also opted not to play it.

“We did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,” said Molly Prescott, a spokesperson for the Port of Portland, which manages Portland International Airport, said in a statement.

Oregon law also prohibits public employees from politicking on the job.

“We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law,” she said.

Officials in New York also pushed back against airing the video.

“It is inappropriate, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the values we expect from our nation’s top public officials,” New York’s Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said in a statement. “The [Public Service Announcement] politicizes the impacts of a federal government shutdown on TSA Operations, and the County finds the tone to be unnecessarily alarmist.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46126ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+257/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F79%2F95c8e2ab486db96e3b3c75f00e0d%2F1525153-me-burbank-airport-ajs-20.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:35.905212

“And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.","In Kentucky, patients drive up to two hours to see Dr. Manikya Kuriti, one of the few endocrinologists who serve the rural communities surrounding Louisville.

Kuriti’s husband, a pulmonologist, drives from Louisville to small hospitals an hour south and north, in Indiana, to help small teams treat critically ill patients.

Rural communities have long struggled to recruit and retain doctors. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially, and have had to eliminate services or even shut down. The shortage of providers is critical in rural communities that tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and early death compared with their urban counterparts.

Many immigrant physicians help fill those gaps thanks in part to the H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign workers to come work in the U.S. Both Kuriti and her husband came to the U.S. via the H-1B visa.

But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The announcement quickly drew criticism from leading medical organizations, which note immigrant physicians make up a significant portion of the health care workforce. They’re concerned the move will hinder the flow of immigrant doctors to the U.S. and exacerbate the nation’s doctor shortage, which is expected to worsen in the coming decades.

Earlier this month, labor unions and other groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the administration over the payment. They argue that the move is unlawful and that the president doesn’t have the authority to circumvent Congress to collect such revenue. The plaintiffs — represented by the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, the Justice Action Center and others — include the AFL-CIO Committee of Interns and Residents and Global Nurse Force.

Last month, the American Medical Association and more than 50 other organizations sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the administration to exempt international medical school graduates from the fee.

According to projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by the year 2036, the groups emphasized in the letter.

National interest

The president’s order says the secretary of homeland security can, at her discretion, waive the $100,000 requirement for prospective H-1B workers in specific industries if it’s in the “national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare” of the nation.

The AMA’s joint letter urges the secretary “to clarify that all physicians, including medical residents, fellows, researchers, and those working in nonclinical settings” are “critical to our national interest” and therefore exempt.

The Department of Homeland Security referred a Stateline request for comment to the White House, which hadn’t responded as of Thursday.

1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

Dr. Tom Price, who served as secretary of health and human services during Trump’s first term, said in an interview that medical workers should be exempt from the $100,000 fee.

“A significant fee for any further H-1B visas in the area of the health care workforce will be detrimental … especially in low-served areas or rural areas,” said Price, a former Republican member of Congress.

In 2024, nearly a quarter of licensed physicians in the U.S. were foreign-trained and roughly 46% of foreign-trained physicians practiced in rural areas, according to data from the Federation of State Medical Boards cited by the AMA. And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.

Trump and other critics of H-1B visas say that some employers, especially tech companies, have abused the program by using it to replace native-born workers with foreigners who will work for less, rather than using it to fill jobs they can’t find Americans to do. But tech companies would have an easier time paying the fee than many hospitals.

Elizabeth Ricci, a Tallahassee, Florida-based immigration lawyer and national expert in immigration law, said at least one hospital in the South has asked her whether it must pay the fee itself or whether it can pass it on to the prospective physician. Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.

“It’s probably going to require litigation to get that guidance,” Ricci said. “And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.

The University of Washington said it has paused H-1B visa petitions.

“The uncertainty around visas creates a significant disruption for talented individuals who hope to train and work at UW Medicine,” Dr. Tim Dellit, CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, wrote in email to Stateline. “It represents a loss for the research and education communities, as well as for the vital clinical care we provide on behalf of our patients and the broader community.”

Iowa, West Virginia and North Dakota — conservative-leaning, largely rural states — had the largest share of physician applicants under the H-1B visa relative to total physicians, according to a study published in July in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

‘The need is there’

When Dr. Sridevi Alla arrived in Mississippi two decades ago, she was part of a small team of hospitalists at a rural clinic in Kosciusko, in the central part of the state. She now practices in Jackson, and on any given day, she could be treating patients having a stroke, complications from untreated diabetes, or someone with dangerously high blood pressure.

“In a state which already has a physician shortage, I think that’s definitely going to affect primary care,” Alla said, referring to the payment.

Alla said she considers herself a Mississippian, and that she’s always felt welcomed and valued by hospital leadership and patients.

“We never felt [like] foreigners in the medical community,” she said. “Maybe from an immigration standpoint we are, but not around being a part of health care.”

She noted Mississippi’s high rates of diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality and poverty.

“This is where I was trained. I sincerely feel like the need is there,” she said. “Even though maybe there are opportunities out [there], I never sincerely looked outside because I felt this is the home after home.”

Four-year limit proposal

Many physicians come to the U.S. under the temporary J-1 visa, which allows medical graduates to come for training and graduate medical education. They are then required to return to their home countries for at least two years. But they can apply for a waiver to stay if they work in rural or underserved communities, which allows them to transfer to an H-1B visa.

In addition to the new $100,000 fee, the administration has proposed a four-year limit on how long J-1 visa holders can stay in the U.S.

Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

AMA President Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, a Flint, Michigan, otolaryngologist, said both his parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to complete their medical residencies.

“In that same hospital where they did their training back in 1970, here in 2025, we still have 30 to 35 international medical graduates that come in,” he said.

Now, hospitals have to “figure out where we’re going to get $100,000 per doctor.”

“We need to not just have the physicians talking about this, but to add to that the understanding of our own lawmakers,” he said.

Dr. Mette Strand, an internal medicine physician at Livingston HealthCare, a 25-bed critical access hospital serving rural Montana, emigrated from Norway. Many of those who mentored her, including specialist colleagues, are immigrants, too.

“Cutting IMGs [international medical graduates], we would be in further need of doctors in an already underserved state,” she said. “I would have a hard time seeing how we would run our hospitals and our clinics.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/immigrant-doctors1760623121.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=K1O30MH0,N,,2025-10-16 12:03:24.978286

The Everett Police Chief and mayor say they did not notify the federal government and that ICE was waiting outside the police department.

Everett Police say they got a credible tip that a 13-year-old boy threatened another student.

Police arrested him last Thursday at a bus stop outside the Parlin School.

They found a six to seven-inch double-sided knife on him. He was taken to the police department, booked, and then, as he was outside the station, he was taken away by ICE agents while his mother was inside.

The mayor and police say they have no control over what ICE does, but people in the community are upset that a teen was quickly whisked away from his family.

“Even people who have committed crimes in this country have the right to due process under the Constitution, even the worse people who have done the worse things,” said Joanna Garren, an Everett School Committee member.

“It is the responsibility of our public servants to protect and serve all people in the community,” said an Everett teacher at a meeting. “All of us, especially those who are most vulnerable.”

On X, Homeland Security said the boy was in possession of a knife and firearm when taken in, with a rap sheet that includes violent assault with a dangerous weapon, battery, breaking and entering, and destruction of property.

However, the chief claims the teen did not have a firearm on him when he was arrested. What does happen when someone is arrested is that their fingerprints are taken and ICE has access to that database. ICE then determines if the individual is here illegally and sends over a detainer.

The teen is currently being held out of state.

The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday afternoon to approve a $3.57 million emergency allocation to dramatically scale up legal services, community outreach and rapid response networks for the county’s immigrant and refugee residents.

Sourced primarily from the Measure W Essential Services Fund, the allocation includes $2.5 million for immigrant and refugee support and an additional $1 million for a flexible contingency pool. The funds will extend and increase contracts for three frontline community coalitions.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.

Spearheaded by Supervisors Nikki Fortunato Bas and Elisa Márquez, the action is a direct response to what county staff reports describe as “exponentially more attacks” and “unprecedented levels” of federal immigration enforcement.

“This is about real-time response and building an infrastructure that will continue to educate and empower our communities to withstand this escalation of threats and attacks,” Márquez said.

Under the new federal budget, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to receive an additional $75 billion over four years, representing a more than 300% increase in enforcement and detention capacity.

Bas said that residents demanded greater support after a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal ICE agents to conduct stops based on perceived ethnicity, raising concerns about heightened racial profiling. The move also follows an incident last month where federal immigration officers detained a man inside an Oakland courthouse.

“With the surge in ICE arrests again, the targeting of our immigrant communities, the community has come to us to say it is urgent that we boost our capacity,” Bas said. “This will allow us to expand the rapid response hotline into the weekends and continue defending immigrants in our legal system to ensure they have due process.”

The six-month funding extension is designed to fortify the local safety net in a county where one in three residents is foreign-born and half of all children live in a mixed-status household, according to a letter from Bas and Márquez to the board recommending adoption.

Bay Area immigration arrests have doubled

Enforcement data for what ICE refers to as the San Francisco “Area of Responsibility,” which stretches from Kern County to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam and includes Alameda County, showed that immigration arrests doubled in early 2025.

This spike disproportionately impacts working-class families, particularly nationals from Mexico, Guatemala, India, El Salvador, and Honduras, according to the supervisors’ letter.

The rapid response hotline run by ACILEP, the Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership, documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025. At Tuesday’s meeting, ACILEP said during the weekday, one person currently staffs the phone at a time, highlighting the group’s limited capacity.

The $3.57 million will support the county’s three core partners in scaling their services:

ACILEP: The largest portion of the funding will support the expansion of the organization’s Rapid Response Hotline to operate on weekends and ensure 24/7 coverage, alongside bolstering legal services and community volunteer network coordination.

California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice: The funds will maintain removal defense capacity, offset filing fees for low-income clients and fund legal education and outreach — ensuring immigrants in removal proceedings have access to due process and legal protection.

Trabajadores Unidos Workers United: The group will use the funding to provide resources, mutual aid and community organizing opportunities to low-income immigrant workers and their families.

The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office. This funding will help offset skyrocketing immigration application and litigation fees for low-income clients, such as the recent significant increase in costs for asylum applications and green cards following the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budget bill.

Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco, and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated office of immigrant and refugee affairs.

“We definitely have to do more strategic planning and develop stronger infrastructure for the long term,” Márquez said.

Alameda County Together, an ad hoc committee prioritizing equity and inclusion for residents, recommended that the county establish such an office, which would be tasked with coordinating resources, overseeing immigrant-serving programs, and advising the board of supervisors on responsive policies.

County staff have been directed to return to the board on Oct. 21 with a comprehensive coordination plan, and again on Oct. 28. The county is engaging with philanthropists, including the San Francisco Foundation’s new initiative, the Stand Together Bay Area Fund, to support these initiatives.

“It’s really important that people have a sense of belonging in this county,” Márquez said. “By us investing in these services, to acknowledge the challenges that are occurring and finding a way to mitigate that, just reaffirms our commitment to being a space and inclusive community for everyone.”",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251015-195751.webp,N,,2025-10-16 08:56:48.675354

Immigration and Gangs in Tennessee ICE’s sweeping new national approach began in early February with a series of “enhanced immigration enforcement operations” in multiple cities across the country.
Between March and late May, when new orders led to a change in ICE tactics, ICE reported carrying out 22 special enforcement operations.
Local Democrats called the ICE operation “white supremacist terror.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused Mayor O’Connell of shielding gang members after he criticized ICE tactics.","On the night of May 4, the phones and social media of migrant rights activists in Nashville lit up with alerts, some with shaky cell phone videos all showing similar scenes: the multilane transport arteries that slice through south Nashville’s immigrant districts illuminated by the flashing red and blue of state trooper vehicles and the fuzzy yellow glow from the headlights of unmarked cars. Men in khaki shirts and wide-brimmed hats approached cars, while murky figures in tactical vests lurked over their shoulders in the distance.

The pattern soon became clear: Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) were pulling people over, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were detaining them. The 150 stops they made that night were part of a “public safety operation,” the THP said, targeting “areas with a history of serious traffic crashes and suspected gang activity.”

The sweep was part of a national effort to deliver on the campaign promise of President Donald Trump to launch “the largest deportation campaign in history.” That campaign, Trump claimed, would prioritize violent criminals and organized crime: drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and gangs with roots in Latin America.

The administration has called it the “worst first” strategy. And among their leading targets were the legendary Los Angeles-born Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, and Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan prison gang that has spread throughout the Americas by preying on the exodus of people fleeing poverty, insecurity, and political oppression in Venezuela.

“All of these criminals, these murderers, these drug dealers — we’re getting them out. I will put these vicious, bloodthirsty criminals in jail, or I will get them out of the country,” Trump had said.

But if these operations were meant to dismantle criminal groups, there was little in the public record to show for it. During the Nashville sweeps, authorities detained just one alleged member of the MS13 and one from the Tren de Aragua. The operation also stirred up political controversy, sparked a community backlash, and has left many in the city’s migrant community living in constant fear.

The Tennessee operation was a microcosm of the conflicts caused by a national immigration crackdown that has been justified with the threat of Latin American organized crime. With two of the most prominent criminal groups in the Americas at the center of it, InSight Crime sought to determine the nature of these networks and the threat level they pose in Tennessee and measure it against the response by the government — as well as the impact of that response on local communities.

This is the first of three articles resulting from that effort. It chronicles the crackdown and the reverberations from it. The other articles profile the Tennessee operations of the criminal groups in question: the MS13 and Tren de Aragua, two of the most violent gangs in the Americas. The reports are based on dozens of interviews with law enforcement and judicial officials, community workers and activists, family members of the detained, immigration lawyers, political leaders, and experts on all sides of the debate. We also read through dozens of court filings and public statements by officials across the country and analyzed crime and immigration data stretching back decades.

The effects of these crackdowns are still being felt. While the government claims it has deported record numbers of gang members, and supporters of these policies say these operations are a critical tool for combating transnational criminal networks, authorities refuse to share the crucial details needed to corroborate these efforts.

Instead, the information released suggests the scope of the operations has widened considerably beyond the “worst first” mission, undermining trust between some of the communities most affected by organized crime and the law enforcement agencies tasked with stopping it. But more than that, the operations are the most visible manifestation of tectonic shifts in the US government’s approach not only to immigration but also to combatting organized crime that could have a lasting impact on US security policy.

Immigration and Gangs in Tennessee

ICE’s sweeping new national approach began in early February with a series of “enhanced immigration enforcement operations” in multiple cities across the country. The statement announcing the raids included few details, but a series of photos showed arrests of alleged MS13 and Tren de Aragua members in Maryland and South Carolina.

Within a month, ICE was carrying out similar operations around the country. Most took place over several days and were carried out alongside other federal agencies or state and local law enforcement. They arrested tens, even hundreds, of people at a time. The operations hit Texas, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Alabama, New York, Florida, and Maryland before reaching Tennessee.

Tennessee was a logical target. Located in the southeastern United States, the state typifies many of the organized crime and migration dynamics that have risen to the top of the Trump administration’s security agenda. Foreign-born residents account for around 6% of the state’s total population and 15% in Nashville, according to 2024 census figures. While accurate figures on the number of undocumented migrants are difficult to calculate, the American Immigration Council estimates a total population of around 156,000 living in the state, where they work in sectors such as construction and hospitality in urban hubs and in the agricultural sector that forms the backbone of the state’s rural economy.

But Tennessee also has gang problems and high murder rates in its major cities, human trafficking, and high levels of fentanyl addiction. And gangs such as the MS13 and Tren de Aragua are present in migrant communities, where they commit serious crimes, mostly against members of those same communities.

Of the two, the MS13 has a much deeper history. The gang has been in Nashville for more than two decades, and the city has seen two major criminal conspiracy investigations leading to multiple convictions on charges ranging from murder to kidnapping.

Tren de Aragua’s presence, however, is harder to pin down. State law enforcement first warned of the advances of Tren de Aragua across Tennessee in late 2024. While they have since faced criticisms for overplaying the threat posed, in 2025, federal prosecutors brought sex trafficking charges against what they allege is the first organized Tren de Aragua cell in the state.

Casting a Wide Net

From the beginning of the Nashville operation, it was clear that ICE and state police were casting a wide net. Legal observers described to InSight Crime how THP troopers pulled drivers over citing minor traffic violations. The THP would approach the cars first, then ICE officers would demand to see proof of immigration status. If any of those in the vehicles couldn’t provide it, ICE bundled them into their vehicles and whisked them away.

The ICE officers sometimes demanded to see people’s tattoos, but activists who spoke to InSight Crime said they did not see any authorities doing criminal background checks on the scene, and little more was done to establish any criminal affiliations or record. Beyond concentrating operations along the main roads of the town’s immigrant neighborhoods, there was scant evidence to suggest the stops were targeting specific individuals, they said.

“I don’t think they had any rhyme or reason. It was just whoever they decided that looked Latino at that instance and could be pulled over,” Jazmin Ramírez, a migrant rights activist and community organizer who witnessed two arrests while carrying out legal observer work, told InSight Crime.

Both state and federal authorities have refused to release all but a snapshot of data on the background of those stopped, which was obtained by local journalists. That snapshot provided details on the ethnicity of 34 of the drivers who were stopped: 29 of them were Latino, two Asian, two Black, and one white.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who heads ICE’s parent agency, pushed back on allegations of racial profiling in the operation.

“Do you have any indication that anybody was targeted just specifically because of what their race or creed was?” she responded when questioned by journalists in Nashville. “Every single enforcement operation that we have conducted has been based on case work and investigative reports of criminal activity.”

Activists, though, said anyone caught in the dragnet risked arrest. On one occasion, legal observers documented ICE pulling a mother from her children. On another, they detained a man in front of school children waiting for a bus.

During the operation, much of Nashville’s migrant community essentially went into lockdown, only leaving their homes when they had little other choice.

“It was this weird, eerie silence. People not on the streets, businesses completely empty — this hyper alertness of ‘could that be the car?’” said Ramírez.

Despite the claims the operation was targeting gangs, there were few signs of the authorities trying to gather intelligence or build cases after making arrests. Instead, they denied many detainees the due process and rights they would have been entitled to in the US criminal justice system, including access to a lawyer or the right to a phone call.

Many of those detained were shunted around jails in Tennessee before being transported to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, 500 miles away. Some spent time chained and shackled and did not get adequate food and medical care, according to multiple accounts by detainees, relatives, and activists.

“They were treated like they weren’t human,” said Chelsea White, whose Mexican husband, Hilario Martinez Garcia, was detained during the operation by THP working with ICE on the outskirts of Nashville.

While some of those detained were able to contact their families, many others were not. The first time some families heard from their loved ones was when they received phone calls from Guatemala, El Salvador, or Mexico.

White heard nothing about her husband for a week.

“I had no idea where he was, what was going on, what was happening, if he was okay,” she said.

Since the operation, there is no sign authorities have brought criminal charges against those arrested in the operation. Instead, in many cases, immigration officials pushed detainees to sign self-deportation papers, which many did not understand as they were only offered in English, activists and relatives told InSight Crime.

White’s husband eventually signed those papers after a court hearing in which a judge told him he would be held in ICE detention indefinitely if he decided to fight his legal case.

“There were people that had been there for months already and didn’t even have a court date, and he was scared that was going to be his fate,” she said.

White, a US citizen who has lived her whole life in Tennessee, moved to Mexico with her three children to keep her family together. As she tries to rebuild her life, she bristles at the suggestion that the operation that tore it apart was taking aim at organized crime. When Trump said his government would target gang members and violent criminals, she had believed it, she said during a telephone interview from Mexico.

“But he’s not just getting those people. He’s getting normal, everyday people that go to work and come back. He’s getting family people.”

Hundreds of ‘Aliens,’ but Few Gang Members

The Nashville operation lasted a week, after which ICE reported that agents had arrested 196 “criminal illegal aliens.” Of these, 95 — fewer than half — had prior criminal convictions or pending cases.

While ICE has refused to release any information on the case history of the 95 with criminal records, it did provide some details on seven “notable arrests.” Their rap sheets included rape, domestic abuse, sex with a minor, aggravated assault, drug possession, and intent to supply. Headlining the list were two alleged gang members.

One of them was Franklin Velásquez, an alleged MS13 member from El Salvador. Velásquez had been convicted in the US for drug possession, failure to appear at judicial proceedings, and criminal impersonation, and he is wanted in El Salvador on aggravated murder charges. However, no information was provided on what role, if any, Velásquez had with the MS13 in Nashville, and his name had not come up during an MS13 case that concluded in July 2024 with the conviction of 18 gang members.

The other detainee with alleged links to organized crime, according to the statement, was an unnamed 37-year-old Venezuelan who ICE claimed was a Tren de Aragua “affiliate member.” A later statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) providing further information on the “notable arrests” made no mention of the alleged Tren de Aragua member.

Federal authorities stonewalled efforts to provide more. ICE declined to provide details on the alleged Tren de Aragua member or any further information on the other detainees to the media, and it did not respond to InSight Crime’s request to discuss the operation. DHS sent InSight Crime a link to its press release.

When the legal department of Nashville’s mayor’s office asked DHS and THP for the details of those detained, THP responded that no such documents existed, while DHS did not respond at all. The THP also refused to release all but heavily redacted dispatch records on the traffic stops made from the first night, making it impossible to verify where, when, why, or how Velasquez and the alleged Tren de Aragua member were detained.

The results of ICE’s special enforcement operation in Nashville reflected the patterns seen on the national stage. Between March and late May, when new orders led to a change in ICE tactics, ICE reported carrying out 22 special enforcement operations. Of those, gangs and transnational criminal networks were explicitly named as priority targets in more than half of the cases. But of the total of 6,022 people detained in these operations, only 27 were alleged to be gang members or have gang ties – less than 0.5%. And only 8 of those were actually named.

ICE’s public statements may only offer the highlights of the overall panorama, and those arrested during the operations were not the only alleged gang members detained over the period. But the complete datasets available paint a similar picture.

According to an analysis by the Cato Institute that combined publicly available government data with internal ICE data, ICE detained 204,297 people between October 2024 and June 2025. Of those, 65.4% had neither convictions nor pending criminal charges. While the data did not include information on the number with alleged organized crime ties, records showed 6.9% were detained for violent crimes and another 4.5% for “vice” crimes — drugs, gambling, and the sex trade — sometimes linked to gang activity.

Among Law Enforcement, A Mixed Reaction

Backlash to the Nashville ICE operation was immediate. Activists organized patrols of legal observers, blockaded ICE facilities where detainees were being held, and organized solidarity campaigns. The city’s liberal mayor, Freddie O’Connell, also spoke out.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said.

But the reaction among law enforcement and judicial officials to the sweep was mixed. Thomas Jaworski, a former federal prosecutor who in 2024 rose to the position of acting US Attorney for Middle Tennessee, told InSight Crime that while the numbers of serious criminals detained may be low, those individuals are likely major drivers of crime locally.

And while the operation in Nashville may not have directly weakened gangs or other transnational criminal networks, it may reduce their operational capacity, he added. The street presence of ICE and the threat of deportation, he said, will likely force these groups to keep a low profile.

“You’re going to see a slight dip going forward simply because of the immigration enforcement activities. That is not to be ugly about it. That’s just a fact of life,” he said.

Scott Mechkowski, a former ICE Deputy Director for New York City, told InSight Crime such broad operations can be an effective tactic for dismantling gangs by picking up what often gets left behind by slow-moving, costly investigations.

SEE ALSO: Gangs, Tattoos, and the Roots of the US Due Process Crisis

“Some of it may have shifted into wrapping it up in your daily local enforcement,” he told InSight Crime. “Why build the case if we know these guys are gangbangers and they’re illegal. Just lock them up and get rid of them.”

The operations, Mechkowski added, are likely not as indiscriminate as they can appear from the outside.

“It’s using intelligence and data collection to help you focus on your mission, your priorities,” he said. “You’re not racially profiling, but you are profiling.”

“You become experts on what to look for or what’s out of the norm,” he added.

Mechkowski sees the approach as a corrective to years of policies under the previous US administration of President Joe Biden that shackled law enforcement.

Under Biden, he said, ICE was restricted by protections for migrants lost in the never-ending asylum backlog or with protected immigration status, who could not be removed and had to be cut loose after arrest. He also highlighted the difficulties working in “sanctuary cities,” like New York and Los Angeles, where municipal authorities protect migrant communities by placing limits on the cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

“Under the Biden administration, it was hard to lock anybody up,” he said.

In May, Mechkowski testified at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the protection of ICE officers during such operations. Also speaking that day was another former official that saw the issue very differently.

In his testimony, former ICE Chief of Staff Jason Houser labeled the operations as “designed for media optics rather than public safety.”

“When resources are diverted toward the arrest of low-priority individuals, enforcement becomes a dragnet,” he told the committee. “That may generate high arrest numbers for press releases, but it pulls ICE personnel away from complex, high-risk cases that improve public safety. It creates a false sense of security while leaving human trafficking, narcotics operations, and violent criminal networks less disrupted.”

Houser did not respond to InSight Crime’s request for an interview. Other former officials, though, similarly questioned both the tactics and the results.

A former senior DHS official who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity expressed doubt that authorities are tracking down people whom they know have direct contacts with MS13 or Tren de Aragua in operations such as the one in Nashville.

“All the highway patrol operations and random traffic stops, that’s just to increase fear, it’s a fishing expedition,” he said.

Rather than a concerted crackdown on organized crime, the former official said, the results in Nashville and beyond point to agencies scrambling to deliver the numbers the Trump administration needs to keep its ambitious deportation promises. That pressure could also explain the lack of transparency over the allegations of gang affiliations.

“There are incentives to characterize somebody falsely or to err on the side of assuming that there’s activity with TdA or trying to conflate TdA or MS13 activity with stuff that’s pretty benign or routine,” he added.

A Law Enforcement Overhaul

While special enforcement operations such as the ICE sweep in Nashville have been the most eye-catching aspect of the convergence of crime and immigration under Trump, they are just one part of much deeper changes that could radically alter how transnational organized crime is investigated and prosecuted in the United States.

In March, the government announced its new “Take Back America” initiative. At the top of their new list of priorities was immigration — or, as the Department of Justice (DOJ) memo announcing the change put it, to “repel the foreign invasion.” To facilitate quick removals, the memo directs prosecutors to prioritize charging “the most serious, readily provable offense” over building cases.

The new priorities were then reinforced in funding plans. In 2026, the DHS will see a 65% increase in its budget. This will be the start of an unprecedented surge in funding planned for the next few years, much of it funneled to ICE, where billions of additional dollars will be allocated to recruiting new enforcement officers, building and operating detention facilities, and removals. With a projected budget of nearly $28 billion a year over the next four years, the changes will make ICE by far the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States.

At the same time, the DOJ faces billions of dollars in budget cuts. And the federal agencies traditionally tasked with investigating organized crime — the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) — have already seen their budgets slashed by hundreds of millions of dollars and their agents pulled from their duties to support ICE immigration enforcements.

As if to put an exclamation point on the new strategy, one of the main tools used by the DOJ to bring local and federal law enforcement together to target criminal networks — Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) — is being dissolved altogether.

The changing panorama has caused alarm among some of those who have been leading efforts to take on transnational organized crime in Tennessee, where recent cases brought against MS13 and Tren de Aragua have been built on slow-moving, complex investigations carried out by multiple agencies, including through the organized crime task forces that are now being disbanded.

One recently retired Tennessee organized crime prosecutor, who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity, doubts the effectiveness of prioritizing immigration enforcement and worries it could undermine efforts to investigate criminal networks.

“It’s having the reverse effect of what the administration claims that it should have and what most people think that it should have when you end up just arresting people based on their immigration status,” the former prosecutor said.

Not only are such operations unlikely to reach top-level criminals, they may also undermine the community relations that are key to prosecuting such actors.

“I’m sure that it has put a damper on people willing to serve as informants, because if you have some kind of status that might subject you to enforcement, you’re certainly not going to willingly go talk to anybody and provide information,” the former prosecutor added.

In some cases, such tactics could even strengthen the hold of criminal groups over their victims. The former prosecutor pointed to a recent sex trafficking case authorities connected to Tren de Aragua, where the alleged traffickers used their victims’ immigration status as leverage.

“It makes that even easier, [they can say] ‘you see these arrests out here? That’s what will happen to you unless you continue to do this,” the former prosecutor said.

The pulling of resources away from investigative agencies and to immigration enforcement will also undermine capacity to build cases, the ex-prosecutor added.

“The time and resources that [agents] have to put into these immigration arrests makes them completely unable to perform any of their long-term investigations, so you just completely hamstring them.”

However, ex-ICE officer Mechkowski believes this prioritization of immigration enforcement does not have to come at the expense of building cases against transnational gangs and criminal networks.

“I think they can exist side by side,” he said. “I don’t think they’ve abandoned dismantling gangs, just that maybe right now the focus has changed a little bit. And I still think they’re doing those investigations.”

The deployment of investigative agents to immigration enforcement operations, he added, is likely a temporary measure that will no longer be necessary with the surge in ICE funding and recruitment.

Security Policy and Politics: Worlds Apart

While security and justice officials and experts debate the effectiveness of immigration enforcement as a tool to combat organized crime, on the political stage, the two political parties occupy different realities. And again, Tennessee has seen its local version of the conflict playing out nationally.

Local Democrats called the ICE operation “white supremacist terror.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused Mayor O’Connell of shielding gang members after he criticized ICE tactics. In September, one local representative upped the stakes further by calling for the National Guard to be deployed to Nashville because the mayor was “using the city as an outpost for international gangs to set up shop in our neighborhoods.”

Nationally though, the Trump administration has moved away from the threat of organized crime in its orders to ICE. Several US media outlets reported on a meeting in late May in which Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is leading the administration’s immigration crackdown, tore into ICE leaders from around the country for not making enough arrests.

“What do you mean you are going after criminals?” Miller angrily told them, according to an account of the meeting in the Washington Examiner. “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?’”

Within days, that is exactly where ICE went, as well as to construction sites, farms, and other workplaces that rely on migrant labor. The number of migrants with no criminal record being detained soared. And whatever remained of a “worst first” policy targeting gangs and organized crime fell away.

“At this point, I can’t see any strategy other than harassment, discrimination, and racism,” the former DHS official said.

While ICE reports since the Miller meeting reflect a pivot to worksite enforcement, special operations have continued, with four carried out between June and September that declared gangs and transnational criminal networks as their targets or that they were based on a “worst first” approach. In those operations, ICE reported making 1,172 arrests. Just 14 of them were suspected members of organized crime groups.",https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gangs-and-Immigration-Cover-chapter-1-InSight-Crime-Sep-2025-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 07:56:46.387281

It’s the first time the financial agreement has been made public after the White House initially said the deal amounted to $6 million.

The payments were part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown and decision to invoke a wartime law to remove Venezuelan nationals.

The four-page agreement between the United States and El Salvador verifies that the funds came out of the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law, which gives financial assistance to security forces and is subject to a human rights law known as the Leahy Law.

That human rights law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons — facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.

“The purpose of this grant is to provide funds to be used by the Salvadoran law enforcement and corrections agencies for its law enforcement needs, which includes costs associated with detaining the 238 TdA members recently deported to El Salvador,” according to the agreement.

Those who drafted the law raised concerns that those payments violated human rights laws, as more than 250 Venezuelan men were removed from the U.S. to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, despite a federal judge’s order barring such action.

Congressional Democrats have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the White House for a copy of the financial agreement for months, over concerns the funds were being used in violation of human rights.

March flight to El Salvador

On March 15, the Trump administration sent 238 men to CECOT, after invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to apply to Venezuelan nationals 14 and older who are suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

The agreement, dated March 22, noted the men could be detained up to a year.

It also bars any of the $4.76 million to be used to help asylum seekers seek legal counsel for the U.S. asylum process, for access to abortion, funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians or for programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

The men were released back to Venezuela as part of a prison swap in July, but they remained at CECOT for four months. Some of those detained, including Kilmar Abrego Garica, of Maryland, whose mistaken deportation captured national attention, detailed psychological and physical torture.

No protection from torture

The document was obtained through a lawsuit by Democracy Forward, which specifically argued the financial agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. “was created without any legal basis.”

“The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

That case is being overseen by District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg, who also ordered the Trump administration to turn around planes carrying men removed under the wartime law. Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador.",https://highlandcountypress.com/sites/default/files/36998-acd99b42-6825-4670-9083-1cf8208792ba_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:54.510779

Here's where they're happening,Melissa Montalvo,,,,,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article312445163.html,"ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.
ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.
The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program.
However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.
Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.","ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.

The Fresno Bee analyzed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Deportation Data Project, a UC Berkeley Law School initiative.

The data sheds light for the first time on how ICE operates in the Central Valley, such as where administrative arrests have taken place and which demographic groups have been most impacted.

ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.

During the same time period in 2024, ICE made 733 arrests in the six-county region.

While many of these cases are pending, at least 516 individuals have already been deported. Most of these arrests took place in the Fresno and Bakersfield areas, where ICE has sub-field offices.

Bill Ong Hing, founding director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at University of San Francisco, warned that arrests will likely increase throughout the state after last month’s Supreme Court decision that allows immigration agents to conduct “roving patrols.” He said the court’s decision gives ICE the permission to “racially profile.”

“They’re trying every strategy,” he said.

An ICE spokesperson said the agency could not verify or comment on the data compiled by the Deportation Data Project.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” an ICE spokesperson said. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”

This tally is likely an undercount of total ICE apprehensions of Valley residents.

The data only reflects administrative arrests made by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, the division responsible for enforcing immigration law in the country’s interior. Also, not all arrest records in the dataset include details on where an individual was arrested. The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program. Exact location details are unavailable for these arrests.

The data also does not include criminal arrests conducted by ICE or arrests made by other federal law enforcement agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

How many people have been deported from Fresno area?

Roughly half, or 516, of the 1,156 people arrested by ICE in the region have already been deported, data shows.

Most, or 333, of these deportations were from arrests made in Fresno County, followed by Kern County, with 185. (Deportations or removals are classified as: “Deported/Removed - Deportability” or “Excluded/Removed - Inadmissibility” in the chart below.)

Hing said people who have been arrested are probably taken to an ICE detention facility.

“If they sign away their rights, then they’ll be deported, probably within a week or so,” he said.

About 112 of those arrested, have “self-deported,” or returned voluntarily. (These cases are categorized as: “Withdrawal Permitted - I-275 Issued,” “Voluntary Departure Confirmed,” or “VR Witnessed.”)

As of late July, 369 cases remain active, meaning their immigration and removal cases are pending.

Where are people being arrested by ICE in Fresno area?

Most ICE arrests this year have taken place in the Bakersfield and Fresno areas, though the exact locations are unknown and are categorized as “general, non-specific” areas.

However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.

Approximately 21% of these arrests took place in the region’s federal and state prisons as well as county jails.

The top three state prisons for ICE arrests in the six-county region include Avenal, Corcoran and Pleasant Valley. Federal prison arrests took place at FCI Mendota and FCI Atwater, and there was one arrest recorded at the Golden State Annex ICE detention facility.

Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.

ICE arrests of Central Valley residents could take place outside the region, such as if they have hearings at immigration courthouses in San Francisco, Concord or Sacramento.

Hing said he’s aware of at least two Central Valley residents who have been arrested from the immigration courthouse in San Francisco through his involvement with the city’s rapid response network.

About half of all arrests were classified as “located” or “non-custodial arrests” — which the Deportation Data Project said likely indicates arrests made in the community.

Nearly half, or 43%, of total administrative arrests, were part of ICE’s “Criminal Alien Program,” or CAP. This program focuses on the “identification, arrest, and removal of Incarcerated aliens at federal, state, and local levels, as well as at-large criminal aliens,” according to ICE.

Only two individuals have been arrested as part of a workplace enforcement operation — which took place in Kern County in June.

Who is being arrested by ICE in the Central Valley?

Sixty-five percent of those arrested by ICE in the six-county region had previously been convicted of a crime — or 787 out of 1,156. Meanwhile, 112 people arrested by ICE, or 12%, had pending criminal charges.

The remaining 265 individuals arrested, or 23%, only had an immigration violation.

However, nationwide, most people held in ICE detention have no criminal history, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a Syracuse University research project.

A majority, or 61%, of those arrested were from Mexico (713), followed by India (115) and El Salvador (63).

Comeaux told the board in a Tuesday meeting that none of his officers have ever gone out with ICE agents to make an immigration arrest.

DPD chief turns down ICE funding

Comeaux went so far as to claim that he recently turned down a $25 million offer to team up with ICE on immigration enforcement.

Comeaux says misleading social media posts are fueling the false narrative that DPD is assisting ICE in immigration arrests.

He says those videos actually show DPD officers working with U.S. Marshals to help arrest fugitives and sex offenders.

'We don't have the authority'

What they're saying:

""We at DPD are not doing any immigration enforcement. We don't have the authority to do that, nor have we done that, nor will we do that,"" Comeaux said at the meeting.

Questioning from board members prompted Comeaux to reveal the funding he allegedly declined.

""We were contacted by the federal government either last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be part of 287-G, and we said, ‘Absolutely not. No.’ That was me who said that, turned it down,"" Comeaux said.

For now, DPD only assists ICE with requests for securing a perimeter or transport. But Comeaux is worried continued exposure on what he considers a non-issue will turn it into one.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke,"" Comeaux said.

ICE 287-G program

Funding from ICE's 287-G program allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Several North Texas law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE, including the Keller Police Department and several local sheriff's offices.

The federal government hopes others will join. A TV ad currently runs targeting Dallas and Fort Worth law enforcement.

The ad began airing just over a month after ICE held a two-day hiring event in North Texas, which was met with some community backlash.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/screenshot-2025-10-15-163146.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-16 03:01:47.011362

We, as workers, have a common enemy that is raising prices and keeping our wages down consciously—and it’s not your immigrant neighbor.
This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe.","Rumeysa Ozturk’s seizure by plainclothes masked agents outside of her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, in March 2025 had all the hallmarks of a kidnapping. The PhD student, originally from Turkey, was flown to a detention facility in Louisiana, stripped of her F1 student visa, and slated for deportation—all as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration targeting international students for pro-Palestine speech. The draconian arrest sparked outrage among elected officials, advocacy groups, and more. It signaled a frightening escalation—and served as a signal that more was to come.

After two months, however, and due to relentless mobilizing work conducted by a coalition of pro-Palestine activists, free speech advocates, labor organizers, and more, Ozturk was released on bail. She remains free today.

“If you want to know what [rapid response] looks like, it’s getting a call at 10 pm that your member was kidnapped off the street, there’s video of it that’s going to hit the new—and springing into action,” says Dave Foley, president of SEIU Local 509. Foley, whose local represents nearly 30,000 workers in human services and education across Massachusetts, was on the front lines in fighting for Ozturk’s release.

Ozturk’s arrest came as just one of many escalations in the Trump administration’s crusade against immigrants in the United States—including the illegal military occupation of Democratic-controlled cities, the repurposing of prison camps, and the use of detention to third-party nations. However, the expansion of ICE, immigrant detention, and rollbacks to civil liberties that’ve been at the center of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration are not entirely new. They build atop histories of anti-immigrant sentiment and policies—some more recent than others.

“It’s built on other layers of foundation,” says Dr. A. Naomi Paik, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “But the escalation and the rapidity—how quickly this is happening—that feels new.”

Dr. Paik’s research centers immigration and detention within the United States. She is the author of Rightlessness: Testimony and Redress in U.S. Prison Camps Since World War II and Bans, Walls, Raids, Sanctuary: Understanding U.S. Immigration for the Twenty-First Century.

In this August interview, Foley and Paik sat down for a conversation on the evolving threat that escalating immigrant detention poses to our communities—as well as new and historic lessons for our solidarity movements.

This interview has been condensed and edited lightly for clarity.

—Henry Hicks IV

Henry Hicks IV: Dr. Paik, how is what we’re seeing today unprecedented—and in what ways have we been here before?

Dr. A. Naomi Paik: One is the technological advances that have really escalated and accelerated the surveillance of not just migrants but of all of us; and the profiteering from these new surveillance technologies. This has been going on for quite some time, but Big Data and the advancement of AI has accelerated things so much, in such a way that it’s actually hard to keep up with what’s even happening.

In terms of detention, the extraordinary rendition of migrants from United States territory to extraterritorial sites of detention—like CECOT in El Salvador, or Uganda, or even Guantánamo—is new. Having said that, extraterritorial detention itself is not new. During the 1990s, the United States detained Haitian and Cuban migrants at Guantánamo during refugee crises. So, that set the precedent, not only for migrant detention in extraterritorial spaces, but also the indefinite detention of men captured under the War on Terror.

Under Trump, the US is taking migrants from the United States territory. That’s the new thing. [They are taking migrants] to this site now that is now synonymous with torture, whereas before, we would intercept migrants in international waters and then bring them to Guantánamo to prevent them from getting to the United States territory, where they have things like claims to asylum. Again, it’s an advancement. It’s an escalation of ideas that were already there.

HH: Dave, from your perspective as someone who’s doing work on the ground, how is what you’re seeing new?

Dave Foley: [SEIU has] always had connections with the different ICE Watch networks. Where we’re seeing things differently today is statuses being revoked. We had a member of ours on an F-1 student visa. Her F-1 student visa was terminated in a very high-profile, public way—and that’s new to us. It really scared a lot of people. The administration will constantly announce new things that leaves us scrambling.

HH: How are unions and different community groups well-positioned to be doing this kind of resistance work?

DF: Unions are fundamentally built on one-on-one relationships in a workplace. You can move people politically. You can give people a real political education that you can’t do through TV, or ads, or newspapers, or anything like that, in the actual worksite, because you have organic leaders there. So, you might have someone that you know that is a real xenophobe or a real racist, and you figure that they can’t be moved on something like immigration justice, but if anybody can do it, it’s the union steward who sits with them through a disciplinary hearing and saves their job. Or it’s the on-the-ground worksite leader who rallies the rest of the workplace to get a better raise or better rates on the health insurance premiums in a contract. These people can see real leaders, who can then give them a political education.

The other important thing that unions provide is two-way communication, in an organized way. We hear from our members. For instance, when our member was kidnapped off the streets by ICE, we knew about it before anybody did, really, because our steward network was plugged into it and knew to call the union very early, so we could spring into action and provide as much assistance as possible. We’ve got organized lists and can communicate with our members, so we can mobilize and turn people out to a rally or in the streets very, very rapidly—like within 24 hours.

And then, finally, a union like ours, with the size and resources that we have, we’re in a powerful position to actually talk to elected leaders and push them into positions that might make them feel uncomfortable. [We can] leverage the political power that we get from our rank-and-file members and turn our voting power into real political action.

HH: Dr Paik, how have you seen effective resistance movements manifest in prior moments that echo what we’re seeing today?

ANP: A lot of the resistance that we’re seeing—on the streets of DC, in Chicago, with community defense, people coming out on the streets to prevent ICE from taking somebody, or to chase ICE away, or recording them in the Home Depot parking lot—that didn’t come out of nowhere. It [builds] on previous eras and again. It’s not just from Trump 1.0. It’s also from Obama. The formation of those community defense groups, of rapid response networks, of these different kinds of communication—using social media, using email—that has already been built. When Trump got reelected, it could be activated once again.

And there’s muscle memory there—not only in organizing leadership but also just regular people. I am not one of the main organizers of any of the rapid response networks in Chicago, but when the call is made, I am going to show up for the trainings. The fact that they can make the call, that they know where to make it, and that people actually show up, that is, again, that kind of community muscle memory that’s being activated in this moment. People have learned over time what kinds of tactics and what kind of strategies are going to be effective.

In the Obama era, we saw more of this kind of “good immigrant, bad immigrant,” “were they here legally,” “did they commit a crime before,” etc. We should defend immigrants because they’re “good,” and they go to church, and they work hard, and whatever. In this moment, it makes zero sense to make those kinds of arguments—because anybody who is without status or is not a citizen is at risk.

HH: We’re talking about the role that unions are playing in defending immigrants—when citizen workers and immigrants are often positioned against each other. Why is rejecting that narrative of incompatibility so important?

DF: I think it’s something that has to be confronted and rejected very consciously at every opportunity. We have a whole lot more in common with our immigrant neighbors, brothers, sisters, and siblings than we do with those that try to divide us. We, as workers, have a common enemy that is raising prices and keeping our wages down consciously—and it’s not your immigrant neighbor. It is the billionaire who owns your company and probably owns the property that you rent from.

ANP: The kind of “citizen-worker versus immigrant-worker” is a total distraction, and it keeps us fighting each other so that we are not directing our ire where it should be: to the actual culprits who are making our lives worse.

The whole point of having borders is to keep wages low and to keep labor extraction for profit high. This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe. It’s also about our corporations going into poorer places, colonized places, and extracting low wage labor there as well. We have to think about how labor is working globally to extract wealth from the bottom and concentrate it at the top. One of the functions of borders is to divide the global working class.

HH: You described earlier that the practice of detention itself is something that’s happening across borders as well.

ANP: It’s becoming a global industry. Again, there are all these innovative ways of extracting profit from regular people—that don’t necessarily require labor. Our data is one source of profit extraction, and then also social control through things like detention, like policing, like surveillance networks. Those are other ways of extracting profit that don’t require us to work at subminimum wages. This is part of the technology thing that really worries me. They don’t even need to extract our labor. Then what?

DF: If I could add to that: Dr. Paik is saying that there’s no labor cost to this data collection—but that does not mean it’s free. We just saw in the Big Beautiful Bill a massive cut in what will be care work, what will be labor. The cuts that we’re going to see to Medicaid are going to translate into cuts to jobs in the fastest-growing industry in the United States right now, which is care work. And at the same time, we’re going to see a massive amount of money move right into ICE, into the building of new detention centers. Those facilities will be funded by cuts that will cost jobs. That’s the cost.

HH: There’s so much more time to go in this adminitration. How are y’all approaching the long-term nature of this fight? How are y’all thinking about how to withstand the continual escalation of these things over the next three years, at least?

DF: In the labor world, we use two different terms: “mobilizing” and “organizing.” Mobilizing is essentially turning people out, and organizing is really building that infrastructure so that when you need to, you can turn the maximum amount of people out or take the biggest action that you can. We’ve had to mobilize a lot lately, in these past seven months. But the real priority for us, is continual organizing.

No matter who the next president is and which party they come from, we know that we need to push beyond just defending against what Trump has done, and we need to really push for immigration reform—which has never happened in my lifetime. We have so many people in this country that have been waiting and waiting and waiting for justice to happen. We need to use a moment like this to really organize and to build, so that we can get beyond where we have been for my entire life. But you’re right, this is not a sprint. It’s a marathon. There’s a long way to go.

ANP: It’s so hard because the crises that we’re facing are so immense, and they have been building for so long. The roots of the crises that we’re facing go so deep. And so, to really extirpate those roots, it’s going to take so much effort. And it’s going to take everyone’s effort.

DF: It might feel like the forces arrayed against us are limitless, but you can outwork them. They’re not as resilient as us. They don’t work as hard. They’re not used to working as hard. I’ve seen it in so many fights—we can easily be outspent, but we can outwork them time and time and time again.

Ad Policy

HH: Are there prior resistance movements or flash points of community strength that give you hope?

ANP: Going further back, [I think of] the abolitionist movement against slavery. They weren’t just demanding freedom for the enslaved. They wanted to overturn an entire global political economy based on enslaved labor. That’s huge! They were really trying to change the whole world. And they did it. That is remarkable to me. People who were not even considered people overturned an entire global political economic system based on their nonrecognition as humans.

For more recent moments, I think of the summer of 2020. The lesson for me from that summer is that we don’t know how historical change is going to happen, and that it doesn’t necessarily happen in a linear fashion. I did not expect abolitionist thought to become a mainstream news item at all—ever. But it did. We also have to understand that even when movements don’t get the goods in the way that we would have liked to have seen, that they still make meaningful changes that we then build upon.

A lot of people criticize Occupy Wall Street because they weren’t organized enough, they didn’t move things in a certain direction, it didn’t have a durable life—but it gave us the language of “the 1%.” For me as a teacher, before Occupy Wall Street, if I said “the 1%,” no one would know what I’m talking about. I say it now and everyone knows exactly what I’m talking about. All of these movements build on each other and learn from each other.

DF: [I think of several], from the Haitian Revolution to the changes we’re seeing in public opinion when it comes to Israel and Gaza and the genocide. I get a lot of inspiration from historical reminders that popular opinion and people can be moved and they can be changed. Something that seems ubiquitous can change really, really quickly by the actions of very, very brave people.

We are seeing a level of disgust in what the Trump administration is doing, that is drawing people to action. This could be an inflection point. We don’t know where this is going to go, but it’s inspiring to know that this history isn’t written—and that we can shape it.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226092155.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:56:58.310616

A Chicago judge signed an order Wednesday prohibiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from making arrests at Cook County courthouses, citing concerns about ""fear or obstruction"" while suspected illegal immigrants attend court proceedings.

Local officials in the Midwest sanctuary city, which the Trump administration has targeted in its federal immigration crackdown, claimed people were avoiding court because they were afraid of being detained.

JUDGE ALLOWS ICE TO CONTINUE COURTHOUSE ARRESTS IN NEW YORK CITY FOLLOWING LEGAL CHALLENGE

Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans reportedly said justice ""depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction"" in his decision.

The Trump administration in June launched an initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings.

The tactic stirred controversy, with critics claiming migrants seeking legal citizenship would be less likely to show up to hearings, and those arrested after hearings may not have additional criminal histories.

FEDERAL JUDGE LIMITS ICE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE

Videos of the arrests went viral on social media, with some accusing ICE of ""kidnapping"" migrants.

In September, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit in New York City regarding the practice, though a federal judge ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to suggest ICE's courthouse arrest policy changes were ""unexplained, arbitrary and capricious"" after 2021 guidance allowed arrests at or near immigration courts.

""Every day, our members are forced to choose between being kidnapped and/or put into expedited removal or risking deeper legal consequences because they're too scared to go to court,"" Diana Konaté, deputy executive director of Policy and Advocacy at African Communities Together, wrote in a statement published by the ACLU related to the New York City case.

""This is exactly what the administration intended—for people to be so fearful of enforcement that they forfeit the very resources and systems in place to protect them,"" Konaté added.

DESTINY TORRES, BYLINE: The county typically uses state of emergency funding to help with natural disasters like flooding, earthquakes and fires. But county officials are hoping to help stabilize neighborhoods that have been hurt by ICE enforcement. LA County has nearly 950,000 immigrants without legal status, or 9% of the region's population. The Trump administration has been cracking down on undocumented immigrants in cities across the country and is conducting deportations. According to county officials, the raids have caused fear, disruption to local businesses and lost wages for immigrant workers who are afraid to go out in public. The declaration itself doesn't say how the funding would be used, but supervisor Lindsey Horvath says it will allow the county to respond quickly to the growing crisis.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDSEY HORVATH: It means Los Angeles County can move faster, coordinate better and use every tool available to support and stabilize our communities.

TORRES: The declaration allows the county to seek financial aid from the state. Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the one dissenting vote on Tuesday. She said in a statement that a local state of emergency is not the way to address the fear among immigrant communities. She calls it a symbolic gesture that could open up the county to litigation, which the county can't afford. Supervisor Janice Hahn says the move is not symbolic but critical to the county's response moving forward to better support its residents.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JANICE HAHN: We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers were taken from their workplaces, and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on the table.

TORRES: The declaration remains in place until the board moves to end it. For NPR News, I'm Destiny Torres in Los Angeles.

POLITICO’s exclusive reporting on a Young Republican group chat filled with racist epithets and hateful jokes reverberated Tuesday across the country, resulting in mounting condemnation and more chat members out of their jobs.

Peter Giunta lost his post as state Assemblymember Mike Reilly’s chief of staff, Playbook reported.

Joe Maligno was out as an employee of the New York State Unified Court System.

Vermont’s Republican governor and GOP lawmakers called on state Sen. Sam Douglass to resign.

The Kansas Republican Party announced that the Kansas Young Republicans, where William Hendrix was a leader, were inactive.

That’s on top of what happened before the story published: Hendrix lost his job with Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, and Bobby Walker’s offer to join NY-19 congressional candidate Peter Oberacker’s campaign was effectively revoked.

In the chat — 2,900 pages of which were leaked and reviewed by POLITICO — Giunta joked: “Everyone that votes no is going to the gas chamber.”

Maligno responded, “Can we fix the showers? Gas chambers don’t fit the Hitler aesthetic.”

The remarks — a look into how a group of Young Republicans talk in private and the coarsening rhetoric in the Trump era — drew swift rebukes from Republicans and Democrats.

But not from Vice President JD Vance. He broke with Republicans who broadly condemned the comments within the chat.

On X Tuesday night, Vance drew attention to Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones, who texted a colleague about shooting the then-Republican House speaker and wishing harm on his children.

“This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia,” Vance wrote with a screenshot of the text exchange. “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”

Maligno, Hendrix and Douglass did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In separate statements, both Giunta and Walker apologized for the messages they wrote in the Telegram chat but questioned whether they had been altered or taken out of context. They also attempted to blame the release of their chat on the New York Young Republican Club, a political group that operates at the city level and which is often at odds with the state group.

“I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat that I created during my campaign to lead the Young Republicans,” Giunta said. “These logs were sourced by way of extortion and provided to POLITICO by the very same people conspiring against me in what appears to be a highly-coordinated year-long character assassination led by Gavin Wax and the New York City Young Republican Club.”

Walker struck a similar tone.

“There is no excuse for the language and tone in messages attributed to me. The language is wrong and hurtful, and I sincerely apologize,” he said. “It’s troubling that private exchanges were obtained and released in a way clearly intended to inflict harm, and the circumstances raise real questions about accuracy and motive but none of that excuses the language. This has been a painful lesson about judgment and trust.”

Wax declined POLITICO’s request for comment.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler condemned their chat remarks, as his Democratic rivals circulated photos of him with Giunta and Walker.

“The deeply offensive and hateful comments reportedly made in a private chat among members of the New York State Young Republicans are disgusting,” Lawler said via his spokesperson Ciro Riccardi.

Several racial minorities were slurred in the private Telegram group chat, and congressional Democrats aren’t standing for it.

“When we say white supremacy is thriving on the right, they call us reactionary,” Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said on X. “Give me a break. The future of the Republican Party proudly embraces bigotry that belongs in the past, and every American needs to recognize how dangerous that is.”

Rep. Grace Meng, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement to POLITICO that “their willingness to engage in such vile rhetoric behind closed doors speaks volumes to their character and the tone set by our nation’s leaders.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries posted an image of POLITICO’s article on Instagram and wrote: “These are sick people. Every single one of these racists and antisemites must be publicly exposed and held accountable.” — Emily Ngo

ABOVE THE FOLD

TRUMP TO CITY: DROP DEAD: President Donald Trump once again threatened to cut off New York from federal funds if the “communist” Mamdani wins the mayoral race.

“If somebody wins and has no chance of ever having a great economy because of that philosophy, you would put a halt to what we’re doing,” Trump said at a lunch Tuesday with Argentine President Javier Milei.

Trump slammed Mamdani several times over the course of the nearly hour-long press availability, insisting incorrectly that the democratic socialist Mamdani is a communist.

“I’m not going to send a lot of money to New York. I don’t have to. You know, the money comes all through the White House,” he said. “And if they’re going to be sending us stupid policies, I mean, communist policies… we’re not going to ruin one of our great cities.”

Trump also took a shot at Mamdani’s opponents, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, saying “it’s a fluke if (Mamdani) gets in” because “there are a lot of failed people that he’s running against.”

Asked about Trump’s comments, Mamdani brushed it off as nothing new — Trump is already hurting New York by trying to pull infrastructure funding in retaliation for the government shutdown.

But if Trump tries while Mamdani is mayor, he said he’d go to the courts.

“We will continue to receive funding from the federal government, and that’s not because of President Trump’s generosity. That’s because it is the law,” he said. “And just because he utters something does not make it the law.”

Hochul, meanwhile, suggested she’d appeal to Trump’s own interests if he tried.

“There’s no person who’s ever sat in the Oval Office who understands more than Donald Trump that New York City is the economic engine for the entire state,” she said. “This is detrimental to his properties, business interests, his friends in the city, and a whole way of life that perhaps he may need to come back to.“ — Jeff Coltin

CITY HALL: THE LATEST

QUEENS BOY, NOT A QUEENS COLLEGE BOY: Cuomo’s past attempts to cut state aid to the City University of New York are raising questions about his commitment to public universities in a race centered on affordability.

CUNY endured decades of declining state aid, including during the former governor’s tenure from 2011 until 2021 — a trend the state has started to reverse.

POLITICO spoke to 16 people, including city and state lawmakers, former state and CUNY officials, and students and advocates, who portrayed a record of neglect toward public higher education — a history they argued bodes poorly for the university if he becomes mayor.

Read more from POLITICO’s Madina Touré on how Cuomo treated CUNY “as the foster child he never really wanted.”

CRYPTOKEEPER: Nearly four years after converting his first paycheck to cryptocurrency, Mayor Eric Adams created the new New York City Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain on Tuesday.

A City Hall spokesperson said the announcement had nothing to do with cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce’s massive, $1.1 million donation to a pro-Adams super PAC and his gushing compliments about the mayor, and that the insinuation they’re connected “doesn’t make sense.” In fact, the spox said, City Hall’s been planning to launch it for months.

Alex Sommer, who advises crypto clients at Tusk Strategies, welcomed the news.

“Plenty of cities are clamoring to be home to this booming industry so it makes sense for the city to stake its claim,” he said. “It’ll obviously be up to the next mayor to see this through, but elevating New York with all the attention in D.C. should be helpful.” — Jeff Coltin

NEW FROM PLANET ALBANY

DEREGULATION TIME: Hochul’s plan to review unnecessary or outdated state regulations is potentially music to the ears of her allies at The New York Business Council.

The lobby group last month issued a report that decried the regulatory environment in New York that it argued is choking private sector investment.

“We have work to do,” Business Council President Heather Mulligan said. “But this report shows that we are all willing to work together with state leaders to address these challenges and make necessary changes to enhance our business climate, quality of life, and ultimately, strengthen our economic competitiveness to improve economic opportunities for all New Yorkers.”

Last week, Hochul’s top budget adviser requested state agency and department chiefs draft up lists of regulations for potential elimination. Some of these regulations are more than a century old and concern outdated modes of transportation like steamboats.

The regulatory push is a layup for the Democratic governor, who is running for reelection next year and has tried to show voters she’s focused on issues like affordability. It will be very easy for her campaign a year from now to boast about eliminating bothersome rules and regulations — stealing a Republican-sounding talking point along the way. — Nick Reisman

A FRIEND OF THE SENATE: Christopher Friend was appointed the top budget aide to state Senate Democrats. He replaces David Friedfel, who announced plans to depart the job earlier this year.

Friend has worked for the Senate Democrats for the last six years. He’s taking over the role ahead of a potentially tough state budget season as New York officials absorb federal aid cuts and prepare to run for reelection. — Nick Reisman

KEEPING UP WITH THE DELEGATION

RYAN’S FUNDRAISING: Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan today will report raising more than $1 million across a trio of campaign committees, according to details exclusively shared with Playbook.

The swing seat Hudson Valley lawmaker’s haul includes his main campaign committee and a pair of PACs, including the group he formed this year to aid down-ballot Democrats with public service backgrounds.

Ryan’s principal campaign committee will report raising more than $800,000 in the most recent fundraising period. His cash-on-hand total stands at more than $2.2 million.

The healthy fundraising clip stands to help Ryan as he prepares to run for a third term and potentially scare off rivals in the sprawling House district. — Nick Reisman

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay.
ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.
“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit.
Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration.","A coalition of legal organizations and undocumented immigrants has filed suit in Los Angeles challenging an ICE policy that authorizes the “routine” jailing and deportation of noncitizen survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, according to court papers obtained Wednesday.

The suit filed Tuesday by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law and others contends the policy “violates the very legal protections, crafted by Congress and passed with bipartisan support, that were designed to shield vulnerable adults and children from harm.”

The plaintiffs also allege in Los Angeles federal court that ICE “routinely imprisons and deports immigrant survivors who have been formally granted the right to remain in the U.S.” and “regularly deports survivors of trafficking and other serious crimes without carrying out the required legal review to determine if they are eligible for protections that Congress specifically created to keep survivors safe from deportation.”

A message requesting comment sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately answered Wednesday.

According to the lawsuit, the government’s practices are harming “vulnerable survivors,” including Yessenia Ruano, who says she came to the United States from El Salvador seeking safety from human trafficking in 2011 and worked as a teacher’s aid in Milwaukee until June 2025, when she says she was forced by ICE to self-deport.

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay. ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.

Ruano returned to her home country with her U.S. citizen children.

“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit. “They said that if I didn’t go on my own, they would hunt me down and find me, and that I would be separated from my daughters, detained and deported. I was in turmoil, because I also could not face being taken away from my kids and imprisoned.”

To address the fear that frequently prevents immigrant survivors from seeking help due to the threat of deportation, Congress created the U and T visa programs in 2000 through its renewal of the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act.

Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration. The lawsuit’s plaintiffs allege the administration of President Donald Trump “is actively denying and unlawfully dismantling these vital protections, all in the service of illegal enforcement actions that ignore the law.”",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LPT-L-DOWNTOWN-PROTEST-0612-KB19.jpg?w=1024&h=475,N,,2025-10-15 23:57:13.130939

Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside courthouses has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The US Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a Wednesday statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July, when representatives said they’ve seen US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed on to a petition earlier this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a Wednesday statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

“Our courthouses remain places where all people — regardless of their background or circumstance — should be able to safely and confidently participate in the judicial process,” Evans said in a statement.

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations, and has drawn lawsuits from some statesand the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Questioned about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol statewide. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done,” Welch said. “These should be safe spaces.”

Republicans questioned their opponents’ sincerity. Debating a resolution condemning political violence, GOP Rep. Adam Niemerg noted incendiary language from Gov. JB Pritzker — in the spring he called for “street fighters” to oppose the administration — although the governor has not espoused violence. Rep. Nicole La Ha, who said she has received death threats, accused Democrats of trying to stifle opposition.

“This is not a stand against violence,” La Ha said. “It is a tasteless tactic to punish dissent and difference of opinion.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use on protesters

Meanwhile, Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed chase on a residential street on Chicago’s South Side.

A few protesters also gathered Wednesday afternoon outside an ICE facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, where a fence that has been at the center of a recent lawsuit had come down.

A judge ordered ICE to remove the fence after the village of Broadview sued federal authorities for “illegally” erecting an 8-foot-tall fence outside the facility, blocking public streets and creating problems for local emergency services trying to access the area. On Monday, state legislators and Black mayors of nearby suburbs gathered outside the facility to demand the fence be removed and announce an executive order limiting protests in the area to designated zones. Trump has long targeted Black mayors in large Democratic cities, many of whom have voiced solidarity with one another in recent months amid federal interventions in their areas.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents in their areas.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events across the city and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three children detained earlier this month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25288654664026.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-15 19:02:18.839079

The conservative justices, who make up most of the bench, appear sympathetic to the case that Louisiana’s congressional map – which added a second majority-Black district after a Voting Rights Act lawsuit – violates the constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative, pressed Janai Nelson, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was defending the map, as to why section 2 was still needed.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases, but they should not be indefinite and should have an endpoint. What exactly do you think that endpoint should be?” he said.

The chief justice, John Roberts, a conservative but swing vote on the court, pressed Nelson on what the proper role of race in redistricting was.

“What’s the proper size?” he said. “Is it wiggle room we’re talking about or a significant percentage?”

Neil Gorsuch, another conservative justice, appeared skeptical of the use of race in redistricting.

“One argument is often, ‘Well, once you found a section 2 violation, you’ve got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map,’” he said.

2. Getting rid of section 2 would be ‘catastrophic’ for Black voters, lawyers said

Nelson was asked by Justice Elena Kagan what the consequences would be if the court got rid of section 2.

“I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson said. She went on to say that many of the Black representatives in Louisiana alone were elected from districts that exist because of the Voting Rights Act. “Any further neutering of section 2 would resurrect the 15th amendment as a mere parchment promise.”

J Benjamin Aguiñaga, the solicitor general of Louisiana, pushed back, saying: “I think there’s been a lot of sky-is-falling rhetoric from the other side in this case. I don’t know what our legislature would do if the court rules in our favor … I don’t think the sky is going to fall.” He said that Republicans would not necessarily wipe out both the majority-Black districts in Louisiana, which elected Democrats last year, because doing so could make Republican districts more competitive.

3. There was a lot of wrangling over a similar case from 2023

There was a lot of back and forth on Wednesday over Allen v Milligan, a 2023 supreme court case in which the justices said section 2 of the Voting Rights Act required Alabama to add a second majority-Black district.

Nelson told the justices that Milligan was “a nearly identical case”. At another point during the arguments, Justice Kagan pointed out that many of the arguments Louisiana and white voters challenging the map were making were ones the court had already rejected in Milligan.

The message to the rest of the justices was clear – it was an effort to remind them that siding with Louisiana in this case would essentially amount to overturning precedent set just two years ago.

“This court said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one, that calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a unique way. My opponents here have not done the labor of showing that precedent should be overturned,” Nelson said.

Recognizing that challenge, Roberts said Milligan “took the existing precedent as a given and considered Alabama’s application of its approach to the evidence”. It was a subtle but potentially significant remark that signaled he might be open to reconsidering the precedent in Milligan.

4. Louisiana argued that race-based redistricting is unconstitutional

Aguiñaga said in his opening argument: “Race-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our constitution.” He added that racial stereotypes were a consequence of the practice.

“They assume, for example, that a Black voter, simply because he is Black, must think like other Black voters, share the same interests and prefer the same political candidates, and this stereotyping system has no logical endpoint.”

Edward Greim, a lawyer for white voters who challenged Louisiana’s map, told the justices: “In today’s America, voters like the appellees are still being racially stereotyped to place them into single-member districts. If it was ever acceptable under our color-blind constitution to do this, it was never intended to continue indefinitely.”

5. Justice Kavanaugh appeared interested in a proposal that would make it harder to challenge districts

Throughout the arguments, Kavanaugh repeatedly asked lawyers to address a proposal from the justice department that would reconfigure the test plaintiffs need to go through to win a section 2 lawsuit.

Part of that test requires plaintiffs to show they can draw a reasonably configured alternative district that gives the minority group a chance to elect their preferred candidate. The solicitor general’s proposal would add an additional layer to that test. It would require the challengers to show an illustrative district that also meets the political goals of mapmakers.

Such a requirement would be essentially impossible to meet, especially in the US south, where voting is often highly racially polarized, Nicholas Stephanopolous, an election law expert and professor at Harvard, wrote in a blogpost earlier this month.

“Suppose the [solicitor general]’s position were adopted and Louisiana (the home of Callais) decided to get rid of both of its congressional minority-opportunity districts in order to craft an all-Republican map. Any section 2 plaintiff would then have to prove that a reasonably configured, majority-minority district could be drawn while preserving the plan’s all-Republican delegation,” he wrote. “In all likelihood, this showing couldn’t be made because, under conditions of severely racially polarized voting, any majority-minority district would almost certainly elect a Democrat, not a Republican.”

6. Progressive voting groups said the court’s decision could cost Democrats a significant number of House seats

The supreme court is considering the case as Republicans make a nationwide push to redraw district lines to shore up their advantage in the US House ahead of the 2026 midterms. The aggressive effort is unusual and has been criticized as an anti-democratic effort to prevent GOP politicians from being held accountable to voters.

It could cost Democrats about 12 seats in the House, according to a New York Times analysis. A report by two progressive voting rights groups put the number of seats at risk even higher, at 19.

Reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents near St. Jerome Catholic Church in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood on Oct. 12 prompted warnings of caution from its pastor, although a spokesperson for ICE denied the church was targeted, NBC Chicago reported. The news outlet reported that neighbors have resorted to forming human chains to help Catholic migrants fearful of ICE go to and leave Sunday Mass so they could worship and receive the sacraments.

In February, more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to challenge a Trump administration policy that rescinded long-standing restrictions on ICE agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

The lawsuit, in which Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection represented the plaintiffs, argued the new policy sparked fear of ICE raids both in their own congregations and in the populations they serve, lowering attendance at worship services and curtailing their ability to serve the less fortunate.

In April, a judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, but the lawsuit is ongoing.

In September, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops submitted an amicus brief, sometimes called a friend-of-the-court brief, to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to support the plaintiffs' argument that the changes to the policy have put their congregations in an ""untenable position.""

""They either increase the risk to their congregants of harmful enforcement action by maintaining the obligation to attend weekly services, or limit the provision of in-person religious services to their congregants in response to the imminent threat of an enforcement action, and their congregants' well-founded fears thereof,"" it said.

Asked for comment, a spokesperson directed OSV News to the text of the amicus brief.

ICE has argued that the policy changes will help them deter criminal activity. In a previous statement about the lawsuit over those changes to OSV News, Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for public affairs, said, ""We are protecting our schools, places of worship, and Americans who attend by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn't go inside under the previous Administration.""

""DHS's directive gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs,"" McLaughlin.

But faith groups are not the only ones who have expressed concern about the rollback. An Oct. 14 report from Axios said health care workers have raised alarm about the same policy rollback, and that ""stepped-up enforcement is interfering with care in some instances."" LAist reported federal immigration agents have interfered in care or efforts to provide medical privacy to detainees.

The sensitive locations policy is among the religious liberty concerns some Catholic immigration advocates have expressed about recent immigration enforcement policy actions.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation's duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

As a group, Catholics in the U.S. are deeply connected to immigrant populations and are the single largest group of Christians directly affected by the U.S. mass deportation campaign.

A joint report by the National Association of Evangelicals, the USCCB's Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025.

Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of deportation. The Christians most at risk of deportation are Catholics, 61% of the total.

Another 7 million Christians who are U.S. citizens live in the same household as someone at risk of deportation.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). Pew also found that eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics were either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

The Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful in May that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being, according to the church's own teaching and canon law.

Police in some Texas cities get a heads up before ICE raids and arrests. Austin is not one of them.

In an interview with The Texas Newsroom, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said they are not warned ahead of time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to conduct sweeps in city limits. Davis said this lack of communication causes confusion and threatens to create dangerous misunderstandings between local and federal law enforcement agencies.

People who witness ICE arrests have even reported them as assaults or kidnappings, she added, prompting local police to investigate what happened. Davis said APD often only finds out about raids at all because of the public attention they draw.

The Travis County Sheriff’s Office said it also doesn’t hear about impending immigration raids.

“We are not notified, but that's not unusual,” Kristen Dark, senior public information officer for the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview. “State and federal agencies have no obligation to notify us when they're conducting operations in our jurisdiction.”

There have been several raids in the Austin area this year, including one in East Austin near a construction site that resulted in multiple arrests. Federal and state officers were involved in that raid.

Aggressive public sweeps like this have become a hallmark of the second Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. In some places, local law enforcement has provided support to federal agents to carry out raids. In others, ICE has accused city police of refusing to help.

Notification has been inconsistent nationwide. In June, Los Angeles police said they were not informed ahead of raids in that city. That same month, city and county law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska, said they were notified, with deputies backing up operations with traffic enforcement.

The Texas Newsroom reached out to police departments and county sheriffs’ offices across the state to learn more about their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Their answers revealed that ICE also provides advance notice to some local agencies in the state, while keeping silent with others.

In the Houston area, the sheriff is ""frequently"" given advanced notice of large-scale immigration operations “for situation awareness,” Communications Advisor Jason Spencer said in an email. “The Harris County Sheriff’s Office is in frequent communication with our counterparts at all local, state, and federal agencies, including DPS and ICE.”

The Houston Police Department was less open in explaining its relationship with federal immigration officials.

“We do not comment about other agencies' policies,” Spokesperson Shay Awosiyan said. He declined to answer follow-up questions.

El Paso Police Spokesperson Adrian Cisneros said they have “a working partnership” with law enforcement agencies at multiple levels, including ICE, but declined to elaborate. He too said “we're not speaking on behalf of other agencies.""

Police and sheriffs’ offices in Bexar and Dallas did not respond to questions.

Some departments coordinate with ICE, which can facilitate communication. Sheriff’s officers in Hays County, for example, actively partnered on a raid earlier this year that led to the arrest of dozens of men and women.

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office also partners more closely with federal law enforcement than many of its peers. It is the only one of the five most populous Texas counties to pen a formal agreement, through what’s called the 287(g) program, with ICE to enhance collaboration with state and local law enforcement partners. A sheriff’s office spokesperson said all questions about this coordination should be directed to ICE.

The federal agency did not respond to questions about why some law enforcement agencies were notified about immigration actions and others are not.

The lack of notification may be due in part to a lack of cooperation. Many big city police departments in Texas and elsewhere have preferred to keep the agency at arm’s length.

In Austin, the police chief said officers are required by state law to notify ICE if a background check indicates that a suspect may be in the county without legal status. But she added officers do not typically ask a suspect's immigration status.

“Our priorities are violent crime here in this city, crime prevention,” Davis said. “It’s not about immigration.”

She said while advance notification of big ICE operations would be useful, she does not want Austin police to work more closely with the agency.

“The Hispanic population is one that does not trust law enforcement to begin with,” Davis said.

Karen Cocq, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network highlighted:

The government is trying to skirt around the overwhelming opposition to C-2 by repackaging it as something new.

U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith in September ruled that the Department of Homeland Security directive making enforcement of Trump’s immigration agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief grants was unconstitutional and harmful to states and their residents.

Yet Smith found the department has continued to attach the condition to FEMA grants as part of a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make” or else risk losing funding already appropriated by Congress.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids,” Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in a ruling Tuesday.

R.I. federal judge strikes down Trump edict tying federal disaster aid to immigration

A filing by a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general that sued the department over the grant conditions in May accused the Trump administration of violating Smith’s order. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading the case, Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The Oct. 8 motion asking Smith to enforce the order noted that states and municipalities in late September received award letters in which FEMA “copy-pasted the contested conditions” with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

“Plaintiff States are, as a result, still required to certify, as a condition of obtaining federal funds,” they wrote.

AGs attached letters received by emergency management agencies in California, Colorado and Illinois. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency has not received any letters with the immigration language as of Wednesday, spokesperson Courtney Marciano said in an interview.

Smith ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permanently stop enforcing immigration conditions against plaintiff states and that the agency must amend grant awards within seven days to remove language related to complying with federal immigration law.

A Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for inquiry on whether officials intend to comply with the new court order.

The Trump administration argued in an Oct. 10 court filing that it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and was only seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions should the ruling be overturned.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. “The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”

But Smith in his ruling Tuesday said that no matter how confident the Trump administration may be of their chances of appeal, the contested conditions at the moment are unlawful.

“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote.

Neronha commended Smith’s latest ruling against what he called “blatant overreach” by the Trump administration in ignoring the September court order.

“Whether it’s a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or some other enforcement, the courts are holding up,” he said in a statement. “And we will continue fighting for the American people for as long as this administration puts them in harm’s way.”

Besides Rhode Island and Illinois, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also part of the case.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2023Flood.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 17:01:39.714635

It was unclear whether the removal was temporary or permanent.

The removal complies with an order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt of the Northern District of Illinois, who set a temporary restraining order after finding that ICE had erected the fence on municipal property without getting necessary permissions, exceeding its authority.

“The law, including municipal law, applies even to the federal government,” said Village of Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson in a statement.

“This is a victory for the rule of law in a country that is still a democracy,” Thompson said in the statement.

“And it is a victory for Broadview residents and businesses who depend on their municipal government to assure public safety.”

Hunt ruled that ICE violated local safety codes by restricting first responders’ access and that the fence caused irreparable harm to public safety. The gate, which is 16 feet wide, is smaller than the 20-foot requirement set by the International Fire Code adopted by the village.

“DHS’s Beach Street gate creates a quasi-federal zone where the Village’s ability to respond to emergencies is hindered and only allows it to provide lifesaving services at the whims and fancies of the Federal Defendants,” the ruling stated.

For more information, please visit www.democracyforward.org About the American Immigration Council","Washington, D.C, October 15 — Today, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the American Immigration Council, and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, demanding the release of critical records the government has unlawfully withheld about arrests at immigration courts and the dismissal of immigration cases.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

Since May 20, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) and Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), have been taking part in a coordinated effort to detain noncitizens appearing for hearings in immigration courts nationwide.

Arresting people who voluntarily show up for their immigration court dates in search of protection is a deeply problematic practice. Immigration courts are not criminal courts and are supposed to be places that guarantee fair hearings, not act as pipelines into detention. When those who show up seeking a fair day in court are instead arrested, it undermines core tenets of our democracy, discourages people from pursuing their legal rights, and inflicts serious human costs.

Additionally, ICE attorneys have been asking immigration judges to dismiss cases and shift people into expedited removal, a fast-track process with fewer due process protections and no path to permanent residence. The EOIR, the agency which runs the immigration courts, has directed immigration judges to grant these dismissals on the spot, even though this violates agency policy and long-standing practice.

Seeking to better understand how and why arrests at immigration courts are taking place, LatinoJustice and the American Immigration Council filed a total of 11 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, six with the EOIR and five with ICE on July 28 and 29, 2025. The requests seek basic information about arrests and dismissals around immigration courts, and communications between and within the agencies coordinating these activities. LatinoJustice and the Council also asked for these requests to be handled quickly through expedited processing.

Yet to date, the government has failed to provide timely and adequate responses to ten of these FOIA requests, in violation of the law. The EOIR has declared that it cannot find any guidance it issued to immigration judges about dismissing cases and courthouse arrests, even though a copy of applicable guidance has been leaked to the public. The EOIR has also refused to even search for records about the extent of its coordination with ICE, while ICE has ignored or delayed the processing of all the requests to it.

“Our FOIA requests seek to shine a light on how ICE operates in immigration courts, where families are fighting to keep their families together and for their future,” said Rex Chen, supervising counsel for Immigrant Rights at LatinoJustice PRLDEF. “Instead of transparency, they have chosen secrecy, stonewalling or have provided inadequate responses to our request. It is unacceptable to prolong this urgent matter.”

“Families’ futures are on the line. That’s why we need to better understand how these arrests at immigration courts are being carried out, and the degree to which supposedly independent and neutral agencies like the EOIR are pushing a mass deportation agenda. The public has a right to know what the EOIR and ICE are doing behind closed doors,” said Chris Opila, staff attorney for transparency at the American Immigration Council.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

“The public has a right to know when our government rewrites the rules to make mass arrests and deny people of due process — especially inside the very courtrooms meant to deliver justice,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is separately litigating to challenge these arrests. “The administration cannot hide guidance that turns immigration courts into traps and accelerates deportations without fair hearings. We will not allow these agencies to operate in the shadows. Transparency is the first safeguard against abuse of power, and we’re in court to demand accountability.”

The lawsuit seeks to compel the four agencies to comply fully with FOIA and turn over all the documents responsive to 7 of the requests. It also demands the expedited disclosure of guidance directives and correspondence between ICE and the EOIR.

Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.","Hamden’s mayor, town council president, and two dozen immigrant rights activists and fellow politicians gathered on Dixwell Avenue Wednesday afternoon to denounce an ICE raid that took place at a nearby car wash Wednesday morning.

Still looking for answers as to what exactly happened, the elected officials said that federal agents seized a total of eight people.

An eyewitness to the raid, meanwhile, said she saw at least 10 agents show up — some wearing masks and tactical gear — and described a man being slammed to the ground and a woman being hauled away into an unmarked van.

Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett said at Wednesday’s press conference at the Keefe Community Center that the raid happened at the Optimo Car Wash, located at 1126 Dixwell Ave., at approximately 10:20 a.m.

She said that, as part of this raid, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained a mother and father while their kids were in school.

“The acts from the administration and ICE are deplorable, they are disgusting, they are not what we represent in Hamden,” Garrett said. “People are living in fear because of an inhumane presidency.”

Wednesday afternoon’s presser was also attended by Hamden Legislative Council President Dominique Baez and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker, among a host of state legislators, pastors, and immigrant rights advocates.

One of the speakers at the presser identified herself only by her first name, Rachel, and said she was at the car wash Wednesday morning when the raid took place.

She said that, while she was at the car wash, she heard “tires screeching to a halt.” When she ran to the window to see what was happening, she said she saw at least 10 ICE agents, many of whom were wearing masks and tactical gear. She heard the girl who works at the front desk scream.

She said she saw a “man who was slammed to the ground.”

When she asked the man if he was OK, Rachel said, an ICE agent “got in my face and said I would end up just like him” if she interfered. She said she saw an ICE agent haul the girl who screamed into an unmarked van.

An employee at NE Motors, which sits right next door to the car wash, told the Independent on Wednesday that she also saw the raid play out, and that she saw a bunch of people get tackled. She said that, after ICE took people away, the car wash was left open and people’s stuff were strewn about. She identified Rachel as a neighbor of the car wash, and said that Rachel and other staff helped close up the car wash after the raid.

The ICE raid was partially captured on video and posted on Instagram by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition. The video’s caption states that seven people were “confirmed” to have been detained by ICE officers around 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA) organizer John Lugo went to Optimo Car Wash after hearing about the incident. He told the Independent Wednesday that he heard that ICE agents surrounded the store and seized seven people, including a ULA member. He said he was also told that a client of the car wash confronted ICE officers, who then tried to arrest her. Lugo was unsure if the client had actually been arrested.

Garrett drove to Optimo after hearing that ICE had detained people there. She said in a separate interview with the Independent that witnesses to the incident told her that seven people were taken, while the Hamden Police Department told her they heard the number was eight.

“We’re in the middle of contacting family members of those detained,” added Garrett.

Tina Colón Williams, the lawyer representing previously ICE-detained Wilbur Cross student Esdrás Zabaleta-Ramirez, learned about the incident from the family member of someone who was detained. “It’s all very sudden, and we’re still figuring out what’s going on,” said Colón Williams in an interview with the Independent. She heard either eight or nine people were seized.

Garrett convened the press conference about the incident at the Keefe Community Center in Hamden at 2:30 p.m. Roughly 30 people attended the presser.

Rev. Emily Scott from First Presbyterian Church in New Haven said that one person who was taken was a customer, and not a worker. She said that when she and the New Haven Immigrants Coalition showed up Wednesday morning, “the entire staff was gone with no trace.” Doors were locked and no one was there to talk with them.

At 2:58 p.m. Wednesday., U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.

“Right now, I am focused on confirming the safety and status of those who were detained during the raid on a Hamden car wash today, as well as their family members, some of whom are school-age children,” she is quoted as saying in that press release. “The aggressive tactics used by ICE and endorsed by President Trump have escalated tensions with communities here and across the country, exacerbating fear. They are not making Americans any safer. I will continue to engage with local leaders and law enforcement to understand the basis for this raid and to ensure that the rights of these individuals and all Connecticut residents are respected.”

On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing.","Immigration judges are continuing to deny bond hearings for detainees in Iowa and throughout the country, despite being repeatedly overruled by federal district court judges.

Five weeks ago, immigration judges across the country formally adopted the U.S. Department of Justice’s new legal position that detainees suspected of entering the country illegally can be held in jail indefinitely without being afforded a hearing on whether they’re entitled to release on bond while their case is pending.

The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.

The board’s decision endorsing that view has upended decades of past practice in which immigration judges — who are not part of the judicial branch, and are instead part of the executive branch and the DOJ — released individuals on bond in cases where the detainees were not considered a flight risk or a danger to the public.

In the past few months, hundreds of detainees have sought relief by seeking the intervention of U.S. District Court judges, arguing that being held under such circumstances is a violation of their right to due process.

In an overwhelming number of such cases, the federal judges have sided with the detainees, ordering the immigration judges to hold bond hearings at which the detainees can argue that their history, employment, family obligations or other circumstances warrant their temporary release on bond.

Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.

More Iowa detainees seek court intervention

Among the most recent Iowa cases is that of Filemon Brito Barrajas, a citizen of Mexico who says he has lived in the United States for 20 years without legal status. Court records indicate Barrajas had no criminal record until July of this year, when he was jailed on a charge of contempt of court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then issued a detainer for him, keeping him in jail after he’d served his sentence for contempt.

On Aug. 18, 2025, Barrajas requested a bond hearing, but was denied by an immigration judge who concluded he lacked jurisdiction, echoing the DOJ’s position on the issue.

Barrajas then took the matter to U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem, as well as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ and the Omaha Immigration Court.

Attorneys for Barrajas argued he was entitled to a hearing on the question of bond and that, in the alternative, he should be released from custody.

On Sept. 23, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa ordered that such a hearing be scheduled by the immigration court within seven days.

“District courts across the country have addressed arguments similar to – and often identical to – the ones raised here,” Locher wrote in his decision. “The overwhelming majority of these courts have concluded that aliens in the petitioners’ situation are … entitled to bond hearings.”

Locher’s decision was similar to that of many other judges in that while he found that Barrajas was entitled to argue for his release on bond, the issue of whether bond should be granted was for the immigration court, not a U.S. District Court judge, to decide.

“It is not the court’s prerogative to assume the role of the immigration judge by deciding bond or detention,” Locher wrote.

Another recent Iowa case involves Marua Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States, according to her lawyers, to escape some form of persecution. Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.

But on Sept. 2, 2025, while attending her regularly scheduled check-in appointment at the ICE office in Cedar Rapids, ICE officials allegedly canceled her notice to appear in immigration court, entered an order calling for her expedited removal from the country, and had her detained in the Muscatine County Jail.

On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing. A week later, on Oct. 7, 2025, attorneys for Reyes sought an emergency hearing on the matter in U.S. District Court, arguing the immigration court had violated her due process rights by denying her a hearing.

On Tuesday of this week, the Department of Justice sought and obtained a continuance in the case. Judge Locher has given the DOJ until Oct. 21 to file a response in the case.

The Barrajas and Reyes cases are among at least 20 such bond-hearing cases filed recently in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Because the final decisions on bond are still made within the immigration court system, the current status or outcome of the cases is difficult — and in some cases impossible — to track.

Federal judges rule against the DOJ

Last week, federal judges in the San Francisco area ordered the release of dozens of immigrants held in California detention facilities without a bond hearing. In each case, a U.S. District Court judge had already issued a temporary restraining order or an injunction granting the temporary release of the detainees until the bond-hearing issue could be resolved.

One federal judge in San Francisco, James Donato, recently expressed frustration when a DOJ lawyer argued in court that detainees have no right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney. “Just give them a hearing … What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again, and again, and again, in front of every judge in this district?”

Two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court judge in the state of Washington ruled that the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings to detainees was unlawful. That Sept. 30 ruling was made in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March 2025, challenging the then-new practice of denying bond hearings even to people who have lived in the United States for decades.

Other class-action lawsuits over the same issue, as well as the hundreds of individually filed cases, are still pending in courts throughout the United States.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-2048x1367.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 17:02:24.727456

Despite this explicit law, President Trump and Director Vought have continued to bully and target our dedicated federal workforce, including by threatening(link is external) to illegally withhold back pay after the shutdown ends. In a bipartisan letter to Director Vought, the lawmakers underscore that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which was passed and signed into law during the last shutdown under President Trump, is clear that all federal employees, whether they are excepted or furloughed, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends. There are more than 30,000 federal workers that reside in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District.

“During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law,” the members wrote.

“The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),” the members wrote. “OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens.”

The members continued, “The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.”

“We request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law,” the members concluded.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.
The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025.
The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office.
Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.","The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday afternoon to approve a $3.57 million emergency allocation to dramatically scale up legal services, community outreach and rapid response networks for the county’s immigrant and refugee residents.

Sourced primarily from the Measure W Essential Services Fund, the allocation includes $2.5 million designated for immigrant and refugee support and an additional $1 million for a flexible contingency pool. The funds will extend and increase contracts for three frontline community coalitions.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.

Spearheaded by Supervisors Nikki Fortunato Bas and Elisa Márquez, the action is a direct response to what county staff reports describe as “exponentially more attacks” and “unprecedented levels” of federal immigration enforcement.

“This is about real-time response and building an infrastructure that will continue to educate and empower our communities to withstand this escalation of threats and attacks,” Márquez said.

Under the new federal budget, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to receive an additional $75 billion over four years, representing a more than 300% increase in enforcement and detention capacity.

Bas said that residents demanded greater support after a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal ICE agents to conduct stops based on perceived ethnicity, raising concerns about heightened racial profiling. The move also follows an incident last month where federal immigration officers detained a man inside an Oakland courthouse.

“With the surge in ICE arrests again, the targeting of our immigrant communities, the community has come to us to say it is urgent that we boost our capacity,” Bas said. “This will allow us to expand the rapid response hotline into the weekends and continue defending immigrants in our legal system to ensure they have due process.”

The six-month funding extension is designed to fortify the local safety net in a county where one in three residents is foreign-born and half of all children live in a mixed-status household, according to a letter from Bas and Márquez to the board recommending adoption.

Enforcement data for what ICE refers to as the San Francisco “Area of Responsibility,” which stretches from Kern County to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam and includes Alameda County, showed that immigration arrests doubled in early 2025.

This spike disproportionately impacts working-class families, particularly nationals from Mexico, Guatemala, India, El Salvador and Honduras, according to the supervisors’ letter.

The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025. At Tuesday’s meeting, ACILEP said during the weekday, one staffer currently mans the phone at a time, highlighting the group’s limited capacity.

The $3.57 million will support the county’s three core partners in scaling their services:

ACILEP: The largest portion of the funding will support the expansion of the organization’s Rapid Response Hotline to operate on weekends and ensure 24/7 coverage, alongside bolstering legal services and community volunteer network coordination.

California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice: The funds will maintain removal defense capacity, offset filing fees for low-income clients and fund legal education and outreach—ensuring immigrants in removal proceedings have access to due process and legal protection.

Trabajadores Unidos Workers United: The group will use the funding to provide resources, mutual aid and community organizing opportunities to low-income immigrant workers and their families.

The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office. This funding will help offset skyrocketing immigration application and litigation fees for low-income clients, such as the recent significant increase in costs for asylum applications and green cards following the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budget bill.

Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.

“We definitely have to do more strategic planning and develop stronger infrastructure for the long term,” Márquez said.

Alameda County Together, an ad hoc committee prioritizing equity and inclusion for residents, recommended that the county establish such an office, which would be tasked with coordinating resources, overseeing immigrant-serving programs and advising the Board on responsive policies.

County staff have been directed to return to the Board on Oct. 21 with a comprehensive coordination plan, and again on Oct. 28. The county is engaging with philanthropy, including the San Francisco Foundation’s new initiative, the Stand Together Bay Area Fund, to support these initiatives.

“It’s really important that people have a sense of belonging in this county,” Márquez said. “By us investing in these services, to acknowledge the challenges that are occurring and finding a way to mitigate that, just reaffirms our commitment to being a space and inclusive community for everyone.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/09/250903-ICETRAINING_01023_TV-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:18.678943

According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation.","The spike in immigration enforcement and raids has created a pressing demand for immigration legal resources, yet representation is often limited for those who need it across New York and the United States, according to immigration experts.

As of January, there were 4.5 million immigrants living in New York; 1.8 million were non-citizens and an estimated 670,000 lack documentation. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association New York Chapter, however, there are around 1,600 immigration lawyers in New York. The accessibility of legal representation for immigrant New Yorkers is severely disproportionate to the demand — an issue that extends nationwide.

New York City, however, has a much higher concentration of immigration lawyers, funding and general aid organizations compared to upstate, where many struggle to get the help they need.

“Not only is there a lack in professionals handling the cases, but it's also an issue of availability of funds,” said Syracuse immigration lawyer Jose Perez. “It all limits [a client’s] possibilities — not to mention the fact that if they speak a different language, it becomes more complicated.”

Fifty-seven workers were detained in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Cato in September. Of those 57, Hediberto Ramierz was detained and sent back to Guatemala despite his valid work permit, and pending immigration case. He says he never had an opportunity to consult his lawyer, and others detained are still without representation.

Immigration by the numbers

When President Trump entered office in January, the U.S. immigrant population was at a record high of 53.3 million, accounting for 15.8% of the population. Compared to this year, in 2011, 13% of the population were immigrants. Owing to the series of aggressive immigration initiatives this year, this high declined by 2 million. Immigrants now account for around 15.2% of the population. There are about 20,000 immigration lawyers in the U.S., according to IBIS World's 2025 industry analysis.

Jessica Maxwell is the executive director of the Workers Center of Central New York, a pro-immigrant worker group, and highlighted the organization's efforts while stressing the current difficulties within the legal sphere.

“There is a shortage of lawyers,” said Maxwell. It's hard enough to get representation and then there's this layer of tension, making it really difficult for people to find representation or communicate and effectively coordinate representation.”

Maxwell and her Syracuse-based team often refer immigrants to at least three lawyers at a time, so they “have a chance.” Immigration law all over the country lacks essential components for such catered representation — and numbers aren't the only issue.

Language barrier proves to be an issue

Language is one of the largest barriers preventing immigrants from accessing legal help. Maxwell and Perez both say immigration law reflects a pattern of systematic disadvantages for individuals who speak languages other than English.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but in the whole [state] of New York,” said Perez. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful of attorneys that speak Spanish and do immigration.”

The general morale of immigration attorneys is at an all-time low, for many say the administration’s “violations of human rights"" neglect their legal efforts, according to Perez. Representation in immigration courts has seen a general decline. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group associated with Syracuse University, this decline highlights a 10% drop this year in representation for Arabic, Creole and Spanish speaking defendants when comparing the previous four fiscal years to 2025.

Although federal law requires the court to provide those who do not speak English with interpreters, it is not required to provide legal counsel. Success in the courtroom has proven significantly more likely with representation than without. According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation. Yet, 2025 has revealed nationwide that only 38% of all immigration cases were represented.

While the current law calls for attentive legal defense, immigrants face a lack of comprehensive representation and are left to fend for themselves, Perez said.

Tai Shaw, a Vietnamese immigrant-turned-business owner and advocate living in Syracuse, says he sees the struggle daily in his clients — whom he prefers to call “neighbors.” Financial factors coincide with legal limitations. Despite the case matter, legal fees are expensive, a burden that falls hardest on immigrants.

“Financial hardship is not just for my people, but is a question for everybody, especially now with the new administration,” said Shaw, who has lived in Syracuse for 20 years.

Employment and immigration

Poverty rates among immigrants consistently lean higher than their American-born counterparts. Therefore, many immigrants rely on pro bono representation, said Maxwell. Yet, these waitlists are months or years long — an adverse trend in immigration law. Public interest law organizations are a solution for those struggling. They provide legal services for people who would otherwise lack proper representation, focusing on public good rather than profit. Yet in conservative, poorer and less populated or rural regions — areas typically heavily populated with immigrants — these resources are scarce and packed with people, according to studies done by UC Berkely.

“We have a few very excellent legal services organizations here in New York state, but they're just way over capacity,” said Maxwell. “They are unable to provide services to a lot of people, especially as we see immigration enforcement ramping up.”

Millions of immigrants choose to settle in New York, whether it be in the city’s prominent urban and poorer areas or upstate, which is primarily rural. In New York City alone, one in four New Yorkers live in poverty, according to an annual report from Robin Hood and Columbia University. Nationally, New York City is home to the largest population of immigrants, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. In upstate, Onondaga, Erie, Monroe, Albany and Oneida counties are the top five counties with the highest immigrant populations. Within these areas, Census data found high poverty and limited English proficiency are prevalent, serving as primary factors for receiving legal aid and employment.

Now that the Trump administration is actively prioritizing U.S.-born individuals, especially in the workforce, it has become increasingly difficult for both immigrants here legally and illegally to find jobs and escape poverty, advocates said.

“Our community has an extremely hard time getting jobs right now, and most don't have decent jobs,” said Shaw. “Factory workers, janitors, cleaning, assembly line. The majority of my people are working at Amazon because of the language barrier. They don't have to speak. They're just throwing boxes.”

Employment opportunity is paramount to immigrant poverty rates, further curbing accessibility to legal aid.

At a press conference concerning September’s Cato Nutrition Bar Confectioners Factory raid, acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III warned employers across New York not to employ unauthorized workers. He emphasized the unlawful employment of immigrants takes away opportunities from Americans. Sarcone pointed to the “high unemployment” rates in upstate New York, yet county unemployment is either lower or at the state average.

Perez, and many other experts, refuted Sarcone's — and the Trump administration’s — standpoints on immigrant employment. Perez’s work boils down to the crucial point that immigrants are not taking jobs from Americans but are working the ones U.S.-born workers are not willing to.

“How many Americans are picking foods in the farms around New York?” Perez asked. “You're not going to see a single person doing that. How many Anglo people are working in the kitchens, doing the dishes, or cleaning services in the hotels? If you spend a night in the hotel, you're not going to see white people cleaning rooms. They are going to see immigrants.”

Immigrant work is an integral part of the labor market, benefiting an economy all Americans work toward, Perez says, while also providing immigrants the money it takes to stay here and continue their economic contributions.

Maxwell emphasized that employment still doesn't solve every issue. Immigration enforcement is targeting all immigrants, whether they have legal status or not, making no immigrant, despite compliance with the system, immune, Maxwell said.

“I've had at least three people this week who have valid work permits and are working be detained,” said Maxwell. “They're losing that income right when they need it the most; to rely on legal services when there's no reason to believe they should have needed a lawyer.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-JosePerez-20250909-001_1,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:01.177395

The federal government is planning on making the domestic spy agency’s powers for compulsory questioning permanent, while also significantly expanding the offences covered by the rules.

Introduced in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, the compulsory questioning powers would cover sabotage, promotion of communal violence, attacks on the defence system and serious threats to Australia’s border security.

But legislation introduced to parliament by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, would also end so-called sunset provisions – the effective expiry dates that require parliament to reconsider the powers on a regular basis.

Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, intelligence operatives have powers to issue a questioning warrant, requiring a person as young as 14 to give information or produce items that may assist in a serious investigation.

The powers are being temporarily extended, for 18 months, to allow parliament to consider a permanent expansion.

Asio has hardly used the powers since 2020. Just four warrants were served on three people, in counter-terror and espionage cases, in that time.

Guardian Australia revealed in July a review of the legislation was under way by parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security.

In a joint submission, Liberty Victoria and the New South Wales and Queensland councils for civil liberties say the plan would seriously diminish the right to a fair trial and risk Asio being characterised as a secret police force, rather than an intelligence agency.

They say the laws would unfairly allow the government to force an innocent person to undergo compulsory questioning, with their answers available for use by prosecutors.

“This creates an incentive for the executive to conduct ‘fishing expeditions’ against individuals who could not otherwise be investigated under ordinary criminal procedure,” their submission said.

It noted a 2016 review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor had recommended the powers be repealed or allowed to lapse.

The NSW Council for Civil Liberties’ president, Timothy Roberts, said the powers should be withdrawn.

“Any government interested in maintaining its identity as ‘democratic’ would not have laws with such far-reaching powers,” he said.

“It is alarming with all the recent international examples of the dangers of this type of overreach, our government has chosen not to shore up its citizens rights, and instead erode them.”

His Queensland counterpart, Michael Cope, said warnings about permanent damage to civil liberties after 9/11 were being shown to be justified.

“These are the powers of a police state. They are found in no other liberal democracy and must not be made permanent,” he said.

Asio has told the committee the questioning powers were a “unique and critical tool” for investigating threats.

The agency said the country faced “more security surprises” in the next five years than what has occurred in the past few years.

Espionage and foreign interference were at unprecedented levels, it said, while political violence represents an “elevated concern” amid growing political polarisation.

It also warned sabotage will pose an increasing challenge to authorities and could quickly escalate, and insisted powers to question minors were warranted.

“Given the increase in the prevalence of minors in Asio’s terrorism caseload – all attacks and major counter-terrorism disruptions in 2024 involved minors or young people – the numbers of minors being radicalised online, and the way minors are moving towards violence more quickly, Asio considers the retention of these powers is necessary and proportionate to the potential threat to security.”

The organisation offered a hypothetical scenario to illustrate its use of the powers, in which an Australian citizen was helping organise a people-smuggling operation offshore. In the scenario, the individual refuses to answer questions after returning to Australia, before being compelled under the laws. Their answers see a people-smuggling boat stopped before it reaches Australia.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c0efa5ffeceff7f524094b20ac59b67c947ba4/472_0_4718_3775/master/4718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ee6badfc2d498fe61531741a1372dbe",N,,2025-10-15 16:04:05.791642

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump’s first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers’ jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.

WATCH: How the latest round of federal layoffs could impact public health

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.

Trump administration launches wave of layoffs

Farruggia is the head of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency’s leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said.

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump’s budget office.

READ MORE: Amid shutdown fight, Trump no longer distancing himself from Project 2025

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don’t.”

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn’t fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it’s codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won’t wait for me to eventually get paid.”

Shutdown drags on, and frustration grows

For some federal workers, this isn’t their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump’s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn’t mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate.

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There’s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can’t even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

Workers used as ‘political pawns’

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union’s members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn’t about one party or the other. It’s about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

WATCH: ‘Do your damn job,’ federal worker union leaders tell Congress mired in shutdown

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they’re not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

It’s time to rethink what we mean by “fixing” immigration—and work toward real solutions.

In the matter of K-E-S-G-, an asylum case decided by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals on July 18, Department of Justice officials declared that a Salvadoran woman stalked and threatened by gang members could not obtain asylum based solely on the argument that her persecution was due to her gender, despite occurring in a country that, she argued, views women as property.

The decision is the latest in a 30-year battle over the legitimacy of gender-based asylum claims and closely tracks the first Trump administration’s efforts to roll back decisions and policies that recognized the unique role gender plays in many asylum cases, particularly those involving domestic abuse, sexual violence or trafficking.

According to the attorneys representing S.G., while the decision does not prevent women from making gender-based asylum claims, it will make it much more difficult to prove them. Neela Chakravartula, associate director of litigation at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and a co-counsel in the case, predicts that this new ruling will lead to more denials of women’s asylum claims since it “sends a strong signal to immigration judges that women’s asylum claims should not be taken seriously.”

Chakravartula said in a press briefing:

“This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has singled out women seeking asylum, and we know where this path leads. More judges denying protection to women who qualify for it. More refugees being deported to danger. Even more chaos and confusion injected into our immigration system.”

The Tahirih Justice Center’s Kursten Phelps, another co-counsel on S.G.’s case, expressed concern about the chilling effect the decision will have on many potential asylum seekers.

“This decision does not mean they are suddenly ineligible for asylum,” she noted. “But harmful rhetoric and decisions like this one are designed to deter them—and us—from even trying. We must not do their work for them. These cases are still winnable, and we owe it to survivors to keep fighting and affirm that their stories do count.”

Asylum law is complex, making it difficult to obtain asylum in the United States. You must demonstrate that you have been or will be persecuted based on a protected category, and that your own government will not or cannot help you. You must show that your persecutor intended to harm you because you are a member of the protected category. You must show that you can’t simply move to another part of your country and that your life is in danger if you return home.

If you demonstrate all these things based on the protected grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinion, you have a shot at winning your case. If someone is persecuting you because you are a woman, however, you also must prove that you are a member of a particular social group, one sufficiently distinct and separate from the general population of women in your country that your membership in this group makes you a target for some particular form of persecution.

Some asylum claims seem straightforward—persecution by the Russian government of a political dissident is tied to political opinion, while ethnic cleansing operations are persecution on account of race—but others are more complicated. Union membership, sexual orientation, gender, whistleblowing or geography can all be part of persecution claims that don’t necessarily fit under the delineated grounds.

Gender has been controversial, driven in large part by the fact that many forms of gender-based persecution are committed by private actors rather than by the government itself, and by fears of overwhelming the asylum system if gender is accepted as the basis for persecution without more evidence to distinguish the claim.

Since the Clinton administration, efforts to fully address gender have swung back and forth in U.S. courts; most advocates have pinned their hopes on regulations that would definitively address gender as part of a rule defining a “particular social group.” Those efforts have been thwarted politically in Democratic administrations and have been completely abandoned under the Trump administration.

The board’s decision in K-E-S-G- takes on deeper significance because it doesn’t simply reject the applicant’s definition of a particular social group. It goes further, declaring that gender is never sufficient on its own to demonstrate a protected class. In classic originalist form, the board pivoted to the 1950s, declaring that it could not recognize gender as a distinct protected class because it wasn’t part of the original group of five established at the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention.

However, an analysis of the Refugee Convention and its history argues for recognizing that protected groups can change over time and custom. It’s not that gender can’t be a protected category, but that gender must be tied to certain specifics that define a woman’s status in a particular country at a particular time. Given the state of the world, this should mean that gender-based claims would not require linguistic gymnastics to establish that a woman in El Salvador is likely at risk for persecution.

An obvious example is the condition of women in Afghanistan. Under Matter of K-E-S-G-, it appears that Afghan women fleeing the Taliban may not be considered a sufficiently specific group, despite the overwhelming threat to life and freedom women face in Afghanistan today. Afghan women refugees in the U.S., many of whom are still waiting for the government to keep its promises to protect them from the Taliban through permanent U.S. residence, are keenly aware of this possibility.

“When I learned about the decision in K-E-S-G-, I thought of our clients,” said Laila Ayub, cofounder and director of Project ANAR (the Afghan Network for Advocacy and Resources), a legal services organization founded to assist Afghan refugees. “With every new announcement from this administration, they reach out to us asking if they will face deportation. It is shameful that at a time when other countries are expanding protections for displaced peoples fleeing gender-based violence and persecution, this administration is weaponizing the immigration court system to further restrict them.”",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2194932514.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:30.226800

In this series, we will lay out how various federal and state actors are using the funding to attack our democracy, increase authoritarianism, expand the prison/military industrial complex, and negatively impact communities, families, and individuals.

On July 3, Republicans in Congress and President Trump elected to trade away billions of dollars for health care and anti-poverty programs to fund an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement, specifically in the form of detention. We are only beginning to see and feel the impacts of this tradeoff of care for cages, but reports are already rolling in.

For a clear illustration of this trade, we can look to a corner of rural Nebraska. The town of Curtis, Nebraska recently lost its rural hospital center following the 2025 reconciliation act’s enactment. The CEO of Community Hospital said in his statement about the closure that the anticipated federal funding cuts to Medicaid were a major deciding factor in closing their clinic. Community Hospital’s headquarters is located in McCook, Nebraska – about 45 minutes from Curtis. Trading away critical care for increased detention, the only investment that appears to be on the table is a new immigration detention site at the McCook Work Ethic Camp. The state of Nebraska intends to move the nearly 200 Nebraskans currently housed at the McCook facility for rehabilitative programming into other prisons, converting the facility into an immigration jail that would house up to 300 immigrants on any given day.

We all know that money talks – if it wasn’t clear to see before, this bill shows that the Trump administration and the members of Congress that voted to pass the 2025 reconciliation bill only have one goal: cruelty at any cost to deter future immigrants and push out those already here, no matter their ties to the country.

As a country, we want everyone to be healthy and have access to the care they need. We all want our kids to go to school and learn. We want everyone in this country to have the tools they need to thrive. The government had the opportunity to invest in health care, create jobs, and invest in our children’s education. But instead of using our taxpayer money to make those visions a reality, the reconciliation act slashed funding for basic safety net programs like Medicaid and anti-poverty programs and redirected more than $150 billion towards fueling Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. Here’s a quick breakdown:

$45 billion to detain immigrant adults and families

$75 billion in enforcement and surveillance funding for border communities, including $47 billion for construction of the border wall

$32 billion for immigration agents and operations related to enforcement and deportation

$13.5 billion for state and local enforcement of federal immigration law

$1 billion to divert military resources towards border militarization

This unprecedented slush fund for detention and enforcement comes at the expense of everyone’s wellbeing and economic stability.

The decisions made in the reconciliation bill spell out a dark future for the country: Hospitals will close. Millions of Medicaid recipients will lose access to their health care. The national deficit will balloon by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.

Meanwhile, the $45 billion awarded to ICE to jail immigrants is 13 times the government’s annual budget for immigration detention, which was already at a record high. The funding allocated to detention in the reconciliation bill is a moral failure and an existential threat.

State of Detention

The alarm has been ringing for decades about the inhumane, unsanitary, and deadly conditions inside immigration detention sites. From reports of rotten food, physical abuse, and over 230 documented deaths since 2003, the U.S. immigration detention system has been plagued with crisis-level concerns for years. Years of investigation from the media, advocates, and members of Congress into sites across the country document a disturbing pattern of abuse: physical and sexual abuse, denial of medical care (including mental health care), a lack of acceptable food and water, and restricted to non-existent access to legal counsel.

The history of ICE detention is rife with abuse, but we fear things are only going to get worse. With disturbing reports from inside detention sites documenting the rise in suicide attempts and deaths from medical neglect, it is no surprise that 2025 is on track to be one of the deadliest years on record.

The Trump administration’s expansion is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before: as of publication, ICE is holding 58,766 individuals in detention – with no sign of slowing down. As the Administration continues to carry out its goal of mass enforcement, advocates and organizers predict that the situation is about to get much worse.

There have been several stark developments as the Trump administration pushes for mass expansion, including:

The Everglades Detention Camp in Ochopee, Florida has been universally condemned as a human rights disaster – yet Trump officials still consider it the blueprint for future sites.

The opening of the largest federal detention site at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas is a massive expansion in a state that hosts over 20 detention sites. The soft-sided facility (a tent-like structure not designed for housing people for long periods of time will hold at least 1,000 individuals initially, with plans to expand capacity to 5,000.

Military facilities are being converted into detention sites across the country, including Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck in Edinburgh, Indiana; Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas; and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Trenton, New Jersey.

An ACLU investigation revealed plans for six potential new sites in Colorado – marking a 600% increase in detention in the state.

Private prison companies, namely GEO Group and CoreCivic, currently manage sites that hold 90% of detained immigrants, meaning there is even less transparency into the conditions and less oversight into their management than government-run facilities.

Small rural towns are the prime target for new and expanded immigration detention sites. Private prison corporations and the federal government are predatory, promising economic revitalization and an influx of jobs to areas struggling with high unemployment and budget shortfalls. But in reality, these sites cause more harm in the surrounding community than good.

The Trump Administration calls H.R. 1 the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), but the truth is that this bill is far from beautiful. It is ugly, shortsighted, and it will take generations of advocacy to undo the pain it is causing for immigrants and their families. More immigration detention means more parents ripped away from their children, economic and health instability for the families left behind, and more people placed in life-threatening situations hidden behind the walls of detention.

As time goes on, it will become even more important to have a written record that documents the scope, harm, and significance of the reconciliation act’s funding for detention. In the next few entries to this blog series, we will examine how the act’s funds impact ICE-run sites, private-run sites, state-run sites, and detention facilities at military sites. Using first-hand accounts, news reporting, and research into detention conditions, we will continue to witness the devastating impacts of reconciliation act funding.

In a 4-1 vote, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved the measure, according to The Associated Press.

The emergency declaration will ensure funds are provided to local residents for rental assistance and legal aid because some immigrants have stopped going to work in an effort to avoid being taken by immigration officials.

“We have residents afraid to leave their homes, we have constituents contacting my office because their family members never came home and they don’t know if they’ve been taken by ICE or where they’ve been taken,” County Supervisor Janice Hahn said, per the AP.

“We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers have been taken from their work places and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on their table,” she added.

Migrant workers have been targeted through raids at farms, places of business and at their homes.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the sole person to dissent on the board, warning the declaration could harm landlords and open the county to legal challenges.

Rent arrangements offered by the county during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred a whirlwind of legal cases from landlords.

Daniel Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles, told AP that landlords lost billions in uncollected rent during the COVID-19 emergency.

The county’s move marks the latest effort by California officials to push back on President Trump’s immigration crackdown in the state.

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued new legislation banning ICE agents from wearing masks.

He said face coverings allow federal law enforcement agents to be “hidden from accountability” arguing masks prevent “transparency” for citizens and hinder “oversight.”

Residents have protested against ICE raids as the Department of Homeland Security said 5,000 immigrants in the country illegally were arrested from June to August in Los Angeles.

Multiple airports in Texas are refusing to play a video at their security checkpoints in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown, citing advertising policies that bar the use of political content.

Airports commonly display videos from the head of homeland security on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these messages are usually apolitical. This changed when Department of Homeland Security officials directed TSA to display a video that begins with Noem outlining TSA’s priorities and ends with her expressing hope that “Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”

“Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government,” Noem says in the video. “Because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Spokespeople for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas Love Field Airport, Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport told The Texas Tribune that the video is not on display at their TSA checkpoints.

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport’s decision to not display the video is consistent with its longstanding policy that prohibits political advertising, said Zachary Greiner, a spokesperson for the airport.

Dallas Love Field Airport’s advertising policy also “prohibits political or issue-oriented content,” said spokesperson Patrick Clarke. Additionally, the airport has not received the permit application required for such videos.

Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport are also not running the video at this time, according to statements from the airports that did not include explanations.

Jacquelyn Eckmann, a spokesperson for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, said the airport’s checkpoints do not have the ability to display the video because they are not equipped with video monitors.

TSA is displaying the video at its security checkpoint at El Paso International Airport, said spokesperson Tammy Fonce.

The Houston Airport System did not respond to an inquiry about whether they were showing Noem’s message.

As of May 2022, TSA employed nearly 50,000 officers across the country, with more than 4,000 in Texas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of these workers are required to work without pay during government shutdowns.

This has contributed to staffing shortages and flight delays across the country, including at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Monday.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Texas Tribune that the government shutdown has created challenges for TSA employees, but that security operations are largely unchanged.

“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” she said.

United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections.
The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor.
Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor.
The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta.
First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison.","For almost 140 years, removal protections have been the hallmark of independence for multimember commissions like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). By statute, the president may remove FTC commissioners only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” President Trump did not cite any of these reasons when, in March 2025, he removed FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Instead, he argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and, therefore, the FTC’s removal protections could not constitutionally constrain his power to remove them. Trump has also removed commissioners at other independent agencies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, in violation of statutory removal protections.

Trump’s actions directly conflict with Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections. By removing Slaughter and Bedoya without cause, Trump overstepped his statutory authority and violated Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, Judge Loren AliKhan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment in favor of Slaughter, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit refused to stay that decision.

The U.S. Supreme Court, however, stayed the district court’s decision, allowing Trump to remove Slaughter during the pendency of the case. Simultaneously, the Court granted certiorari on two issues: first, “Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), should be overruled,” and second, “Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.”

Scholars largely anticipate that the Supreme Court will narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor in Trump v. Slaughter, but the degree to which the Supreme Court will carve back Humphrey’s Executor remains unclear. Regardless, Slaughter will carry significant consequences for public administration.

The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor

The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor. The Constitution discusses the removal of officers only in conferring the impeachment power upon Congress. Although Article II grants the president the power to nominate principal officers of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate, nothing in the Constitution explicitly grants them the power to remove these officers. Whether the president has the power to remove subordinates and whether Congress may restrict that power remains one of the most hotly contested issues in constitutional law.

Although silent on the question of removal, Article II vests the “executive power” in “a President of the United States.” Proponents of unitary executive theory argue that the “executive power” vested by Article II necessarily includes the right to control subordinates within the executive branch. Many proponents view the power to remove subordinate officers as a residual feature of the “executive power” inherited by the president from the British Crown. Others have alternative theories about why Article II confers the removal power. Of course, opponents of unitary executive theory—and even some of its proponents—argue that the Vesting Clause confers no removal power and that Congress’s power over agency design allows for removal protections.

Those who believe the Constitution necessarily confers the removal power upon the president draw support from the Supreme Court’s decision in Myers v. United States. In that case, Chief Justice William Taft—himself once president—held that “the power of removal of executive officers was incident to the power of appointment.” His decision follows a similar logic as unitary executive theory. Presidents rely on subordinates to execute the law, and, therefore, they have the power to appoint their agents. Consequently, presidents must also have the power to remove these agents when they fail to faithfully execute the law.

In various cases before Myers, however, the Supreme Court held that Congress could restrict removal for inferior officers. In Ex Parte Hennen, the Court upheld the removal of a district court clerk but implied that statutory law could limit removal. In United States v. Perkins, the Court held that Congress may limit the removal of inferior officers when it vests their appointment in the heads of departments. The Court reasoned, “The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to officers so appointed.” Taft narrowly construed these precedents in Myers, reasoning that the different appointment mechanisms for inferior officers grant Congress greater control over the removal of inferior officers.

Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor. Relying on the precedent set in Myers, President Franklin Roosevelt removed FTC Commissioner William Humphrey, who enjoyed for-cause removal protections. The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta. In upholding the removal protections, the Court reasoned that the FTC “cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive”:

To the extent that it exercises any executive function—as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense—it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government.

The precise rule of Humphrey’s Executor has confused both scholars and jurists. In Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court more or less abandoned the quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative categories it used to justify removal protections for multimember commissions. According to the Court, “the real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty”—not whether the official exercises “purely executive” power rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” power.

Together, Myers and Humphrey’s Executor appeared to stand for the proposition that the president possesses the power to remove principal officers by default, but Congress could expressly restrict that power in specific circumstances. The Court’s decision in Wiener v. United States complicated this rule by holding that some agencies possess implied removal protections. The petitioner—an adjudicator of the War Claims Commission—argued that his removal by the president was unlawful, even though the War Claims Act did not expressly restrict his removal. Drawing from Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court concluded that the president had no constitutional authority to remove commissioners of an adjudicatory body and that statutory silence did not implicitly confer the removal power upon the president. Wiener allowed for the possibility that officers without express removal protections, like commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enjoyed impliedremoval protections.

The Roberts Court has chipped away at Congress’s power to restrict removal and simultaneously expanded the president’s control over principal officers. In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Congress created the PCAOB as an entity within the SEC but limited the SEC commissioners’ ability to remove their appointees to the PCAOB. For the sake of argument, the Supreme Court assumed that the SEC commissioners also enjoyed removal protections. Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion reasoned that these “double for-cause removal protections” impermissibly insulated PCAOB members from presidential oversight. The Court emphasized that Article II requires the president to remain politically accountable for executive action, and such accountability dissipates if inferior officers are insulated not once, but twice, from presidential control.

In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Court went further by invalidating removal protections for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB’s statute permitted the president to remove its single director only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that such a restriction on removal was unconstitutional when applied to a single-headed agency wielding substantial executive authority. In Collins v. Yellen, the Court extended Seila Law by holding that the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s single-director structure with for-cause removal protection likewise violated Article II, reaffirming that such insulation is incompatible with presidential accountability. The Office of Legal Counsel subsequently concluded that Collins permitted the president to remove the Social Security commissioner at will.

In all three cases, Chief Justice Roberts described the precedent as recognizing only two exceptions to the president’s general removal authority: the Humphrey’s Executor exception for multimember commissions and the Perkins exception for inferior officers. First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison. Second, Roberts has emphasized that “Congress could provide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined duties.” Yet Roberts declined to clarify what types of responsibilities qualify as “narrowly defined duties.”

By the beginning of Trump’s second term, many legal scholars regarded Humphrey’s Executor as effectively on life support. That perception was reinforced when the Supreme Court stayed a district court order enjoining the removal of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In an unsigned, two-page opinion in Trump v. Wilcox, the Supreme Court concluded that “the Government [was] likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.” The majority, however, stopped short of deciding whether those agencies fell within the Humphrey’s Executor exception. Nevertheless, it felt the need to recognize a new exception for the Federal Reserve—an agency not before the Court—reasoning that the “Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” Such an originalist-inspired carve-out would have been unnecessary if Humphrey’s Executor remained firmly intact.

The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn—or at least substantially narrow—Humphrey’s Executor. How far the Court intends to extend the president’s removal power remains uncertain, and any prediction is fraught. Roberts authored the majority opinions in Free Enterprise and Collins, adopting a characteristically incrementalist approach to changing precedent. Yet Roberts is no longer the pivotal vote in the conservative majority. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have openly called for overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism about the decision, though scholars debate whether he would vote to overturn it. Justice Samuel Alito, who authored Collins, has not indicated whether he would support overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has yet to write in a case involving removal protections. The coming term will reveal whether the Court is prepared to dismantle Humphrey’s Executor outright or continue its gradual erosion.

The narrowest path forward could preserve Humphrey’s Executor while distinguishing the modern FTC on factual grounds. Today’s FTC exercises greater power than it did in 1935, raising questions about whether it exercises “substantial executive authority” rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” functions. The D.C. Circuit has interpreted the Trade Commission Act as providing broader authority than originally anticipated, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act greatly expanded the FTC’s jurisdiction over consumer protection. This incrementalist approach would preserve the core holding of Humphrey’s Executor but would require lower courts to undertake the fraught task of parsing agency functions to decide whether a given agency exercises “substantial executive authority.”

Alternatively, the Court could simply overturn Humphrey’s Executor, striking down removal protections for most multimember commissions. As suggested by its rhetoric in Trump v. Wilcox, the Court seems poised to recognize an exception for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Effectively, the Court may preserve removal protections for entities or officers that had some sort of analog at the Founding. (Such a test, however, has its own problems with respect to the Federal Reserve.)

As discussed below, the demise of Humphrey’s Executor would be immensely consequential, but its ripple effects may prove even greater in subsequent cases. Trump has already removed members of the Senior Executive Service—who are plausibly inferior officers—raising questions about the viability of Perkins and its exception for inferior officers. Judge James Ho of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has likewise suggested that the courts should reconsider whether tenure protections for federal employees violate Article II. Taken to its extreme, Slaughter could become the catalyst for dismantling long-standing civil service protections.

Remedies in Removal Cases

The second question presented in Trump v. Slaughter concerns the appropriate remedy in cases involving the removal of a federal official. The petitioners in Perkins, Myers, and Humphrey’s Executor sought back pay. (In fact, Humphrey died during litigation.) Recently, however, commissioners and former employees have sought to enjoin their removal from office. Whether courts have the authority to provide injunctive relief to principal officers has yet to be decided.

The remedy has significant consequences for the petitioners and the administration of government. In general, most commissioners are motivated to retain the power of their positions—not their modest government salaries. Until his death, Humphrey insisted he remained an FTC commissioner and retained authority to exercise its duties. Injunctive relief provides removed officials with the remedy they truly seek and incentivizes them to bring actions aimed at enforcing statutory limitations on removal.

Without interim relief, however, removal may cause instability. Suppose the president appoints a successor who occupies the office pending the resolution of litigation. Depending on the willingness of courts to preliminarily enjoin removal, the position may flip between the removed officer and the president’s preferred appointee throughout litigation. Thus far, the Supreme Court has suggested that it would not allow courts to preliminarily enjoin removals. In Trump v. Wilcox, the majority described its stay of the district court’s injunction as “reflect[ing] our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”

In a forthcoming article, Samuel Bray develops a remedial framework for officer removal cases that helps explain why the second question in Trump v. Slaughter is so significant. He argues that the best remedy for a wrongfully removed officer is typically declaratory relief—through a declaratory judgment or quo warranto—because such judgments definitively resolve the officer’s legal entitlement to office without requiring courts to manage the executive branch directly. On interim relief, Bray emphasizes what he calls the “anti-flipping principle”: courts should minimize the instability created when control of an office toggles back and forth during litigation. To achieve that, he proposes a presumption that officers who sue immediately to contest their removal should remain in place as de facto officers pending judgment, while those who delay should not be restored through preliminary injunctions. This approach, grounded in historical equity practice and the de facto officer doctrine, seeks to deter opportunistic removals by the president while avoiding the chaos of repeated turnovers in officeholders.

The debate over remedies is not abstract—the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook illustrates the stakes. President Trump’s attempt to oust Cook without cause raised precisely the instability that Bray identifies. If the courts lacked authority to provide interim relief, Cook could have been removed, replaced, and then reinstated after months of litigation, creating “flips” in officeholders at the very heart of monetary policy. Such turnover risks undermining market confidence and the Fed’s institutional credibility. By contrast, adopting Bray’s anti-flipping principle would mean that, because Cook immediately sued to contest her removal, she should remain as a de facto officer until the litigation concludes. This approach preserves continuity in the governance of the Federal Reserve while still leaving open the possibility of judicial resolution on the merits.

In a brief, unsigned order issued on Oct. 1, the Supreme Court deferred Trump’s request for a stay in Trump v. Cook. Consequently, Cook will remain in office at least until the Supreme Court hears arguments in January 2026. The Supreme Court did not explain why it granted Trump’s request in Slaughter but denied it in Cook. Presumably, its decision relates to the fact that a majority believes that the Federal Reserve’s removal protections are constitutional, while the FTC’s protections are not. The federal government does not technically challenge the Federal Reserve’s removal protections in Trump v. Cook, but the Court will likely distinguish (at least in dicta) its decision in Slaughter from Cook based on its reasoning in Trump v. Wilcox. Nevertheless, the Court will still need to decide whether the Federal Reserve’s officers are entitled to a hearing before their removal.

Whatever the court decides in Slaughter and Cook, the Supreme Court’s answer to the remedy question should have less impact on federal civil servants. When a federal employee is unlawfully removed, the statutory framework provides both a right to challenge the action and a remedy of reinstatement with back pay. Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, employees may appeal removals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has the authority to order reinstatement if the action is found unlawful. Likewise, employees found “to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action” must receive back pay and benefits, effectively restoring them to the status quo ante. Because Congress has specified statutory remedies for civil servants, civil servants do not need to rely on the equitable powers of the court for relief.

Implications

In all likelihood, Slaughter and Cook will reshape the relationship between the president and independent agencies. The precise implications of the decision depend on the course the Supreme Court takes.

Before discussing how Slaughter affects administration within the executive branch, it is worth examining its implications for the relationship between the president and the Supreme Court. Some commentators predict that Trump will defy a ruling by the Supreme Court. Preserving its institutional authority requires the Court to assert clearly and forcefully that the president is bound to respect its precedent.

Yet Trump has openly defied existing precedent by removing the FTC commissioner. Even if the Supreme Court ultimately intends to narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor, its failure to check the president’s defiance risks signaling that the Court’s precedents can be ignored until formally enforced. The Court could have sent a stronger message about the rule of law by staying the district court’s decision, reinforcing that precedent binds the executive until the Court itself says otherwise. The decision signals that precedent binds only when the Court chooses to enforce it—undermining the idea of stare decisis, which holds that courts should decide cases according to prior precedents.

Ultimately, Slaughter may have little practical effect on the president’s ability to control multimember commissions. Survey research by Neal Devins and David Lewis suggests that—contrary to popular wisdom—independent commissions are not particularly insulated from White House influence. Todd Phillips demonstrates that control over commission chairs grants the president considerable control over the day-to-day operations of these agencies. Anecdotal evidence illustrates the degree of control presidents already exercise over most independent agencies. The Federal Communications Commission promulgated net neutrality regulations during the Obama administration, only to repeal those regulations during the first Trump administration. Extending the removal power may not meaningfully improve the president’s ability to exercise control over these agencies.

That does not mean, however, that independent agencies will experience no change. The organic statutes governing many multimember commissions, including the FTC, require presidents to appoint members of both parties to the commission. Members of these commissions also serve a staggered period of a fixed number of years. Structural features such as partisan-balancing and staggered terms are rendered less effective by an unfettered removal power.

Moreover, multimember commissions have quorum rules that require the presence of a majority of commissioners to conduct business. As Todd Phillips and I argue in a forthcoming article, expansion of the removal power enables presidents to break quorums. Depriving commissions of a quorum matters most for adjudicatory commissions, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. Parties appearing before adjudicatory commissions typically must exhaust their claims before these adjudicatory commissions before filing a claim in federal court. Without a quorum, parties’ cases go undecided, and they remain trapped in adjudicatory limbo until the president nominates and the Senate confirms a sufficient number of commissioners.

Overturning Humphrey’s Executor could also weaken administrative capacity within independent agencies. On average, these agencies employ more skilled workforces than cabinet departments, in part because their institutional structures preserve the autonomy that attracts talented professionals to federal service. These same structures may reduce politicization within independent agencies—another leading cause of retention problems. In interviews I conducted around the 2020 election, early-career federal employees frequently expressed a preference for independent agencies over cabinet departments, favoring the perceived stability of these agencies. Slaughter may erode the advantage independent agencies enjoy in the job market, undermining their ability to recruit and retain qualified employees. And if the Supreme Court ultimately extends the decision to eliminate tenure protections for all career staff, the resulting instability could drastically impair the ability of the federal government to recruit and retain qualified individuals.

Regardless of whether unitary executive theory is ultimately correct that removal protections violate Article II, these protections have been central to the administrative state for nearly 140 years. Abolishing them will reshape the administration of many federal agencies. The degree of change, however, will depend on how far the Supreme Court ultimately extends the president’s removal power—whether in Slaughter or subsequent cases.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 13:57:21.525053

For decades, US soft power was rooted in the promise of human rights and democracy.
For those of us who have lived through repression, these are unmistakable warning signs.
Defending human rights and democratic principles is never easy—as my organization, Human Rights Watch, knows too well.
That means building stronger regional institutions with the authority and resources to act, supporting accountability mechanisms like the African Court and the International Criminal Court, and investing in early warning systems that can prevent crises before they spiral into atrocities.","(Washington, DC) - I moved to the United States in 2012 with great reluctance. I wasn’t sure why I should uproot myself to a country thousands of miles away from my hometown. The move reminded me of a childhood I hadn’t fully embraced—growing up in faraway countries like Russia and China, making constant adjustments, encountering racism, forging and losing friendships along the way. I had promised myself I would not impose the same cycle on my children.

But the U.S. turned out to be different. It wasn’t China, and it wasn’t Russia. It was, and still is, a mosaic of cultures, languages, and nationalities unlike anywhere else. Most important, it was a country rooted in the fierce belief that people are free to speak, dissent, and live as they choose.

That bedrock principle, however, is eroding. The US is changing in ways eerily reminiscent of my home country, Burundi. In 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza defied the constitution to seek a third term, peaceful protesters were met with bullets, political opponents were silenced, and journalists fled. Many of those journalists found refuge in the US—at Voice of America, for instance—only to lose their livelihoods recently when the government shuttered most of VOA’s Africa department.

The dismantling of USAID has left social workers and health experts reeling, their efforts to uplift millions crushed overnight. Yes, the US has long had a complicated role abroad. I grew up hearing about its support for abusive leaders like Mobutu in what was then Zaire and its meddling in countries’ internal affairs in the name of fighting communism.

But those contradictions always existed alongside a powerful counterforce: freedom in journalism and academia, and activism that relentlessly exposed America’s own wrongs. Writers like Alfred McCoy and critics like Noam Chomsky built careers by holding the U.S. government accountable—something unthinkable in today’s Burundi, Moscow or Beijing.

That commitment to truth and liberty was precisely why, when Burundian security forces fired live bullets into protesters, students instinctively ran to the US embassy—not the Russian or Chinese one. For decades, US soft power was rooted in the promise of human rights and democracy.

Today, that promise is faltering. The forced deportations of immigrants without due process, violent crackdowns against protesters in Los Angeles, ICE raids, and the deployment of military forces in Washington, D.C. are chilling reminders of the authoritarian playbook.

For those of us who have lived through repression, these are unmistakable warning signs. Dictatorships do not emerge overnight; they take root when fear replaces voice, when courts surrender independence, when social movements fracture. Above all, they thrive on apathy and isolation.

Defending human rights and democratic principles is never easy—as my organization, Human Rights Watch, knows too well. But it is the only way to safeguard the dignity of the vulnerable and the cohesion of our shared humanity. So if Washington retreats from that responsibility, who will step up?

The answer lies, in part, with African governments. This is the moment for the continent to claim leadership, to strengthen multilateralism, and to shape a global order rooted not in interventionism, self-centeredness but in Ubuntu — a vision of shared humanity, community, and interdependence. Many Africans applauded when South Africa took Israel to the International Court of Justice saying Israel violated the Genocide Convention in Gaza. That same courage is needed in Sudan, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Sahel, where civilians face atrocities while the U.S. limits itself to mineral deals or silence.

“African solutions to African problems” cannot remain a slogan. It needs to become a policy agenda with concrete commitments. That means building stronger regional institutions with the authority and resources to act, supporting accountability mechanisms like the African Court and the International Criminal Court, and investing in early warning systems that can prevent crises before they spiral into atrocities.

It means protecting independent media and civil society so that governments are held accountable at home as well as abroad. And it means engaging at the United Nations and other multilateral forums not just as individual states but as coordinated blocks capable of shaping outcomes.

The US retreat is not simply a void; it is a test. If African leaders want to claim greater influence in the global order, they need to demonstrate it through pragmatic policies that protect civilians, strengthen the rule of law, and prioritize human dignity over mineral contracts and short-term business deals. This is less about replacing America and more about safeguarding Africa’s future on its own terms.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-15 13:57:18.012206

… Knowing these standards is how we protect our rights.” McKinney described how the same standards don’t necessarily apply in immigration matters, where proceedings are considered civil.
“Detention usually implies criminal punishment, but immigration detention is labeled civil, and that fluidity raises due process concerns: Who may be held, where, under what conditions, and with what rights?” Beasley said.
Panelists closed by urging future lawyers to understand these boundaries, help clients know their rights, and uphold justice in every setting — criminal, civil or otherwise.
“Lawyers and courts are pushing back and upholding the rule of law,” Beasley said, noting why she is encouraged during a challenging moment for democracy.","The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution promises protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, yet its application differs sharply between criminal and civil proceedings.

Those distinctions can determine who has access to legal counsel, when warrants are required, and what remedies exist when rights are violated.

That complex divide was the focus of a panel discussion hosted by We The People: Elon Law’s Constitutional Law Journal on Oct. 7, 2025. “Unlawful or Unprotected? 4th Amendment Rights in Criminal vs. Immigration Detention” attracted a standing-room-only crowd to Room 204 at Elon Law’s downtown Greensboro campus, with discussion and response to audience questions lasting more than an hour and a half.

Panelists Cheri Beasley, Sandra Day O’Connor Professor at Elon Law and former chief justice of the N.C. Supreme Court, Erin Fitzgerald, assistant professor of law and a former prosecutor, and Jeremy McKinney, a renowned immigration attorney, explored variability in Constitutional protections and how those safeguards operate in practice. Their discussion was moderated by Professor of Law David Levine.

“Courts are grappling in real time with evolving issues,” Beasley said, noting a trend of brief orders and rulings from higher courts clouding how lower courts should respond. “Appellate courts sometimes use brief or per curiam dispositions. When major questions are resolved on abbreviated orders, the U.S. Supreme Court’s so-called ‘shadow docket,’ the lack of reasoning can disserve the public and the bar” through lack of legal guidance.

Fitzgerald explained that searches and arrests generally require a warrant supported by probable cause, except in limited, well-defined circumstances such as emergencies or brief investigative stops. Lesser encounters — like brief detentions or frisks — require only reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.

“In the simplest terms, the Fourth Amendment protects people and their ‘persons, houses, papers, and effects’ from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures,” Fitzgerald says. “We care because we all have boundaries — our phones, cars, homes. … Knowing these standards is how we protect our rights.”

McKinney described how the same standards don’t necessarily apply in immigration matters, where proceedings are considered civil. People questioned or detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have a right to remain silent, may refuse entry to their homes without a judicial warrant, and can ask to speak with an attorney — but those rights are grounded in statute, not constitutional law. Because immigration cases are civil, the exclusionary rule that suppresses illegally obtained evidence in criminal court rarely applies.

Beasley expanded on the practical challenges this creates for courts and communities, noting that individuals are sometimes held in local jails at federal request and that many detention centers are privately operated, complicating oversight and access to due process.

“Detention usually implies criminal punishment, but immigration detention is labeled civil, and that fluidity raises due process concerns: Who may be held, where, under what conditions, and with what rights?” Beasley said. Despite these complexities, she said, lawyers and judges play a crucial role in upholding fairness, transparency, and public confidence in the legal system.

McKinney detailed a recent case where an immigrant was mistaken for someone on a watch list with the same name. He was detained and interrogated without a judicial warrant and held at a facility in Georgia, though McKinney said it was clear his client wasn’t the individual the government was looking for. The client posted bond, but ICE invoked an “automatic stay.” McKinney freed his client through a writ of habeus corpus — challenging the lawfulness of government detention — but hiring an attorney to take that step is cost prohibitive for many.

He cautioned that knowing your rights may not matter as much in the current climate if those “feel ignored on the ground.”

“The government can’t have it both ways — calling people ‘criminals’ while denying criminal-procedure protections in what it labels as civil proceedings,” McKinney said.

Panelists closed by urging future lawyers to understand these boundaries, help clients know their rights, and uphold justice in every setting — criminal, civil or otherwise.

“Lawyers and courts are pushing back and upholding the rule of law,” Beasley said, noting why she is encouraged during a challenging moment for democracy. “The pendulum swings, but advocacy, teaching and judging move the needle. To our students: It’s a good time to be a lawyer. Your work changes lives and strengthens institutions.”",https://eloncdn.blob.core.windows.net/eu3/sites/74/2025/10/10_07_25_We-the-People-4th-Amendment-001-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:12.532119

The court also rejected an appeal by several Colorado parents, who contend that a school district in that state violated their constitutional rights when they excluded them from discussions of their children’s gender identity.

The announcements came as part of a list of orders released by the Supreme Court from the justices’ private conference on Oct. 10. The court granted one new case, Hunter v. United States, from that conference on Friday afternoon; Tuesday’s order list did not add any additional cases to its oral argument calendar for the 2025-26 term.

Kelsey Dallas has more on the Alex Jones case in an earlier post for SCOTUSblog.

In Lee v. Poudre School District R-1, the justices declined to weigh in on a lawsuit against a Colorado school district by parents who allege that the district violated their constitutional rights by interfering with their parental decision making. Specifically, the parents contended that the school district’s policies “exclude parents from the conversation of their child’s gender identity by, inter alia, actively discouraging disclosure of such information by school officials” and “sowing doubt in the minds of students regarding the trustworthiness of their parents” – by, for example, telling students not to tell their parents what they discuss at an after-school group that addresses gender and sexuality, and by directing school staff to use a student’s preferred name and pronouns with the child, but the child’s birth name and pronouns with the parents. “This secrecy and concealment toward parents whose children discuss topics related to gender identity at school creates division within the parent-child relationship and undermines the trust essential to a family’s foundation,” the parents said.

A federal district court ruled for the school district, concluding that the parents had not shown that the school district had an official policy that caused the parents’ alleged injury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision.

On Monday, the court denied the parents’ petition for review. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, penned a statement regarding the decision to deny review. Alito wrote that he agreed with the court’s decision because the parents had not challenged “the ground for the ruling below.” “But I remain concerned,” Alito added, “that some federal courts are ‘tempt[ed]’ to avoid confronting a ‘particularly contentious constitutional questio[n]’: whether a school district violates parents’ fundamental rights ‘when, without parental knowledge or consent, it encourages a student to transition to a new gender or assists in that process.’” “The troubling—and tragic—allegations in this case underscore the ‘great and growing national importance’ of the question that these parent petitioners present,’” he concluded.

The justices denied review without comment in Doe v. Grindr, in which the court had been asked to weigh in on the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives websites and online platforms immunity from lawsuits arising from content posted by their users, and for their moderation of content.

The question comes to the court in a lawsuit brought against Grindr, a dating app that is popular with bisexual and gay men, by an anonymous plaintiff, known only as John Doe. Doe contends that when he was 15, Grindr offered him a membership and recommended him to adults for sex, and that he was then raped by four adults over four days.

A federal court in California dismissed Doe’s case. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright acknowledged that the facts of Doe’s case were “indisputably alarming and tragic,” but he concluded that they were barred by Section 230. Although Doe “seeks to hold Grindr liable for the design, development, and sale of a defective product,” Wright wrote, in fact “Doe’s claims seek to hold Grindr liable based on its publishing of user content.”

When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld that ruling, Doe came to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up his case. “This abdication of responsibility by platforms is exactly what Congress enacted Section 230 to prevent, yet it has turned into a license to unleash harm in the name of profit,” he argued.

In Humphreys v. Emmons, the justices denied review in a death penalty case based on a murder and robbery in which a juror told the court before the trial began that she had been the victim of an attempted rape and robbery but swore that she could nonetheless be a fair juror. While the jury was deliberating whether to impose the death penalty, however, she told the other jurors that she had been assaulted while naked in her bed, and jurors later reported that she “had her mind made up from day one” of the trial. Jury deliberations eventually “almost completely broke down,” and the jury eventually returned a death sentence.

Although testimony and affidavits about the juror’s conduct later came to light, Georgia law generally bars the use of testimony by jurors to undermine a verdict. When the defendant raised the issue in an effort to overturn his sentence, the federal courts rejected his claim under federal post-conviction law, and the Supreme Court denied review.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the denial of review. In Sotomayor’s view, the Supreme Court should have sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit for it to clarify the grounds for its decision. “In a capital case with a potentially meritorious juror-misconduct claim,” she wrote, “mere confusion about a lower court’s reasoning does not justify closing the door to relief altogether.” “Tragically,” she continued, “the Court denies review instead, allowing a death sentence tainted by a single juror’s extraordinary misconduct to stand.”

In Thomas v. Humboldt County, California, the court rebuffed an appeal from California property owners who challenged the county’s failure to provide them with a jury trial before imposing fines for alleged violations of county codes relating to growing cannabis – even though, the property owners say, none of them actually ever grew cannabis. The lower courts dismissed their claim under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, citing the Supreme Court’s 1916 ruling in Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Co. v. Bombolis, holding that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does not apply to the states. The property owners then came to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up their case.

Gorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of review in which he agreed with the court’s decision to turn down Thomas’ appeal, noting that the case was not a suitable one in which to decide whether to overrule Bombolis. “At the same time,” Gorsuch added, “I do not doubt that Bombolis warrants a second look.” He urged the justices to take up the question soon.

The justices called for the views of the U.S. solicitor general in two cases: Renteria v. New Mexico Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, involving New Mexico’s decision to bar organizations claiming an exemption under the Affordable Care Act from operating within the state; and Highland Capital Management v. Nexpoint Advisors, involving bankruptcy protections for nondebtors. There is no deadline for the solicitor general to file his response.

The justices did not act on Does 1-2 v. Hochul, a challenge to New York’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers that has since been repealed. The justices will meet for another private conference on Friday, Oct. 17.

Father Curran told OSV News he got caught in the protest following the shooting on his way to his rectory after celebrating Mass elsewhere.
The priest said he wanted to help cool things down, but the ICE agents ""did not look like they wanted me around.""
""Before ... we could kind of see between the fencing, the detainees being loaded into the vans,"" she told OSV News.
She and Father Curran said the foremost prayer is for meaningful immigration reform.","CHICAGO (OSV News) -- Amid ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations and protests in Chicago, Catholic faithful and clergy there are trying to both uphold the human dignity of affected immigrants and protect their rights to worship and receive the sacraments.

In a statement sent to OSV News Oct. 14, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago said keeping the country safe and being mindful of human dignity ""are not mutually exclusive.""

""In fact, one cannot exist without the other,"" he said.

The cardinal decried what he called ""unnecessarily aggressive tactics"" of federal agents whom he said have overreached in their task of apprehending people, ""and which seem to be intended to terrorize and cause chaos, rather than fulfilling the noble calling of law enforcement."" He said law enforcement should not be put in this position.

""Not only do they risk violating the dignity of others but such activity is beneath their own dignity,"" Cardinal Cupich said.

Local media reported that residents in Rogers Park, a Northside neighborhood surrounding St. Jerome Church, took action to protect Catholic parishioners' ability to enter and leave the church for Sunday Mass Oct. 12, forming a human chain, after learning of the presence of alleged federal immigration agents outside St. Jerome during the 8 a.m. Mass in Spanish.

Video footage from a Spanish-language news outlet Telemundo Chicago showed a priest warning Mass-goers to be very careful leaving the church. Various news outlets showed the church's outdoor signage had its Mass times covered.

A day earlier, federal agents did not allow priests, who led a Eucharistic procession in Chicago’s near-western suburbs to an immigration processing facility in Broadview, to give holy Communion to Catholics detained there. When they arrived and told Illinois state troopers their plan, the troopers checked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who said they could not give it to detainees.

Priests told various local media they had told ICE days in advance about the Eucharistic procession and distribution of holy Communion planned for Oct. 11.

The priests instead gave the Eucharist, which Catholics hold to be Jesus Christ in his body, blood, soul and divinity, to the 1,000 faithful who joined the procession. Afterward, all left the area.

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of Trump's mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief. The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%); eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

The Broadview processing center has been a flashpoint for chaotic protests of the Trump administration's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" against immigrants in the Chicago area who lack legal authorization to live in the U.S. Tense confrontations between protestors and ICE agents have taken place at the ICE holding facility in Broadview, just 12.5 miles west of downtown Chicago, since mid-September.

On Oct. 9, U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis placed a temporary restraining order on federal agents' use of tear gas, pepper spray and deterrents against the protesters.

A Chicago-area Dominican priest, who attended the hearing, expressed relief for the two-week reprieve, calling it ""an absolutely courageous move by a federal judge.""

Dominican Father Brendan Curran, promoter of peace and justice for his order in the U.S. and Canada, told OSV News he is speaking as a witness in the case's next court hearing.

""I have witnessed people abusing the law as federal agents, hitting people -- tear gas is dropped right around me, out at Broadview, out at Pershing and Kedzie. It dropped right in front of my car,"" Father Curran said.

Multiple Chicago-area, Illinois state media groups and a national media union, as well as a Presbyterian pastor and other individuals, lodged a freedom of speech complaint Oct. 6 against the Trump administration after the plaintiffs reported multiple incidents of getting hit by various riot deterrents used by armed ICE officers during the protests.

Among the videos to be submitted to the court is one showing Presbyterian Pastor David Black being struck on the side of the head in a shower of pepper balls fired from federal agents standing atop the Broadview facility's roof Sept. 19.

The First Presbyterian Church of Chicago pastor said in an Instagram post that went viral Oct. 8 that he told ICE agents moments before being struck that ""there was still time to repent, believe the Good News, and turn from their wicked ways.""

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a lengthy post on X that the same video showed ""agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility -- impeding operations."" She said these actions put people at risk.

""If you are obstructing law enforcement you can expect to be met with force,"" she said.

Homeland Security has claimed that, as of Oct. 9, ICE agents have experienced a 1,000% increase in assaults against them, as well as doxxing (publishing private information online) and threats to their families online. DHS also reported Oct. 3 more than 1,000 arrests of immigrants it said lacked authorization to live and work in the U.S. in Illinois.

However, Amanda Tovar said her video supplemented footage of this incident by showing what took place from a different angle, showing two out of three masked agents, both wearing camouflage, firing down in Pastor Black's direction from their rooftop position.

Tovar, a special education teacher from nearby Forest Park, told OSV News her footage ""clearly shows"" the pastor was unarmed, ""not being threatening"" and the agents were not under attack.

Tovar said she herself was injured when she was struck by a ""flash-bang"" grenade (designed to disorient with its bright flash and sparks) on the chest ""near the heart"" later that day. She said she was hit with multiple pepper balls in the ""really chaotic scene.""

""So I really got injured in that and I still have bruising ... even from weeks ago. That's how bad it was,"" said Tovar.

At Pershing Road and Kedzie Avenue, an intersection inside an area that has become a hotspot for ICE arrests in Chicago, a federal agent fired multiple shots Oct. 4 that injured a woman, Marimar Martinez who was treated for gunshot wounds and released. DHS claimed that Martinez deliberately rammed a Customs and Border Patrol vehicle; her attorney told the judge he had body-camera footage from an agent showing a CBP officer got out of the government vehicle and yelled, ""Do something (expletive),"" before shooting Martinez multiple times.

Father Curran told OSV News he got caught in the protest following the shooting on his way to his rectory after celebrating Mass elsewhere. The priest said he wanted to help cool things down, but the ICE agents ""did not look like they wanted me around."" Given that, and the tear gas in the air, the priest said he did not get out of his car.

Father Curran is part of a prayer group that has gone to the Broadview facility every Friday morning for more than 18 years. He said the prayer vigils had been peaceful and without incident all those years -- but recently he had to stop taking student groups there, because it had become dangerous. Father Curran said the behavior he saw in September from federal agents was ""just dreadful.""

Father Curran described ""intimidation, pushing people, hurling these things off the building.""

""There's snipers on both corners of the building,"" he said.

Father Curran said he hoped Judge Ellis' order would mean ""there is someone supervising this kind of abusive action that has been out of control for a month.""

Margie Rudnik, a Lay Sister of Mercy from the nearby River Forest suburb, who coordinates a weekly rosary for detained migrants, told OSV News that their prayer group that arrives at about 7:15 a.m. near the Broadview facility every Friday morning to pray, is not as affected by the chaos that has ensued at the protests. Rupdnik said for safety, they have purposely moved to a far corner about a block away.

""Before ... we could kind of see between the fencing, the detainees being loaded into the vans,"" she told OSV News. ""And then as the vans drove away, we would hold up our rosaries. And we have a picture and a flag of Our Lady of Guadalupe ,and we would hold those up in the hopes that the people on the buses would understand that we were praying for them. But now we've not been able to do any of that.""

Rudnik said she has not ""seen a van"" in weeks and she said she believes the detainees are likely moved very early in the morning.

She and Father Curran said the foremost prayer is for meaningful immigration reform.

But Father Curran also said his presence at the prayer site is also as a representative for Catholics whose community is ""absolutely terrorized"" -- to the point that religious education has been suspended, people do not go to church, nor leave home, even for food.

""This is real,"" he said.

The department did not identify the visa holders by name or specify what type of visas were revoked.

The revocations followed earlier warnings from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that foreigners on visas praising Kirk’s death should “prepare to be deported.” A day after Kirk’s shooting, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau instructed consular officials to monitor such comments on social media and identify their authors.

Hours after the announcement, immigration attorney Eric Lee, a co-founder of the Consular Accountability Project, wrote on social media that the legal defense organization would represent anyone whose visa was denied or revoked over “Charlie Kirk-related speech” pro bono.

Lee has previously defended foreign students and activists whose visas were revoked for political speech. He’s challenged the Trump administration’s visa restrictions targeting pro-Palestinian protesters across university campuses.

Kirk was a prominent political voice in the conservative movement. He founded Turning Point USA, a group that mobilized young voters around right-wing causes and became a key player in President Donald Trump’s political movement. Known for his polarizing ideological debates on college campuses, he built a large social media following and developed close ties with Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other Republican leaders. He played a critical role in Trump’s reelection by bolstering his appeal to younger voters.

In a statement sent to OSV News Oct. 14, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago said keeping the country safe and being mindful of human dignity “are not mutually exclusive.”

“In fact, one cannot exist without the other,” he said.

The cardinal decried what he called “unnecessarily aggressive tactics” of federal agents whom he said have overreached in their task of apprehending people, “and which seem to be intended to terrorize and cause chaos, rather than fulfilling the noble calling of law enforcement.” He said law enforcement should not be put in this position.

“Not only do they risk violating the dignity of others but such activity is beneath their own dignity,” Cardinal Cupich said.

Recent instances highlight issues

Local media reported that residents in Rogers Park, a Northside neighborhood surrounding St. Jerome Church, took action to protect Catholic parishioners’ ability to enter and leave the church for Sunday Mass Oct. 12, forming a human chain, after learning of the presence of alleged federal immigration agents outside St. Jerome during the 8 a.m. Mass in Spanish.

Video footage from a Spanish-language news outlet Telemundo Chicago showed a priest warning Mass-goers to be very careful leaving the church. Various news outlets showed the church’s outdoor signage had its Mass times covered.

A day earlier, federal agents did not allow priests, who led a Eucharistic procession in Chicago’s near-western suburbs to an immigration processing facility in Broadview, to give holy Communion to Catholics detained there. When they arrived and told Illinois state troopers their plan, the troopers checked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who said they could not give it to detainees.

Priests told various local media they had told ICE days in advance about the Eucharistic procession and distribution of holy Communion planned for Oct. 11.

The priests instead gave the Eucharist, which Catholics hold to be Jesus Christ in his body, blood, soul and divinity, to the 1,000 faithful who joined the procession. Afterward, all left the area.

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief. The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%); eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

Confrontations between protestors and ICE

The Broadview processing center has been a flashpoint for chaotic protests of the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” against immigrants in the Chicago area who lack legal authorization to live in the U.S. Tense confrontations between protestors and ICE agents have taken place at the ICE holding facility in Broadview, just 12.5 miles west of downtown Chicago, since mid-September.

On Oct. 9, U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis placed a temporary restraining order on federal agents’ use of tear gas, pepper spray and deterrents against the protesters.

A Chicago-area Dominican priest, who attended the hearing, expressed relief for the two-week reprieve, calling it “an absolutely courageous move by a federal judge.”

Dominican Father Brendan Curran, promoter of peace and justice for his order in the U.S. and Canada, told OSV News he is speaking as a witness in the case’s next court hearing.

“I have witnessed people abusing the law as federal agents, hitting people — tear gas is dropped right around me, out at Broadview, out at Pershing and Kedzie. It dropped right in front of my car,” Father Curran said.

Multiple Chicago-area, Illinois state media groups and a national media union, as well as a Presbyterian pastor and other individuals, lodged a freedom of speech complaint Oct. 6 against the Trump administration after the plaintiffs reported multiple incidents of getting hit by various riot deterrents used by armed ICE officers during the protests.

Among the videos to be submitted to the court is one showing Presbyterian Pastor David Black being struck on the side of the head in a shower of pepper balls fired from federal agents standing atop the Broadview facility’s roof Sept. 19.

Sutro Professor of Law at the Santa Clara University School of Law and a faculty scholar with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Views are his own.

In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., decided in June 2025, the Supreme Court gave a green light to the Trump Administration to continue its practice of “third country removals.” In a powerful dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that the Court effectively authorized the president to deport non-citizens to countries where they are likely to be tortured.

The United States is a party to the Convention Against Torture, a multilateral treaty. Under Article 3, the United States has a binding international legal obligation not to deport “a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.” That legal obligation is also a moral obligation: it would be morally reprehensible for our government, or any government, to send an individual to a country where that person is likely to be tortured. The Court’s decision in D.V.D. raises the question whether the United States is violating both international law and fundamental ethical norms.

To evaluate that question, let’s begin with some background on federal statutes governing “removal” of non-citizens. If the government wants to expel a non-citizen from the United States, it must first obtain a “removal order” from a federal judge that authorizes the government to remove that person from U.S. territory. As a general rule, non-citizens arrested upon entry into the United States must be returned to the country from which they came. Most other non-citizens who are subject to removal orders are entitled to designate a country of their choice. If neither of the above options is practicable, federal statutes specify that the government must send the individual either to his country of citizenship or to his former country of residence.

In very unusual circumstances–where none of these options is feasible–federal statutes authorize “third country removal,” meaning that the U.S. government may send that person to any country where the government will accept him. However, federal law allows third country removal only after the government has tried all of the alternatives listed in the previous paragraph and determined that they are “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.”

Assume that the government intends to send Jane Doe to country X. Federal law grants Ms. Doe a right to object on the grounds that removal to country X would violate U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the Torture Convention. Federal law also grants Jane Doe a right to have her objection heard by an impartial judge before the government sends her to country X. That procedural right—the opportunity to be heard—is constitutionally protected by the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. Moreover, I contend, in cases where Jane Doe fears that she may be tortured in country X, the opportunity to be heard is both a moral and a legal entitlement.

The Trump Administration’s policy, as articulated in internal guidance documents issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security, boils down to this. Individuals like Jane Doe have a procedural right to raise a defense to removal under Article 3 of the Torture Convention once, but not more than once. For example, assume that the government intends to send Jane Doe to Guatemala. Ms. Doe objects that removal to Guatemala would violate Article 3 because she is likely to be tortured there. An immigration judge agrees with her and issues an order barring removal to Guatemala. At that point, according to the Trump Administration’s policy guidance, Jane Doe has effectively exhausted her only opportunity to be heard on a Torture Convention claim. If the government then designates South Sudan, for example, as the destination for third country removal, Jane Doe no longer has a procedural right to raise a Torture Convention defense because she already used that right to avoid removal to Guatemala. (Technically, the bar to raising a Torture Convention defense applies only if the government has obtained “credible assurances” from South Sudan that individuals sent there will not be tortured. However, according to the Trump Administration, the executive branch has unilateral authority to determine whether assurances are “credible,” and courts cannot second-guess such determinations.)

The petitioners in D.V.D. included a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico, and six individuals who were sent to South Sudan—all under the third-country removal policy described above. Various news reports suggest that the Trump Administration has obtained diplomatic assurances, which it deems “credible,” allowing for third country removals to Uganda, Rwanda, Eswatini, and South Sudan. The government has reportedly considered both Uganda and Eswatini as potential destination countries for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man whom the Trump Administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, despite a court order prohibiting his removal to El Salvador.

Freedom House publishes an annual report that rates the level of freedom for every country in the world on a scale from zero to 100. 100 is the best possible score. In the most recent Freedom House report, Uganda scored 34, Rwanda scored 21, Eswatini scored 17, and South Sudan scored a whopping 1 out of 100. All four countries are rated “not free.” Given the terrible human rights records of all four countries, diplomatic assurances from those countries—that is, promises not to commit acts of torture—are not worth the paper they are written on. Although the Trump Administration claims that diplomatic assurances from those countries are “credible,” that claim itself is not credible.

Commentators have suggested that, under the current third-country removal policies, as many as one million non-citizens currently living in the United States may be exposed to the risk of removal to countries with horrible human rights conditions. In their zeal to carry out the president’s mass deportation policies, senior government officials in the Trump Administration are sacrificing the rights of detainees—both their substantive right not to be tortured and their right to procedural due process before they are removed from the country. Senior officials are also sacrificing their own moral integrity by accepting diplomatic assurances from dictatorial governments and pretending that those assurances are credible.",https://www.scu.edu/media/scuedu/style-assets/stylesheets/css-assets/footer-mission@2x.png,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:20.628302

""She might argue that she's trying to couch this in policy and so therefore, she's just pointing the blame where she sees that it lies, but I think other people could interpret this as being excessively partisan,"" Gillespie said.

Secretary Kristi Noem TSA video about shutdown

The backstory:

The video, first obtained by FOX News last week, was intended to be shown at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints where employees have continued working without pay on the 14th day of the shutdown.

In the message, Noem reportedly says, ""It is TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience possible while we keep you safe.""

She goes on to add, ""However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.""

Backlash towards shutdown TSA video

What they're saying:

Airport officials across the country have cited multiple reasons for refusing to play the video — from concerns about its ""political content"" to potential violations of federal law, specifically the Hatch Act, a 1939 statute designed to prevent federal employees from using their positions to influence elections or how government programs are administered.

While TSA checkpoints often display informational videos featuring government officials welcoming travelers or explaining security procedures, they typically avoid any content with political overtones.

According to CNN, airports that have declined to play the video due to its political nature include Seattle-Tacoma International, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Harry Reid International in Las Vegas, and Portland International. The Washington Post reports that airports in Buffalo, Charlotte, Cleveland, and Los Angeles also have no plans to show the video.

Since the federal government shut down on Oct. 1, the TSA has warned travelers to expect delays as staffing shortages and unpaid workdays begin to take their toll. Air traffic controllers are also continuing to work without pay, creating additional strain and financial uncertainty for critical aviation workers.

Across more than two hours of arguments, the conservative majority raised alarm that states like Louisiana are going too far in intentionally drawing additional majority-minority districts to comply with the landmark 1965 law to the point where it’s unconstitutional.

It’s a premise that poses major implications for electoral maps not just in Louisiana, but nationwide.

It remains to be seen just how broadly the court will rule, but several conservative justices questioned if the court’s voting rights precedents need to be modified or even overruled outright.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second appointee to the court.

“But that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” he pressed.

The justices are weighing whether race-based redistricting under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act complies with the 14th and 15th amendments, which were ratified after the Civil War to provide equal protection under the law and prohibit intentional racial discrimination in voting.

Louisiana’s Republican-controlled legislature begrudgingly added a second majority-Black congressional district after the courts ruled a design with only one likely violated Section 2.

Last term, Louisiana defended its new map before the high court. But after the justices raised the stakes and set the case for a rare reargument, Louisiana abandoned defending its design.

Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga told the justices that the state fought “tooth and nail” during the earlier litigation to convince the courts that the Constitution would not permit a second majority-Black district, suggesting the current map would “never” have been passed if it succeeded.

“We never wanted to be here in the first place,” Aguiñaga said. “They have placed states in impossible situations where the only sure demand is more racial discrimination for more decades.

“But I think if anything is clear in this court’s dedication to eliminating all racial discrimination, it is that the Constitution does not tolerate this system of government-mandated racial balancing,” he continued.

The reargument has thrown into question the court’s decades-old voting precedents that have empowered minority groups to challenge maps across the country and force states to draw more majority-minority districts under Section 2.

Louisiana urged the court Wednesday to have zero tolerance for any consideration of race in redistricting. The state’s flip now puts it on the same side of the case as the Trump administration, but the administration has argued for a more modest approach.

Rather than completely overrule the court’s Section 2 framework, it told the court it should merely limit it.

Specifically, the Justice Department wants the high court to require Section 2 plaintiffs to

propose a superior map to the state’s — not just an equivalent one — and show an objective likelihood the state’s map reflects intentional discrimination.

The administration also wants the justices to decouple political party from race, even if it means modifying the framework that has governed Section 2 claims since the 1980s, known as the Gingles test.

“That’s part of the problem here,” said Principal Deputy Solicitor General Hashim Mooppan, “is that what’s going on under Gingles now is not actually figuring out whether there’s an unfair effect based on race; it’s figuring out whether there’s an unfair effect based on party.”

Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked if the court would “necessarily” have to modify the precedent.

“Is there a way to say it’s a clarification of Gingles? I mean, Gingles is a 40-year-old precedent. A big ask to change it.”

No matter whether it ends up being completely eviscerated, modified or tweaked, the court’s liberal justices took the administration’s stance to mean a more sweeping endgame was likely.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the government’s ultimate goal was to get rid of Section 2.

“Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn’t deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor said.

Justice Elena Kagan at one point said some of the challengers’ arguments “have been specifically rejected by this court over many decades and three years ago.”

The long-running legal battle over Louisiana’s map began after the 2020 census, when the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature overrode a former Democratic governor’s veto of a map with one majority-Black district.

Black voters and civil rights groups sued. They claimed that the design diluted Black voters’ power at the polls.

A three-judge appeals panel agreed, and the Supreme Court temporarily let the map stay in place ahead of the 2022 midterms, before throwing out Louisiana’s appeal after deciding a separate redistricting case in Alabama.

To avoid court-drawn boundaries, Republican leaders in the state took action.

They passed a new map with a second majority-Black district. Self-described “non-African American” voters then challenged it, which a three-judge panel invalidated, sending the case back to the Supreme Court.

The map remained in effect for last year’s elections, but the Supreme Court’s decision could cause a major shake-up for future terms.

With Louisiana and the “non-African American” voters now aligned, it left the Black voters and civil rights groups from the earlier litigation to defend the Voting Rights Act in its current form before the Supreme Court.

They argued that siding with Louisiana would effectively turn back the page to the widespread discrimination that existed before the landmark law’s enactment.

NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Janai Nelson told the justices that, in Louisiana, every Black congressional member was elected in districts drawn to enable minority groups to garner enough voting power to elect their candidates of choice.

“We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,” she said, suggesting it would be “catastrophic” for Section 2 to cease to operate as it does today.

A decision is expected in the case by next summer. Though it may come too late to impact next year’s midterms, the ruling could spark changes to congressional maps for future election cycles.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R) was in the public gallery Wednesday as his state made its case, as was Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).

The Louisiana governor told The Hill in an interview ahead of arguments that courts should stay out of redistricting, a process that’s political in nature and should fall to elected representatives.

“What you’ve seen is that the more the court gets involved in a legislative process, the more it entangles itself in its own opinions,” Landry said Tuesday. “Because what has happened is, each time it’s had to render or address an opinion based upon redistricting, it’s only complicated the process even further and ended up with a different series of litigation.”

He said he wants the Supreme Court to end the dispute entirely, so Louisiana can stop “needlessly” spending tens of millions of dollars on litigation tied to redistricting.

“I hope that this is the end of the tracks,” he said.

Callais, which could determine whether Black voters have a meaningful chance at equal representation in Congress. The question before the court is a crucial one: does creating majority-Black districts to comply with the Voting Rights Act amount to unconstitutional racial discrimination?

In 2022, Louisiana lawmakers drew a congressional map that gave Black voters—one-third of the state’s population—a realistic shot at electing a member of Congress in only one of six districts. Federal courts ruled that this violated the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voting practices that discriminate based on race. The legislature then created a second majority-Black district linking the cities of Baton Rouge and Shreveport. For the first time in decades, the state’s political map reflected its demographics.

A group of white voters sued, claiming the remedy itself was discriminatory. A divided federal court agreed, finding lawmakers gave race too much weight. Now the Supreme Court must decide whether intentionally creating a district where Black voters can elect their preferred candidates violates the constitution, though Congress endorsed this remedy in 1965.

The challengers’ logic is upside down. But these attempts to undermine anti-racist efforts are not new. Legal experts warn Callais could become a sequel to Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision that gutted key Voting Rights Act provisions and unleashed widespread voter suppression. If the court narrows this provision again, challenging racially skewed maps will become nearly impossible.

A constitutional scholar, Erwin Chemerinsky, cautions that the court could go even further, undermining the principle of disparate impact, the idea that policies can be discriminatory when they disproportionately harm people of color, even without overt racist intent. This idea, used to enforce equal rights in housing, education, and employment for decades, helps bring the United States into better alignment with international human rights law.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510usp_us_Louisiana%20v.%20Callais%20.jpg?h=e6ec9631&itok=n2e3ZcWB,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:10.097643

Steve Rios told NBC 7 that his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez, were picking up his pregnant younger sister, Ashley, and her husband, who is also a Marine, at the enormous West Coast base on Sept. 28 — just like they had done every weekend for the past few months while expecting their first grandchild.

But this time, Rios said, his parents were stopped at the gate and held for ICE agents, who detained them.

They were released a few hours later with ankle monitors and picked up by their son, who said they were instructed to check in with the agency later that week.

When Rios drove them to their check-in appointment a few days later, he said, they waited for hours before being detained again.

“I just kept on looking at my parents. I didn’t know if it would be the last time I’d see them,” the young Marine said.

Rios shared that his father was wearing a red shirt and a white hat, both of which said “Proud dad of a US Marine,” when he was taken away and deported by ICE agents.

“He said, ‘Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we’ll be fine,'” Rios recalled.

He said he spoke briefly to his father on the phone the day after the second detention, and was told his parents were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court.

They were later transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center, NBC 7 reported.

While his father was deported after being detained by ICE, it’s unclear if his mother suffered the same fate.

Rios, who said he joined the Corps right out of high school to make his parents proud and is currently in the reserves after spending four years on active duty, mentioned that the couple came to the US from Mexico 30 years ago.

He described them as hardworking, law-abiding members of their community with no criminal record, who washed cars and cleaned houses to get by.

They were also waiting for green cards and work visas that he sponsored when they were detained.

“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Rios said. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in. I don’t think amounts to what they’ve done.”

He said the experience scared him because it was something he had worried about happening his whole life.

Ashley, his younger sister, recalled the gut-wrenching message she received from her brother when their parents were first detained at Camp Pendleton’s front gate.

“My brother texted me that they got stopped. And as soon as I heard that, I just started bawling,” she said, fighting back tears.

Now expecting her first child, Ashley said the ordeal has hit even harder.

“It’s just hard because you just want to hear your parents’ voices and know everything will be OK,” she said. “I’d always want my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it’s hard not to think about them.”

The siblings said they’re uncertain what will happen next, but their faith is helping them stay strong.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Rios said. “The only person that knows is up there.”

A spokesperson for ICE told NBC 7 that “as part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

Ninth Circuit:

No En Banc Rehearing in Case Over Legal Aid Funding

Divided Panel Rejects Call for En Banc Review of Denial of Bid for Stay of Preliminary Injunction Directing Reinstatement of Payments for Representation of Unaccompanied Migrant Children

By a MetNews Staff Writer

A divided Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday denied a request for en banc rehearing over a decision declining to stay a preliminary injunction directing the Executive Branch to reinstate funding to a left-leaning immigration group that provides, among other services, legal representation for unaccompanied migrant children through subcontracting with firms across the nation.

The case originated after Community Legal Services and Social Justice Collaborative, two Bay Area immigration firms, and other organizations filed a complaint against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in March, asserting that the Executive Branch violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) by cancelling a $200 million contract with Acacia Center for Justice that served as a source of the plaintiffs’ funding.

They sought only declaratory and injunctive relief.

Acacia describes itself as a “non-governmental organization that supports and partners with a national network of human rights defenders who provide legal defense to immigrants” and says that the “U.S. immigration…system is…intentionally designed to exploit, exclude, criminalize, detain, and deport people who have historically been viewed as undeserving of inclusion in our national fabric, particularly Black and brown people.”

Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), HHS is required to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children in immigration custody receive legal representation. In March, President Donald Trump’s administration paused the flow of federal dollars to Acacia, which was the sole vendor paid by the federal government to provide legal aid for migrant minors.

Preliminary Injunction

On April 29, District Court Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of the Northern District of California, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief, ordering:

“Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds…as of March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008…, particularly [the] provision of funds for direct legal representation services to unaccompanied children.”

In May, a divided three-judge panel denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh, a Biden appointee, joined by Senior Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher, who was placed on the court by Democratic President Bill Clinton, concluded that the government had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. Koh and Fletcher were each appointed by Democrats.

Dissenting, Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, wrote that “[e]ven if the district court had jurisdiction,” a decision to cut funding “is committed to agency discretion.”

En Banc Reconsideration

Fletcher and Koh wrote in support of Friday’s order denying en banc reconsideration of the stay denial. Circuit Judges Patrick J. Bumatay and Lawrence VanDyke, joined in by Callahan as well as Circuit Judges Sandra S. Ikuta, Mark J. Bennett, Ryan D. Nelson, Daniel P. Collins, Kenneth K. Lee, and Daniel Aaron Bress, penned a dissent, saying:

“Though Plaintiffs style this suit as one premised on the APA, ‘in essence’ it’s contractual. This dispute therefore belongs in the Court of Federal Claims, and we’re powerless to hear it. This should have been a hard point to miss….Even so, our court has decided against rehearing this case. In doing so, we leave in place a novel and intrusive injunction that the district court never had the authority to enter.”

Ikuta, like Callahan, was placed on the court by President George W. Bush. The remaining dissenters are Trump appointees.

Breach of Contract Action

Koh and Fletcher acknowledged that, under the Tucker Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. §1491, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over any breach of contract claim against the federal government seeking monetary damages over $10,000. However, they rejected the view that the plaintiffs’ claims amount to a restyled breach of contract action arising out of the Acacia agreement, saying:

“The bottom line is that Plaintiffs have no contract with the Government. They do not invoke any contractual terms as the basis for their action. Nor do they seek a contractual remedy from the Government. Rather, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring compliance with the statutory obligations set out by Congress and the regulatory obligations set forth by Defendants themselves. Thus, as the district court put it, ‘Plaintiffs’ claims have no business before the [Court of Federal] Claims.’ ”

Noting that “every presidential administration since the TVPRA’s passage has provided funding for direct representation of unaccompanied children,” they pointed out that the APA directs that agency actions that are arbitrary or capricious are to be “set aside.”

No Reinstatement

They opined:

“Plaintiffs do not seek reinstatement of the Acacia contract. Rather, Plaintiffs challenge the Cancellation Order because the Government had previously complied with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule solely through the Acacia contract and failed to provide any meaningful alternative to comply with the TVPRA.”

Koh and Fletcher added:

“The non-contractual source of Plaintiffs’ rights is dispositive….In any event, the second inquiry, ‘the type of relief sought,’ also supports jurisdiction in the district court….Under this prong, we assess whether the ‘complaint…seeks monetary relief.’…It does not.”

Under those circumstances, they declared:

“Our court made the correct decision in denying en banc review….In this appeal, the Government’s merits arguments have been limited solely to whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. For the reasons stated above, as well as those stated in our opinion denying the Government’s motion for a stay, the Government has failed to make the required ‘strong showing’ that it will likely succeed on the merits of its jurisdictional argument.”

Dissenting View

Dissenting, Bumatay and VanDyke asserted:

“The Supreme Court has warned against an ‘imperial Judiciary.’…In recent times, the Court has repeatedly needed to dial back lower court decisions that exceed the judiciary’s equitable authority….For cases involving hot-button policy issues, our review is often constrained—and sometimes curtailed altogether. That means staying in our lane and respecting our jurisdictional bounds. But once again, the Ninth Circuit fails to respect our role and the Supreme Court’s guidance.”

Saying that “groups opposed to the [federal government’s] policies rushed to the federal courthouse in San Francisco” after the administration “stopped funding ongoing work while the Executive Branch reviews the integrity of its multimillion-dollar payments to Acacia,” they asserted:

“But the district court never had jurisdiction in this case. No matter how hard we squint, we can’t avoid the fact that this is a contract dispute. No statute or regulation entitles Plaintiffs to funding. Instead, Plaintiffs simply want money from the federal government based on the government’s contract with the organization that Plaintiffs have subcontracted with.”

Subcontractor Exception

Characterizing the majority’s decision to deny rehearing as “brush[ing] aside these jurisdictional concerns” by creating a “subcontractor exception” to the Tucker Act, they reasoned:

“Now subcontractors can bring suits arising out of government contracts in any district court, including allowing them to utilize the full array of equitable relief available to district courts, while contractors are limited to the Court of Federal Claims.”

Citing two U.S. Supreme Court cases decided earlier this year, Department of Education v. California and National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the judges said:

“It’s our duty to follow the Supreme Court’s lead on how to exercise our equitable power. In cases where a district court’s jurisdiction is likely wanting,…the Court has directed that we stay injunctions against the Executive Branch.”

A significant segment of voters (in some — though not all — polls, a majority) favor large-scale internal immigration enforcement.
But voters should know that they don’t need to agree with liberals about all that in order to reject Trump’s immigration policies.
Rather, that case rests on the myriad ways that Trump’s immigration agenda is egregiously undermining Americans’ civil liberties and democratic freedoms.
3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.","When liberals denounce Donald Trump’s authoritarianism, they often cast his immigration agenda as a case in point.

Back in June, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee decried the president’s “mass deportation operations” as the “stepping stone” to his “radical attempts to seize absolute power.” In the same statement, they condemned the administration’s deportation of noncriminal immigrants “as cruel,” lamenting the harms that it imposed on “law-abiding families.”

Personally, I agree with both of these indictments of Trump’s policy. But it’s important for Americans to understand that they can accept the first one, even if they reject the second: In other words, you don’t need to share liberals’ moral objections to large-scale deportation in order to accept that Trump’s handling of that task is intolerably authoritarian.

For many liberals, the most morally horrifying aspect of Trump’s immigration agenda is its consequences for the undocumented and their loved ones. Armed agents forcing children from their homes, breaking up families, and exiling hardworking people pursuing the American dream — all this seems needlessly cruel.

For precisely that reason, it strikes many progressives as evocative of fascism: The government appears to be tormenting a vulnerable minority population for the sake of tormenting a vulnerable minority population. Thus, from the left’s vantage point, the humanitarian critique of deporting non-criminal immigrants — and the anti-authoritarian critique of Trump’s approach to deporting them — can look like one in the same.

But not all Americans share these intuitions. A significant segment of voters (in some — though not all — polls, a majority) favor large-scale internal immigration enforcement. To them, liberals may sound as though we are equating “authoritarianism” with “the implementation of policies that I don’t like.”

Indeed, some voters may feel that large-scale deportation efforts are the opposite of undemocratic. After all, immigration laws are the byproducts of democratic governance: Our elected representatives chose to put certain restrictions on migration. When people violate those laws, they undermine the electorate’s sovereignty over an issue of public concern. From this viewpoint, deporting law-abiding immigrants may generate sad stories and ugly scenes. Yet were America to adopt the rule, “if you make it past the border, you can stay forever, so long as you don’t commit any crimes,” it would only encourage further subversion of its laws.

I think this line of thought puts too little weight on the welfare of the undocumented, the economic benefits of immigration, and America’s capacity to deter unlawful inflows through border enforcement. But voters should know that they don’t need to agree with liberals about all that in order to reject Trump’s immigration policies.

The case for deeming those policies authoritarian does not hinge on the righteousness of cosmopolitan moral assumptions or economic theories. Rather, that case rests on the myriad ways that Trump’s immigration agenda is egregiously undermining Americans’ civil liberties and democratic freedoms.

Below, I will detail five reasons why even conservative voters should consider Trump’s handling of immigration anti-democratic.

1) The administration is openly flouting due process

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants’ due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, he declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, the Trump administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: When an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule that would empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can’t immediately prove that they’ve been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents aren’t merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and Customs and Border Protection have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump’s expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, Trump has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump’s enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, the president has infamously deported longtime US residents — who’d been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite detention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump’s contempt for due process.

2) Trump is normalizing the use of the military for civil law enforcement

The president has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard’s deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, the president asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president’s command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn’t tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump’s immigration agenda is eroding them.

3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech

The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration’s official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration’s complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2024, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university’s newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk’s visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in antisemitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

4) The government is shielding ICE officers from accountability

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this through both formal and tacit means. On the first front, it has essentially shuttered the DHS’s internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration has condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers and thus hold them to account.

The threat of ICE agents acting abusively is not hypothetical. Recently, an officer was caught on video shoving a woman to the ground inside a New York City courthouse. Initially, he was relieved of his duties pending an investigation. Then, just days later, he was reportedly reinstated after facing no discernible punishment.

Critically, all this is consistent with the president’s own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the DC police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, cops would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protestors throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

5) The pursuit of indiscriminate, mass deportation imposes inherent costs to civil liberties

To this point, I’ve been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump’s immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it’s also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans’ civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on lawbreakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America’s 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America’s immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar tradeoffs.

That doesn’t mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden’s is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans’ most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And Trump’s immigration agenda does precisely that.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/gettyimages-2238859233.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-15 08:57:14.005781

The administration of President Donald Trump has been cracking down on migrants who have entered the country illegally, saying that it is especially targeting those with criminal records, including those who cannot easily be deported to their home countries.

Dozens of deportees have been sent to Africa since July after the Trump administration struck largely secretive agreements with at least five African nations to take migrants under a new third-country deportation program.

Students, faculty and human rights groups are calling for VCU and other universities to protect students from profiling and detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as they expand raid operations nationwide.

Efforts include a student petition for VCUarts to outline its safety policy and a statewide proposal to reestablish campuses as protected “sanctuary” zones posed by faculty unions and the Virginia Coalition for Human Rights.

The efforts come as candidates for statewide office show broad support for local cooperation with ICE. Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, as well as lieutenant governor — and gubernatorial candidate — Winsome Earle-Sears have both previously opposed efforts to make Virginia a “sanctuary state,” meaning they will not cooperate with federal agencies on immigration enforcement.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger said in last week’s debate that she also opposed “providing any sort of sanctuary policies here,” according to a previous report by The Commonwealth Times.

Alyse Few, a second-year graphic design major, is one of the students circulating a petition in the School of the Arts asking the university to address student detainment fears. The petition calls for classes to switch from in-person to virtual instruction when students feel unsafe on campus because of ICE threats.

“There have been several accounts made by students of ICE being spotted on or near the VCU campus, even from last semester,” Few said. “I’ve heard students, [myself] included, express their fears, worries and anger over ICE being on campus knowing how they have presented themselves over the last year. Some students have even avoided going to class out of fear.”

The biggest risk to students is walking to and from class, Few said. She believes there should be a transparent way to communicate with students about the presence of immigration enforcement that does not rely on hearsay. She suggested a system that operates similarly to VCUAlerts.

“No one should have to live in fear whenever they leave their home, class, clubs or any other location because of how they look or how they speak, especially at a school,” Few said.

Immigration operations have changed nationally since January as well as rules regulating agents’ behavior, according to NPR. Schools have not been a “protected area” from immigration enforcement since Jan. 20, when the Trump administration rescinded the previous policy protecting them, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

However, ICE cannot enter private homes, including dorms, without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center. The NIJC website shows viewers what a judicial warrant looks like, along with an administrative warrant — a more common form of permission not signed by a judge that does not carry the same power.

The Sacred Heart Center, a local nonprofit, operates a resource page with information for the community regarding immigration enforcement, including Virginia-specific examples of these forms.

Nearly 1,200 international students attend VCU, according to the Office of Admissions. Last semester, two students and one alum were among thousands nationwide to have their visas revoked, according to previous reporting by The CT. The three VCU students later had their visas restored.

VCU assistant professor of sociology Gabriela León-Pérez thinks there is a “heightened sense of fear and anxiety” surrounding ICE’s presence on campus. She thinks many faculty members have responded to the possibility of ICE entering classrooms by developing plans with their students.

“Other universities, such as Columbia University and the University of Michigan, have developed protocols for potential visits by ICE to campus, and it would be a good idea for VCU to develop similar guidelines for our campus community,” León-Pérez said.

Community organizer and former Virginia Tech professor Jack Leff recently collaborated with VCHR to create a list of proposed legislation to protect higher education.

One policy calls for Virginia campuses to be reinstated as “protected sanctuary sites” and prohibits cooperation between campus police departments and ICE. It would codify the requests into state law if officially proposed and passed. Leff said a member of the General Assembly has already agreed to sponsor a bill carrying the proposal — though it depends on the Nov. 4 election results.

Leff said the federal administration is weaponizing ICE to “quell political dissent” on campuses.

“We have seen ICE begin using racial profiling on college and university campuses to attack Latinx students and their families,” Leff said. “Education is a human right, and if people are afraid to come to campus or speak out because of the threat of ICE, then that would fundamentally dismantle the promise of higher education.”

First-year student Alex Cox said he thinks ICE has no business on campus and described the idea as “sickening.”

“I don’t like ICE at all,” Cox said. “I think it’s inhumane and absurd, the things the general public has been allowing to slide in terms of this administration as a whole. Seeing ICE on campus is … [a] nightmare.”

Cox said the precedent for racial profiling set by the Supreme Court is concerning to him because of his family’s immigrant background and Spanish surnames.

“Hispanics are everywhere, immigrants of every kind are everywhere, and this is really disproportionately affecting Black and brown people especially,” Cox said. “I feel like Afro-Latinos get forgotten about, but they’re also disproportionately affected.”

Michelle Poole, a second-year journalism student, said the presence of ICE officials would endanger students with visas in particular. She is skeptical that VCU would defend students by denying them access. She noted the concern over unwarranted detainments extends to her as a Black student.

“If I had to put an emotion to it, it would definitely be anger,” Poole said. “And also fear in a way. People have to realize that it’s not just one demographic of people of color at risk, it’s now all people of color.”

Kaleb Morton, a second-year biology student, believes ICE deployment on campus is unnecessary. He instead supports building a deeper relationship between VCU Police and students to increase security. He said ICE is not fulfilling their obligation as federal workers to protect and serve.

“The slightest increment of bias, hate or even just an oversaturated sense of power can lead anybody who is in that position to racially profile anybody,” Morton said. “It’s gonna be purely based off of self-interest at that point.”

Lola Good, a second-year forensic science student, is looking ahead to what all Americans can do to prevent violence towards citizens at the hands of immigration officials.

“I would say I’m honestly just confused and scared how we as Americans are letting this happen,” Good said.

All four students said they thought a proposal to put limits on how VCU could cooperate with ICE in some way is a sound idea.

Early in my career as a journalist, I had dinner with a source who would be assassinated less than two years later. Francisco Piedragil Ayala, president of the state coffee council in Guerrero, Mexico, spoke in slow, deliberate Spanish, his snow-white hair tied back. “I think—no, I know—that you and the young people like you are the light at the end of the darkness we are in,” he said, a gleam in his eye. “The way you are going to illuminate it is by learning. By getting to know.”

We were at a restaurant in Acapulco, where my editor had asked me not to stay out late because he was worried about cartel violence. But I was riveted by Piedragil. As the ocean blackened beside us, I took notes and asked questions. At twenty-two, I had moved to Mexico City to cover soft commodities—coffee, cacao, and other crops—for the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. My job was to track their production in Mexico and Central America. But the deeper I went into the mountains and villages, the clearer it became that I wasn’t just reporting on supply chains. I was witnessing the silent machinery behind mass migration.

Piedragil told me that multinational industries were destroying the earth and displacing people. He’d led a longtime resistance to corporate extraction, such as by setting fire to coffee skins destined for Nestlé. When we met, he was helping opium poppy farmers become small-scale quality coffee farmers so that they could be free of the cartels and demand fair prices for their beans. Piedragil told me that the rapacious harvesting of the earth had to end. Otherwise, he said, the earth would become “a machine that will be able to feed only machines.”

He was pointing me toward a truth that our country’s political focus on the border obscures. Poverty and violence, the conditions that are often cited as “root causes” of migration, are symptoms of the industrial pillaging that he was fighting. That plunder—by corporations and cartels, at the behest of corrupt officials—is what was driving people from their homes. “I don’t care what you write about,” Piedragil told me. “I understand that you’ve got to get paid and that they only care to publish certain things.” He knew that my article would be limited to an economic report on rising coffee prices. “But,” he continued, “I can see the wheels turning in your brain.”

Piedragil was planting seeds that would mature long after his assassination, years after I returned to the US to become a border reporter for KPBS in San Diego, then wrote an investigative biography of Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump’s immigration policies, and became an opinion columnist and commentator.

Earlier this year, as I watched the inward creep of the border under the second Trump presidency, it dawned on me: Every day, the border appears in the news as a wall, a fence, or a fixed stretch of land. Inert, unmoving. But the border is a mobile machine. The US has long outsourced border enforcement to Mexico and other countries. Now US federal agents have been deputized to carry the border deep into the US, dragging its violence and impunity to Chicago, Los Angeles, and other American cities; meanwhile, the Supreme Court has affirmed that those agents can target people based on their skin color, language, or low-wage jobs.

I worry about the border settling inside of the journalists who cover it.

Journalists are trained to privilege what we can see. It is easier to photograph concertina wire and corrugated barriers than to trace the snaking patterns of a system that manufactures disposability in the Americas and beyond. But the border is more than its steel. It is the circuitry that is turning the earth into a factory and people into its moving parts. It is a tool of caste, sorting human beings into categories of worth based on race, language, and class. It is the most effective instrument of the machine Piedragil warned about—a machine that can feed only machines.

The border was never confined to the borderlands. I worry about the border settling inside of the journalists who cover it, partitioning our minds and relationships. What began as a geopolitical barrier has become an internal one, regulating whom we can see, how we can feel, what futures we can imagine.

By describing the border only in terms of walls and trespass, the US news media distracts from the architecture of global inequality that our border sustains. We collude in its function: the separation of Americans from Americans across the Americas, from people across the world—from our shared history and humanity.

To report honestly, journalism must become unbordered.

What does unbordered journalism look like? First, journalists must refuse to treat the “border” as the origin point of immigration stories. Local reporting out of Los Angeles this year about the Trump administration’s racialized immigration enforcement is a case study in unbordered reporting.

Stories like “‘They run, we chase’: Immigration raids test limits of ‘probable cause,’” by Rachel Uranga and Brittny Mejia for the Los Angeles Times, and “Feds Arrest and Injure Two American Citizens During Raid in Ladera Heights, Leaves One Unconscious” by Izzy Ramirez for LA Taco shed light on how the border has become unmoored—snaking between white and brown, between Americans and neighbors, between citizens and their once-protected rights.

Another defining characteristic of unbordered journalism is that it does not let the border dictate who is worthy or unworthy. Xochitl Gonzalez’s article in The Atlantic, about Narciso Barranco, a father of US Marines who was pummeled by a Border Patrol agent, centered the humanity of people whom the border marks as disposable.

Bordered reporting, on the other hand, endows the border with greater authority than is accorded the people it is built to exclude. A 2023 New Yorker magazine article about Biden’s border policy is one such example; it starts and ends at the border, and frames immigrants as “numbers” and “bodies.”

Unbordered reporting, in contrast, does not avoid the complexity of people and their backgrounds. It shows how migration is shaped by global forces including wars, weapons trafficking, corporate extraction, and climate change. One story that made a lasting impression on me was a 2019 report in the New York Times by Nick Casey, a former Wall Street Journal colleague of mine, about the vanishing of Lake Poopó in Bolivia. The piece showed how the lake’s disappearance threatened not only the livelihood but “the very identity” of the region’s oldest Indigenous community, the Uru-Murato. It helped inform Americans about migration without centering migration or borders at all.

To achieve unbordered reporting, news organizations should invest in foreign bureaus with migration beats, and give conscientious reporters time and resources to pursue in-depth immigration projects. Jonathan Blitzer’s 2024 book Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here is a model for this type of reporting, with its sweeping, human-centered look at immigration from Central America and the role of US intervention. Similarly, Roberto Lovato’s 2020 memoir Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas, illuminates the ripple effects of US-backed violence in El Salvador.

Whenever possible, immigration reporting should strive to be not only geographically but also temporally unbordered. That means uncovering histories of slavery, genocide, and eugenics that help the public understand what is happening in the current day.

Caitlin Dickerson’s 2021 piece in The Atlantic “America Never Wanted the Tired, Poor, Huddled Masses” is exemplary, showing how the US immigration system has never been colorblind and was built to exclude non-whites. Another illuminating example is the 2019 New York Times story tracing the impact of Cordelia Scaife May’s fears of foreign breeding on today’s anti-immigrant movement.

And news coverage should be politically unbordered, holding all leaders accountable without deference. It is nonpartisan, yet partial to human rights. Under the Obama presidency, Maria Hinojosa was one of the few reporters who pursued an unwavering examination of his administration’s anti-immigrant cruelty. Her 2011 PBS Frontline documentary “Lost in Detention” exposed how Obama’s record-high deportations targeting “felons, not families” had the effect of separating innocent mothers and fathers from their children. The film also examined problems of sexual assault and other abuses in detention facilities.

Another reporter who repeatedly called attention to the Obama-era assault on immigrants was Roberto Lovato, the author of Unforgetting. But he often faced an uphill battle with editors. “The protection of the Democratic Party by editorial rooms throughout the nation has enabled fascism,” he told me. “The material fact of tens of thousands of children separated from their mothers was not that different under Obama and Trump—but newsrooms weren’t willing to report seriously on the Democrats’ role in building the deportation machine.”

The most powerful stories live in the spaces between categories. Though most papers separate immigration news and labor news into distinct desks, coverage of immigrant rights and workers’ and civil rights is deeply connected. For instance, a recent piece in The Intercept points to how the erosion of immigrant rights is evolving into the dissolution of privacy and due process nationwide.

Just as corporations strip the soil for profit, technology firms are stripping us of privacy and free will, feeding our data into vast systems of monitoring and control.

Unbordered reporting understands that the border is a laboratory for surveillance capitalism, which is constructing a world where human beings are programmable. It understands that the underclass status of some immigrants enables other exploitations; the solution is not criminalization, as conservative media and politicians suggest, but legalization.

When offering policy recommendations, columnists and commentators should highlight pathways to citizenship and other protections that would reduce economic inequality by emancipating the engineered underclass. Right now, conservative media outlets such as Breitbart and the National Review dominate reporting at the intersection of labor and immigrant rights, giving Trump the scaffolding to pit American workers against immigrant workers by framing them as at odds. Unbordered journalism sees through the false dichotomy between those two groups. Honest journalism needs to fill the vacuum in that space.

The unbordered journalist knows that accuracy does not come from detachment. It comes from attention.

Finally, I think that immigration reporting needs to acknowledge the positionality of the writer—feelings, identities, and lived experiences—rather than pretending to report from nowhere. Memo Torres, a reporter for LA Taco, starts his reports with references to the “ICE siege of LA,” positioning his dispatches as a form of resistance.

This type of language may be uncomfortable for a reporter working in a traditional mode at a legacy newspaper. But I would argue that it is truer and more honest than a lot of reporting that performs neutrality. Many centrist and left-of-center news outlets remain committed to outdated notions of impartiality at a time when conservative media is leaning hard into personality and propaganda. Journalists who value accuracy cannot regain the trust of general audiences until and unless we begin to embrace authenticity.

Hinojosa has modeled unbordered reporting for decades. Her Pulitzer Prize–winning podcast Suave, which follows one man’s journey across the boundaries of prison and freedom, approaches the story through the lens of Hinojosa’s friendship with him. The podcast challenges the journalistic tradition of keeping an emotional distance from sources. Hinojosa embraces reporting from the heart—not to sentimentalize, but to restore dignity to lives that are stripped of it by many in politics and the media. Her practice of unbordered reporting is to refuse the artificial walls between fact and feeling, between journalist and subject.

Suave recounts Hinojosa’s decision to send Christmas cards to her source in prison because it felt like the human thing to do. Because of disclosures like this one,

Hinojosa has dealt with accusations of bias her entire career. But the unbordered journalist is authentically herself. She knows that accuracy does not come from detachment. It comes from attention. When we refuse to reduce our humanity, we are more capable of recognizing others’ humanity. We become more curious.

Hinojosa’s advice to journalists is to approach immigrant sources with respect. “Respect, not empathy. Respect,” she told me. “Understand that the people you’re speaking to have the capacity to teach you life lessons that no one else can.”

Unbordered journalism pushes us to ask deeper questions, to listen for what lies beneath dominant narratives, to see the systems that invisibly shape what we call “news.” It does not distort reality; it restores it.

On one of the last days I saw Piedragil before he was murdered, I attended a meeting he led with small-scale coffee farmers deep in the mountains of Guerrero. The farmers spoke of their gratitude for his help in gaining national recognition for their coffee and in earning a decent living. But they were worried. They wanted to know what they should do if they lost Piedragil’s leadership. How could they resist corporations and cartels without him? He reassured them. He told them they had the wind at their backs; they didn’t need him anymore. All they had to do now was remember one thing. “You’ve got to make yourselves alive,” he said.

The heart of aliveness, he said, is connection: building coalitions to protect our common humanity. That is unbordered reporting at its finest: It organizes. It collaborates. It rages against the destruction of life.

If the border is part of a machine that feeds machines, then unbordered reporting is the act of jamming its gears. It is how we resist systems of extraction and begin to write a different future—one that honors the lives and lands that Piedragil died defending, and the human gifts of learning, of getting to know.",https://www.cjr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unbordered-reporting-birds-nb2.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 08:02:35.974689

U.S. Supreme Court considers Louisiana redistricting case

In one of the first major cases of this term to come before the U.S. Supreme Court, justices will hear arguments over Louisiana’s effort to draw new congressional maps in which the state is seeking to dismiss any consideration of race.

The state will not defend its current map, which includes two districts represented by Black Democrats.

That map was drawn two years ago, after the Supreme Court found Louisiana’s prior map likely violated the Voting Rights Act.

But now, a group of white Louisiana voters claims that race was the driving factor in drawing this map, leading the case back to the high court.

Justices first heard the case in March, and several conservative members suggested they could throw out the current map, and potentially make it harder to bring redistricting lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act.

At the time, the justices ultimately ordered the re-argument of the case.

In a brief filed with the court, the state of Louisiana says the Voting Rights Act’s rules regarding race-based maps are “unworkable and unconstitutional.”

“No amount of surgery can eliminate the constitutional defects inherent in a system that, at the end of the day, requires states to sort their citizens by race,” the brief stated.

“Make no mistake: Black Louisianians are entitled to the same fair and representative maps as voters anywhere in this country,” Louisiana Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union Alanah Odoms said. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to that pursuit — until equality is not just promised, but realized.”

If the court overturns Louisiana’s maps, it could have implications in Florida.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that a ruling declaring racial consideration in map drawing unconstitutional could require Florida to redraw its maps.

The governor also defended the practice of making political considerations in drawing maps.

“The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, which is why the court is likely to find racial gerrymandering to be unconstitutional,” DeSantis wrote on a post on X.

The Constitution says nothing about political gerrymandering, which is why the court has found such claims to be non-justiciable.

New lawsuit accuses state agency of illegally withholding public records concerning 'Alligator Alcatraz'

A new lawsuit filed by Friends of the Everglades against the Florida Department of Emergency Management is accusing the state agency of denying the existence of public records requested by the nonprofit, only to later admit they existed all along.

Despite acknowledging their existence, FOTE attorneys say the state has still not produced the records.

According to the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in Circuit Court in Leon County, just five days after FDEM announced plans to open and operate the so-called ""Alligator Alcatraz"" immigrant detention center in the Everglades on June 19, Friends of the Everglades, Inc., requested documents under Florida's open records law concerning communication between the state and federal officials about the site.

At the time, the lawsuit claims the state agency initially denied the existence of any communication records, before later making ""an incomplete production.""

On Sept. 11, the nonprofit's attorneys sent a follow-up on its request, ""to make clear that Plaintiff's request specifically sought '[a]ll documents pertaining to or constituting any application for funds or grants to FEMA, DHS or other federal agency from FDEM or another state agency for financial assistance in connection with building any immigration detention center in Florida including without limitation to the ('Alligator Alcatraz') detention center.""

The lawsuit does not accuse the state agency of denying the existence of the communication records following the Sept. 11 request, but rather, claims the Florida Department of Emergency Management simply did not respond to it at all.

On Aug. 21, a federal judge ruled that the ""Alligator Alcatraz"" detention site could not expand or take in additional detainees, and gave the state 60 days to begin removal of fencing, lighting fixtures and ""all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support this project.""

An appeals court later blocked the lower court's order, noting several times in its ruling that the state had not applied for, or received federal funding for the project — which would have required the site to ""comply with a host of regulatory prerequisites in support of that application"" that would not otherwise be necessary.

The lawsuit specifically points to a line in the appellate court's ruling that said: ""Without an application, there is simply nothing on which a decision can be made.""

Unbeknownst to the court or the plaintiffs in the case, though, was the fact that Florida had in fact applied for a federal grant almost a month before the appeals court made its ruling. The Friends of the Everglades lawsuit cites a single-page email disclosed by FDEM on Oct. 10 that showed a FEMA grant application — titled ""Fiscal Year 2025 Detention Support Grant Program"" — had been filed by the state at 7:05 p.m. on Aug. 7.

""More than a month later, FDEM has not corrected the Eleventh Circuit Court's misimpressions,"" the lawsuit filed Tuesday said. ""What the federal District and Circuit Courts (and Plaintiff) were unaware of, because FDEM did not disclose the fact or produce the documents, is that FDEM had already applied for federal funding on August 7, 2025.""

The Florida Department of Emergency Management's release of the funding email comes a little more than a week after Florida announced that FEMA had awarded the state $608 million to cover costs associated with ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

The Friends of the Everglades lawsuit claims that the Florida Department of Emergency Management ""has not asserted that any documents requested by Plaintiff are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act.""

The nonprofit's lawsuit is asking the court to force the state to release all requested records within 48 hours, to find that the department violated the law by not releasing the requested documents, and award it attorney fees and any other appropriate relief.

Los Angeles County leaders declared a local state of emergency in the region Tuesday, according to local officials.

News of the proclamation was shared in a news release online by LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath's office.

The measure was said to be a response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across LA County, which is home to more than 10 million people and one of the U.S.'s largest immigrant populations.

The county can now offer to support residents financially who have been impacted by the raids, including rent relief and accessing state funds for any legal aid.

""Declaring a Local Emergency ensures that the full weight of County government is aligned to support our immigrant communities who are being targeted by federal actions,"" she added.

The proclamation notice, dated Oct. 9, said that it will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Supervisors.

County departments were ordered to ""take necessary emergency actions to protect and stabilize communities impacted by federal immigration actions,"" it read.

County supervisors voted 4-1 in favor of the emergency proclamation to mobilize county resources and support affected communities despite potential legal challenges from the federal government.

County officials claimed the raids have ""created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy,"" including decreased workplace attendance, temporary or permanent business closures, and increased strain on schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Supervisor Janice Hahn said the emergency declaration was needed to respond to ""the fear, the pain and the disorder these ICE raids are causing our community.""

Supervisor Holly Mitchell also added that the raids have emboldened others to commit acts of race-based violence and hate.

The one vote against the proclamation came from Board Chair Kathryn Barger, who warned that the county’s action could provoke legal consequences.

""The federal government has sole authority to enforce federal immigration law, and local governments cannot impede that authority,"" Barger said. ""We should instead advocate for meaningful immigration reform that is fair, pragmatic, and creates legal pathways for those who contribute to our communities.""

Robert Jenrick MP has spearheaded a campaign to reveal what he describes as ‘activist’ judges and named two who he said should not sit on immigration cases. One of those was Mark Symes, who sits part-time on the upper tribunal and is a barrister with 25 years of experience who practices at Garden Court.

Jenrick also compiled a list of 35 judges whom he singled out for criticism because of their public comments and alleged conflict of interests. The list included Greg Ó Ceallaigh KC, who presides over deportation asylum appeals and is a Garden Court silk.

The chambers posted a statement this week in response to ‘press and social media commentary focused on members of Garden Court Chambers and others who sit as part-time judges’. It said: ‘Like many others across the legal profession who sit in part-time judicial roles, those barristers continue their other legal work and practices.

‘The availability of high-quality specialist lawyers is of great importance to the effective management of the immigration appellate system which, as has been widely reported, has suffered significant backlogs.’

The statement added that many members of the court have engaged in charitable and public interest work, including in areas such as human rights, but said ‘this outside experience informs rather than diminishes their standing’.

At the Conservative Party conference Jenrick said a future Conservative government would restore the responsibility for appointing judges to ministers by scrapping the Judicial Appointments Commission, which selects judges in England and Wales.

Garden Court said this move would ‘represent a significant departure from the principles of judicial independence’.

CHICAGO — Facebook removed one of the city’s most active pages for reporting ICE sightings on Tuesday after being asked to do so by the Department of Justice.

The page, “ICE Sighting-Chicagoland” had more than 80,000 members and was increasingly active as street arrests by federal agents accelerated in the past month under “Operation Midway Blitz.” Members shared photos, videos or reports of ICE sightings across city neighborhoods and nearby suburbs, occasionally including the license plates of federal agents’ unmarked vehicles.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media that the page was being used to “dox and target” ICE agents. The page was taken down two days after right wing activist Laura Loomer — a fierce ally of President Donald Trump who often aires out perceived enemies of the president online — posted about it and claimed “ICE tracking accounts are getting people killed.”

Trump officials have frequently claimed federal agents in Chicago are under attack, despite widespread reports that the masked agents have made ambush-style arrests and quelled mostly peaceful protesters with force. Two people have been shot, one fatally, by federal agents since the operation began.

“The wave of violence against ICE has been driven by online apps and social media campaigns designed to put ICE officers at risk just for doing their jobs,” Bondi wrote. “The Department of Justice will continue engaging tech companies to eliminate platforms where radicals can incite imminent violence against federal law enforcement.”

Francis Brennan, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a short statement that the page was taken down for “violating our policies against coordinated harm.” Brennan is a former 2020 Trump campaign advisor hired by Meta after Trump’s election to a second term.

Kae Rosado, the administrator of the now-defunct page who runs a small imported jewelry business, has already started a new one: “ICE Sightings-Chicagoland 2.”

“I started it simply to warn others because I seen some ICE agents were using excessive force & they didn’t seem to be following any safety protocols our local police typically do. It blew up into so much more,” Rosado wrote on her personal Facebook page. “Now its not only a representation of Chicago’s United community but an entire example of the Trump administration’s clear attempts at violating the U.S Constitution and Eliminating Freedom of Speech for anyone who doesn’t agree with him.”

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has aligned more closely with Trump since the president’s return to power. The company settled a $25 million lawsuit over the suspensions of Trump’s accounts following the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. Meta also sent $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, canceled its diversity programs, got rid of fact-checkers and appointed Dana White, a close Trump ally and leader of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to its board of directors.

Loomer had accused Zuckerberg of a “leftist subversion of Trump and his policies” in her post about the sightings page.

“You’d think other Big Tech executives would use this as an opportunity to be in compliance and to support President Trump’s immigration policies, but they aren’t,” Loomer wrote.

The move to shutter the Facebook page comes as the Trump administration continues to exert influence on tech companies and pressure Chicagoans and journalists documenting its aggressive immigration enforcement operations in the city.

Outside ICE’s Broadview processing facility, federal agents detained an independent journalist and allegedly fired a pepper ball into a TV news truck. A lengthy ban on drone flights over the city was seen by the ACLU as “suspiciously like an attempt” to “prevent reporters and citizens from recording the activities of authorities.”

Block Club Chicago is a plaintiff in a lawsuit that has led a judge to limit ICE’s ability to fire chemical agents at peaceful protesters and journalists.

Before a decision last week temporarily blocking a deployment of the National Guard, U.S. District Judge April Perry expressed doubt over the “credibility and assessment” of federal authorities in Chicago.

Francia Garcia Hernandez contributed to this report.

Happening In Chicago

A large presence of federal agents were seen in East Chicago Tuesday morning, leading to arrests and clashes with protesters. Agents were seen on video chasing people inside a Walgreens.

A federal vehicle crashed at 105th Street and Avenue N in East Chicago, leading to “at least 45 military officers” flooding the street, arresting three people and using tear gas on a gathering crowd, according to Southeast Side Rapid Response.

Two arrests were also made at 91st Street and Commercial Avenue and three arrests at 106th Street and Ewing Avenue, according to Southeast Side Rapid Response.

Alexa Van Brunt, a Chicago-based attorney with the Illinois MacArthur Justice Center, discussed the possibility with NBC Chicago.

""When any party, any litigant, ignores a court order, you are facing potential contempt proceedings,"" Van Brunt explained. ""Judges have a lot of discretion to take certain actions.""

Van Brunt also directs the Civil Rights Litigation Clinic at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.

""What we really need to be concerned about is that they are held accountable for ignoring the law,"" she said.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Sec. Tricia McLaughlin defended the erected fences in a previous statement to NBC Chicago.

""DHS is extending fencing surrounding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview Processing Center after rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,” she said.

Outside the ICE facility, more protests took place on Tuesday afternoon.

Less than a mile away, outside village hall, a one-man press conference was held by the Revolutionary Black Panther Party, demanding the mayor and village cease and desist limiting peaceful protest hours to the hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the ICE facility.

""This restriction has been unlawful, and state police have been aggressors,"" said Dr. Alli Muhammad with the Revolutionary Black Panther Party.

They also asked that the concrete barriers be removed because they obstruct public visibility and access to the facility and surrounding sidewalks.

""The facility is open 24 hours… so we have a right to assemble in peace 24 hours,"" Muhammad said.

The Illinois State Police Unified Command issued a news release on Tuesday, announcing additional safety measures to ensure public safety that it said ""ensures the safe expression of First Amendment rights.""

Among those are the closures of sidewalks along the east and west sides of 25th Avenue between Filmore and Lexington streets. Police will also maintain the designated protest and media areas.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/broadview-fence.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-15 04:57:34.742214

Podcaster Joe Rogan and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have publicly condemned the administration over its immigration crackdown.
According to Nicolle Wallace, that criticism is evidence that Trump’s grip over his base may be slipping.
The sights and sounds are proving to be too much for arguably the most influential podcaster in the MAGA-adjacent universe,” she added.
“We have a labor force in America, across many industries, that has been built on illegal labor,” Greene said.","Some of MAGA’s loudest voices are starting to turn on Donald Trump over his mass deportation efforts. Podcaster Joe Rogan and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have publicly condemned the administration over its immigration crackdown.

According to Nicolle Wallace, that criticism is evidence that Trump’s grip over his base may be slipping. “If Donald Trump’s political power lies in being able to convince his supporters of anything and everything, then loud public dissent from inside his coalition from prominent MAGA influencers might be the thing that will melt his carefully crafted alternative, fact-based reality faster than the Wicked Witch in ‘The Wizard of Oz,’” Wallace said on Monday’s “Deadline: White House.”

In recent weeks, social media has been flooded with images and videos of what Wallace described as the administration’s “brutal and ugly and clunky and wildly unpopular mass deportation scheme.”

“The sight and the sound and the smells of heavily armed federal agents sweeping up people with no criminal records — everyone from grandmas to kids — with arrests everywhere, from outside of schools to outside of bakeries, even to a Marine base. The sights and sounds are proving to be too much for arguably the most influential podcaster in the MAGA-adjacent universe,” she added.

Wallace then played a clip from Thursday’s “Joe Rogan Experience,” where the popular podcaster called Trump’s deportations “horrific.” He went on to say, “When you’re just arresting people in front of their kids and just normal, regular people that have been here for 20 years — everybody who has a heart can’t get along with that.”

While the “Deadline: White House” host acknowledged that Rogan has spoken out against Trump and his immigration policies in the past, she said it was important to note that he was “not alone.”

During an appearance on “The Tim Dillon Show,” Greene, who is usually among the president’s fiercest defenders in Congress, said she’s seen the damage of Trump’s immigration crackdown firsthand. “We have a labor force in America, across many industries, that has been built on illegal labor,” Greene said. “That’s a fact that also cannot be ignored, and as a conservative and as a business owner in the construction industry and as a realist, I can say we have to do something about labor, and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that, right?”

Greene stated she knew she would get “pushback” for her comments, but said she was just “living in reality from here on out.”

Wallace said that while there was “plenty to not like about Marjorie Taylor Greene and Joe Rogan,” those who oppose Trump’s crackdown should welcome their newfound criticism, noting that “if we could have done this on our own, we wouldn’t be here.”

“The reality of Trump’s mass deportation campaign and how it is impacting everyone of us, everyone is going to be touched by it, regardless of who you vote for — it’s starting to sink in,” Wallace said.

“The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S,” the department added.

According to the department’s thread, an Argentinian national, a South African national, a Mexican national, a Brazilian national, a German national and a Paraguayan national all had their visas revoked over comments about Kirk’s assassination.

In a post on X, the State Department said the Argentine national said in an online post that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell. In a separate post, the department claimed the South African national had “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk” by saying in a post online that “they’re hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom” and alleging “he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash.”

“@POTUS and @SecRubio will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws,” the State Department said in their X thread. “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”

Following Kirk’s death, debates have arisen regarding his legacy, rhetoric, and the limits of free speech. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel had his show briefly suspended by ABC over comments he made about Kirk’s assassination, drawing heavy backlash from Democrats.

On Tuesday, President Trump awarded the U.S.’s highest civilian honor posthumously to Kirk, calling him a “martyr for truth and for freedom.”

If the orders are extended, that would continue to keep Guard troops out of Portland until the Oct. 29 trial and a final judgment from Immergut.
More than that, they’ll decide whether the president has the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard.
It’s a longer strategy should higher courts rule that Trump can control and deploy the Oregon National Guard.
“The Supreme Court hasn’t talked about National Guard federalization in almost two centuries,” Williams said.","It’s been two and a half weeks since President Donald Trump posted on social media that he would send the military to Portland, setting off a legal battle that is now in the hands of four judges in two different courts.

The ongoing legal fight has implications for cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, where Trump has, or has attempted, to deploy National Guard troops to federal buildings. Trump has argued that protesters are impeding federal immigration officials from carrying out their orders, though the generally small and peaceful protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland don’t support his argument.

The state of Oregon and the city of Portland contend Trump violated several laws and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to deploy Guard troops to Portland over the objections of state and local elected leaders. Each of these issues deals with the balance of state and federal power — particularly related to authority over policing within states — and the extent of presidential power over the U.S. military.

“It’s not just Portland. If the ruling is in favor of the Trump administration on this matter, then it means that the president can pretty much deploy the National Guard to any city where the president says they (the federal government) are unable to enforce federal law,” said Tung Yin, a law professor at Portland’s Lewis & Clark College.

In the meantime, a district judge in Portland and three appellate judges in San Francisco are considering stop-gap decisions that would block Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from deploying Guard troops to Portland while everyone awaits an Oct. 29 trial.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, could decide as early as Wednesday whether to extend for two more weeks temporary restraining orders she first issued on Oct. 4 and Oct. 5, that barred Trump from federalizing and deploying any National Guard troops to Portland.

If the orders are extended, that would continue to keep Guard troops out of Portland until the Oct. 29 trial and a final judgment from Immergut.

But another decision expected this week from three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco could end up nullifying Immergut’s orders altogether, opening the door for Guard deployment to Portland, said Willamette University professor Norman Williams, a constitutional law expert.

U.S. Appellate Judges Susan Graber, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade — the first a former Oregon Supreme Court Justice and Clinton appointee, and the latter two appointed by Trump — are expected this week to rule whether Immergut’s first order, which barred Trump from federalizing the Oregon National Guard, can stand.

More than that, they’ll decide whether the president has the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Two of the three judges signaled in a hearing Thursday that they were deferential to giving the president the power to federalize those troops.

If the judges rule that Trump can federalize and control the Oregon Guard, it would be difficult for Immergut to restrain when and where they are deployed, Williams explained. It’s more likely that the federal government would, following the 9th Circuit ruling, ask Immergut to stay — or stop — legal proceedings.

“There’s no statutory basis that would allow her to say, ‘They’ve been properly federalized, but I’m going to order them to barracks. They can’t be deployed outside the barracks.’ I don’t think that’s a possibility,” Williams said.

This, he added, is why Oregon has also argued that Trump is violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from undertaking domestic law enforcement. It’s a longer strategy should higher courts rule that Trump can control and deploy the Oregon National Guard.

“So the federalization is just the first step, but the state would still have arguments about: ‘Have they been used in an appropriate fashion?’ And that would depend on what he (Trump) actually does with them,” Williams said.

Both Yin and Williams said that if the Ninth Circuit hands the power to federalize the Oregon National Guard to Trump, it’s likely attorneys for Oregon will request a fuller review, called an en banc court, by 11 appellate judges across the Ninth Circuit, which spans Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington.

Those judges would decide if the three appellate judges in California ruled erroneously.

Until then, however, Trump could likely deploy the federalized Guard troops.

If the appellate judges rule that Immergut’s orders and justification for them are valid, then the current state of affairs will remain unless the federal government asks for an emergency hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Supreme Court hasn’t talked about National Guard federalization in almost two centuries,” Williams said. “This just doesn’t come up in part because presidents don’t do it in politically contentious ways that are going to spur likely litigation over it.”

Immergut on Wednesday will also decide whether to grant the federal government a new request that, if the state’s case against them moves forward in Oregon, it be delayed by a month until “at least” Nov. 20, rather than Oct. 29.

On Monday, Michael Gerardi, a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department, wrote in a joint-status report that federal lawyers need more time to collect, review, redact and produce documents that Oregon’s lawyers have requested.

In that report, Gerardi also argued that because the president is granted great deference in his powers, that lawyers for Oregon should not be entitled to communications they’ve sought from the White House that would reveal more clearly what Trump and other leaders were discussing regarding Portland before Trump made his social media post.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC094901-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:57:43.227338

“Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work.

WGN confirmed shortly after Brockman was detained that she works in the station’s creative services department, separate from the news department.

“During the morning hours this past Friday, Ms. Brockman was walking to the bus stop as part of her morning commute when she was attacked by Border Patrol agents,” according to the statement.

The environmental groups disagreed with the request.
Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued this summer, accusing the federal and state governments of failing to adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires a federal environmental impact assessment for large federal projects.
A lower district judge agreed with the environmental groups and ordered the site effectively shut down within 60 days.
The appellate court expedited the case, and the state’s opening brief was due to be filed on Oct. 24, with oral arguments scheduled for January.","Lawyers for the federal government say the government shutdown prevents them from working and are requesting that an appellate court pause a lawsuit over the controversial detention center in the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz.

In a filing on Friday, Department of Justice lawyers asked the Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to pause proceedings in the appeal filed by the DeSantis administration to overturn a lower-court decision siding with environmental groups who said the government had circumvented federal environmental regulations when building the makeshift facility.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,” the federal government lawyers stated.

The environmental groups disagreed with the request. They argued that if the appeals case is paused, the site’s operations and construction – which were allowed to continue after the appellate court overturned the lower court’s injunction – could cause more harm to the surrounding Everglades wetlands during the shutdown, the length of which is unknown.

“The balance of harms favors denying an indefinite stay in this case, which would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm,” the lawyers for the environmental group said. Any further construction and operation of the facility “imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area,” they added.

The federal government shutdown has now added another obstacle to one of the multiple lawsuits challenging the legality of the tent detention facility built on the airstrip of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued this summer, accusing the federal and state governments of failing to adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires a federal environmental impact assessment for large federal projects. A lower district judge agreed with the environmental groups and ordered the site effectively shut down within 60 days.

The state and federal governments argued that NEPA does not apply to the state, and the appellate court agreed with them, suspending the lower court’s decision pending arguments on the merits of the appeal and wresting the case from District Judge Kathleen Williams until the appeal is resolved.

The appellate court expedited the case, and the state’s opening brief was due to be filed on Oct. 24, with oral arguments scheduled for January.

The federal government lawyers told the court in their Friday filing that they would resume “as soon as Congress has appropriated funds for the Department.”

Lawyers for the environmental groups said, “It is indeed regrettable that the lapse in appropriations has disrupted the Department of Justice,” but maintained that there was an urgency to address the “irreversible harms” to the environment, given the ongoing construction at the facility.

On Tuesday, the environmental groups filed a related lawsuit against the Florida Division of Emergency Management for failing to disclose records regarding its agreements with the federal government to receive reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for expenses related to Alligator Alcatraz.

On Sept. 30, FEMA approved the DeSantis administration’s $608 million grant request to cover the cost of operations at Alligator Alcatraz and other immigration detention facilities, including Deportation Depot.

The transfer of funds between the federal government and the state was a key point in the appeal judges’ decision to support the government’s claim that NEPA does not apply to states.

“When the Court of Appeals issued its order pausing the trial court’s order halting operations at the detention center, the Court of Appeals said more than once that the Florida Department of Emergency Management had not applied for federal funding,” Paul Schwiep of Coffey Burlington, the lawyer for the environmental groups, said in a statement.

What they're saying: Jordy Johnson, one of the organizers, told KOIN that if Trump wants to invoke the Insurrection Act ""he's going to have to point at people in inflatable chickens and inflatable frogs and inflatable unicorns.""

Jack Dickinson, 26, has deployed a similar tactic — and has been a regular fixture of the protest scenes — by wearing a chicken suit and American flag cape.

""What they rely on is fear,"" he told Willamette Week. ""So by coming out in an absurdist manner, it speaks to them, to some extent, that we're actually not that afraid.""

Meanwhile, even local lawmakers are capitalizing on the stunt.

In a video ahead of this week's ""emergency"" naked bike ride, members of the Metro Council put out a video statement urging protestors to be respectful while seemingly in the buff themselves.

Attorney General Nick Brown is proposing legislation, dubbed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, that would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Other states, including California, Oregon and Illinois, already have similar laws.

The attorney general’s office notes workplace raids are increasing under President Donald Trump. But first, federal immigration agents usually tell employers they want to audit I-9 documents.

“While the employer is given 72 hours to gather and produce their employees’ I-9 forms, employees often have no idea that their I-9 documents are being sent for review,” spokesperson Mike Faulk said. “This bill would give workers the opportunity to get their documentation in order, speak to an attorney, or make plans with their family if needed.”

Employers fill out I-9 forms for all of their employees. On the forms, workers attest to their legal status or authorization to work in the United States, and must provide documentation to that effect.

Businesses can use the federal E-Verify system to compare an employee’s I-9 to government data to determine their eligibility to work. Many states require at least some employers to use E-Verify, but Washington isn’t one of them.

The proposed law would protect against raids like one earlier this year at a Bellingham roofing company.

Immigration officials had reportedly asked Mt. Baker Roofing for I-9 documentation for its workers. Investigators said they found 56 employees had given false information. They used this information to get a judge to sign off on a warrant to search the company’s warehouse. In an early morning raid in April, federal agents arrested 37 people.

In May, agents arrested 17 workers at Eagle Beverage and Accessories Products in Kent, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. Authorities attributed the arrests to employees presenting fraudulent work documents attesting to their immigration status.

The Biden administration had paused such large-scale workplace raids, and instead focused on holding employers accountable for hiring unauthorized workers. The Trump administration restarted the practice this year.

One of the Trump era’s largest workplace immigration operations came last month, when agents arrested nearly 500 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, at a car plant in Georgia.

The executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network called Brown’s proposal “an important means of transparency for workers.”

“Immigrant communities who are essential to the economic and cultural vitality of our state are facing enormous threats because of the federal government’s ongoing mass detention and deportation agenda, while also struggling to meet basic needs,” Catalina Velasquez said in a statement.

On the other hand, state Rep. Jim Walsh, the chair of the Washington Republican Party, called it a “clear effort to undermine enforcement of federal immigration law.”

“It’s not clever. It’s not smart,” Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said in a text message Tuesday. “It’s decadent. And it puts the interests of illegal aliens ahead of the rights of American citizens.”

The attorney general’s office and state Department of Labor and Industries would enforce the policy.

Brown outlined his proposal in a Labor Day report last month on his office’s efforts to protect workers, and in a request for funding to Gov. Bob Ferguson. Lawmakers next year will approve a supplemental budget building on the two-year spending plan they passed this year.

Brown wants about $400,000 to carry out the law if it is passed. Some of that money would go to community organizations like the solidarity network for outreach and education work.

US revokes visas from six foreign nationals for social media comments critical of Charlie Kirk

In a stunning departure for an administration that came to power vowing to stop social-media censorship, Donald Trump’s state department announced on Tuesday that it had revoked the visas of six foreign nationals who posted critical comments on social media about Charlie Kirk, in the wake of the conservative activist’s murder.

“The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the US state department said in a statement posted on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.”

The state department then listed six “examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” in a thread on the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, the Trump donor who called himself “a free speech absolutist” before buying the site formerly known as Twitter.

The thread included screenshots and quotes from people identified as foreign nationals of Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.

None of the individuals was identified by name, but the screenshots made it possible to trace the identities of two people, including one who had been singled out for abuse by conservatives on X.

“Charlie Kirk won’t be remembered as a hero,” one of the comments posted on X read. “He was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash!”

The thread ended with a statement from the state department that Trump and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws. Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”

Last month, a deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged social media users to send him posts critical of Kirk, saying he was “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

The administration has previously ramped up efforts to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreign students it accuses of participating in unrest in the form of protests against Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The administration has also required foreign visitors to make their social media accounts public so that they can be checked before they are allowed to enter the land of the free.

In recent months, the administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the US for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York and cancelled visas of the visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan.

The government has also said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million holders of visas to enter the US for potential violations of its standards.

Those actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as blatant violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the US, not just citizens.

Leaders of Young Republican groups in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont used racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic slurs in private Telegram group chat messages over a period of seven months obtained by Politico, the news outlet reports.

The young Republicans referred to Black people as monkeys and “the watermelon people” and joked about raping their enemies, driving them to suicide or putting them in gas chambers.

One of the Young Republican leaders, Peter Giunta, recently presented an award to Elise Stefanik, the pro-Trump congresswoman expected to run for governor, as chair of the New York State Young Republicans.

Giunta also praised teen activists who “support slavery” as “based.”

Congress remained deadlocked on legislation to reopen the federal government, as the US Senate on Tuesday again rejected a Republican plan to end the government shutdown that began two weeks ago.

The eighth Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would fund government operations through 21 November failed on a 49-45 tally – far short of the 60 needed for advancement in the chamber. In a sign that that there has been little if any progress toward ending the stalemate, no senators changed their votes from the last time the measure was brought to the floor, though there were a handful of absences.

Earlier on Tuesday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson said he won’t negotiate with Senate Democrats as the government shutdown dragged into its 14th day, while defending the Trump administration’s decision to shuffle Pentagon funds to make sure military personnel get their paychecks.

Trump previously called presidential medal 'much better' than top military award

The White House ceremony in honor of Charlie Kirk has now concluded.

At a campaign event last year, Donald Trump said that the Presidential Medal of Freedom for civilians, which he bestowed on Kirk on Tuesday, was “much better” than the top military award for those killed or wounded in action: the Medal of Honor.

Trump was widely criticized for that comment, made as he addressed Miriam Adelson, the widow of the Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. Trump had awarded Miriam Adelson the Medal of Freedom in 2018.

The civilian medal, Trump told supporters then, is “actually much better because everyone [who] gets the congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers.”

“They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets or they’re dead. She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal.”

Charlie Kirk is not the first to receive the medal from Trump posthumously. During his first term, he gave it to Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley and Antonin Scalia.

In 2020, Trump also presented the medal to the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh during a State of the Union address.

In his speech at the memorial for Kirk in Arizona last month, Trump revealed that Limbaugh was one of Kirk’s role models. “He was an Eagle scout who spent his school lunch breaks listening to another champion for liberty, somebody that he greatly admired, Rush Limbaugh,” Trump said.

In remarks at the White House, Charlie Kirk’s widow praised her late husband in explicitly Christian terms and said that he would likely have run for president one day had he not been killed before his 32nd birthday.

In paying tribute to Kirk, Trump railed against “radical left extremism, violence and terror.”

He asserted: “They have the devil’s ideology… They seem to become very violent on the left.”

Trump claimed these attacks included the attempt on his own life at a campaign rally last year, even though the would-be assassin had no apparent political motive.

The president went on tout his law and order crackdown on US cities. “We’ve done a great job.”

He said of Washington: “We’re done with the angry mobs.” He claimed the city is now safe.

But then police car sirens wailed near the White House. Trump, however, insisted: “That’s a beautiful sound. They’re stopping crime. That’s what they’re doing.”

Sirens interrupt Trump's boasts about ending crime in Washington DC

As Donald Trump boasted about the impact of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia, blaring sirens could be heard in the distance, undermining his claim that there is no longer any crime in the capital city.

Trump then claimed, falsely, that sirens were previously not heard in Washington DC because the city’s police force did not respond to crime.

“You hear those sirens going off? That’s good, that’s a good sound,” the president said. “That means they either got the bad guy, or are gonna stop the bad guy. You didn’t hear that sound, because nobody wanted to do anything.”

Trump boasts about 2024 election victory while praising Kirk

In the course of praising Charlie Kirk for his efforts to turn out conservative voters, Donald Trump boasted at length about his victory in the 2024 presidential election, repeating his familiar exaggerated claims that his popular vote victory “was massive”.

From my vantage point at the back, I saw Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity greet each other warmly. Laura Ingraham, Bill O’Reilly, Sean Spicer and Jesse Watters are also present.

Reflecting on Kirk’s death, Trump said: “It’s a horrible, heinous, demonic act of murder.”

The president, who just returned from the Middle East, noted the inconvenient timing of today’s event but insisted: “I would not have missed this moment for anything in the world.”

Guests are sitting or standing in warm sunshine and a gentle breeze as Trump speaks from a lectern with four US flags behind him.

Recent additions to the rose garden and surrounding area include a statue of George Washington, bust of Abraham Lincoln and gold framed portraits of every president except Joe Biden, replaced by an auto pen.

Trump referred to the government shutdown and commented: “We’re dealing with some radical left lunatics.”

He suggested that Kirk would have responded by organising a young people’s march on the US Capitol.

Trump said: “Charles James Kirk was a visionary and one of the greatest leaders of his generation.”

The president seemed to be telling Kirk’s life story but veered off into talking about his past election campaigns. “Too big to rig.”

Trump praises Charlie Kirk at Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony

Donald Trump just began his remarks by praising his own renovation of what he called “the new and improved Rose Garden, and people are loving it”. He also drew attention to the new “presidential walk of fame”, which is a gallery of portraits of 44 of the 45 men to have served as president, with an image of an automatic pen in place of Joe Biden.

Trump said that they were gathered to honor “the late, great Charlie Kirk”, the founder of the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA he is awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor.

The president took issue with the characterization of Kirk at his memorial in Arizona as someone who loved his enemies. “He didn’t necessarily love those enemies”, Trump said.

Trump also suggested that he would have asked to push back the ceremony so that he could stay longer in the Middle East with the wealthy leaders of Gulf nations, but “October 14 is Charlie’s birthday, and he should have been turning 32 years old”.

The president went on to give a largely familiar political speech, attacking Democrats as “radical left lunatics” and making jokes about the ABC host George Stephanopoulos, whose name he intentionally mispronounced.

Trump also suggested that the current government shutdown would have been ended by Kirk, had he not been killed last month in Utah, who would have led “a march on the Capitol.”

Here's a recap of the day so far

Donald Trump said that a list of ‘Democrat programs’ that White House plans to cut will be released on Friday. He noted that he plans to cut “egregious, semi-communist” programs that, he claims, Democrats hold dear, but doesn’t plan to touch Republican programs, “because we think they work”. While hosting Javier Milei, president of Argentina, Trump took questions from reporters, in what became a far-ranging, impromptu press conference.

Trump warned that Hamas must disarm ‘or we will disarm them’. Trump added that could happen “quickly and perhaps violently”. When he was asked about a timeline for disarmament, the president said that it would be “a reasonable period of time … pretty quickly”. So far, Trump has been taking a victory lap, complete with bipartisan praise, for brokering the hostage-prisoner exchange on Monday, and the ceasefire deal in Gaza.

Earlier, Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has struck another small boat that he accuses of carrying drugs in waters off the coast of Venezuala, killing six people aboard. “The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “No U.S. Forces were harmed.”

Back in Washington, the government shutdown enters its 14th day, with no end in sight. House Republicans continued to criticize the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who they accuse of holding out on the House-passed funding bill to appease the left-wing base of his party. “We’re certainly not going to allow the American people to be taken hostage for his political gain,” House speaker Mike Johnson said today. Meanwhile Democrats, claim their colleagues across the aisle have abandoned good faith negotiations. House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries said that Republicans have gone “radio silent” since congressional leadership met with Trump at the White House days before the shutdown began. The Senate will hold its eighth vote, in the hopes of passing a funding bill to reopen the government. Spoiler alert: it’s unlikely to happen.

The supreme court declined to hear Alex Jones’s challenge to a $1.4bn judgment awarded to families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012. Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, made several false statements that the shooting – which killed 20 children – was a hoax.

On the campaign trail, Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, has officially announced that she’s running for US Senate, challenging the incumbent, Republican Susan Collins. Mills, 77, will face a primary challenge from Graham Platner, the progressive oyster farmer entering politics for the first time and backed by Independent senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.

Trump threatens to take world cup hosting away from Boston

Donald Trump floated taking away Boston’s ability to host several 2026 World Cup matches, calling out mayor Michelle Wu. “She’s intelligent, but she’s radical left,” Trump said, while offering to send federal law enforcement to the city. “All she has to do is call us. We’ll go in and take them back. But she’s afraid to, because she thinks it’s bad politically.”

Trump added that if he feels that the city is “unsafe” he will “call up Gianni” and tell him to move the games to another location. Gianni Infantino, the head of Fifa, has emerged as an ally of the president as the games inch closer.

“Boston better clean up their act, that’s all I can say,” Trump said.

The three-judge panel heard arguments brought by a coalition of 12 immigrant rights groups, which served as government subcontractors for several “legal orientation” programs previously paid for and administered by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review.
The coalition specifically challenges the apparent termination of the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk and the Legal Orientation Program for Custodians, which provide legal services to detained immigrants, non-detained immigrants and the custodians of unaccompanied minors, respectively.
The 1887 statute gives the U.S. Court of Federal Claims purview over most contractual claims.
“What we are looking for is the executive agency to meet its obligation under the appropriation statute to spend $28 million in the furtherance of services and activities of the legal orientation program.” U.S.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel on Tuesday appeared doubtful that the Trump administration’s sudden cancellation of a federal contracting program providing legal advice and services to immigrants was legal if the government fails to begin providing the same services itself.

The three-judge panel heard arguments brought by a coalition of 12 immigrant rights groups, which served as government subcontractors for several “legal orientation” programs previously paid for and administered by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review.

When President Donald Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, he issued an executive order titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” which directed the Justice Department to pause distribution of all government contract funds to nongovernmental organizations “supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens” pending review.

On Jan. 22, the Justice Department issued a stop-work order to Acacia Center for Justice, the main contractor the plaintiffs subcontract with.

The same day, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also told its employees that the Executive Office of Immigration Review was pausing all legal orientation services and instructed any informational posters about the program to be taken down in ICE housing units and its law library.

Led by the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, the coalition filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Jan. 31, arguing that the government’s decision flouted Congress’ decision to allocate $28 million to the program in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The coalition specifically challenges the apparent termination of the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk and the Legal Orientation Program for Custodians, which provide legal services to detained immigrants, non-detained immigrants and the custodians of unaccompanied minors, respectively.

Laura Sturges, attorney of Gibson Dunn and representing the providers, argued U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrongfully granted the government summary judgment after finding he did not have jurisdiction over the providers’ claims due to the Tucker Act.

The 1887 statute gives the U.S. Court of Federal Claims purview over most contractual claims.

Sturges said the Barack Obama appointee was wrong to accept declarations from acting director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review Sirce Owens that alluded to an “ill-defined” federalized version of the program that would no longer require third-party providers. She urged the panel to remand the case to allow Moss to rule on a more extensive record.

Sturges maintained that the providers were challenging the work stoppage itself rather than trying to restore their specific contracts, and thus, the only adequate relief they could obtain was an injunction lifting the stop-work order. The distinction would untie the Tucker Act from the case.

“The purpose of the services and activities of the legal orientation program are certainly to make the immigration courts more efficient and to provide the modicum of due process, the very bare minimum of due process for detained non-citizens going through the immigration system,” Sturges said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, noted Tuesday’s case was the latest “shutdown case,” a term for the challenges against the Trump administration’s effort to reshape the federal government by gutting independent agencies and related federal programs.

Katas said there were two categories of shutdown cases: cases like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where the watchdog’s effective shutdown would injure consumers of the agency’s services; and cases like the Voice of America, where the media outlet amounted to a specifically named contractor receiving earmarked funds from Congress.

He asked Sturges how her case fit into that framework, to which she responded that the providers were around decades before the program itself existed, and their missions were now being thwarted by the government’s actions.

Justice Department attorney Sean Janda urged the panel to affirm Moss’ summary judgment ruling, arguing that on either challenged action — the termination of the Acacia contract and the federalization of the program — the providers fail because their claims can only be heard by the Court of Federal Claims.

Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked whether the Federal Claims court would have sole jurisdiction in a case where the Justice Department completely stopped providing services, where the elimination of contracts is just part of that wider effort.

Janda suggested beneficiaries of the services could challenge the wider termination of the program but maintained that the providers’ only remedy here is related to their contracts and thus are limited to Federal Claims review.

“We’re not looking for damages — giving us money now does not solve our problem, which has been that every day, we are unable to provide the services that our organizations have been designed to provide,” Sturges said in her rebuttal. “What we are looking for is the executive agency to meet its obligation under the appropriation statute to spend $28 million in the furtherance of services and activities of the legal orientation program.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, rounded out the panel.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/07/donald-trump-and-kristi-noem-tour-alligator-alcatraz.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-14 16:58:13.026622

By the first week of June, when the migrants’ once-extended permits were set to expire again, only 24 migrants remained.

The Afghan girl stayed behind in Tapachula; one of the four remaining Nepali women went to join her husband.","On a humid evening in early June, Jharana Chhetri said good-bye to the group of people she had come to know intimately over her last three months in Panama.

Jharana had freshly showered and wore an orange and white T-shirt with a tie-dye design. She and a small group — two other Nepali women, one of whom was her closest friend, a Nepali boy she had taken under her wing, and a young woman from Afghanistan — were ready to leave what had been their home since March. It was already dark by the time their car backed into the dirt driveway of the migrant-reception center in the outer rim of Panama City. Jharana hugged each person who was staying behind. When some of the women started to tear up, she steadied their shoulders. “Be strong,” she said.

Jharana, which is a nickname she asked to use to protect her privacy, and the other Nepalis at the center had met in January, when they crossed into the U.S. and turned themselves in to Border Patrol. Jharana had been traveling for two years by that point; in total, she spent 22 days in detention. The whole time, she was sustained by the hope that she would soon be reunited with her husband, who had arrived in the U.S. in 2022 to request asylum; he now had work authorization. “I kept thinking, I’ve made it, I’m here, I’ll see him soon,” she said.

Stranded

The second Trump administration has deported more than 8,100 people to places other than their countries of origin — also known as third countries. Some have been sent to foreign prisons or active war zones; other third countries have not offered long-term plans for legal status. A series about what happens next.

Instead, Jharana and her group of Nepalis were ushered onto a flight one early morning in February, in a group of about 300 migrants of various nationalities. The pilot and staff told them that it would be a six-hour journey to their destination but did not entertain any questions. Jharana believed they were being transferred to another detention facility in the U.S. It was only when the pilot announced their arrival in Panama that she understood what had happened. They had been sent back to the country with one of the deadliest land-migration routes in the world — the Darién Gap — which they had already passed through on their way up to the U.S. border from South America, after flying there on a multi-stop journey from Nepal. “After all that travel, all those difficulties, all that walking in the jungle for days, we were back there again,” she said. Jharana and other Nepali women started weeping loudly.

Most migrants in the cohort spoke little to no Spanish. Jharana was one of the few who spoke a little English, which catapulted her into the role of a sort of middlewoman — someone gathering and disseminating information to her group. Becoming a de facto leader “wasn’t so intentional,” she said. “I needed to get information for myself anyway, so it just ended up being the case that I was also asking for others.” Upon arriving in Panama, the migrants were separated by nationality, and locked up in the Decapolis Hotel, unable to leave their rooms except for meals and not allowed to speak with family or lawyers. But Jharana and the others watched the news on the TV sets in their rooms. With lipstick, they scrawled pleas for help on the windows.

Photos of this group barricaded in their hotel inspired headlines around the world. This was the first cohort to be hastily dumped in a third country in what would become a central tactic of the Trump administration’s deportation policy — one that human-rights groups have argued ignores the law and violates due process. And yet today many of the migrants are still stuck in Panama, a country where less than one percent of asylum applicants were approved in 2022 and the top border official said it would “never” offer asylum to “these people”; others, like Jharana, have decided finally to move on. All of their lives have been marked by the fleeting bonds they’ve made with others along the way, both forged and undone by circumstance. “That is just the nature of the journey,” Jharana said.“It is so difficult — and we become close in the process of checking up on each other and asking, ‘Are you okay?’”

Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panama had agreed to accept the migrants temporarily, acting as a bridge to their home countries or to other countries where they might be resettled, but it proved more complicated than the government expected. The U.S. had not screened most of these migrants for asylum and other types of protection, and it was against international law for Panama to send them back to their home countries if they expressed fear of being harmed there. So by March 18, the U.N.’s migration agency repatriated around 60 percent of the migrants who agreed to be sent to their home countries (although migrants later said that they felt coerced, and at least one had not fully realized what they were consenting to). The rest decided to stay in Panama, expressing fear of persecution or harm back home.

Among those who remained were women fleeing armed conflict in Cameroon, men who had escaped gang violence in Nigeria, Iranian women who had converted to Christianity and feared religious persecution, and Pakistani and Afghan migrants who were evading the Taliban. Jharana had spent two years of her life and thousands of dollars trying to make it to the U.S.; going back at that point would have meant resigning herself to a future of debilitating debt in a country in freefall. Nepal is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, and more than 400,000 people have left the country owing to climate disasters between 2008 and 2014 that put a stranglehold on its economy; political unrest has also swept the region. After Jharana’s husband left for America on the advice of a friend, following him felt inevitable. Jharana took out loans and paid $44,000 up front to the smuggler for a multi-stop package common among Indians and Nepali migrants, who pay much higher costs than migrants from elsewhere. By the time she landed in Panama, she only had around $200 left.

The Panamanian government agreed to keep migrants temporarily while it waited for a third country to accept them but, wary of the press frenzy, sent them to a camp in the Darién Gap for about four weeks. Conditions there, the migrants said, were unlivable. They had no access to their phones, and there were reports of unclean water and rotting food. The bathrooms had no doors, which for many migrants from conservative cultures and religious backgrounds that stressed modesty was particularly humiliating. Some got sick, one with dengue. “I can’t even express how bad it was,” Jharana said. “No one should have to go through something like that.”

In one instance, the guards patrolling them 24/7 hit an Iranian woman who begged for access to her phone. Syed Saqlain Badshah, a 26-year-old who fled the Taliban in Northwest Pakistan, said that the group was shocked and enraged that they hurt a woman. When the holy month of Ramadan started, Badshah asked for his phone so he could listen to, and carry out, his daily prayers. The guards laughed and made jokes, he said. “I got very angry,” Badshah said. “I said, ‘You’re laughing at our ritual and our religion.’”

In the turmoil, Jharana clung to a group of people she shared a language and national background with. One of them, whom she affectionately called “Niru,” had accompanied Jharana all the way from Nepal; another was a lanky 18-year-old boy named Milan, who reminded her of her own teenage son back home and whom she had picked up along the journey months prior in Brazil. She became close with a few other Nepali women in their 20s and 30s with whom she had been detained in the U.S. back in January.

Then, in early March, after legal pushback, the migrants were bussed back and dropped off in Panama City after dark. An American researcher, lawyer, and a few UNICEF officials received them and took the families in the group to the hotel that would become their home. The researcher Caitlyn Yates, an anthropologist who studies migration, bought the rest some fast food and put them up at a hotel for the night with her own funds (which she later recuperated through donations). Around 60 in that group moved into a school turned shelter run by the Jesuit nonprofit Fe y Alegría.

On their first day, they got a hot meal and some much-needed reassurance from Father Marco Tulio Gómez, director of Fe y Alegría’s Panama operations. “I told them, ‘You are free here,’” he said. The diversity of languages and disparate cultural habits posed some initial difficulties. But the staff went to great lengths to accommodate them: They made it possible for the women who were uncomfortable sleeping in the open, in the vicinity of men, to use private quarters. During Ramadan, they brought in a local imam for the Muslims. They took the Christians to church. Jharana, who is Hindu, could not avail herself of these benefits, but nevertheless she felt welcomed. For the first time since she arrived in Panama, “I felt like I was in my home with my family,” Jharana said.

Throughout March and April, the shelter saw a flurry of visits by reporters, researchers, officials, lawyers, and members of international organizations. Almost everyone who applied for asylum got a quick rejection, so every couple of weeks, officials would say they were asking another third country to take them. According to Yates, who — along with a number of advocacy organizations — was part of the talks with several countries to take these migrants, prospects looked positive at first, but they were “strung up for weeks or months” and would ultimately fail because of some small “logistical, bureaucratic or legal hurdle.” Jharana and the others understood that they were all being given the runaround. “Two or so months went by just like this: waiting, waiting,” she said. By the third month, the outside visits became sparse and boredom set in.

Without jobs or expendable income, the migrants didn’t have much to do. Some formed their own routines. An Afghan man named Hidayat Zazai, who had served in the Afghan special forces alongside the U.S. military and fled when the Taliban took over Kabul, said that he walked for hours around the neighborhood every day — often returning at dusk. A Nigerian man who fled armed militants back home and, for that reason, only wanted to go by his initials D.R.O., said he tended to keep to himself: work out during the day and take online Spanish lessons in the evening on his phone. “I normally sit alone and maybe make friends with my phone — it gives me company,” he said.

The Nepali women walked to local stores for lotions and bright lipsticks; they played Uno nonstop for weeks, until they tired of that too; some days, they picked fights with each other just to have something to do. Jharana was gregarious and outgoing; she tried to find joy in the newness — strange fruit at the market or marveling at scenery. She passed time by making TikToks in the shelter kitchen or in the nearby parking lot of the Super 99 store under a palm tree, lip-syncing and dancing to Hindi and Nepali songs. “We’ve wasted so much time,” Jharana said. “Might as well get some laughs out of it.” She encouraged the others to “to go see things and talk to everyone” instead of stewing in their room, but they didn’t like being told this; they didn’t think there was any point.

The Panamanian government had given out 30-day permits to the migrants who remained in the country starting in March, with the option of extending for up to 90 days. These recurring, short-term deferrals created a cloud of protracted uncertainty over the shelter that was perhaps strategic, Father Gomez said. The limbo was meant to wear the migrants down, push them to leave Panama. And it worked. After the first four weeks, the first group that “couldn’t take it” anymore, departed the shelter — frequently traveling north. After that, every month, about ten more followed.

By the first week of June, when the migrants’ once-extended permits were set to expire again, only 24 migrants remained. The large gymnasium in the compound, once lined on three sides with mattresses, now seemed deserted. Murmurs of a six-month extension were buzzing around that week — and would be announced later that month — but no lasting solution was on the horizon. Jharana was restless. This whole time, she hadn’t even told her in-laws in Nepal, whom she was closer to than her actual parents, where she was because she didn’t want to worry them. She was anxious to start making money and supporting her family, to actually start living a life — even if it was not the one she had imagined. “What would we do sitting here for another six months without being able to work?” Jharana told me.

Three members of the original Nepali group had left Fe y Alegría for Mexico City in late spring; fed up with waiting around, Jharana decided to follow suit. She shared the idea with her husband, and he agreed to send her the money — around $2,500 — for the journey. Once she was sure, she floated the idea to Niru and Milan and the rest of the Nepali group, asking if anyone else wanted to come along; their responses hinged on access to money.

Some had no relatives left to rely on, or the ones they did have back home were too burdened with debt from the sunk cost of their first journey to America to help them out a second time. Zazai, who had fled the Taliban, wanted to move on to Mexico, too, for instance, where he knew many Afghans were biding their time until it became safe to try to seek asylum in the U.S. again, but he had no choice but to stay in Panama. Three of the Nepali women also stayed behind, two for financial reasons; their relatives had put up their homes as collateral and were paying back their debts in monthly installments. Niru still had some relatives who could send her the money she needed for the trip to Mexico; Milan was from a village in Central Nepal where every household scrounged together money to send their boys to America — his relatives were able to help pay for him to move on.

On their last day together, Jharana and the other Nepali women at the shelter swapped cooking shifts with another group of migrants. Around 2 p.m., they took over the communal kitchen, boiling chicken and chopping onions, eggplants, tomatoes, and potatoes. In response to Jharana’s occasional directions, the youngest in the group jokingly used an Urdu honorific meant to signal seniority and high regard: “Okay, huzoor,” she said.

The women piled up the chicken curry and sabzi onto plates along with large mountains of white rice. Jharana rang Milan, who promptly sauntered in, watching a cricket match on his phone. They sat down to their last meal together. “In that time of sorrow, we were together,” Jharana said. “So when another trying time approaches, I’ll think of these people and gain strength.”

Jharana and her small group traveled by car and occasionally bus across successive borders up to Mexico. The acute pain she felt the day she left Fé y Alegría started to fade a couple of days into the journey. She has come to see separation as an inevitable part of her life on the move. “That’s how I steady myself and carry on — and I have to, right?” she added. “It’s necessary to get a hold of myself because no one else is around to do it for me.”

Upon arrival in Mexico in mid-June, the group splintered further. The Afghan girl stayed behind in Tapachula; one of the four remaining Nepali women went to join her husband. Niru, Milan, and Jharana rented a studio with a kitchen through an acquaintance for $500. They found an Indian store to buy ingredients to cook Nepali food. Some days, they explored the city a little and learned from others what they could do for work. Jharana felt her Spanish was improving.

Around two weeks after she arrived in Mexico City, Jharana applied for asylum with the help of a local lawyer. Around the same time, she posted a photo of herself on TikTok in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City with a caption in Nepali: “Seeking respect above your status is your greatest folly.”

At the end of August, Milan left the trio for the U.S.-Mexico border, paying up to $17,000 hoping to cross again to join relatives. “I felt really bad when he left,” Jharana said, “but he didn’t feel like he had an opportunity here.” By September, he had crossed and joined an uncle in America. Now, Niru, who is currently staying with Jharana at their third apartment in the outskirts of the city, is also considering another border crossing.

Jharana received a temporary document in September that allows her to stay in Mexico City for a year — and certifies that she is in the asylum process. When she gets work authorization, she wants to open a hair salon and set her own hours. After two years, she and her husband, who will have likely got his asylum decision by then, will recalibrate their plans. Every day, she talks to her boys. The younger one, 6, calls her some morning before catching the bus to school. The older one, 16, is now in 11th grade. She checks in with the migrants she left behind at Fé y Alegría less often. “I try to look out for people around me, make sure no one is feeling hurt, even when no one has asked this of me,” she said. “But I don’t feel like I have anyone like that here to do that for me.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f90/112/bad78c5d9b5b7e340d4bbb0a6e63345ef0-third-countries-part-two-02.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:57:52.361432

The docket for the case contains no notice of appeal to the appellate court with jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.","A federal judge rebuked the Trump administration Tuesday for “a ham-handed attempt to bully the states” that also defied his court order against conditioning eligibility for federal funds on cooperation with immigration enforcement.

Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island, an appointee of George W. Bush, last month issued an order to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from requiring those conditions on state and local recipients of Federal Emergency Management Agency grants.

Smith, in an order Tuesday, said DHS since then has inserted those conditions on award letters along with statements that the conditions will become immediately effective if Smith’s order is lifted or wiped out on an appeal.

“Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress,” Smith wrote.

The insertion of the language in effect means states are still being asked to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of grants, and states have a right to accept grants without the conditions, Smith wrote.

“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote. “No matter how confident Defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful.”

Smith’s latest order bars FEMA from enforcing the contested conditions and “any materially similar term requiring cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.”

Additionally, the order requires states to “amend all award documents” within seven days to remove all mention of compliance with immigration law from award letters to localities.

The order comes as critics have accused the Trump administration of refusing to comply with court orders, especially in litigation related to immigration.

Even though the inserted language anticipates an appeal, the government as of Tuesday appears to have not done so. The docket for the case contains no notice of appeal to the appellate court with jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.

Congress had appropriated more than $1 billion to the state under the initiatives, which include the Emergency Management Performance Grant, the Homeland Security Grant Program and Port Security Grant Program, according to a court filing in the cases from officials in 20 states.

The states argued the new language effectively requires them to affirm they would cooperate with federal officials in violation of the earlier order, saying the change “is materially identical to the text of the vacated and enjoined Contested Conditions.””

The states contended they must still agree to be bound by the conditions, it’s just they must “agree to be bound by them at a later date, if a specific event occurs.”

The Trump administration argued the conditional language did not deviate from the earlier order the judge, arguing the states “cite nothing that indicates that the Agency is currently enforcing the Contested Conditions in violation of this Court’s order.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/fema_BC_085_030625.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:56:54.283349

It previously cost employers a few thousand dollars per H-1B visa application, depending on the size of the company, according to the American Immigration Council.
He’s doubtful the new visa fee will go into effect, due in part to the lack of a clear process in place for collecting or enforcing the fee.
“So I’m highly skeptical that it will actually go into effect.” He said the increased cost for employers also raises legal questions.
“Employers are only hiring if they really need somebody because of these extra costs,” Sovern said.","The White House’s planned $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications could substantially raise costs for some Wisconsin businesses. But an attorney in the state says it’s unclear whether the proposal will ultimately stay on track.

According to state data, 372 employers in Wisconsin employ a total of 2,245 people who have H-1B visas, which apply to highly skilled workers in specialty occupations. It previously cost employers a few thousand dollars per H-1B visa application, depending on the size of the company, according to the American Immigration Council.

The Trump administration says the fee is being put in place to “curb abuses that displace U.S. workers and undermine national security” and that it may allow special exemptions “if in the national interest.”

A group of employers filed a lawsuit earlier this month against the Trump administration, claiming the president lacks the authority to change the visa system established by Congress.

‘Prohibitively expensive for companies in the Midwest’

H-1B visas are most commonly used by tech, education and medical sectors. The top employer of H-1B visas in Wisconsin is the financial technology company Fiserv, according to data compiled by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

“We’re reviewing President Trump’s proclamation and assessing any potential impact on our U.S. workforce. At this time, we don’t expect any immediate impacts to our operations or client service,” a Fiserv spokesperson said in a statement to WPR.

But the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, Dale Kooyenga, told “Wisconsin Today” the fee may disproportionately affect Midwestern companies with lower profit margins.

“The reality is a lot of companies that rely upon these are not high margin tech companies with billions of dollars in capital,” Kooyenga said. “Our fear is that it’s prohibitively expensive for companies in the Midwest, where the cost of living is lower and the margin for these mature industries is lower.”

Kooyenga also worries international companies like Fiserv will choose to keep their workforce offshore.

“With that type of fee, does it make sense to bring them to Milwaukee, Wisconsin? Or does it make sense to keep them in a part of the world where nearly all large companies have the ability to outsource parts of their workforce?” Kooyenga said. “If you have [the H-1B] program here, then you’re going to get these individuals to come here and [get] the company to invest here through these individuals.”

H-1B process already has strict requirements, disincentives

Grant Sovern is an immigration attorney at Quarles & Brady, where he regularly files H-1B petitions for Wisconsin businesses. He’s doubtful the new visa fee will go into effect, due in part to the lack of a clear process in place for collecting or enforcing the fee.

“There is no way to pay that fee or to show someone that you paid it so you could get into the country if you have an H-1B,” Sovern told WPR. “So I’m highly skeptical that it will actually go into effect.”

He said the increased cost for employers also raises legal questions.

“This $100,000 fee isn’t at all related to the cost of processing the H-1B petitions,” he said. “The law does require that any filing fee has to be related to what it costs to get it done.”

When announcing the fee, the White House said some employers “have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages” for American citizens.

However, Sovern pointed out that regulations are already in place to prevent businesses from using the program for cheap labor.

Employers are required to pay the prevailing wage for that position at that location and post it for other employees to see. They’re also required to file paperwork ensuring there hasn’t been a layoff or that a strike is not a strike happening.

And the costs associated with filing the paperwork to comply with those requirements is a disincentive for an employer to abuse the system, Sovern said.

“Employers are only hiring if they really need somebody because of these extra costs,” Sovern said.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP23118629121438-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:56:58.947593

(WGN) — Federal officials have until the end of the day on Tuesday to take down a fence surrounding an ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview, as immigration enforcement operations continue in Chicagoland.
The mayor said that over the weekend, protests spilled out onto 22nd Avenue, about a block from the ICE facility.
Going forward, protestors will only be allowed on Beach Street, which is closer to the ICE facility.
“We have the right, without giving any notice, to inspect any ICE detention facility,” he said.
“This particular Broadview facility, in my opinion, would qualify as a detention facility, whatever name they call it.","BROADVIEW, Ill. (WGN) — Federal officials have until the end of the day on Tuesday to take down a fence surrounding an ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview, as immigration enforcement operations continue in Chicagoland.

The fence was erected around the west suburban facility about three weeks ago by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). But it restricts access to Beach St, something the Village of Broadview took the agency to federal court over last week.

A judge later agreed that the fence must come down because it created a public safety concern for first responders who tried to access the area.

A court-issued deadline for the fence’s removal was set for 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, but there were still no signs of removal by around 9:30 a.m..

The court-ordered teardown comes just a day after Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued an executive order placing new restrictions that shrink the size and scope of where the demonstrators are allowed to protest.

The mayor said that over the weekend, protests spilled out onto 22nd Avenue, about a block from the ICE facility. That created a dangerous situation, according to the mayor. Going forward, protestors will only be allowed on Beach Street, which is closer to the ICE facility.

The new restrictions were put in place just a week after Thompson signed an executive order that limited protests to a designated area only between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

The decision to further contain protests was not well-received by demonstrators.

“We care about what’s going on behind those walls,” one protestor said in part.

Elected leaders at all levels of government were at the facility Monday, praising the federal judge’s decision to grant, at least temporarily, the village’s request to bring the fence down.

“Without permission or collaboration with this community, this fence you see behind us has been standing here blocking the community’s access to its own streets and standing as a symbol of division,” Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said Monday. “It’s a symbol of Donald Trump’s contempt for this community and so many like it.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois’ 8th District also came to the Broadview ICE facility on Monday and attempted to gain access himself to check on a 15-year-old girl from his district, who he believes is detained there.

But Krishnamoorthi was denied, just like Illinois Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin last week, and told that because it’s a holding facility and not a detention facility, his rights as a member of Congress to gain access did not apply.

Krishnamoorthi disagreed with that determination.

“We have the right, without giving any notice, to inspect any ICE detention facility,” he said. “This particular Broadview facility, in my opinion, would qualify as a detention facility, whatever name they call it.

The Department of Homeland Security has appealed the judge’s ruling as the clock ticks on the teardown of the fence.",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-14T095023.975.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 15:57:11.963936

Through research, dialogue, and public engagement, the Judicial Foundations Project will explore and articulate the legitimate scope of judicial power and the risks associated with its growing influence in Canada’s parliamentary democracy. By fostering informed debate. The initiative aims to strengthen Canada’s democratic foundations and ensure that the delicate relationship between the courts, Parliament, and the executive continues to serve the common good.

Canada’s constitutional order, which is founded upon the principles of the United Kingdom constitution, embraces the primacy of political authority. Under the Westminster model of responsible government, it is Parliament, not the courts, that is charged with the responsibility to make and to change the law. Underscoring this primacy of political over judicial authority, the Constitution Act, 1867 establishes and vests “Executive Power” and “Legislative Power”, while providing for the “Judicature” or “The Administration of Justice” to be framed by the appointment and law-making powers of the Governor General and provincial legislatures, respectively.

The traditional primacy of the legislative and executive in law- and policy-making is increasingly displaced by the undisciplined exercise of judicial power. Across a wide array of matters, the policy agenda has largely been dictated by judicial rulings. But this expansion of judicial power is incompatible with the role of courts in a constitutional democracy.

There is a need for sustained reflection on the ways in which judicial power is exercised, the innovative adjudicative methodologies that underlie its expansion, its implications for the relationship between our judicial and political institutions—and, ultimately, its impact on Canadian democracy and the common good. This project seeks to provide Canadians with a deeper understanding of judicial power and its proper limits in the balance of our constitution. It does not seek to diminish our judiciary, but to reestablish the foundations of the judicial role in upholding settled law and legal principle, not choosing policy. We welcome intellectual exchanges with practitioners, scholars, jurists, and all those concerned with the ambit of judicial power in Canada.",https://macdonaldlaurier.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Judicial-Foundations-Hero.png,N,,2025-10-14 18:57:24.985162

Washington, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has obtained credible intelligence indicating that Mexican criminals, in coordination with domestic extremist groups have placed targeted bounties on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel.

These criminal networks have issued explicit instructions to U.S.-based sympathetics, including street gangs in Chicago, to monitor, harass, and assassinate federal agents. Specific details from ongoing investigations include:

Spotter Networks: In neighborhoods like Chicago's Pilsen and Little Village, gang members affiliated with groups such as the Latin Kings have deployed ""spotters"" on rooftops equipped with firearms and radio communications. These individuals track ICE and CBP movements in real-time, relaying coordinates. This surveillance has enabled ambushes and disruptions during routine enforcement actions, including recent raids under Operation Midway Blitz.

Tiered Bounty System: Cartels have disseminated a structured bounty program to incentivize violence against federal personnel, with payouts escalating based on rank and action taken:

$2,000 for gathering intelligence or doxxing agents (including photos and family details).

$5,000–$10,000 for kidnapping or non-lethal assaults on standard ICE/CBP officers.

Up to $50,000 for the assassination of high-ranking officials.

In Portland and Chicago, Antifa groups have provided logistical support such as pre-staged protest supplies, doxxing of agent identities, and on-the-ground interference to shield cartel-linked individuals from deportation.

“These criminal networks are not just resisting the rule of law, they are waging an organized campaign of terror against the brave men and women who protect our borders and communities,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “Our agents are facing ambushes, drone surveillance, and death threats, all because they dare to enforce the laws passed by Congress. We will not back down from these threats, and every criminal, terrorist, and illegal alien will face American justice.”

DHS will not be deterred by these threats and calls on sanctuary state and local leaders to cease policies that embolden criminals.

In his earlier ruling, the judge had struck down conditions the department originally had imposed on grant awards.

At the time, 20 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia had argued the restrictions were designed to coerce them into adhering to the Republican president’s hardline immigration crackdown.

After Smith’s initial ruling, the administration issued new grant award documents to the states with nearly identical immigration enforcement conditions but with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

Smith said the “fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference” as the administration was again unlawfully forcing the states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo millions of dollars in funding.

“Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress,” Smith wrote.

The judge, an appointee of former Republican President George W Bush, blocked the new conditions from being enforced and required the administration to amend the grant award documents by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The administration had argued it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and had merely been seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions in the event his ruling was later overturned.

This was “not a good faith effort to comply with the order,” Smith ruled Tuesday.

Senior U.S. District Judge William Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, scolded the government for what he called a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make.”

In September, Smith ruled that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is barred from enforcing new requirements that effectively withhold disaster aid from states with so-called “sanctuary” immigration laws.

But despite that order, Smith wrote Tuesday that the department tried to implement a workaround: adding a trigger clause to the FEMA disaster relief grants that would force states to comply with the immigration provisions if the judge’s prior injunction gets overturned on appeal.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids, which is requiring plaintiff states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of DHS grants,” Smith wrote in a three-page ruling. “The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference.”

“No matter how confident defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful,” the judge added. “Plaintiff states therefore have a right to accept the awards without regard to the contested conditions.”

The states complained earlier this month of potential violations to Smith’s order, writing in a letter to the judge that Homeland Security “copy-pasted the contested conditions” into a new grant term with the trigger clause.

This was “not a good faith effort to comply with the order,” Smith ruled Tuesday. He found that the government’s attempted workaround is indeed a violation of his September order.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.

A batch of Democratic states sued the administration in May, claiming that the government was “hanging a halt in … critical funding over states like a sword of Damocles” by requiring collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get FEMA funds.

In doing so, the states claimed that they were put in the impossible situation of having to choose between emergency readiness and how to best use their local law enforcement. Complying with the government in this case, the states argued, would pull police resources off of crimefighting efforts and onto the government’s immigration agenda.

The requirements also mandate that states end any program that “benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration,” which the states say is a breach of federalism.

“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: Agencies in the executive branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce states into adopting its preferred policies,” the states argue.

Emergency relief is just one of the ways the Trump administration has attempted to get states to comply with its mass deportation agenda, which has been scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights leaders as an unlawful affront to the Constitution.

Federal authorities also tried to tie immigration enforcement to transportation funding — another move that prompted a massive lawsuit from a multistate coalition.

“My team and I continue to gather information about the exact details of what happened in Hoffman Estates on Friday — but there is no doubt that the video is real and that it happened here, in my district, on a street I have walked myself,” Krishnamoorthi stated in a media release.

“What that footage appears to show — a child being slammed to the ground by an ICE agent — is indefensible,” he said.

“The Hoffman Estates Police Department has confirmed that ICE agents were present in the department’s parking lot that same day and issued a statement referencing videos circulating about the day’s events.

“Yet instead of providing transparency or clarifying the facts, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security aggressively spread misinformation online, falsely claiming this was an unrelated arrest from over a year ago and miles away in Chicago.

“This continues a disturbing pattern of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security denying the public transparency or accountability while actively spreading politically motivated disinformation.

“The events in Hoffman Estates embody everything that’s wrong with the Trump Administration’s militarized ICE raids: cruelty without accountability, secrecy without oversight, and power without restraint,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“That must end — and I will continue working in Congress to demand the transparency, oversight, and justice the American people deserve.”

Earlier today, Krishnamoorthi traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, to perform congressional oversight of reported detentions — including of minors — but was once again denied entry by the Trump administration.

The refusal follows a similar incident in June, when Krishnamoorthi and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were turned away from another ICE site in Chicago’s South Loop after attempting to inspect conditions and obtain information about detainees.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” Krishnamoorthi stated. “Once again, the Trump administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability. Congress and the American people have every right to see what’s happening behind those walls.”

Krishnamoorthi emphasized that continued obstruction of lawful oversight undermines accountability at a time when federal enforcement actions have intensified under Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump Administration’s mass-deportation campaign targeting Democratic-led cities.

The move would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to provide rent relief for tenants who have fallen behind as a result of the crackdown on immigrants. A local state of emergency can also funnel state money for legal aid and other services.

Funds for rent would be available to people who apply via an online portal that would be launched within two months, Supervisor Lindsey Horvath’s office said. The motion could also be a first step toward an eviction moratorium, but that would require a separate action by the supervisors.

Landlords worried it could be another financial hit after an extended ban on evictions and rental increases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since June, the Los Angeles region has been a battleground in the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guards and Marines for more than a month. Federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms. Some U.S. citizens have also been detained.

Horvath and Janice Hahn said the raids have spread fear and destabilized households and businesses.

“They are targeting families, disrupting classrooms, silencing workers, and forcing people to choose between staying safe and staying housed,” Horvath said in a statement, referencing actions by the Trump administration. She added declaring an emergency “is how we fight back.”

Last week the five-member board voted 4-1 to put the declaration up for a vote at its regular Tuesday meeting. The sole “no” vote came from Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who argued that the immigration raids did not meet the criteria of an emergency and that it could be unfair to landlords.

“I’m sure we’re going to be challenged legally,” Barger said. The county’s eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in multiple lawsuits.

Landlords are “still reeling” from the COVID-era freezes that cost them “billions of dollars in uncollected rent and prohibited annual rent increase,” said Daniel Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.

He said housing providers are sympathetic to tenants and their family members affected by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities. But, he said, the association isn’t aware of anyone unable to pay rent due to immigration enforcement.

“If local jurisdictions once again allow rent payments to be deferred due to ICE enforcement activities, this will lead to the further deterioration and loss of affordable housing in our community,” Yukelson said.",https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/APTOPIX_California_Immigration_Raids_45296.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:58:07.129713

I am writing this week’s newsletter on Thursday, so the usual disclaimers apply if any big news is missing. I usually prefer to ignore the utterances of certain politicians, but it has only been a few days since the last newsletter and I need some content. So I’m afraid that I am going to take a look at what the shadow Justice minister said last week, seemingly while using a judge’s wig as a puppet (??).

In a speech given at what appeared to be a sparsely populated Tory conference last week, the shadow minister continued an attack on judges that has been championed by the right wing press who have been misreporting immigration and asylum appeals since the beginning of the year. He apparently has a list of judges whose views he does not agree with because they are suspected of being pro-migrant, for reasons including previous cases and social media posts. Names have been made public and as a consequence those judges have been placed at risk of far-right violence.

Meanwhile, suspicions are that this recent hit piece was written by a judge, given the access to the bookshelves in Field House. The article acknowledges that the Home Office makes bad decisions, yet concludes that the solution is to get rid of both lawyers and judges. No wonder there is no name attached, as this is an embarrassingly incoherent position. Presumably though, Jenrick would have no issue with any judge holding these views.

On Free Movement, the latest podcast is out for those of you who want to listen to Barry and I discuss all things September. Right at the end I even managed to get Barry to discuss his most (in)famous case.

The Migration Advisory Committee has completed the first stage of its review of the temporary shortage list. Also last week, we finally have our newest Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (and as a consequence are down one Immigration Services Commissioner). We republished our updated briefing on the role.

We also had a few case write ups, with more to come this week. For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s.

A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated.
In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.","LINCOLN — As Nebraska moves forward in converting a McCook state prison into an ICE detention center, concerns grow about the Governor’s Office stonewalling public requests seeking more about what is going on.

By late September, Gov. Jim Pillen’s office had denied at least nine public records requests asking for information about the state’s negotiations with the federal government regarding the McCook Work Ethic Camp, records obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicate. Additionally, there’s evidence that broader requests on the subject have also been denied, although some state agencies, including the prison system, have released some records.

These denials raised the eyebrows of local activists and legal experts who say they are suspicious that potentially thousands of public records could be withheld under the governor’s justifications. Though there is little evidence of wrongdoing, the lack of information on a subject that involves a state prison and state funds makes some believe the state has something to hide.

“Whether or not they file an open records request, people are calling out for this information and are entitled to understand what their government is doing in their name,” said Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. “The interest in obscuring that information completely … is really suspect, and the motivation for that needs to be questioned.”

Meanwhile, Nebraska is well underway in transitioning the McCook property into a jail that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said just over 60 of the 180 men the camp typically holds remained housed there as of Oct. 8.

Charlie McPherson, executive director with the McCook Economic Development Corp., said his team is “keeping eyes and ears open for more information,” and hasn’t gotten any fresh info from the city or state. “Just sitting tight.” He said driving by the camp, he noticed fencing work being done.

Talks between state officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the Work Ethic Camp have been going since at least late March, according to documents the government watchdog group Common Cause Nebraska acquired from the Department of Corrections.

News of the plan broke in late August. In early September, Pillen administration staffers revealed in a closed-door briefing that state officials initiated conversations with the federal government regarding the possibility of helping ICE.

At the time, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington said she was told state leaders expect a written agreement between Nebraska and the federal government to be completed within 60 days.

Though it’s still within the 60-day window, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha said he’s heard from several sources that the state has already signed the contract and is waiting for a federal response. There has been no official confirmation as yet. Homeland Security operations continue during a government shutdown that could limit some ICE actions.

The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request of its own Sept. 5 for communications between Pillen, his staff, and Homeland Security officials about the deal. The Governor’s Office responded to the request Sept. 18, well past the four-day deadline laid out in statute for how long state agencies have to respond.

In its response, the office denied the request based on four justifications:

The documents requested constitute “proprietary or commercial information.”

The documents requested constitute “negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”

The documents requested constitute “confidential communications.”

Cited a statute outlining the rules for lawyer-client privilege.

The Examiner sent a follow-up request on Sept. 22 seeking how the Governor’s Office responded to related requests from others. The office requested an extension and fulfilled the request on Oct. 8.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s. All were denied, and seven of the nine were denied with virtually identical reasonings — those listed above. The requests were made by a range of individuals, including reporters, private citizens and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

But the state’s justifications for denying the requests are questionable, according to multiple legal experts who spoke with the Examiner, including Houlden and Daniel Gutman, a lawyer who has litigated several public records disputes. Houlden said she believes the exceptions government agencies are granted under law are being applied more broadly than they ought to be.

“(The governor’s office) tends to blur lines when it comes to interpretations,” said Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska.

Geis argued that the first two justifications treat the dealings between two public bodies — the Nebraska state government and the federal government — as though both are private businesses. Houlden noted the exact language of one of the cited statutes grants an exception for records that would “give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose” if they were made public, which makes her believe that the exception should not apply.

Houlden said the second justification contradicts previous public statements state officials have made that Nebraska will continue to own and operate the McCook facility.

Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted. Though Gutman said this isn’t a legally binding principle, there is a legal obligation for state officials to “understand and apply the exceptions in light of a broader public policy that favors disclosure.”

The Governor’s Office declined an interview for this story but sent a written statement.

“The Governor’s Office has responded to all record requests submitted about WEC and its transition to becoming a federal detention center,” Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple wrote. “The process followed was the same as for any record request. Records have been provided to each requestor within the scope of law, which also allows for withholding information that meets specific exceptions.”

Gutman equated questionable public records responses to “the chicken or the egg” paradox, because while there is cause to suspect the Governor’s Office is withholding records that should be public, there is no way to know for certain without seeing the records being withheld.

There are legitimate reasons to withhold government records, Gutman said. The question is: Do those reasons apply to the potentially thousands of records that pertain to the WEC negotiations? Gutman said he thinks that’s unlikely.

Nebraska law treats most public documents as public records. According to the Attorney General’s Office, exceptions to the state’s public records statutes include personal information on students, medical records other than about births or deaths, trade secrets, investigatory records, vulnerabilities involving public property, firearms registration information and cybersecurity info.

A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated. The main option is suing in Lancaster District Court, which Gutman said at best can take two to three months to resolve, or longer if the state appeals.

The state also recommends requesters petition the Attorney General’s Office for a review if they believe an error was made in their response.

In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of the governor and other state agencies, said she believes Pillen’s office is banking on the assumption that most people won’t take them to court.

Cavanaugh acknowledged that hesitation over public records requests is not a problem specific to Pillen’s administration but argued it has gotten worse since he took office. Former governor turned U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., didn’t make the process easy, but he returned requests and allowed room for negotiations, she said.

When reached by the Examiner, McCook City Council members said they agreed to direct all questions on the McCook conversion to Molly Smith, a city spokesperson who did not return calls. McCook Mayor Linda Taylor also did not return calls.

State Sen. David Murman, whose legislative district includes McCook, said he had no fresh update. He supports the project and President Trump’s efforts to secure the border, he said, and believes many of his constituents do also.

Cavanaugh, along with fellow Appropriations Committee member State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, requested that the committee hold a public briefing to better understand the transition process and its financial implications for the state. They were denied by committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who said there will be opportunity to discuss the topic when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

Judiciary Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln also has denied requests for public hearings about the Work Ethic Camp.

The Urban Affairs Committee, chaired by McKinney, held a public hearing in September at the Capitol, which drew a large enough crowd that it required an overflow area. This is part of the “far-reaching consequences” Geis said come with withholding information on matters of high public interest. It limits the opportunities for voters to make informed decisions.

On the flip side, he said, it also keeps voters in the dark about good decisions their government is making. In this way, Geis argued Pillen could benefit from being more forthcoming.

“When they close the door, we can only assume that what’s happening back there is not to our benefit,” Geis said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said its agents use a “minimum amount of force” when making arrests, but every day it seems a new video pops up online that indicates otherwise.

Personally, my social media feed has been a stream of brutal ICE interactions: agents caught on video being both verbally and physically aggressive with the people they are detaining and with bystanders — all while many of them hide behind masks and plainclothes.

In one video, taken outside of an elementary school in Chicago, a group of masked ICE officers can be seen pulling a screaming woman out of her car. Eyewitnesses said she was in line for afternoon school pickup at the time of the incident. In the video, the woman said the agents did not have a warrant and claimed that agents had “forcibly opened” her car door.

Another video taken in Chicago showed masked agents in a white SUV throwing a canister of tear gas onto a pedestrian street near a middle school in broad daylight. Cars can be seen trying to block the unmarked vehicle, which was reportedly headed for a local grocery store. An agent then rolled down his window and threw the tear gas, causing bystanders to disperse.

In Maryland, two ICE officers chased a man into a busy intersection and then tackled him. The man could be heard screaming in Spanish “ayuda,” which means “help.” During the struggle, an agent dropped his handgun and then appeared to point it at bystanders. The Department of Homeland Security said the man being arrested in the video was resisting.

In Chicago, a journalist by the name of Debbie Brockman was forced to the ground and cuffed by three federal agents while she was out reporting. DHS said Brockman was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. WGN-TV, Brockman’s employer, said she was not charged with any crimes and was ultimately released.

Responding to criticism about its operation, DHS said that “anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

But the tactics seen in these videos are brutal in nature, alarmingly so, and the presence of a rolling camera does not seem to deter ICE agents’ behavior. While many of these videos are difficult to watch, it is also important to bear witness to what is happening to human beings on the streets of America.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-velshi-ice-videos-zz-25262a.jpg",N,,2025-10-14 12:56:57.870435

4.3 This instrument also makes minor changes to other policy areas, detailed in paragraphs 5.40 and 5.60 of section 5 of this Explanatory Memorandum.

Where does the legislation extend to, and apply?

4.4 The extent of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, the jurisdiction(s) which the statement forms part of the law of) is all of the United Kingdom.

4.5 The territorial application of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, where the statement produces a practical effect) is all of the United Kingdom.

5. Policy Context

What is being done and why?

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

5.1 The changes will introduce a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK.

5.2 Linked to this Botswana will be removed from the list of countries whose nationals are eligible to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).

5.3 By applying a visit visa requirement and removing eligibility to enter the UK with an ETA, those travelling to visit the UK can be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival in the UK. This means that their visit visa application will be refused where it is assessed that they do not meet those requirements or issued where it is concluded that they do.

5.4 UK visa requirements are kept under review. There are high numbers of nationals of Botswana who travel to the UK for purposes that are not permitted under the Immigration Rules for visitors. In particular, since 2022 there has been a persistently high number of nationals of Botswana who claim asylum. Between January 2022 and June 2025, 1,332 nationals of Botswana claimed asylum with 642 of these claims made at port. So far in 2025 (January to June), 147 nationals of Botswana have claimed asylum. While the number of people claiming asylum has fluctuated, numbers have remained high throughout this period and all asylum claims place additional resource pressure on the borders and migration system.

5.5 In 2023, 62% of asylum claims were made at the UK border. In 2024, 21% of asylum claims were made at port. All asylum claims made at port add significantly to operational pressure at the border, diverting staff from other priorities.

5.6 The visa national status of Botswana will be kept under review; particularly with regards to whether the visa introduction affects the number of individuals claiming asylum from within the UK.

5.7 The introduction of the visa requirement will include a transition period for nationals of Botswana to travel to the UK without a visa where they hold a confirmed travel booking made prior to the introduction. This period will commence at the same time as the visa requirement is introduced and run until six weeks after the introduction date: 15:00 GMT on 25 November 2025. During this period, nationals of Botswana who hold a confirmed travel booking at the time of the introduction and an ETA, for travel to the UK within the six-week transition period, will not be required to obtain a visit visa before travel. Applications for an ETA for nationals of Botswana will close at 15:00 BST on 14 October 2025. Nationals who hold confirmed bookings for travel to the UK on a date after the transition period ends will need to obtain a visa in advance of travel. Amending the date of travel on a confirmed booking to an earlier date that falls within the transition period would still require the person to have a visa.

5.8 This transition period is designed to prevent operational difficulties, general unfairness, and ensure that people who arranged travel before this announcement do not lose money. The length of the period (six weeks) has been chosen to give those affected enough time to apply for and receive a visa. The current customer service standard processing time for applicants to receive a decision and, if issued, a visitor visa, is three weeks. Further information can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-processing-times-applications-outside-the-uk.

5.9 The introduction of a visa requirement will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that nationals of Botswana will require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight. If these amendments are not made, nationals of Botswana will be able to travel to the UK purporting to have booked onward travel and instead claim asylum, circumventing the visa requirement. It would also continue to enable nationals to transit through the UK with the intention of travelling to another country to claim asylum.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

5.10 In September 2025, the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine. To deliver this commitment and ensure that the UK maintains the requirement for these nationals to obtain a visa to visit the UK, Palestine is being added to the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa National List.

5.11 This change will introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Palestine, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK. Whilst the Occupied Palestinian Territory (as formerly known) was not previously included on the Visa National List, its citizens were already subject to a requirement to obtain a visa to visit the UK, either as citizens of the Occupied Palestinian Territory or as stateless individuals in certain cases under existing operational guidance. In respect of the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa national list, Palestinian nationals could also previously be considered under section VN 1.1(b) (stateless persons) or VN 1.1(C) (persons travelling on any document other than a national passport).

5.12 By amending legislation to include the newly recognised state of Palestine, those travelling to visit the UK can continue be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival.

5.13 This is a necessary change to protect the UK’s border and national security and to deliver on the Government’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine.

5.14 The addition of Palestine to the Immigration Rules Appendix visitor: Visa national list will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that Palestinian nationals continue to require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Again, this is not a new requirement but ensures continuity and consistency with changes to the Appendix Visitor: Visa national list. Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

5.15 Following EU Exit (effective from 1 October 2021), the UK required passports from EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals, as is the case with nationals from the rest of the world. On the same date, the UK ended its acceptance of the List of Travellers scheme, which allowed people studying in an EU Member State to travel within the EU on an organised educational visit without a passport or visa. The requirement to travel on a passport and hold a visa (if a visa national) was viewed by Germany as a significant barrier to German school groups visiting the UK. The changes address this concern.

5.16 This change will allow people aged 19 years and under who are studying at a German school or educational institution, the existence of which is confirmed by the relevant German municipal or competent authority, to come to the UK without an advance permission (an ETA or visa) when they are travelling as part of a school party of five or more. It also allows EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals aged 19 and under who are studying at the school to travel on a national identity card rather than passport. This change mirrors the similar arrangement the UK already has with France and was agreed in the context of the UK-Germany Treaty.

Change to the validity requirements in Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery

5.17 The change will correct an inconsistency between the validity criteria of Immigration Rules Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery and the caseworker guidance, to accurately reflect that there are two types of application under the route; one via application form FLR (HRO), and one made directly to a relevant competent authority.

Introduction of dependants to Appendix Statelessness

5.18 Changes are being introduced which affect partners and children of a Stateless Person. These include:

A partner or child of a stateless person may apply for entry clearance or permission to stay under Appendix Statelessness from 11 November 2025 where they formed part of the family unit before a stateless person was granted permission to stay. Those applying as a dependant on this route will need to meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

Where a partner or child of a Stateless Person are not themselves stateless and formed part of the family unit after a stateless person was granted permission, they may apply to come to or stay in the UK under the family provisions in Appendix FM. The existing provision in Appendix FM has been amended to reflect this change. Those applying under Appendix FM will need to pay the application fee, or be granted a fee waiver, as well as meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

5.19 As a result of these changes, a minor consequential change has been made to Appendix FM, Appendix Children and Appendix Relationship with Partner.

Changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes

5.20 As set out in the Immigration White Paper (Restoring Control over the Immigration System), we are introducing new requirements for English language in relation to economic migration routes.

5.21 The English language requirement for the Skilled Worker, High Potential Individual and Scale-up routes is increased from B1 Level to B2 Level (as defined under the Common European Framework for Reference for Languages (CEFR)).

5.22 The new requirements will apply to those seeking an initial grant of leave in a relevant route following the implementation of these provisions on 8 January 2026. Those who have already obtained a permission where they were required to show a B1 level, will continue to be subject to a B1 level requirement where they are seeking an extension on the same route.

High Potential Individual - targeted and capped expansion

5.23 Expansion of the High Potential Individual route, doubling the list of eligible institutions (subject to any exclusions the Secretary of State considers appropriate). This may be, for example, where inclusion of an institution would undermine UK national security or foreign policy. There will also be a cap placed on the route of 8,000 applications per year. This follows a commitment made in the Immigration White Paper, published in May 2025.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

5.24 The Immigration White Paper published on 12 May announced the Government’s intention to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months. The Graduate route currently allows eligible graduates who have successfully completed a UK bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or other relevant qualification to remain in the UK for two years, and PhD graduates for three years.

5.25 The change to 18 months will apply to applications submitted on or after 1 January 2027, with PhD graduates continuing to receive three years of leave. The data shows that too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles which the Graduate route was created to facilitate access to. It is important that those who stay transition into graduate-level jobs and are properly contributing to the economy.

Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route

5.26 This is a specific change to Student work conditions that will allow Student visa holders to establish a business, where they have completed their course and are switching to the Innovator Founder route. It replaces a similar provision that previously applied to those switching into the Start-up route, which is now closed to new applications.

Change to replace Part 9: Grounds for Refusal, with Part Suitability

5.27 Part 9 has been replaced by a new section called Part Suitability, which serves as the central reference point for all suitability-related refusal and cancellation grounds. This change aligns with the terminology already used in simplified immigration routes, where applicants are assessed against “suitability requirements” rather than “grounds for refusal”.

5.28 Paragraph 39E, which sets out exceptions for individuals who have overstayed their visa or permission, has been moved into Part Suitability under a dedicated section titled “Exceptions for overstayers”. This ensures that overstaying exceptions are considered within the broader suitability framework and improves consistency across routes.

5.29 A number of consequential changes have been made to other parts of the Immigration Rules to reflect the new structure. These include updates to paragraph references, removal of outdated terminology, and alignment of drafting with simplification principles. For example, references to “Part 9” have been replaced with “Part Suitability” in various sections, and the treatment of overstaying has been clarified to reflect the new location of paragraph 39E in Part Suitability.

5.30 The definition of ‘permission’ has also been clarified to reflect it means either permission to enter or permission to stay and includes settlement.

5.31 These changes are part of a broader simplification initiative in line with the recommendations made by the Law Commission on Simplification of the Immigration Rules in January 2019, to make the rules more accessible and easier to navigate.

Amendments to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependant Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life to apply Part Suitability.

5.32 Family and Private Life rules have, until now, not applied Part 9:Grounds for Refusal, and instead had their own suitability requirements which have resulted in a more generous approach where there are suitability considerations to be made.

5.33 This amendment will apply common suitability provisions to the family and Private life routes - deleting the suitability rules that were bespoke to the Family and Private Life rules and applying Part Suitability (which is replacing Part 9: Grounds for Refusal) to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependent Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life.

Changes to Appendix Temporary Work – Seasonal Worker

5.34 Changes are being made to the rules concerning the number of months a seasonal worker must be outside the UK before being permitted to apply for a new seasonal work visa. These changes will permit seasonal workers to spend no more than six months working in the UK during any rolling 10-month period, rather than any rolling 12-month period under the previous rules.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

5.35 The Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme (UPE) was launched on 4 February 2025. It provides a route for Ukrainians (and their eligible family members), who have already been living in the UK with Ukraine Scheme permission, to make a further application to extend their temporary sanctuary in the UK whilst the conflict in Ukraine remains ongoing.

5.36 Since the launch of UPE, children who apply with their parent who is either granted Ukraine Scheme permission at the same time as, or holds Ukraine Scheme permission, will have their period of permission aligned to that parent. Where both parents meet the criteria, the child’s permission is aligned with the parent whose permission expires last.

5.37 As part of ongoing safeguarding measures, we have identified a need to allow for a child’s permission to be aligned to that of their legal guardian. As such, we are updating the UPE eligibility requirements to ensure children can be granted permission in line with their legal guardian. As an additional safeguarding measure, in the eligibility requirements we are specifying that the adult (parent or legal guardian) must be in the UK for a child’s permission to be aligned.

5.38 We are also amending the residence requirement to allow an application to be refused where a child born in the UK or Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man) to a Ukrainian national parent who holds, or is eligible for, Ukraine scheme permission, has been outside the UK or Islands since birth.

5.39 Lastly, we are making minor drafting changes to the validity requirements, in addition to the nationality and relationship requirements to clarify the current policy intention as reflected in the rules.

Other Minor Changes

Changes to Appendix Global Talent

5.40 The Global Talent category is for talented and promising individuals in the fields of science, digital technology and arts and culture wishing to work in the UK. ‘Talent’ applicants are already leaders in their respective field, while ‘promise’ applicants have shown the potential to become leaders in their field.

5.41 As agreed with Arts Council England and their sub-endorsing body, Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), we are expanding some requirements to allow individuals within the architectural field to provide evidence of their achievements as a named member of a group or contributor, as well for their work as an individual. Additionally, we are allowing applicants to provide evidence of significantly contributing to being shortlisted or nominated for an international architectural award to qualify. Both of these changes more closely align the criteria for architects with other sections of the arts and culture requirements.

Changes to Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes

5.42 Applicants who hold a qualifying prize can qualify without the need to obtain an endorsement from one of the Global Talent endorsing bodies Our expert bodies consider the prizes listed demonstrate irrefutable evidence of prize holders being at the pinnacle of their profession. To be eligible, prizes must be given to named individuals, and therefore the list does not include prestigious awards for specific works, such as an award-winning film, or to whole organisations. Prizes included must also be open to all nationalities and winners must be determined by experts or peers, rather than a public vote.

5.43 Following consultation with the Global Talent endorsing bodies, a further 27 prizes have been added to the list and one prize has been deleted as it is no longer awarded and there are no living former winners. In addition, a number of small corrections have been made to existing prize names and the order they are listed in the tables.

5.44 The list will be kept under review and may be revised in future updates to the Immigration Rules.

Changes to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)

5.45 The EUSS in Appendix EU enables EU, other European Economic Area and Swiss citizens living in the UK before the end of the post-EU exit transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020, and their family members, to obtain the immigration status they need to continue living in the UK.

5.46 The changes clarify the drafting of the change made from 16 July 2025 by Statement of Changes HC 836, enabling a holder of pre-settled status under the EUSS to be granted settled status where they have been resident in the UK for at least 30 months in total in the most recent 60-month period. They also bring the grounds for cancelling pre-settled status on or before the holder’s arrival in the UK into line with those for curtailing it in-country, so that, where proportionate, this can be based on the fact that the person never met, as well as where they have ceased to meet, the requirements of Appendix EU.

Deletion of obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa.

5.47 This change will delete obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa. Applications for entry clearance or for leave to remain cannot be made after 6 July 2025. Given that 6 July 2025 has passed, these Rules, which only apply to entry clearance and leave to remain applications, are no longer needed. It remains possible for those already in the route to apply for indefinite leave to remain until 6 July 2027, where they previously held leave as a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur). Related changes have also been made to delete general requirements for points-based system routes in Part 6A of the Rules.

Changes to Appendix Sports Governing Bodies

5.48 These changes reflect the fact that British Kendo Association and Great Britain Wheelchair Rugby have met the requirements to become Home Office Approved Sports Governing Bodies.

Changes to Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes

5.49 These changes update the names of two visa schemes following requests from the endorsing government departments, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business and Trade, of each scheme. These changes also delete the Khebrat Leadership for Change Programme scheme endorsed by the Department for Education as the scheme is no longer in use.

Changes to Appendix Child Student - Safeguarding

5.50 A nominated guardian is a carer that looks after a Child Student for less than 28 continuous days and is not a close relative. The definition of nominated guardian in the introduction section of the Immigration Rules requires the length of care to be less than 28 days. This has been amended to clarify that the 28 days must be continuous days. The definition has also been expanded to include guardians that care for Child Students during periods of term-time. These amendments have also been reflected within Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules.

5.51 A new definition has been added to the introduction section of the Immigration Rules to describe a guardianship organisation, which is now mentioned in Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules, as a company that arranges a nominated guardian for a Child Student.

5.52 Clarifications are being made to paragraph CS5A.2 and CS5A.3 regarding those living with a nominated guardian. The Child Student’s application can be refused if their nominated guardian regularly lives with someone that has a criminal conviction. This has been amended so that this only applies if the person living with the nominated guardian is an adult. This clarifies that the rule does not apply to children.

5.53 Certain requirements are applied to ensure children have safe living arrangements. The ‘living arrangement requirement’ has been amended to clarify the permitted living arrangements on the route, including that as a boarding student you are able to stay with a parent who has permission as a Parent of a Child Student, if the Child Student is over 12 years of age and the parent is caring for their younger sibling who holds permission as a Child Student. The different types of boarding arrangements (flexi, weekly, and full boarding) have now been amalgamated under a single boarding category for simplicity when reading the rules and to formalise a concessionary arrangement permitting flexi and weekly boarders to be in the care of a nominated guardian when they are not staying at school.

5.54 A new paragraph has been added to Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules to cover the information guardianship organisations need to provide where an applicant does not have the details of their nominated guardian at the point where they apply for permission on the Child Student route. A new paragraph has also been added for this scenario so the named contact from the guardianship organisation must be British or Settled in the UK.

5.55 Paragraph CS9.4(g) has been amended to explain details that we require to be listed on the letter of undertaking relating to adults that regularly live with a nominated guardian.

Student Route Maintenance Requirement Annual Uplift

5.56 There is a maintenance requirement for student applicants to demonstrate they have funds to support themselves for each month of their course (up to 9 months). This level of funds is aligned with the maintenance loans available for home students, which is reviewed every year. This change increases the maintenance requirement to match the maintenance loans available for home students for the 2025/2026 academic year. We will ensure it continues to align with home students’ maintenance loans in future.

5.57 We have updated the maximum amount for the accommodation offset in line with the changes to the maintenance requirement. The accommodation offset allows students to demonstrate less maintenance funds if they have paid a deposit for their accommodation in the UK.

Changes to the continuous residence rules

5.58 Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and Tier 1 (Investor) are being added to the list of provisions to which Appendix Continuous Residence applies, as part of changes to Part 6A of the Immigration Rules. The rule concerning the breaking of continuous residence is also being corrected.

Changes to align drafting across the Immigration Rules

5.59 Minor changes are being made to align the drafting across the Immigration Rules. These are not policy changes and are minor presentational changes that are intended to provide greater transparency, clarity, and consistency.

Other drafting changes

5.60 The Statement of Changes also introduces minor drafting changes to correct incorrect paragraph references and minor errors. It also clarifies and amends technical points relating to occupation tables in the changes laid on 1 July 2025 (HC 997).

6. Legislative and legal context

How has the law changed?

6.1 The Immigration Rules, as laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State, constitute a statement of practice to be followed in the administration of the Immigration Act 1971 for regulating the entry into, and stay of, persons in the United Kingdom.

6.2 This Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules will be incorporated into a consolidated version of the Immigration Rules. This can be found on the GOV.UK website, where all the Statements of Changes in Immigration Rules issued since May 1994 are published.

6.3 The changes will be implemented on various dates from 14 October 2025 as detailed in the implementation section of the accompanying Statement of Changes.

6.4 For the changes that introduce a visa requirement on Botswana, those changes will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025. The changes regarding appendix HPI, will come into effect on 4 November 2025, the changes relating to Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route come into effect on 25 November 2025 and the changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes will come into effect on 8 January 2026. All other changes will come into effect on 11 November 2025 and are detailed in the implementation section of the Statement of Changes.

Why was this approach taken to change the law?

6.5 This is the only possible approach to make the necessary changes.

7. Consultation

Summary of consultation outcome and methodology

7.1 The specific changes in this Statement have not been the subject of a formal public consultation, as this would be disproportionate given the nature of the changes.

8. Applicable Guidance

8.1 Guidance relating to these Rules changes will be updated and placed on the GOV.UK website when these changes take effect.

8.2 It is our practice to only publish guidance updates when Rules changes take effect to mitigate the high risk of users referring to the wrong version.

Part Two: Impact and the Better Regulation Framework

9. Impact Assessment

9.1 A full Impact Assessment for the changes that relates to the various White Paper changes made in this Statement of Changes will be published alongside the Explanatory Memorandum and Statement of Changes on the Gov.uk website.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

9.2 The Graduate route changes are expected to have a modest impact on Student visa demand. It is provisionally estimated a long-term reduction of approximately 12,000 Student visa applications per annum. Short-term impacts may also arise following the announcement. Financial implications include reduced visa fee and Immigration Health Surcharge revenue, with provisional estimates of £27m from the Student route and £23m from the Graduate route.

Other changes

9.3 Although there is a degree of impact as a result of the changes being made, a full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the changes listed below because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for producing an Impact Assessment or Economic Note:

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

9.4 The changes are likely to have a meaningful impact on the public sector. High volumes of asylum claims, if left unchecked, can represent significant cost to the public sector, though overall costs for this population would be a small proportion of overall asylum costs.

9.5 As a result of a visa introduction on nationals of Botswana, there may be an impact on the number of genuine visitors coming from Botswana to the UK due to the requirement to obtain a visa before travel.

9.6 These changes therefore may represent a meaningful indirect impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. The ONS estimated that in 2023, on average, nationals from Botswana arriving by air spent £983 per visit to the UK. Any reduction in spending resulting from a reduction in visitors to the UK is likely to represent a cost to business through a reduction in revenue.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

9.7 The impact of the agreement on Border Force is assessed as low. It is possible that Border Force may experience minor fluidity issues due to the intended increase in German school group travel to the UK, but steps will be taken to mitigate this. The impact of the agreement on border security is low due to the robust authentication measures in place and the low-risk cohort involved.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

9.8 An Impact Assessment was prepared for the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme more broadly and was published on 26 November 2024, following the laying in Parliament of the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules setting out the associated changes. No further economic impacts, beyond those set out in the already published impact assessment, have been identified as a result of these changes.

All other changes

9.9 A full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the other changes in this instrument because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for doing so.

Impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies

9.10 For all other changes there is no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies.

9.11 For all other changes the legislation does not impact small or micro businesses.

9.12 For all other changes there is no, or no significant impact on the public sector.

10. Monitoring and review

What is the approach to monitoring and reviewing this legislation?

10.1 The approach to the monitoring of these changes is to review the operation and effect of all the relevant Immigration Rules, including any Rules amended or added to by the changes in this Statement, and lay a report before Parliament within five years of 6 April 2017, and within every five years after that. Following each review, the Secretary of State will decide whether the relevant Immigration Rules should remain unchanged or be revoked or amended. A further Statement of Changes would be needed to revoke or amend the relevant Rules.

10.2 A statutory review clause is included in the instrument.

Part Three: Statements and Matters of Particular Interest to Parliament

11. Matters of special interest to Parliament

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

11.1 The changes to introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Botswana will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025, and therefore depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament.

11.2 Controlling migration and securing our borders are Home Office priorities. After deciding to introduce a visit or transit visa requirement, it is necessary and reasonable to implement this as quickly as possible. The rationale for breaching the 21-day rule is that prior notification of implementation of a visa requirement could trigger a substantial increase in nationals of Botswana impacted by this change travelling to the UK prior to the visa requirement coming into effect, triggering an unpredictable and unmanageable strain upon the UK’s migration and borders system. This action continues to respect our international obligations.

11.3 Immediate implementation of a visa requirement is accompanied by a six-week transition period to prevent general unfairness and to mitigate the risk that people who arranged travel to the UK prior to the introduction of the visa requirement suffer a financial loss. Additionally, this period prevents serious operational difficulties. This approach has been successful on previous occasions and the Government is clear that implementing changes in this way is necessary and proportionate to protect the UK immigration system from abuse.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

11.4 Unlike previous changes that introduce a visit visa requirement, for this particular change, it is not necessary to depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament. This is for the reasons set out in section 5 above.

11.5 For all other changes there are no matters of interest.

12. European Convention on Human Rights

12.1 As this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules is subject to negative resolution procedure and does not amend primary legislation, no statement is required.

13. The relevant European Union Acts

13.1 This instrument is not being made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (“relevant European Union Acts”). It does, however, relate to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union because it supports further implementation of the EUSS.

13.2 For all other changes, this instrument does not relate to withdrawal from the European Union or trigger the statement requirements under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

14. Consolidation

14.1 The Government has committed to the consolidation of the Rules as part of its response to the Law Commission recommendations on simplifying the Immigration Rules.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-10-14 11:58:44.091722

The village of Broadview sued to have the eight-foot fence removed, saying it posed a public safety hazard because it blocks emergency responders.

Attorneys for the federal government argued the fencing is needed for business and to protect vehicles and personnel.

Illinois legislators gathered outside the Broadview ice facility yesterday in opposition of the immigration crackdown, and calling for the fencing to come down immediately.

""Mr. Trump, tear down this fence now. Tear it down,"" said Democratic Speaker Illinois House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, who represents the 7th District.

In suburban Chicago last month, a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball into the head of a Presbyterian pastor as he prayed outside an ICE facility. Another ICE agent fatally shot a Mexican immigrant in Illinois. Also last month, in New York City, an ICE officer was removed from duty after he was captured on video forcibly shoving a woman to the ground outside an immigration court. Meanwhile, earlier this month, ICE agents conducted a military-style raid on a South Side Chicago apartment building, detaining hundreds of residents, many of whom are U.S.-born children.

On Thursday, after Chicago journalists and protestors sued the federal government alleging “extreme brutality” from agents on the ground, a federal judge in Illinois blocked federal agents from using force or threatening to arrest journalists.

Sandweg worked at the Department of Homeland Security for five years, spending four years as legal counsel. He capped off his DHS tenure with a one-year term leading the nation’s immigration enforcement agency from 2013-2014.

Immigration has always been one of the most polarizing and political fields of law enforcement, Sandweg concedes. But, he adds, it’s become even more polarizing now.

In a wide-ranging interview, Sandweg also expressed concern that ICE wouldn’t be able to adequately train the rapidly expanding ICE workforce and got candid about one of the most divisive trends at the agency: “I hate that the agents are wearing the masks,” he said.

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

We’re seeing ICE agents display really heavy-handed use of force, smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, smoke bombing people, pepper spraying. Has ICE ever been this aggressive before?

Obviously, I don’t think we’ve ever seen a nationwide immigration enforcement effort like this. During the Obama administration, we did a large number of nationwide operations, but they’re very targeted. They’re the kind of work where you’re going after specific individuals, people that you knew had a criminal history. They were carefully selected. There was a lot of research and investigation done before you went out to make the actual arrest. These are much more akin to area sweeps, where they’re going out and just stopping people in the streets, or working in conjunction with other law enforcement as they execute traffic stops, or hitting a large number of apartments in a building where you suspect people are undocumented. We’ve never seen anything like this. I mean, the deployment of FBI agents and other law enforcement agents to supplement DHS efforts, the pulling of these border patrol agents into these urban cities. All of this is unprecedented.

In my experience, most ICE agents do their jobs. They do, and they treat people with dignity and respect. I know we’ve seen some incidents where that hasn’t been true. And I think that’s attributable to a lot of things. I think it’s because the agents are under tremendous pressure. They’ve been under a lot of pressure to ratchet up the number of arrests. They’ve been forced to adopt some of these more aggressive tactics, because the [Trump] administration seems more interested in the quantity of people arrested, more so than the quality. It’s not like we’re seeing those more surgical operations, where you might arrest fewer people, but they have a more serious criminal history. You’re seeing just large numbers of arrested people who have been here a long time, people who have U.S. citizen family members.

And then some of the incidents, I think, have been unfortunate reactions to the protests. This nationwide sweep of people who are not just criminal aliens, it’s triggered a lot of civil unrest, public protests, and I think, unfortunately, you’ve seen some aggressive tactics in dealing with it.

It’s not always clear to me whether it’s ICE, border patrol or even what’s called Federal Protective Service, the law enforcement DHS agency that protects federal buildings. If it’s immigration related, it just gets the ICE moniker.

This kind of enforcement is much more widespread, too, than what we’ve seen before. Tell me a little bit about the Trump administration’s emphasis on quantity over quality of arrests. That seems like a very marked shift from how previous administrations have handled and deployed immigration enforcement.

Even compared to the first Trump administration, you didn’t see anything like this. What we have seen is that immigration enforcement has become probably the central priority for all U.S. law enforcement, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense. This executive order has elevated this to the highest priority. I’ve never seen a whole government effort focused like this, even in the State Department. As a result of that, we’ve never seen an immigration enforcement effort like this. And that manifests itself in a lot of different ways, really quickly.

When you’re at ICE, of course you can run down to a Home Depot parking lot. Any administration could have done this: round the Home Depot parking lot, stop a bunch of day laborers and ID them. In car washes, in places where low-wage workers work, places like that. The reason that historically hasn’t been done, is you just don’t find criminals there. Once in a blue moon you find someone, and we see that the administration highlights when they get someone who has some criminal history. But by and large, your really serious criminal threats don’t do shifts at the local car wash for minimum wage. They’re out making their money, making a living as a criminal.

And so ICE has always focused our operations on getting those individuals — that takes more time, though. You’re taking lists of people who are criminally convicted and you’re identifying them, and then once you identify them, you’re doing research on addresses, and then you’re building a dossier and sending a team out to get them. The Obama administration deported a large number of people, but generally, a very high percentage of them were people who either just crossed the border or people with a serious criminal history.

This administration, though, is taking a different tack. This administration has repurposed the way they’ve operationalized ICE — to go out and get as many people as possible, and that’s why we’re seeing these raids on the car washes and on the Home Depot parking lots. They know they can make a large number of arrests there, and they don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety. They just say, “If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.”

It seems like this agency is much more politicized now than it’s ever been.

Immigration has always been the most politicized law enforcement work. Certainly during my time at DHS, the goal was always to just do our job, and the politics will take care of itself. Focus on the worst of the worst. Get the bad guys off the streets. Everything else will work out. It certainly seems to me that this administration has steered into the political debate. That’s unfortunate, because ICE has become this political football that makes it really hard for the agency to do its job. And it’ll make it really hard in years to come for the agency to do its job.

ICE is expanding, and has poured money into recruiting efforts. It’s looking to double its ranks, and it’s also expanding its units. So what guardrails can ICE place to properly train all of these new employees?

That’s a real concern. It begins with the recruitment. The first concern would be, let’s hope ICE doesn’t lower their standards. This administration is going to want to get as many of these new agents out in the field as quickly as possible. Normally, to hire this many people, it would take the agency three, four years.

The problem is that the agency only has the capacity to do so many background checks at once, to interview so many people at once. The training academy can only train so many people at once. It would take years to fully deploy these agents. This administration clearly doesn’t want to wait. They want to get people out there as quickly as possible. Now, some of what they’re doing makes some sense: They’re recruiting heavily from local law enforcement, other law enforcement agencies, offering signing bonuses and things. But the concern here would be, to the extent to which the administration wants to get these people deployed quickly, do they cut corners? I worry that if you start cutting corners on standards or background checks or training, that it’s only a recipe for problems down the line.

Official DHS policy requires ICE agents to use only the level of force that is “objectively reasonable,” and that’s not concretely defined. What is reasonable? From your experience, I’d love to hear how agents are trained to apply force and what they’re trained to recognize.

Just to keep it simple, the use of force needs to be commensurate with the threat that’s presented your way. It does seem to me that a lot of the episodes where [use of force] certainly seemed to push the line involved other agencies. A lot of them were Border Patrol related.

The hard part, and the reason why I’m always hesitant to question use of force, is that I just don’t know what the agents knew. This apartment building in Chicago, I don’t know what information they had before they went into the apartment building. Operations where it looks heavy-handed, but maybe they have good intel that says a violent, dangerous gang member is in the house. In a case like that, a ton of force is appropriate, if not necessary. But if it’s just a routine immigration operation, wearing the tactical gear and aggressively shoving people against walls and using long arms and some of these things certainly strikes me as excessive. But it’s hard to judge.

Speaking of Chicago, a Mexican immigrant was fatally shot by an ICE agent there in late September. And then last month in Dallas, we saw a shooter open fire at an ICE facility. This seems like such an uptick in violence, both coming from and directed at ICE. Have you seen this level of violence before? Or is this a new kind of escalation?

No, I’ve never seen it. The number one rule: You have to keep the agents safe. One thing that is tough for someone like me, having worked with people at ICE, is that they bear the brunt of people’s frustration with the administration’s policies. The agents have a duty to execute the president’s policies.

Unfortunately, there have been some psychopaths out there — the shooting in Dallas, absolutely horrific. The number of assaults, the uptick is real. There have been increased numbers of assaults, and as the officers do some of these operations, there’s rock throwing, the shooting in Dallas, all of that is real. It’s just a very unfortunate time we’re in. While I fully respect everyone’s right to protest these actions, you also have to make sure the agents themselves are safe.

I understand why it’s happening, but it’s not the agents who are crafting these policies. In my experience, most of these agents signed up with the agency because they want to make a difference in terms of making the country safer. But unfortunately, they do bear the brunt of this. But no, I’ve not seen this level of assaults on the agents themselves.

Why is this happening? Is it just because ICE is extending its reach?

Because it’s become such a symbol of the administration. I think that if people were asked to define what the Trump administration stands for, immigration enforcement would be top one or two. ICE has become the symbol of the administration, and that’s what makes it an attractive target for people.

And what about these headlines about violence and the use of force coming from ICE agents as well?

I think the whole thing has become so politically charged. It increases agitation, it makes it more likely that somebody crazy is going to try to assault an officer. I think as a result of that, the agents probably are more defensive than they otherwise would be. And more aggressive in terms of taking steps to protect their safety. It’s a difficult situation, and I don’t envy the officers at all. They’re in a very tough position.

And on this topic of officer safety, civil rights groups have raised alarms about agent masking. ICE’s current acting director, Todd Lyons, has justified agents concealing their identities, masking their faces — pointing out what you just mentioned, this increased risk of doxxing, threats, abuse and violence against officers.

It was never an issue. I spent five years at DHS working on ICE issues. It just wasn’t an issue. None of the officers felt the need to wear masks. I think it’s an unfortunate byproduct of the administration’s policies. This is a very contentious area of law, this idea that we’re not going to discern the difference between migrants who might be committing serious crimes and those who might have real long-term presence in the United States, young children and family members and things of that nature.

I hate that the agents are wearing the masks. I think it is hurting the reputation of the agency, and feeding a lot of these narratives about the agency. But I’m also sympathetic to the agents themselves, who need to protect themselves and their families. Like we just talked about, there are these upticks, these massive upticks in assaults on the agents. These threats against the agents are real, and there’s, unfortunately, a lot of people out there who can’t discern the difference between the administration and the policymakers and the agents themselves. And as a result of that, these agents feel compelled to take steps to protect themselves and their family, and I’m sympathetic to it.

Just to clarify, the decision to wear a mask, is that an individual choice? Is that coming from the agent, or is that an organization-wide policy?

My recollection, there was no policy on it. I don’t think this administration is requiring them to wear masks. There’s just no policy in place that restricts use of masks.

We’ve talked about how ICE has changed so much under the current administration, but looking back from when you were with DHS and looking at reports of activity now, and what we’re seeing on the ground, how has ICE’s work changed in the past decade?

Two big things have changed that are really significant. The first is the border. ICE has a responsibility to take people into custody who are not from Mexico, if they’re apprehended at the border. All these asylum seekers, ICE has the responsibility of detaining them, processing them through immigration court and supervising them if they were released. Since right about the time I left DHS in 2014, that’s when the border numbers really started picking up. And that has really overwhelmed ICE for 10 years. Detention beds were full of people from the border. It limited ICE’s ability to do much else on the interior of the United States.

Beginning with Biden in June of last year, the numbers at the border started declining dramatically. Those declining numbers frees up ICE, it starts to have more additional resources to rededicate to interior enforcement. And then the Trump administration comes in.

Are we seeing a brand-new shift in ICE’s mission and directive?

I wouldn’t say it’s a shift, this has always been a key part of ICE’s mission. What’s different is who they’re targeting. Under Obama, under Biden and even to a certain extent, under the first Trump administration, there were priorities. The agents were told, “Focus first on the worst. Worst first. Get the worst bad guys off the street first, we’ll deal with everything else later.” Those rules are gone.

Where do we go from here? How do we de-escalate?

Look, the country needs to pass immigration reform. We revert back to ICE’s more traditional tactics of focusing on “the absolute worst first.” This is a difficult question that the country has struggled with. We have people in this country for 15, 20 years who have been out of status, and in that time they’ve had children, they’ve married U.S. citizens, they’ve integrated themselves, they’ve gone to church, made friends with people at work. They’ve just integrated themselves in society.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe4%2Fa0%2F02aac149428dbbe452f8dfc72e50%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2224603707,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:17.233304
,Agencies,2025-10-14 13:55:45+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,ICE's use of full-body restraints during deportations raises concerns over inhumane treatment,Not Available,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/ice-restraints-the-wrap-deportations/,"The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer's CEO, argues.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as ""the burrito"" or ""the bag,"" the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

""It was just like a kidnapping,"" the Nigerian man, who's part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined ""restraint"" played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates' concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP's California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP's manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

""They bundled me and my colleagues,"" he said, ""tied us up in a straitjacket.""

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government's policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

""The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,"" Tricia McLaughlin, DHS' spokesperson, said in an email to AP. ""Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.""

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

""The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation's fundamental values,"" said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE's version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject's cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has ""soft elbow cuffs,"" Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can't flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

""That's not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it's not, then restraints aren't.""

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into ""a bag"" in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he'd be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else's name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the ""bag"" and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the ""bag."" The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda's video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

""Eight hours there and back and they don't give me food or water or anything,"" he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. ""Please help me.""

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda's case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president's deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government's own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren't trained on how to use the restraints.

""This should be a last resort type of restraint after they've already tried other things,"" said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. ""Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.""

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

""No one should be put into a WRAP. I don't even think they strap animals like that,"" recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP's review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

""It was the most painful thing I've been through,"" said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. ""Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.""

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. ""When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.""

ICE's current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE's use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a ""four-point restraint,"" a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

""Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE's continued use of the WRAP,"" wrote the report's authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP's exact role is unknown, Hill's death was ruled a homicide by ""positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression."" Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who'd also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a ""spit mask"" covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn't breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that ""restraint"" played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject's hands and feet together in a practice known as ""hog-tying."" It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents' home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena's death ""accidental,"" but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena's death in part to the WRAP's ""prolonged restraint"" and said it ""could have been averted"" with proper medical care.

""The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,"" said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena's family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff's Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP ""was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena's tragic death."" He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family's lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer's CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP's use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

""With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it's a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,"" Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond's restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

""They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,"" he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He'd fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

""I told him 'I can't breathe,'"" the man said. ""He responded, 'I don't care, I'm doing my job.'""

He wants his west suburban community to know that ICE agents assaulted and detained American citizens on private property last week.

What we know:

Forest Park Mayor Rory E. Hoskins provided cell phone video showing federal agents demanding to be let into Concordia Cemetery, and the vapor of chemicals deployed on four cemetery workers.

One of the workers told Fox 32 they heard a man in distress in the Des Plaines River on October 7.

When they looked into it, federal agents demanded access to the locked cemetery. The agents were told it was private property.

The agents cut the lock on the gate and, according to the workers, deployed pepper spray, body slammed, and cuffed them for five hours.

""What happened to me and my co-workers was alarming and it reminded me of how important it is we all uphold the constitution,"" said Darren Eichler, one of the workers.

Hoskins met with the men about their experience.

""It’s an indication of poor training or just bad intentions on the part of ICE,"" the mayor said.

What they're saying:

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents were trying to rescue the two men from the nearby Des Plaines River.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement:

""Despite the agitation and lack of help from local government, ICE successfully arrested both illegal aliens, including Martin Martinez Guereca, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, previously convicted of assault in 2004, and Jaime Arturo Martinez Rojas, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico with previous arrests for drug possession and driving under the influence. The four U.S. citizens who obstructed law enforcement from the rescue operation were arrested.""

Also on Monday, DHS said in a post on X that its so-called Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,500 people in the Chicago area.

The four workers are still unsure of the allegations.

""These are not public figures,"" Hoskins said. ""These are private men who work in a cemetery. They suffered a very traumatic incident, detained for hours at a time, maced, dehumanized, taunted and here they are back in our community, and we want to make sure they feel protected.""

Three workers were released from a facility in Lombard.

The hospitalized worker was treated and released from an area hospital.

The Democratic lawmaker said he had arrived to conduct official oversight amid reports of detentions, just days after video surfaced showing ICE officers forcefully restraining a 15-year-old from his district in Hoffman Estates. Despite his congressional authority, ICE officials denied him access to the site.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” said Krishnamoorthi. “Once again, the Trump Administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability. Congress and the American people have every right to see what’s happening behind those walls.”

“This is Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, I have former Congressman Luis Gutiérrez with me, under section 527 of the appropriations law I am entitled to be able to inspect,” Krishnamoorthi could be heard saying on the phone call before the facility’s staff member interrupted him on the video posted on X.

Tuesday’s incident marks the second time in recent months that Krishnamoorthi has been denied access to an ICE facility.

In June, he and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were blocked from visiting a Chicago detention center while attempting to review conditions and obtain details about those being held.

Krishnamoorthi warned that such repeated refusals to permit lawful oversight erode transparency at a moment when federal immigration enforcement has sharply escalated under “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation drive targeting Democratic-led cities.

Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who’s part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP’s California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP’s manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government’s policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation’s fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE’s version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject’s cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can’t flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

“That’s not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it’s not, then restraints aren’t.”

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 10:57:31.702945

But the gathering storm of a wider military deployment to Chicago with full arrest power is being considered by the White House and talked up publicly by the president, especially since Justice Department attorneys lost several legal cases here in the past week.

There were controllable skirmish lines last weekend handled by state police troopers in front of the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The operation was conducted by police without help from National Guard troopers sent in by the president. Soldiers last week were ordered by the courts here to disengage -orders being appealed by the White House.

""Our ICE agents, the people who are enforcing our immigration laws, have faced a 1,000% increase in violent attacks against them,” Vice President JD Vance said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday morning. “They're being assaulted. They're being beaten. They're being shot at. The problem here is not the Insurrection Act or whether we actually invoke it or not. The problem is the fact that the entire media in this country, cheered on by a few far-left lunatics, have made it okay to tee off on American law enforcement.""

If Trump invokes the Insurrection Act of 1807, most legal barriers to military use in Chicago would disappear; the president claiming a rebellion is underway here and soldiers could then assume regular police duties, including arresting people.

Northwestern University Law School professor and constitutional expert Paul Gowder told NBC 5 Investigates the use of the Insurrection Act despite stern objections by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is concerning.

“I think that it would set up a really stark conflict between the president's use of troops and our traditional understanding of the autonomy of state governments in local law enforcement that I think would be challenging,"" Gowder said.

An Insurrection Act declaration would allow the president to send in units from any service branch, including the Marines, and to employ the Air Force, regular Army or put together a federal militia, according to Syracuse Law School professor emeritus William Banks.

""They could start enforcing curfews. They could tell people to stay in their homes. They could close doors,” Banks said. “It's not martial law, but it's one step toward martial law.""

The last time the Insurrection Act was used in the United States was 1992 in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, when LA officials asked for help.

And NBC Chicago has found that the Insurrection Act has been previously imposed on Chicago.

In 1894 - during the infamous Pullman Co. labor strike that had paralyzed the nation's rail system. Then-President Grover Cleveland sent in 2000 U.S. Army troops to break the union and stop deadly riots. And just as we are seeing in 2025, there was fierce opposition to federal soldiers from then-Chicago Mayor John Hopkins and then-Illinois Gov. John Altgeld.

""We don't talk about it very much in history classes for whatever reason,” said Northwestern Law’s Gowder. “But this extensive pattern is called the Labor Wars sometimes by historians because it turned into something that looked a lot like warfare.""

The use of the Insurrection Act and deployment of federal troops in Chicago more than 130 years ago is one of just a few dozen times in American history that it’s been used-most often to control unchecked uprisings and raging citywide riots. Presidents have great latitude to use it without oversight, unchecked by congressional review - but possibly checked by the judicial system. Legal experts say the courts can review after deployment if there are allegations a president ""acted in bad faith.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/efe_ba2ab246b270a0798863e310c7b8acac28dc6bc4w.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-14 13:58:02.010257
,Policy,2025-10-14 13:27:06+00:00,The Hill,"Depredations of congressional authority dominate, from Obama to Trump - The Hill",Chris Stirewalt,,,,,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5553150-obamacare-lawsuit-congress-executive/,"In 2014, Congress sued the executive branch over the president’s refusal to enforce the law.
Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots.
But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law?
Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?
Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress.","In 2014, Congress sued the executive branch over the president’s refusal to enforce the law. It was kind of a mind-bender because the majority in Congress hated the law that wasn’t being enforced — ObamaCare — and had repeatedly tried to kill it entirely.

But there we were: U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, in which the Republican-controlled House sued over the failure to implement provisions of then-President Obama’s signature health insurance law that the same lawmakers who brought the suit said would cripple businesses by requiring large employers to provide insurance for workers.

Another, more obvious, claim from Republicans was that the administration was using a kind of slush fund in the Treasury Department to pay subsidies to insurance companies that hadn’t been included in the original legislation passed by Democrats alone four years earlier.

Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots. There were all kinds of lawsuits from states and organizations over specific provisions, notably the requirement that policies from religious groups still had to cover birth control and that very pricey employer mandate. But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law? Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?

That question of prosecutorial discretion was a hot one just then. The day before the lawsuit was filed in November — which was just weeks after Democrats had taken a terrible drubbing in the midterms — Obama had unleashed a raft of executive orders to shield as many as 5 million migrants without legal status from deportation and grant them a path to citizenship. Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress. His ObamaCare moves and, more significantly, immigration decrees were pretty clearly meant to be understood as putting Republicans on notice that he would go it alone.

Democrats called the suit a stunt, and the party and the health care industry came down hard on the case, including scaring off the big law firm that had initially agreed to take it. Even some on the right who coveted executive power for themselves opposed the suit. Then, there were the political calculations. What if the House won and employers got crushed by mandates and customers saw their premiums skyrocket?

But House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) plowed ahead anyway.

“If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well,” he said. “The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.”

Remember that this was back when Democrats were very fond of the Roberts court’s deference to executive authority. The decision he wrote upholding the mandates as a “tax” had vaulted Chief Justice John Roberts into the firmament with Earl Warren and David Souter as the kind of Republican-appointed justice whom Democrats could love. Strange new respect was all around.

When a lower court judge appointed by former President George W. Bush threw out the part of the suit about enforcement but let the part about the slush fund proceed, the White House responded by calling it “just another partisan attack” and vowed to win on appeal. But the case went ahead, and in May of 2016, the judge ruled that “Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.”

Had Hillary Clinton won that year’s presidential election as was expected at the time, the case would have certainly landed in the high court and we might have seen what could have been the biggest case on the separation of powers in decades. But she did not win, and new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) swiftly came to terms with the incoming Trump administration to drop the suit because the new president would eliminate the dubious payments.

It was a smart play for Ryan because there was little sense in risking what could have been a ruling against congressional authority over a program that he, and most in Washington, believed would not survive the first year of the new administration.

As it turned out, everyone was wrong again. ObamaCare not only survived, but we are at this very moment watching Republicans discuss how long to extend extra subsidies passed in 2021 as a pandemic boost. Should it be for one more year or a $415 billion outlay to cover the next decade?

Obama was right about the premise of his executive overreaches. If he could just keep the program running long enough to get a critical mass of enrollments, it would become unrepealable from a political point of view.

Thanks in part to shifting partisan coalitions, Republicans are very much dependent on the working-class voters who like the expanded Medicaid benefits and the well-off older Americans who use ObamaCare to bridge the gap between employer insurance and Medicare.

Just as these subsidies will be extended, you can bet that one day Republicans will undo this year’s Medicaid cuts they craftily delayed until after the midterms. They took the revenue now for cuts that probably won’t ever fully go into effect. “Repeal and replace” has become “preserve and expand.”

But Boehner was right, too. One president got away with making his own laws, and future presidents have indeed done the same.

In the current funding fight, the power of Congress is to inflict pain by refusing to appropriate funds. And on the list of pain points in a shutdown, none surpass the troops going unpaid.

But by quiet, bipartisan assent, that’s being taken off the table as the president just moves some money around to make payroll. Just add that to the list of laws the president either just ignores or skirts, from the unilateral declaration of war against drug cartels to the TikTok ban.

Nicola",,,,,https://www.justsecurity.org/122485/when-deference-is-no-longer-due/,"In the recent cases challenging the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly argued that the courts should defer to the president’s determination that protests against ICE activity in those cities has rendered the government “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” and constitutes a form of “rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” – two of the possible conditions to federalization under 10 U.S.C.
The courts have rightly pushed back on such blind deference, with the 9th Circuit rejecting the DOJ’s argument that the president’s determination is unreviewable.
While not deferring completely to the president, courts have nevertheless given DOJ significant deference, in accordance with how they have historically treated the president’s determinations regarding exigencies that threaten national security or involve foreign policy.
Even applying such deference, however, lower courts have concluded, at least preliminarily, that the president’s determination about the situation in U.S. cities where he has sought to deploy the National Guard does not reflect “a colorable assessment of the facts and law within a ‘range of honest judgment.’” This hesitation to defer to the president’s determination is warranted, not only because, in the words of Judge Karin Immergut in the Oregon case, that presidential determination was “simply untethered to the facts,” but also because the reasons for historical deference to the judgment of the Executive Branch in matters of national security and foreign policy have been severely undermined during the first eight months of the Trump administration.
Deference to the president based on his superior access to intelligence information provided by seasoned intelligence analysts and counterterrorism and counterintelligence experts is no longer warranted where: (1) many of these experts have been fired or stripped of their security clearances for political and retaliatory reasons; (2) presidential determinations have been contrary to the considered assessments of the intelligence community (for example, contrary to Trump administration claims regarding the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TDA), the declassified National Intelligence Council assessment that “the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in theUnited States”); and (3) the administration has pushed the envelope on compliance with court orders and then sought to shield itself from review by invoking deference in matters of foreign policy and national security.","In the recent cases challenging the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly argued that the courts should defer to the president’s determination that protests against ICE activity in those cities has rendered the government “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” and constitutes a form of “rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” – two of the possible conditions to federalization under 10 U.S.C. § 12406.

Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who’s part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP’s California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP’s manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government’s policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation’s fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE’s version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject’s cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can’t flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

“That’s not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it’s not, then restraints aren’t.”

‘Please help me’

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into “a bag” in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he’d be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else’s name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the “bag” and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the “bag.” The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda’s video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

“Eight hours there and back and they don’t give me food or water or anything,” he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. “Please help me.”

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda’s case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president’s deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government’s own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren’t trained on how to use the restraints.

“This should be a last resort type of restraint after they’ve already tried other things,” said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. “Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.”

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

“No one should be put into a WRAP. I don’t even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP’s review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I’ve been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.”

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE’s current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE’s continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report’s authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Use by police and in jails

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP’s exact role is unknown, Hill’s death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who’d also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject’s hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents’ home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena’s death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena’s death in part to the WRAP’s “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena’s family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff’s Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena’s tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family’s lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

‘Carrying me like a corpse’

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer’s CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP’s use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it’s a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond’s restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them on Oct. 9, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across the Chicagoland region have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump Administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

The protest organizer group, Protect Rogers Park, posted on Facebook: “Today 400+ Rogers Parkers gathered to mourn, celebrate, defy authoritarianism, (canvass) and recommit to loving their neighbors. Oh, and buy a lot of tacos.”

“There’s no appetite for immigration legislation at all,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The American economy relies heavily on H-1B visas, with the number of people applying for slots vastly outnumbering those which are available each year.
Almost a year ago, the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk was touting high-skilled immigration throughout the United States through H-1B visas, saying they were necessary to help fuel innovation.","The recent presidential proclamation forcing employers to pay $100,000 to hire workers under H-1B visas — a move designed to incentivize domestic hiring practices — is instilling fear and confusion inside hospitals and universities that rely on the program. It also has sent a jolt through the Senate, where the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee recently reintroduced legislation designed to strengthen the rules for the program and prioritize applicants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.

“We need an immigration bill, badly,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a cosponsor of the bill who is working to get fellow conservatives on board with the effort. He’s also running for governor of a state with multiple major research universities.

“I think Trump, perhaps inadvertently, is strengthening our case for the bill,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another co-sponsor of the legislation.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, however, are skeptical there is sufficient political will to make any meaningful progress on the issue. Immigration hard-liners still occupy senior positions throughout the White House and hold power on Capitol Hill; Trump has waffled on the question of whether the H-1B policy is worth preserving; and at least one key Democrat says any conservative enthusiasm now to tackle the program is too little, too late.

“There’s no appetite for immigration legislation at all,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is set to retire in 2027 with little to show for his work over nearly three decades in office to pass legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.

The American economy relies heavily on H-1B visas, with the number of people applying for slots vastly outnumbering those which are available each year. And this is not the first time lawmakers have seen a glimmer of hope around efforts to overhaul the program — only to later see it fade.

Almost a year ago, the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk was touting high-skilled immigration throughout the United States through H-1B visas, saying they were necessary to help fuel innovation. Trump, who suspended the program during his first term, suddenly appeared ready to side with Musk, lauding the initiative that he claimed to have leveraged for his own business interests.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a MAGA stalwart and Musk acolyte, also signaled an openness to revisiting the H-1B system from his perch as chair of the House Judiciary Committee.

But Musk has since that time had a public falling-out with the president, and anti-immigration hawks like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have Trump’s ear. Trump’s new H-1B visa fee is a reflection of the administration’s current stance.

“Anything that’s going to get done, the president’s got to sign off on it,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), “So it’s going to be something that the president feels comfortable with.”

Scott worked on a previous effort to limit the number of H-1B recipients who can receive green cards annually. Different versions of that bill passed the House and the Senate in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but the two measures were never reconciled, and the legislation was never signed into law.

Wishing to seize the moment but also cognizant of the political challenges ahead, Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in an interview shifted his comments to deliver a personal plea to Trump himself.

“The president has brought attention to the problems with H-1B’s,” the Iowa Republican said. “If the president will read your story, I’d give him this message: He’s created great credibility because he has closed down the border — great credibility on immigration issues.”

Endorsing an H-1B overhaul bill, Grassley continued, “would give him a chance to get some of these really simple things in immigration that ought to pass the Congress.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on its intentions to work with Congress on a legislative fix.

George Fishman, a senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies and former Department of Homeland Security official in the first Trump administration, said Trump is being pulled in radically different directions by those advising him. Barring true interest from Trump in the matter, Fishman suspected congressional action is unlikely.

“Based on three decades of bitter experience, I’m sort of resigned to not expecting things to happen legislatively,” said Fishman, who also worked on immigration policy as a Hill aide.

Trump aside, the political dynamics around the immigration issue on Capitol Hill are broadly problematic. For years, efforts to update the nation’s outdated immigration policy have fallen short. A bipartisan Senate “gang” in 2013 managed to pass a bill that combined border security with a pathway to citizenship, but it was never taken up in the House.

Since that time, the Trump ethos around immigration has further polarized the issue, hardening even Republicans who at one point linked their personal brands to being willing to work with Democrats on it.

That includes Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was once Durbin’s main partner in trying to pass legislation that would protect young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children — the recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Graham now says he isn’t interested in doing anything to expand legal immigration until the border is properly secured — and he doesn’t trust Democrats to restrain themselves.

“We all are agreed that we need H-1B reform,” Graham said in an interview. “Well, then Democrats will say, ‘Okay, let’s reform that, but what about the DACA folks?’ And they’ll want something there, and that’s just the way it goes.”

Grassley said he understood that reality. “We got some people on the right that think they aren’t going to vote for any [immigration] legislation until you load up 12 million people and get them out of the country.”

In the meantime, Trump’s new $100,000 fee is being challenged in court by a coalition of unions, education groups and others who argue the cost is unworkable and unjustified. A judge could strike down the proclamation, and the case is ongoing.

Until then, Grassley suggested the chaos and anxiety being caused by the presidential action could work to the advantage of the program’s proponents.

“The business groups that fought the Grassley-Durbin bill over the last 10 years, that are now upset with the $100,000 the president’s putting in on each one of these [visas] … maybe they would realize that they shouldn’t have fought our legislation,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0a%2F21%2Fa4f5d7dc4d86bb0a6f83ba9a9c0e%2Fu-s-congress-03541.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:58:19.658425

Even as an appeals court allowed a federal judge to temporarily block the Trump administration from sending 500 National Guard troops into Chicago, teams of masked immigration enforcement agents staged a series of increasingly aggressive raids across the city’s North Side.

U.S. District Court Judge April Perry issued an order on Thursday blocking “the federalization and deployment” of 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, 200 members of the Texas National Guard and 14 members of the California National Guard into Illinois.

The Trump administration immediately appealed that order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which allowed Perry’s ruling blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois to stand, while halting her order stopping President Donald Trump from federalizing those troops.

That decision means that the hundreds of National Guard troops remain at a military facility near Joliet, where they arrived last week, but are blocked by Perry’s order from doing anything other than training on land controlled by the federal government.

But the outcome of what promises to be just the first skirmish in a lengthy legal battle that could reach all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court did nothing to stop immigration agents from carrying out the Trump administration’s combative immigration enforcement operation dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operations carried out by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, including members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol, appeared to be concentrated in neighborhoods away from the course of the 47th annual Chicago Marathon, which went off without disruption despite widespread concerns.

A WGN-TV employee was detained by Border Patrol officials on Friday near Lincoln Square on the city’s North Side before being released without charges several hours later. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, that the employee “was arrested for throwing objects at law enforcement.”

As agents left that scene, they struck a vehicle and did not stop.

“Several violent agitators used vehicles to block in agents to impede & assault federal officers. In fear of public & law enforcement safety, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening,” McLaughlin posted.

After several people were detained Thursday and Friday in the Far North Side neighborhood of Rogers Park, hundreds of people rallied Saturday near Clark Street and Lunt Avenue, the location of at least one of the raids, Block Club Chicago reported.

After immigration enforcement agents were reported outside nearby St. Jerome Catholic Church, video of a priest warning parishioners about leaving Mass unaccompanied early Sunday went viral. After word of that warning spread, a human chain formed to protect attendees, witnesses told NBC Chicago.

Community organizations have been working to identify the location of federal agents in Chicago neighborhoods to warn undocumented immigrants of their presence. Groups have distributed whistles and created text and phone networks to sound the alarm.

During a separate incident Sunday morning, federal agents appeared to point a gun at a man who was objecting to their activities in a Rogers Park alley, according to several videos of the incident posted on social media.

But perhaps the most violent encounter between Chicagoans angry about immigration enforcement operations occurred Sunday afternoon in Albany Park, on the city’s Northwest Side, when a group of Chicagoans confronted four vehicles of agents, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.

After agents shoved people to the ground, the agents dispersed tear gas — without any warning — to the dozens of people nearby, according to witnesses and videos posted on social media.

A federal judge ordered agents to issue two warnings before using tear gas.

‘Unreliable’ Assertions by the Trump Administration

Although lawyers for the state of Illinois and city of Chicago had asked Perry to block President Donald Trump from deploying the military into Illinois, she found that there had not been sufficient evidence presented that the president planned to take that step.

The Posse Comitatus Act, which dates to 1878, is a criminal law that bars the use of the military for domestic policing.

Trump has said he would consider enacting the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to deploy the U.S. military within the country in response to what is determined to be an insurrection against the government, if judges block his deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors, or mayors were holding us up, sure I’d do that.”

Read Perry’s full order.

Perry said she found federal officials’ assertions that federal agents had been subjected to serious and coordinated violence by protestors “unreliable.”

Perry wrote that she took note of “a troubling trend of Defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”

“This indicates to the Court both bias and lack of objectivity,” Perry wrote.

Perry also concluded that she could not “find reasonable support for a conclusion that there exists in Illinois a danger of rebellion satisfying the demands” of the federal law allowing the president to federalize the National Guard.

“The unrest Defendants complain of has consisted entirely of opposition (indeed, sometimes violent) to a particular federal agency and the laws it is charged with enforcing. That is not opposition to the authority of the federal government as a whole,” Perry wrote. “Defendants have offered no explanation supporting the notion that widespread opposition to immigration enforcement constitutes the makings of a broader opposition to the authority of the federal government.”

Perry, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, was first tapped to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Her confirmation to that post was blocked by former U.S. Sen. JD Vance, who is now vice president.

‘Countermanding the President’s Military Judgment’: Feds

During Thursday’s historic hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton repeatedly asserted that Perry must give the president’s determination that the deployment of the National Guard is necessary “great deference.”

“The president’s judgement is unreviewable,” Hamilton said.

In its appeal, the Trump administration said Perry had misapplied the law.

“In countermanding the president’s military judgment, the district court largely ignored the facts on the ground, relied on an improper … factual investigation, and rested on an adverse ‘credibility’ finding that had no basis in the record,” according to lawyers for the Trump administration.

The appeals court panel could decide at any time whether to take up the Trump administration’s appeal and whether to allow the deployment of federalized National Guard troops while it resolves the case.

Perry scheduled the next hearing in the case for 9 a.m. Oct. 22, when she said she will consider extending the temporary restraining order she issued for an additional 14 days before the initial order expires at 11:59 p.m. Oct. 23.

Nearly 2,500 federalized National Guard troops from several states led by Republicans have been in Washington, D.C., since August.

While the president has credited those troops with lowering crime in the nation’s capital, crime data shows no significant drop in violent crime, records show. National Guard members have picked up trash and helped package meals for unhoused residents, according to the Associated Press.

A lawsuit brought by D.C.'s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.

Of the more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines sent to Los Angeles, approximately 100 California National Guard members remain under federal authority, officials said, including the 14 soldiers sent to Illinois to provide “training and subject matter expertise.”

Los Angeles and California officials challenged that deployment in federal court. A judge found not only was it illegal, but the activities of the military violated the Posse Comitatus Act. That order has been halted by an appeals court, but the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump has also ordered National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, despite Gov. Tina Kotek’s objections.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the president’s claims of daily unrest in Portland were “untethered to facts” and risked violating the U.S. Constitution by imposing military rule. Immergut has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops into Portland.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide at any time whether to overturn Immergut’s ruling.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-14 09:57:41.546410

During an interaction Sunday with immigration agents in Northwest Side neighborhood Albany Park, video appears to show agents deploying tear gas against the public without any audible warning - something that is unlawful under a court order from last week.

Other images show immigration agents outside of a church in Rogers Park that same day during a Spanish-language Mass.

That is prompting questions over whether they had warrants targeting specific people or were there without warrants, something that requires additional probable cause and an assessment of an immigrant's flight risk.

""What we have seen now to a much larger scale is federal agents indiscriminately stopping and arresting people without warrants and without probable cause required by federal immigration laws,"" said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

A fence still up around the Broadview ICE facility is restricting access to a public road on Monday night after a judge ruled it should be taken down. The deadline to do so is Tuesday night -- but what happens if that does not happen?

Former federal prosecutor Ron Safer said, ""I am very worried about where we are right now. We are on the precipice, looking into the abyss of chaos, because if the norms of the government are not respected, if somebody says, the judiciary makes a decision, and then the executive branch ignores it. That's chaos.""

Safer explained federal judges can rule according to the law, but if the executive branch, in this case federal agents, refuse to follow those rulings, judges don't have an army to enforce their orders.

""Normally, judges enforce their ruling by contempt orders, and then the person who is violating the order is fined or imprisoned, if it's bad enough. How do you do that to a cabinet level official, and who is going to enforce that?"" he asked.

At that point, the constitution and American norms require the executive branch to enforce itself.

That is something Safer is skeptical the president will do.

""It is norms that presidents will respect the decisions of the courts, that they will respect the views of the governors. That's out the window. None of the norms are being observed, and that is going to create, and is creating crises on the streets and in Washington and across the country,"" he said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18000976_101325-wls-iteam-mark-court-orders-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:34.880249

“Students are advised to weigh these challenges against the substantial benefits of a U.S. education at our institution,” Stonesifer said. “The University is committed to monitoring changes in policy, visa processing and global events that may impact international students’ ability to study in the United States and to providing support strategies based on evolving circumstances.”

On April 9, the Trump administration revoked a Pitt student’s visa and two recent graduates’ visas. Shortly after, Student Government Board announced the students’ legal statuses were restored in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

In early October, the Trump administration sent a memo to nine U.S. colleges — not including Pitt — with specific requirements to get preferential access to federal funds. One requirement said universities can have no more than 15% internationally exchanged undergraduate students.

The University approved 215 H1-B visas in 2025, non-immigrant visas for highly educated foreign professionals to work in specialized jobs at universities and companies. Trump instituted a new $100,000 H1-B worker visa application fee in September, which previously cost $215.

Andrea Peña-Vasquez, an assistant professor of international affairs who specializes in immigration at the School of Public and International Affairs, said the University may see more stark effects in international enrollment next year.

“We might see people choosing to stay in their home countries or look into other places other than the U.S. to come for school,” Peña-Vasquez said. “Other countries that also offer opportunities for international students might become more appealing in the future because of [national immigration policy changes].”

Peña-Vasquez said she thinks federal immigration policies will harm SPIA, too.

“At SPIA, especially, we have such a large international population,” Peña-Vasquez said. ”Our international students really bring in this wealth of perspective that our domestic students benefit so greatly from.”

Peña-Vasquez said as a political scientist, she believes in the “soft power” of person-to-person discussion and connecting through educational opportunities, which international students contribute to.

“We learn so much from [international students], and the ones that do return to their home countries end up bringing back lessons from the U.S. about democracy and things like American culture,” Peña-Vasquez said. “I think that is such an important part of soft power, and I think now we’re going to see this decrease in these exchanges.”

Stonesifer said the University is working with public officials on all levels to advocate for international students.

“We work with the University’s elected officials, Pennsylvania’s Congressional delegation and federal agencies to advocate on behalf of our international community,” Stonesifer said.

Peña-Vasquez believes the Trump administration’s immigration policies are harmful to universities nationwide.",https://pittnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carthy-Drone-Photos-8.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:58:30.001919

The text also highlights the principle of “margin of appreciation” developed by the European Court, under which national authorities are best placed to assess domestic circumstances and balance individual rights against the public interest.

According to the document, applications concerning non-nationals represent only about two per cent of all cases processed by the European Court of Human Rights over the past decade, with fewer than 300 findings of violations. It is underlined that states have the right to control the entry and stay of non-nationals, provided such measures respect fundamental protections such as the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 3).

The text also highlights the principle of “margin of appreciation” developed by the European Court, under which national authorities are best placed to assess domestic circumstances and balance individual rights against the public interest. When national decisions are well reasoned and consider all relevant factors, the Court generally defers to them.

As regards interim measures, while the Court may apply them exceptionally to suspend removals of non-nationals, the vast majority of such requests are rejected. It also recognises the challenges faced by states especially in combating crime and terrorism, affirming that expulsions of serious offenders may be compatible with the Convention when justified and proportionate.
