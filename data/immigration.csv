U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week’s hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government’s attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday’s order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,” Gee wrote, referring to the government’s appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/01/GettyImages-1164124770.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-17 23:56:20.088629

Ms. Conrad said that as of late September, 48% of the court’s docket consisted of business cases.
Mr. Knowles presented a sworn stipulation that the total damages in his putative class action suit would be less than $5 million.
A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al.","Cases involving class actions that are of interest to risk managers and businesses are front and center for the U.S. Supreme Court session that begins Oct. 1.

Foremost among them is The Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Greg Knowles, which deals with criteria that determine whether a class action can be moved to federal court from state court as permitted under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.

Knowles is one of several cases the Supreme Court has accepted that are of interest to risk managers and businesses in general.

In fact, the Supreme Court once again is tackling a considerable business docket after broad issues such as health care reform and immigration reform overshadowed business cases in the last term, Robin S. Conrad, executive vice president of the Washington-based National Chamber Litigation Center, which handles litigation for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said during a court preview late last month.

Ms. Conrad said that as of late September, 48% of the court’s docket consisted of business cases. Since then, the court has agreed to hear an additional business-related case regarding the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement powers.

But possibly the most closely watched case with risk management implications is Knowles. Under CAFA, the amount in controversy in a class action must be at least $5 million for such a case to be moved to federal court.

Mr. Knowles presented a sworn stipulation that the total damages in his putative class action suit would be less than $5 million. That was disputed by Standard, which argued the stipulation’s language “does not adequately bind plaintiff” and that the total amount will exceed $5 million once attorneys’ fees and costs are included, according to the Dec. 2, 2011, ruling by Judge P.K. Holmes III, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Fort Smith, Ark.

%%BREAK%%

Ruling in the plaintiff’s favor, Judge Holmes said, “The question is whether a plaintiff may meet his burden of proof by stipulating at the time the complaint is filed that he will not seek more than the federal jurisdictional minimum for himself and the putative class.”

In its ruling Jan. 4, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis denied Standard’s request for a rehearing.

Another class action case before the high court, Comcast Corp. et al. v. Caroline Behrend et al., involves the question of whether a trial court can certify class actions before it resolves whether plaintiff expert testimony is admissible.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held for Ms. Behrend and the class in the case.

As Dan Himmelfarb, a partner in the Washington office of Mayer Brown L.L.P., put it during a Supreme Court preview at the Washington Legal Foundation last month, the issue is an important one because the “certification stage is really where the action is” in class action cases.

A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. At issue in Amgen, which is a securities case, is whether courts should reject certification for a securities class when the plaintiffs fail to adequately demonstrate that they relied on alleged misrepresentations when they purchased a stock.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of the retirement plan.

Foreign affairs and business converge in yet another case before the court, Esther Kiobel et al. v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. et al. At issue is whether the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 applies to conduct outside the United States.

%%BREAK%%

During the NCLC briefing, Andrew J. Pincus, a partner in Mayer Brown’s Washington office, said the plaintiffs in the case are taking a broad position that “U.S. courts are open for business” to provide a civil remedy for anyone who is injured anywhere in the world.

The case was brought on behalf of the widow of Barinem Kiobel, a Nigerian activist who was executed in 1995. The plaintiffs allege that Royal Dutch Shell bribed witnesses to give false testimony to a special tribunal that sentenced Mr. Kiobel and others to death.

Lower courts had rejected the plaintiffs’ position, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and held oral arguments in February. A few days later, the court said it was postponing its review until this term, and instructed lawyers on both sides to file new arguments as to whether the Alien Tort Statute allows U.S. courts to permit lawsuits for violations of international law that took place in foreign territory.

The court also will deal with an employment case — Mayetta Vance v. Ball State University et al. — that asks whether the supervisor liability rule under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to workplace harassment by people who oversee and direct a victim’s daily work or whether it is limited to those who have the power to hire, fire, demote or otherwise affect their victim.",https://www.businessinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NEWS06_309309978_AR_-1_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 20:56:22.506019

Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza.
“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.","A day after conservative activist Laura Loomer, an advisor to President Trump, posted videos on social media of children from Gaza arriving in the U.S. for medical treatment and questioning how they got visas, the State Department said it was halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review.

The State Department said Saturday the visas would be stopped while it looks into how “a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas” were issued in recent days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday told “Face the Nation” on CBS that the action came after ”outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it.”

Rubio said that there were “just a small number” of the visas issued to children in need of medical aid but that they were accompanied by adults. The congressional offices reached out with evidence that “some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas,” he asserted, without providing evidence or naming those organizations.

As a result, he said, “we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the process of acquiring those visas.”

Loomer on Friday posted videos on X of children from Gaza arriving this month in San Francisco and Houston for medical treatment with the aid of an organization called Heal Palestine. “Despite the US saying we are not accepting Palestinian ‘refugees’ into the United States under the Trump administration,” these people from Gaza were able to travel to the U.S., she said.

She called it a “national security threat” and asked who signed off on the visas, calling for the person to be fired. She tagged Rubio, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Trump has downplayed Loomer’s influence on his administration, but several officials swiftly left or were removed shortly after she publicly criticized them.

The State Department on Sunday declined to comment on how many of the visas had been granted and whether the decision to halt visas to people from Gaza had anything to do with Loomer’s posts.

Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza. The group said it is “an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine.”

A post on the organization’s Facebook page Thursday shows a photo of a boy from the Gaza Strip leaving Egypt and headed to St. Louis for treatment and said he is “our 15th evacuated child arriving in the U.S. in the last two weeks.”

The organization brings “severely injured children” to the U.S. on temporary visas for treatment they can’t get at home, the statement said. After treatment, the children and any family members who accompanied them return to the Middle East, the statement said.

“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.

The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where Israel’s 22-month war against Hamas has heavily destroyed or damaged much of the territory’s health system.

“More than 14,800 patients still need lifesaving medical care that is not available in Gaza,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday on social media, and called on more countries to offer support.

A WHO description of the medical evacuation process from Gaza published last year explained that the organization submits lists of patients to Israeli authorities for security clearance. It noted that before the war in Gaza began, 50 to 100 patients were leaving the territory daily for medical treatment, and it called for a higher rate of approvals from Israeli authorities.

The United Nations and partners say medicines and basic healthcare supplies are low in Gaza after Israel cut off all aid to the territory of over 2 million people for more than 10 weeks earlier this year.

“Ceasefire! Peace is the best medicine,” Tedros added Wednesday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e904d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4067x2135+0+288/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F86%2F1a5b6e6748fbab1b98d0b2d9f7c6%2F23e35d7da9da4c4fb0230be5ed32c882.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 17:56:57.442066

WASHINGTON — With additional state National Guard troops deploying to D.C. as untrained federal law enforcement agents perform local police duties in city streets, the American Civil Liberties Union is issuing a stark reminder to all federal and military officials that — no matter what uniform they wear or what authority they claim — they are bound by the U.S. Constitution and all federal and local laws.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration declared that state National Guard troops would be called in to Washington, and the governors of West Virginia, Ohio, and South Carolina announced they are deploying hundreds of their National Guard troops to the nation's capital on top of the 800 D.C. National Guard troops who were already activated by President Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift, these troops may receive orders “to start carrying weapons in the coming days.” National Guard troops are generally not trained in local policing or de-escalation and should never be used for federal immigration purposes.

President Trump has also ordered FBI personnel and other federal officers, who similarly are not trained for local policing, to patrol the city. He earlier promised to let police “do whatever the hell they want” — raising grave concerns about civil rights abuses, particularly for Black, Brown, and unhoused residents.

“Through his manufactured emergency, President Trump is engaging in dangerous political theater to expand his power and sow fear in our communities. Sending heavily armed federal agents and National Guard troops from hundreds of miles away into our nation’s capital is unnecessary, inflammatory, and puts people’s rights at high risk of being violated,” said Hina Shamsi, director of ACLU’s National Security Project. “Governors need to understand that with each order, the Trump administration increases legal and ethical jeopardy for state troops being deployed. No matter what uniform they wear, federal agents and military troops are bound by the Constitution, including our rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, due process, and safeguards against unlawful searches and seizures. If troops or federal agents violate our rights, they must be held accountable.”

On Friday, D.C. sued the administration to block its order asserting federal authority over the city’s police department, saying it violated the Home Rule Act. After a federal court hearing on Friday afternoon, Attorney General Bondi rescinded her most brazen order undermining D.C.’s home rule, thereby allowing the D.C. police commissioner to remain at her post over the D.C. police department.

“The deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops and more federal agents onto D.C. streets is a brazen abuse of power meant to intimidate and create fear in the nation’s capital. This is an unnecessary overstep to micromanage D.C. under a phony emergency, causing real harm to residents and visitors — all to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda.” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of ACLU of D.C. “The ACLU-D.C. will continue to monitor the use of D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure that the constitutional rights of our community are protected. We need the nation to join us in the fight for statehood so that D.C. residents are treated like those in every other state and have the same guardrails against federal overreach.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Martinez was arrested in connection with a prior DUI.

Newsweek reported Martinez, who is well-known on TikTok for posting videos that document several ICE arrests, was filmed on Friday seated in her Tesla when agents opened her car door and pulled her onto the pavement. She also appeared to experience a medical event during the arrest, and at one point onlookers are heard demanding treatment for her.

The arrest was also briefly interrupted by a man who attempted to tow one of the police cars in the arrest.

“He mocked and videotaped ICE officers chasing after him,” McLaughlin also told Newsweek. “Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who seeks to impede law enforcement will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Martinez was initially transported to White Memorial Hospital and is currently being held in a detention center in downtown Los Angeles.

On Thursday, Los Angeles Rep. Jimmy Gomez accused ICE of staging an empty migrant detention center.

“One person was talking to the Mexican consulate who happened to be there, and the other person was just in the cell with their head down on a table or on the table or something. He was just kind of sitting there,” Gomez said of the center he visited recently.

Gomez also questioned why the center was so empty despite the numerous arrests made recently. Nearly 2,800 people have been taken into ICE custody since early June.

Several Oklahoma City priests report parishioners being detained and deported, some with long-term residency and U.S.-born children.

While acknowledging the right to secure borders, priests express concern over the impact of deportations on families and the targeting of those seeking legal status.

In early summer, as immigration raids were ramping up across the country, Bishop Albert Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino granted a dispensation excusing undocumented parishioners in the diocese from attending Mass. The unusual move came out of fear they might be detained by immigration agents if they were in a public gathering like church.

News of the dispensation quickly got back to Little Flower Catholic Church in Oklahoma City, where the Rev. Tim Luschen oversees a heavily Hispanic parish.

The Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, has not granted such a dispensation in the archdiocese, which includes parishes across two-thirds of Oklahoma. Luschen said he hasn't seen a noticeable increase in absences at his church. However, he did know that Rojas' action in the wake of the U.S. immigration Enforcement and Customs efforts in California was a topic of conversation at Little Flower, 1125 S. Walker Ave.

Not surprising, Luschen said, because ""people are living on edge.""

""They're afraid.""

Two of his counterparts whose parishes are on the opposite end of the Oklahoma City metro area, shared similar comments.

""I've noticed that the anxiety level among my parishioners has increased,"" said the Rev. Jim Goins, pastor of St. Eugene Catholic Church, who described his church as the most diverse in the archdiocese.

Though neither Goins, Luschen or the Rev. Stephen Hamilton are aware of large numbers of parishioners disappearing from the pews, all three said they have been talking with their parishioners about the boosted ICE efforts occurring across the country.

And, Luschen said he knows of four people from his historic parish in south Oklahoma City who have been detained, including a man who had been in the U.S. for 30 years and whose son is in the military.

Luschen said he also knew of several people who attended the Warr Acres church where he served as pastor who have been detained. The priest said one of them already has been deported to Honduras. Another man from the Warr Acres church was apprehended by ICE, taken from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, and then on to a private prison in Drumright. Luschen said the man had been in the U.S. for 20 years and has four children who were born in America.

""It hurts me,"" he said.

""All you can do is make sure that people know their rights.""

Facing uncertainty

With people from around the world attending Mass, including people from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Africa, ""it's like the United Nations here"" at St. Eugene, 2400 W. Hefner Road, Goins said. The church has two Spanish Masses and three English Masses each weekend, plus a Swahili Mass once a month, he proudly pointed out.

So, instead of tiptoeing around the subject, Goins said he spoke about the ramped-up immigration enforcement at one of the church's recent Spanish Masses.

""We just talked about how they might feel more vulnerable,"" he said. ""Many of them are unclear about their rights.""

Goins said St. Eugene has a large number of Hispanic parishioners who are in the U.S. legally. However, some of them worry about family members and friends who are undocumented.

""It's causing a lot of stress, particularly for 'mixed-status households,'"" he said.

The priest said he talked about self deportation — but, whether or not they are picked up by ICE or self deport, there is the agony of wondering what happens to their U.S.-born children who are legal citizens.

""They had to make that terrible choice ― it's heartbreaking,"" Goins said. ""I have had many people worry about their children ― 'Will I see them at the end of the day?'""

Both Luschen and Goins said they understand legalities of the situation, but Americans were initially told that the federal government would be concentrating immigration enforcement efforts on getting the most hardened criminals off the streets.

""If you have a criminal record, yes, I want you removed, but the vast majority (of immigrants) are very law abiding,"" Goins said.

He said apprehending and deporting those who have been stuck in the immigration system trying to take the legal route seems ""punitive.""

""In my mind, it's overzealous,"" he said.

""Most of our people have tried and are trying, and most of them have a valid case. There's really no path for them ― it just stretches for years. It's crazy.""

Luschen, at Little Flower, said he's also been told about the choices some parishioners are making, choices Goins described as heartbreaking. He said some people have told him of their plans to self deport, although their children will remain in America.

""The kids are going to stay here,"" he said.

Then, there are the concerns about people being deported to countries that they have never been to.

""No matter what president it is, it doesn't seem to be humane,"" Luschen said. ""This is a new level and new struggles that are really challenging.""

'Complicated and complex'

Hamilton, pastor of St. Monica Catholic Church in Edmond, said attendance at his parish's Spanish Mass has increased from about 225 people when he was first appointed to lead the parish in June of 2012, to between 475 and 550 each weekend now.

The priest said he's proud of the work his parish has done to minister to the Hispanic community, which is a significant part of the universal church.

Thus, he's been well aware of the fear that some parishioners are feeling as ICE's efforts continue.

""I've picked up conversations with people in my own parish and in the larger community that people are scared and unsettled and uncertain,"" he said.

Hamilton said he didn't know of anyone who had been deported and he couldn't say for certain that Mass attendance has dwindled because attendance may decrease in the summer months. The priest said he's not certain who is documented and who is undocumented, but their status is not his first concern.

""Frankly, the church's concern first and foremost, basically, is just human dignity and as a church is to preach the gospel and to proclaim the kingdom of God,"" he said.

The clergy leader said the issues surrounding immigration, border enforcement and deportation are complicated and complex. That's why he thinks people sometimes misunderstand the Catholic Church's position.

""I think it's fair to say that the church supports the country having sovereign borders and that the country does have a right to protect its borders,"" he said.

Having said that, Hamilton said some immigrants have come to the U.S. under policies by previous administrations and the country has a moral responsibility to those people who came under those past conditions.

""We can support border enforcement,"" he said.

""We can support, I think, the arrest and removal of people, who in addition to being here illegally, have committed other criminal acts, but I would say indiscriminate deportation is really not as easily supported by our Catholic social teaching.""","https://www.oklahoman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/30/NOKL/85442770007-rev-jim-goins-03.JPG?crop=3098,1744,x0,y298&width=3098&height=1744&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-17 13:56:42.912866

Several people were seen exiting a car before opening fire, with one of the shots wounding Tarpinian-Jachym. Police said Tarpinian-Jachym wasn't the intended target, adding an adult female and 16-year-old male were injured. The shooting happened in the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest, near the Mt Vernon Sq 7th St-Convention Center Metro stop.

After the fatal shooting, Trump sent a letter to Jachym, saying he and Melania Trump were ""heartbroken for your entire family.""

""Or [the D.C. Council] would change the laws so 12- to 17-year-olds are booked and charged for crimes and get jail time or juvenile detention,"" Jachym said. ""I am not saying for stealing a pair of shoes, but for serious crimes.

""I believe that something needs to be done because the council is allowing these people to engage in serious crime in D.C., and it's getting worse, not better,"" she added. ""It's serious. And you know if they can't see that this is a serious problem, then we have a serious problem.""

The D.C. Council did not respond to a request for comment.

NBC Washington reported that the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has risen every year since 2000, with over 2,000 minors arrested in 2023 and 2024.

In 2024, juveniles made up 51.8% of robbery arrests, according to police, adding that almost 60% of those arrested for carjacking in 2025 are also juveniles.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the uptick in juvenile crime was one reason she helped establish a Juvenile Investigative Response Unit within the agency.

""Recently, we have seen an increase in fights in our schools and more serious criminal offenses outside of our schools,"" Smith said in April. ""And we have seen an increase in juvenile suspects involved in criminal offenses district-wide.""

Jachym said the D.C. City Council needs to go a step further and ensure minors are held accountable for any criminal behavior because, right now, she feels it's a ""crime utopia.""

""I mean, if you're old enough to walk around with a gun and pull a trigger, you're old enough for the consequences,"" Jachym said. ""And these things that the council have in place are not working. Then what's the alternative? Have more people killed, raped, robbed, carjacked? It's just, you know, it's really scary.""

More recently, two juveniles were arrested after allegedly assaulting a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee in Washington, D.C.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has begun detaining people at Fort Bliss as part of its mass deportation campaign. The military base – which has land across El Paso, Texas, and Doña Ana and Otero Counties in New Mexico – will detain up to 5,000 people, making it the country’s largest immigrant detention site. The administration also plans to use at least two more bases to detain and deport people who are immigrants.

The detention camp’s opening is the latest escalation in President Trump’s dystopian agenda to detain and deport millions of immigrants from communities nationwide. The Fort Bliss detention camp, similar to the hastily built detention camp in the Florida Everglades, is a tent facility that will leave detained individuals vulnerable to extreme heat and other harsh conditions. Media reports suggest that the administration is poised to spend $1.26 billion to build the camp. Last month, Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill which will funnel $170 billion to turbocharge deportations and detention.

This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history, as the facility was used to intern German and Italian immigrants and people of Japanese descent during World War II, and later used to detain unaccompanied children in 2016 and from 2021 to 2023, where some were subjected to severe abuse.

The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants and plans to deploy troops to other ICE detention sites around the nation, including at military bases.

Sarah Mehta, deputy director of government affairs, Equality division at the American Civil Liberties Union, issued the following statement in response:

“President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy. Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.

“Members of Congress must stop the use of the military – including its bases – for the Trump administration’s reckless and wasteful deportation drive.”

For information about how The Observer protects your data, read our Privacy Policy.

The impact on free speech is evident even as I write this piece. I’m given less latitude to counter the home secretary’s claims than she is afforded to advance them. Her decision to proscribe gives her a higher degree of control of the narrative, as many papers will be reluctant, for legal reasons, to publish a piece that may make the readers sympathetic to Palestine Action’s aims. So all I am allowed to say on that is contained within my first witness statement. But I must do at least this. It is important that readers understand our case.

As I explained to the court, Palestine Action “take direct action against Israel’s arms trade in Britain”. We “put our bodies in the way of a military machine perpetrating genocide”. In my view the campaign has been effective, so I believe weapons firms and the Israeli embassy lobbied hard for ministers and police to crack down on Palestine Action.

However, proscribing a domestic direct action group has sparked outrage. So far, more than 700 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for holding signs, while opposition to the ban is growing across the political spectrum. To save face, it seems to me the government has resorted to a smear campaign. Rather than solely litigating the case in the courts, they’re also trying to litigate it in the media, where hard facts are swapped for soundbites.

Their newest claim refers to supposed evidence of “disturbing” plans and ideas. Yvette Cooper failed to reference any such evidence in court ahead of the “permission hearing” to challenge the ban, instead launching the claims on TV. These allegations are not supported by the security assessments disclosed by her own department, and don’t match the facts.

The assessment to proscribe Palestine Action was made in March 2025, but it seems Cooper delayed proscription until the most politically convenient moment. If there were “disturbing plans” and serious concerns of national security, why wait four months?

Even Keir Starmer weighed in, making reference to “Jewish-owned” businesses. The intention seemed to be to imply that Palestine Action was antisemitic. In reality, it targeted dozens of companies associated with Israel’s biggest weapons producer, regardless of the identities of the owners. This fact is known by the government, yet they continue to weaponise antisemitism.

I believe the idea behind the government’s statements is to deliberately mislead the public and parliament. The group was banned due to “serious property damage for a political cause”, not because of racism or alleged violence against people. It is false to claim the organisation had violent intent against people. The home secretary’s own security assessments say the direct action group didn’t advocate violence or pose a threat to life.

Cooper’s attempt to justify her decision by misleading the public shows only what a huge political misstep she has made. Her political career will be marked by the most draconian attack on our civil liberties in a generation.

Tom Kisken covers health care and other news for the Ventura County Star.","Patient visits at some sites have fallen.

A petition calls for ICE-free zones.

At-risk people worry any excursions bring risks.

The 9-year-old boy needed medical care.

His mother, an undocumented farmworker who lives in west Ventura County, was too scared to take him to an Oxnard clinic. She worried any excursion outside of her home could mean being detained, deported and separated from her son and his two siblings.

She canceled an appointment for what she described as a “highly important” medical procedure, then canceled a second date for the same treatment.

“I’m afraid they’re going to get me,” she said through an interpreter in a phone interview, declining to give her name. “I’m afraid with everything.”

Advocates with 805 UndocuFund contend more than 400 people in Ventura County have been detained by immigration police so far this year, though U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have provided few numbers.

As enforcement anxieties percolate, driven by actions like the July 10 raid at Glass House Farms near Camarillo, doctors and advocates worry many undocumented people are choosing to stay away from emergency rooms, urgent care centers and medical clinics.

And if they do come, they worry ICE will somehow find them.

“I’ve had two patients in the ER tell me that,” said Dr. Tipu Khan, an addiction medicine specialist at Ventura County Medical Center, the Ventura hospital that serves as a safety net for people with little money, no insurance and other barriers. Delays in care mean patients will become sicker and could ultimately need more treatment.

“This is the only access to care that they may have. They are very medically fragile,” Khan said.

It’s hard to quantify the extent to which fear is keeping people from seeking care in emergency rooms, urgent care centers or clinics.

At the countywide Clinicas del Camino Real health system that also delivers care to underserved populations, visits were once projected to rise by more than 10% in August. Instead, they’re down about 4% over last year largely because of fears of detention and deportation, said CEO Dr. Gagan Pawar.

A surge of enforcement actions across the county in June contributed to cancellations and no-shows too with about 1,800 less visits than June 2024. The system is encouraging people who are afraid to come to clinics to use telehealth options.

“Health care, education and food are not privileges, they are human rights. Those are at stake right now,” Pawar said, contending the fear is affecting medical facilities across the regions. “It’s everywhere. It’s not just us.”

At Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, visits to the emergency room fell about 9% in June compared to 2024 — 330 visits ― and fell a little more in July, said Dr. John Fankhauser, the hospital's CEO. Numbers regularly fluctuate from month to month.

""It's not atypical,"" he said, noting it's too early to attribute the numbers to fear or any specific cause. He emphasized the hospital's mission is to treat everyone who needs care.

""For us as a hospital, it’s so important to message that we’re here for people,"" he said. ""We’re truly committed to providing care to all comers.""

ER visits for June and July were still slightly higher than 2023 levels, Fankhauser said. Usage for the calendar year so far is higher than last year, partly because of a surge of respiratory and other illnesses in January that packed hospitals across the county.

And while doctors say visits to some countywide clinics fell in the wake of the Glass House raids on July 10, officials said patient interactions in June and July were “comparable” to last year’s levels. The ambulatory care system saw about 31,000 patient visits in June, about 2,000 less than a year earlier, said spokesperson Lydia Collins.

Emergency room visits at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks are also down but the decline appears linked to seasonal trends and not to immigration anxiety, said spokesperson Megan Merino.

Officials at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard did not respond to questions about the impact of immigration enforcement fears. Dr. Neil Canby, an emergency medicine doctor at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, said ER numbers were actually a little higher than normal in July. Ambulance calls across the county haven't changed significantly, said Steve Carroll, administrator for Ventura County Emergency Medical Services.

'Long-lasting consequences'

Some health care professionals are reluctant to talk publicly about the impact of immigration enforcement on patient visits. But a petition being circulated by doctors and employees in the county health system contends increased immigration enforcement has brought widespread fear.

“We have seen patients cancel appointments, forgo preventive care, and avoid seeking medical attention altogether—out of fear that accessing healthcare could lead to detention or deportation,” the petition reads. “These disruptions to daily life will have long-lasting consequences on both physical and mental health.

The petition calls on county leaders to declare county hospitals, clinics and their parking lots ICE-free zones where immigration enforcement is not allowed without a judicial warrant. The document also calls for posting signs that tell visitors immigration status is never asked about or shared.

“Our goal is a (medical) center without drama,” said Dr. Carlos O’Bryan-Becerra, the family practice physician who initiated the petition. “We want a safe space to focus on healing.”

Collins, Health Care Agency spokeswoman, said the agency has no comment on the petition.

On the day of the Glass House raids on July 10, people injured in protests outside the farms were taken to St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. The patients included a person who had been apprehended by ICE during the protests. Immigration agents came to the hospital to take the person into custody, triggering a large protest outside the hospital.

Khan of VCMC said the incident and reports of immigration enforcement visits to medical facilities or their parking lots elsewhere in California have created more concern among vulnerable patients. The petition circulated at VCMC calls for more training on what to do if ICE agents come to a medical campus.

Fankhauser said he hasn’t heard of any ICE activity at VCMC. Pawar said Clinicas facilities have also not been visited by ICE.

“We are prepared. We have protocol,” Pawar said, noting that warrants will be required from immigration agents.

Judicial warrants are required for immigration authorities to access private areas of hospitals and medical facilities, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

""In general health centers must allow ICE agents in any area where they would allow general members of the public,"" the ACLU said in a factsheet.

Protecting privacy

Hospital officials across the county emphasized they don’t ask people about immigration status and offer care to everyone who comes to their emergency room.

“We remain committed to safeguarding patient privacy, safety and dignity, no matter the patient’s legal status or situation,” Merino said. “We provide care to all patients who come to our facility in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), while protecting their confidentiality under the HIPAA privacy rule.”

Advocates still worry. Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of 805 UndocuFund, said she’s been told by clinic leaders in Ventura that more people who have made appointments for care simply don’t show up. She worries too about low-income people who bypass government health insurance because of reports that the federal government disclosed personal Medicaid information with ICE.

“It’s difficult to say if any place is safe at this point the way federal immingration enforcement is being carried out,” Hernandez said. “We take it day by day.”

Ryan Drury works with health care professionals who have joined the VC Defensa organization that monitors immigration enforcement and advocates for undocumented people. He said some people injured in the Glass House raids didn’t seek medical care because of fear they would be detained.

Martita Martinez-Bravo, executive director of Friends of Fieldworkers, worries about farmworkers and others who can’t sleep because of nightmares or have other mental health trauma but are afraid to reach out for treatment. She noted many people are afraid to send their kids to school or to leave home for any reason.

“People are not even going to the grocery store,” she said. “People are afraid to go to the laundromat.”

Doctors said people who don’t seek care will get sicker. They worry about people who bypass vaccinations at a time when measles risks are rising. Some said safety net systems designed to serve all comers now face a barrier in the form of immigration enforcement fear.

“We’re feeling a little bit helpless,” O’Bryan-Becerra said.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president’s administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district’s lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Friday night along the district’s U Street, a popular nightlife corridor, an Associated Press photographer saw officers from the FBI, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

Prof. Bheki Mngomezulu

The issue of undocumented migrants in South Africa has caused a stir across various sectors. While some call for their immediate deportation because they deplete the country’s resources at the expense of the nationals, others – including some NGOs – plead on their behalf. They even invoke certain clauses of the Freedom Charter and sections of the country’s constitution to strengthen their argument on why these undocumented migrants should be allowed to stay in this country.

The main question that begs for attention is: where does one draw the line between addressing the challenge of undocumented migrants and upholding human rights? Another question becomes: should the rights of these undocumented migrants supersede those of South African citizens? These are very critical questions. To answer them properly, one must cogently interpret both the Freedom Charter and the Constitution.

Clause five of the Freedom Charter states that ‘all shall be equal before the law.’ Clause 6 states that ‘all shall enjoy equal human rights.’

The reality is that when the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown, Soweto, on June 26, 1955, it did not envision a South Africa that people from outside the country would populate. In that sense, the “all” in both clauses did not refer to foreign nationals. Therefore, if these undocumented migrants were to be allowed to live in South Africa, it would be for other reasons, not because of the Freedom Charter.

Some cite different sections of the Constitution to make a case for these undocumented migrants, especially Chapter 2 on the Bill of Rights. Sec 25 states that “everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing.” Section 27 states that everyone has the right to basic education.

While these sections are relevant to the debate, it is Section 27 that has triggered a serious debate. Sub-section 1(a) states that “everyone has the right to have access to health care services, including reproductive healthcare.”

Some South Africans complain that they are unable to access health care services because they compete with undocumented migrants. It was for this reason that members of Operation Dudula were arrested for checking patients’ identity documents to ascertain if they were South Africans. Others criticise these undocumented migrants for taking their jobs. Whether this is true or not varies from one case to another.

This debate leads us to a broader discussion that we must focus on. In this regard, there are five questions to ruminate about.

Firstly, what role has our government played in creating this situation? For example, had they protected the country’s borders like other countries do, would this problem have arisen?

Secondly, to what extent are the home governments of these undocumented migrants to blame for many of the challenges South Africa is wrestling with? In other words, had these governments ensured political and economic stability in their countries, would these undocumented migrants have come to South Africa?

Thirdly, what role do NGOs play in sustaining this challenge? Do they assist the government on how to address the challenge, or do they use the desperation of these undocumented migrants to make themselves relevant and score cheap points?

Fourthly, how does the international community contribute to the sustenance of this challenge about undocumented migrants? Do they share their experiences with the South African government, or do they use these migrants for political expediency?

Fifthly, what is the way out of this dilemma? In other words, should South Africa simply learn to live with this challenge, or should a solution be found? If the latter is the case, how should the process unfold, and who should be the role-players?

On the first question, our government is to blame for the current situation. The country’s borders are porous. Corruption has become ‘normal’. Some argue that they were in exile in the countries where the undocumented migrants come from. While this statement is factually correct, it is analytically flawed. They lived in camps, were known to the authorities, respected the laws of those countries, and many of them did not compete for jobs with the citizens of their host countries.

On the second question, the home governments of these undocumented migrants are to blame. They created economic and political conditions not conducive to their citizens. As such, some had to find their way out to look for greener pastures in South Africa.

Regarding the third question, NGOs are not a homogeneous group. Some are doing a good job in filling the gaps where the government has failed. Others advance the interests of foreign governments that want to see South Africa fail. They do so under the guise of helping the needy. They take the side of undocumented migrants to paint the country in a bad light.

The fourth question is related to the third one. Some foreign governments are vocal whenever South Africa acts against undocumented migrants. Ironically, they are very tough in their own countries. In that sense, the fate of these undocumented migrants is used to tarnish South Africa’s global image while scoring cheap political points.

The fifth question is the most important. The South African government should demonstrate leadership. This includes teaching South Africans the correct interpretation of the Freedom Charter and the Constitution. Where the constitution has loopholes, these should be filled through constitutional amendments.

The government does not have all the solutions. Instead of claiming the ‘omniscient narrator’ status, politicians should solicit the views of other South Africans – including academics who conduct research and draw lessons from other countries through comparative analyses. Some ordinary South Africans could also proffer ideas on how this situation could be addressed.

Instead of labelling concerns about undocumented migrants as ‘xenophobia’ or ‘Afrophobia’, it is important to approach this issue objectively. Documented migrants and asylum seekers are not the problem. They can be accounted for. They officially contribute to the country’s economy. However, this is not the case with undocumented migrants.

South Africa’s laws should not be used for political expediency!

The Linda Vista ICE arrest was the second at a San Diego-area elementary school in eight days.
On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.","A federal official on Saturday said a man arrested by ICE two days ago had allegedly been using an unauthorized social security number.

The public learned of the arrest outside Linda Vista Elementary School when San Diego schools superintendent Fabiola Bagula held a news conference Friday to reassure the community about the off-campus arrest.

In a emailed statement from the San Diego field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security described the man as an undocumented immigrant who “was fraudulently using an American’s social security number.”

Officers approached him “after he pulled over in a parking lot” on Thursday. ICE arrested him and placed him in removal proceedings, she said.

Other elements of McLaughlin’s statement run counter to those made by Bagula at her news conference.

ICE’s statement opens with the line “allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are FALSE. ICE was NEVER on school grounds.’

Bagula didn’t say ICE officers were on campus. She specifically explained that the arrest “didn’t happen on school grounds, but it happened close enough to our community to feel its impact.”

That means, the superintendent said, that it “happened to an entire school community.” She also called out ICE officers for their use of masks.

McLaughlin’s statement concluded with this: “Any smears that ICE targeted an elementary school are contributing to the 1000% increase in assaults against our brave ICE law enforcement.”

Those numbers remain in dispute – yet the estimates are rapidly increasing. In June, federal officials said that there has been a 500% increase in alleged assaults of ICE officers since the beginning of the year, according to Rolling Stone. In that report, however, Homeland Security did not release actual assault numbers.

By July, federal agencies on up to the White House – the Trump administration blamed Democrats – were citing a 700% percent rise in alleged assaults on ICE.

Immigration arrests have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump took office in January. The administration often repeats that it is going after the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders, but in a new report, the Marshall Project, which covers criminal justice, found that of those immigrants deported between January and May, just around 12% had been convicted of a crime that was” “either violent or potentially violent.”

To date, ICE has targeted workplaces and public spaces where undocumented workers are thought to gather. The area around schools could be a new front for immigration officers.

The Linda Vista ICE arrest was the second at a San Diego-area elementary school in eight days. On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.

ICE said in a statement that she was arrested after being ordered to be deported in absentia by an immigration judge in 2022.

That statement also noted simply, without accusations of smears or assault allegations, that the situation outside Camarena Elementary was “resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1678.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:00:09.166731

The 52-year-old Peruvian asylum-seeker held a valid work permit, paid his taxes, maintained health insurance and had no criminal record. That wasn’t good enough for the Trump administration.

During a routine check-in at an immigration office in July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Vega and now threaten to deport him. Vega is another victim of a broken immigration and asylum system that needs common sense reform.

ICE is reportedly holding Vega in a detention center in Arizona. He is hundreds of miles from his fiancee, his friends and his support network.

If someone who did everything by the book can be arrested and deported, it sends a chilling message to the entire immigrant community. Even those who committed no crime live in fear that masked federal agents could throw them into a van and drive them away at any time.

This harsh enforcement strategy is disruptive not just for families but also for businesses in the North Bay and beyond. The agricultural, hospitality and construction industries rely on immigrant workforces. They now struggle to find workers, and the entire regional economy suffers. In some cases, farmers have left food to rot in fields.

During his presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump talked about targeting immigrants with criminal records. If his administration had done so, he might have broad public support. Instead, 71% of detainees have no criminal record. ICE is sweeping up the sorts of immigrants that most Americans want to keep: longtime residents with jobs, families and community ties. Vega is one of them.

The nation needs comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border and reforms asylum processing but also opens more pathways to legal entry and creates options for permanent legal status.

In 2024, a bipartisan Senate package proposed the most significant immigration reforms in three decades. It combined enhanced border security with updated asylum processing. Republican leaders in Congress supported the changes, some of which could have affected Vega’s case.

Trump opposed those reforms, not because they were bad policy but because he didn’t want the issue taken off the table during the campaign. To their great shame, congressional Republicans obeyed.

The recently introduced Dignity Act (H.R. 4393), which has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, offers them a second chance. It would provide a path to permanent legal status — although not citizenship — for many undocumented immigrants who arrived prior to 2021, something many Democrats support.

The legislation also would overhaul the asylum system, mandate national E-Verify by employers and create new criminal penalties for some immigration violations, all things that Republicans support. Critically, fees paid by participants would fund it all, not taxpayers.

The Dignity Act might not be the comprehensive compromise that the nation needs, but it would take huge steps to address an immigration crisis that entangles people like Vega. With Trump now in the White House and ever eager to take credit for a successful bill, maybe it has a chance of moving the United States closer to overdue immigration reform.

The anchor rally for the nationwide “Fight the Trump Takeover” protests was held in Austin, Texas, where Republicans in the state are poised to become the first in the nation to redraw their maps at the president’s behest.

Progressives in the Lone Star State capital rallied against Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for breaking with historical precedent by carrying out congressional redistricting in the middle of the decade. Independent experts have estimated that the Texas gerrymandering alone could yield the GOP five additional seats in the US House of Representatives.

Speaking before a boisterous crowd of thousands of people, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) charged that the Texas GOP was drawing up “districts set up to elect a Trump minion” in next year’s midterms. However, Doggett also said that progressives should still try to compete in these districts, whose residents voted for Trump in the 2024 election but who also have histories of supporting Democratic candidates.

“Next year, [Trump is] not going to be on the ballot to draw the MAGA vote,” said Doggett. “Is there anyone here who believes that we ought to abandon any of these redrawn districts and surrender them to Trump?”

Leonard Aguilar, the secretary-treasurer of Texas AFL-CIO, attacked Abbott for doing the president’s bidding even as people in central Texas are still struggling in the aftermath of the deadly floods last month that killed at least 136 people.

“It’s time for Gov. Abbott to cut the bullshit,” he said. “We need help now but he’s working at the behest of the president, on behalf of Trump … He’s letting Trump take over Texas!”

Aguilar also speculated that Trump is fixated on having Texas redraw its maps because he “knows he’s in trouble and he wants to change the rules midstream.”

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) went through a litany of grievances against Trump and the Republican Party, ranging from the Texas redistricting plan, to hardline immigration policies, to the massive GOP budget package passed last month that is projected to kick 17 million Americans off of Medicaid.

However, Casar also said that he felt hope watching how people in Austin were fighting back against Trump and his policies.

“I’m proud that our city is fighting,” he said. “I’m proud of the grit that we have even when the odds are stacked against us. The only answer to oligarchy is organization.”

What they're saying:

The San Bernardino Police Department responded to a call of a shooting near Acacia Avenue and Baseline Street a little after 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, August 16. Upon arrival, federal agents tied to ICE told San Bernardino PD that an officer-involved shooting broke out and the man they were looking for had drove off from the scene.

A little after the police spoke with the federal agents, the driver wanted by ICE had called 9-1-1 saying a group of masked men tried to get him to pull over, broke his car window and shot at him.

The driver told 9-1-1 he did not know who they were and was looking to get help from the police. An organization called Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice shared a video believed to be of the San Bernardino incident on social media. The video showed a driver and at least two passengers refusing to get out of a car and a CBP agent smashing the car's window, prompting the driver to take off from the scene.

As local police in San Bernardino heard both sides of the incident – federal agents and the driver wanted by ICE – SBPD officers found the car tied to the driver in the 1000 block of Mt. View Drive.

At the time of the car being found, SBPD got a hold of the driver, but left the scene without an arrest because it was not formally known what the driver was wanted for.

Around 1:15 p.m., federal officials called SBPD asking for help in addressing a large crowd. SBPD was told that federal agents tied to ICE had tried to arrest the driver for alleged assault on a federal officer. In a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, the driver was accused of hitting two Border Patrol officers with his car.

The Department of Homeland Security added in the same statement that the driver was briefly taken into custody before letting him go.

San Bernardino Police Department said it responded to that scene for crowd control purposes, not necessarily to go out and arrest the man for immigration reasons.

Below is a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security:

""During a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, CBP officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down.

In the course of the incident the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle. Because of the subjects forcing a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense. The subject escaped the scene.

After the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody, he was set free. This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities.""

What we don't know:

The cause of the shooting remains under investigation.

Officials have not released the identity of the driver wanted for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. As of 8 p.m. Saturday, no videos were released by federal officials showing the driver allegedly running CBP officers over.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/generic-web-main-3-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-17 07:56:28.275917

The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.","SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- As the Trump administration looks to increase the number of deportations of undocumented immigrants, a new battle has opened inside the nation's immigration courts.

Immigration judges and lawyers are being targeted for following established procedures.

""I think there is a valid fear among the immigration community of attorneys and legal service providers that we are putting ourselves at risk, putting our careers at risk, our license at risk if we're too vocal about the work that we do,"" said Millie Atkinson of the San Francisco Bar Association's Immigrant Legal Defense Program.

The fear intensified in March when President Donald Trump issued an executive order that accused immigration lawyers of coaching their clients to lie in asylum petitions.

The president then directed the U.S. Attorney General to identify misconduct ""such as filing frivolous litigation or engaging in fraudulent practices"" and sanction attorneys who ""violate professional conduct rules.""

""The language in that executive order was very threatening, that by helping someone apply for asylum we're violating our ethical rules as attorneys and that we will be investigated and could be charged and lose our licenses if we continue to help people seeking asylum,"" said former immigration judge Ilyce Shugall.

Shugall was an immigration judge between 2017 to 2019. She resigned after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented case quotas during the first Trump administration.

""The executive order is written in such a way that it suggests that even attorneys who are acting as zealous advocates to help individuals pursue relief and are presenting truthful claims may be targeted for their zealous advocacy,"" said Shugall, who is now the managing attorney at Immigrant Legal Defense.

She expressed concern about the large number of people being arrested in immigration courts since Trump began his second term.

Shugall said many of those being targeted were allowed to enter the country under humanitarian parole when large caravans of migrants were flooding the border with Mexico during the last two years of Biden's presidency. These migrants were then able to asylum. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates 2.8 million immigrants were granted humanitarian parole.

Trump ended that program in January, exposing these migrants to deportation if Department of Homeland Security lawyers can convince immigration judges to close their cases.

""DHS is moving to dismiss the removal proceedings so that DHS can pursue something called expedited removal,"" Shugall said..

Immigrants put into expedited removal can still present an asylum claim with the Department of Homeland Security, but it has to be done while they are in detention, where they don't have the same protections they have in immigration court. If DHS denies their claim they can be deported immediately.

""Representation matters in terms of individuals being granted relief. So by putting them into detention, it reduces the likelihood of representation and reduces the likelihood of being granted relief,"" Shugall said.

There's been an ongoing purge of immigration judges since Trump took office.

On Inauguration Day, the Justice Department fired the acting head of the immigration court system and three top officials. Since then, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired.

Many were hired in the past two years and were still in their probationary period, but others -- like Jennifer Peyton, who oversaw Chicago's immigration court as assistant chief judge -- were also fired with no reason given. She got a three sentence email from Sirce Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), that simply stated ""your removal is effective today.""

EOIR, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, has declined to comment on the firings.

Immigration judges are different than criminal court judges. They are not appointed or elected. They're civil servants and can be fired like other federal employees. In San Francisco, four judges have been fired in the past three months.

A review of Tracreports, a website run by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, shows several of those fired were approving more than 90% of asylum cases. For comparison, just 4% of asylum seekers are being approved at Adelanto ICE Detention Center in San Bernardino County. Immigration judges have gotten policy memos pressuring them to reject more asylum cases.

""They can't flat out say if you don't do this, you will get fired. But it kind of puts pressure on the judges, knowing if they don't follow the advice in that memo, they might be putting themselves at risk for being fired or being targeted or being reassigned,"" Atkinson said.

As a result of the firing, immigration courts are now down to 600 immigration judges out of the 800 authorized by EOIR. It's expected the judges that will be hired will be more focused on the Trump administration's goals.

The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.

""We're doing protective presence at the immigration court. The idea is that if enough people are here, ICE won't bother abducting people out of the communities,"" said one demonstrator who did not want to be identified.

The activists hand out informational leaflets and offer to accompany immigrants to their appointments. Others are regularly going inside immigration courtrooms to watch over the proceedings and recording people's names and relevant information in case they get detained.

""Immigration courts are open to the public, and it's very important that we have observers there to make sure that due process is being followed and that the immigrants are aware of their rights,"" said Eric Leenson, who co-founded the Friends of La Peña Immigrant Rights Committee.

He said he has seen teenagers without a lawyer attend hearings and forced to make decisions about their asylum case.

Leenson said court watchers are also attending hearings in case ICE agents try to detain someone.

""We like to have more people there in case someone needs to go outside the room to accompany an immigrant out, and then we like to have more people there in case there is an incident in which someone does feel intimidated,"" Leenson said.

Detentions in the hallways of immigration court have become contentious.

In June, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while trying to hold onto a person being detained by immigration agents.

Despite the risk, more than 100 people turned out recently for a court observer training at La Peña in Berkeley.

""It's important to kind of follow people's whereabouts, because once they're picked up, they get lost in the system. And if we know who they were and what time they were picked, it's much easier subsequently to follow them within the system to look out for their rights,"" Leenson said.

Court observers noted that since the courthouse arrests began there's been an increase in the number of immigrants who are too afraid to show up for a hearing.

""There are a lot of no shows now. People are really scared,"" said one observer.

Immigrants who don't show up for an appointment could have their case dismissed, making them immediately deportable.

The Catholic family were stunned to learn a bishop had accompanied them that day, he said.
Pulido isn’t the only Catholic bishop who has gone to immigration court.
You have to pass, no matter what, by the immigration agents.
Court accompaniment is an expression of faith, Contreras said.","San Diego Auxiliary Bishop Felipe Pulido noticed the way a father held his young daughter and stood close to his wife and teenage daughter in the courtroom. The love and care they had for each other was palpable on Tuesday (Aug. 12), when Pulido accompanied the asylum-seeking family for an immigration court hearing.

“As an immigrant, I got emotional because of that connection I have with my own family — I put myself in his shoes,” said the Catholic bishop, who was born in the Mexican state of Michoacán before immigrating to Yakima Valley in Washington as a teenager. He finished high school there, worked picking produce and eventually was ordained a priest.

Immigrants are facing court appointments with newly heightened levels of fear as the Trump administration has begun sending agents to detain migrants as they leave the courtroom. If immigration judges dismiss their cases, they can immediately face expedited removal proceedings without a chance to make their case for asylum. Previously, a 10-day response time to the dismissal was allowed.

Guided by their faith, clergy like Pulido and other representatives from religious groups are accompanying immigrants to court appointments to provide comfort and information and, in cases where their worst fears are realized, to pick up the pieces of a shattered American dream.

The Rev. Noel Andersen, national field director at Church World Service who is ordained in the United Church of Christ, holds a weekly call on faith-based court accompaniment. He told RNS that through accompaniment, “Faith leaders bear witness and speak out against the ways masked ICE agents are abducting our community members.” Accompaniment is taking place “in every major city and in some rural areas, just about everywhere there is an immigration court,” he said.

When it was time to leave their San Diego hearing, Pulido said, the family saw half a dozen United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and the mother told him she was scared. The bishop stuck close to the family, talking and reassuring them as they walked by the agents, he said. The judge had given them another hearing in December.

Pulido was present because the San Diego Catholic Church has partnered with Episcopal, Lutheran, Jewish and Muslim clergy, as well as lay people, to provide accompaniment for immigrants at the courthouse every day in August. They have more than 50 volunteers, and as more sign up, they’re planning to continue the ministry.

It was only when they’d gotten through the ordeal safely that the family asked Pulido which church he was with. The Catholic family were stunned to learn a bishop had accompanied them that day, he said.

Pulido said he was inspired by Pope Francis’ words last year when he attended “baby bishop camp,” an orientation for new bishops in Rome, to get involved in the court accompaniment ministry. “Be a sign of hope for the homeless, for the migrants, for those who are in prison,” he recalled Francis saying.

He said he believes sometimes ICE agents choose not to detain migrants even after their cases are dismissed because his priests are walking with them, though they have also witnessed detentions.

Pulido isn’t the only Catholic bishop who has gone to immigration court. In Orange County, where priests and deacons are also accompanying the faithful in immigration court, Bishop Kevin Vann attended the July bond hearing of Narciso Barranco, an immigrant without legal status and father of three U.S. Marines who was filmed being beaten in the head by immigration agents during his June arrest.

El Paso, Texas, Bishop Mark Seitz was also in immigration court on Tuesday, said Scalabrinian Sr. Leticia Gutiérrez, the director of the diocese’s migrant hospitality ministry.

Seitz witnessed the detention of three people — “the sobbing, the anguish of the wife of one of them,” said Gutiérrez in Spanish. Seitz told her, “I saw Jesus walking through the hallway, sister, defenseless.”

Gutiérrez, who has organized a precise system for the diocese’s immigration court accompaniment in the last two months, arrives at immigration court at exactly 7:50 a.m., four days a week, and stays until the final cases have concluded.

Before ICE agents arrive (about 20 minutes after she does), Gutiérrez and a priest who is a retired immigration lawyer introduce themselves to migrants arriving for court and provide them basic legal advice and information — and try to sit with them in their anxiety.

While some of the diocesan team members observe the court sessions, ICE agents have also allowed them a protected zone in the waiting room, so when immigrants leave their court appointments, Gutiérrez helps them arrange their affairs, sometimes taking up to 30 to 40 minutes before they walk toward the agents. She encourages them to call their families one last time and share their Alien Registration Number, and then to write phone numbers on their bodies so they can call family if they’re detained.

If they’re willing to share personal information and their keys, she offers to let their family know if they’re detained, send another team to visit them in detention, connect them with a lawyer when available and move their vehicle so it doesn’t incur fines before their family can pick it up.

Many people are in shock when judges dismiss their cases, Gutiérrez said. “It’s incomprehensible for many of them, who say, ‘I paid taxes. I already have an apartment. I have a car … why are they going to detain me?’”

At that point, Gutiérrez said, “There really is no escape. You have to pass, no matter what, by the immigration agents. So it’s like Jesus, who goes directly to the cross.”

In Los Angeles, Isaac Cuevas, director of immigration and public affairs for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, has trained about 180 priests, deacons and religious sisters in court accompaniment. While they make an effort to match parishioners who request accompaniment for immigration court with someone who has gone through the program, the vowed religious largely create their own schedules for going to courts in the area.

“If people are in need, then we try to come forward and answer that call however possible,” said Cuevas, emphasizing that they do so not by civil disobedience, but through prayer, solidarity and recommendations to seek legal advice.

In Arizona, Alicia Contreras, executive director of Corazón AZ, part of the grassroots multi-faith Faith in Action federation, said faith leaders in the state attend immigration court when community members request accompaniment. It is part of the group’s broader work, including know-your-rights and family defense planning, when a family makes plans for children, pets and bills in the event of a crisis. Corazón AZ has partnered with Puente, another Phoenix organizing group that maintains a more regular presence at the courthouse.

Corazón AZ has sent Disciples of Christ, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Catholics, Unitarian Universalists and volunteers without a specific tradition to the courthouse. The majority have been lay people.

“If I can offer a word of prayer, if I have brought folks a rosary or just sat with them, give them a gentle touch on their back, a hug when they need it, this goes a long way to calm the nerves,” Contreras said. She reminds immigrants to breathe. “We are not in control of a lot, but we are in control of our breathing.”

Fear can also cause immigrants to “black out” during their hearings, leaving them unable to remember what happened, Contreras said, explaining that faith leaders can help explain what happened afterward. In the worst cases, fear can lead community members to skip their court dates, a guaranteed way to enter deportation proceedings, she said.

Court accompaniment is an expression of faith, Contreras said.

“I know that their higher power, or in my faith tradition, God, does not want this for them,” said Contreras, a Catholic. “God is not putting the barriers, and God also is not wanting us to look away.”",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/NCR5.png?h=71976bb4&itok=cYy-Fb6S,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:46.924457

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.","WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District's police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement ""notwithstanding"" city law.

Bondi's new order Friday came after officials in the nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of the Washington police. On Thursday night. his administration escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

The attorney general's new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive that sought to put the police force under the full control of the federal government. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

The District of Columbia's police chief said Trump's earlier move to sideline her would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. ""In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,"" Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican president's administration that exists in its midst. Trump's takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city -- from the streets to the legal system -- suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city's immigration and policing policies, the district's right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

After a court hearing on the district's request for a temporary restraining order against sidelining Smith, the Trump administration and city officials reached the temporary.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn't grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

""The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can't control,"" said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The judge asked the two sides to hammer out a compromise, and promised to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn't agree.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

Washington officials were pushing in court to halt U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's order Thursday to put the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of Washington police.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation's capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it.

CHIEF HAD AGREED TO SHARE IMMIGRATION INFORMATION

Bondi's directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued practice of ""sanctuary policies,"" which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media ""there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.""

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

""Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. ""But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.""

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation's capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they've seen a ""really significant change,"" she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity ""is receiving calls almost off the hook.""

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested ""several"" people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

RESIDENTS ARE SEEING A SIGNIFICANT SHOW OF FORCE

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments -- to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting ""Protect home rule!"" and waving signs saying ""Resist!""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/16/210829727_210829727-c5bdfae541224245a1b8d9f8b44ae2f2_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:31.852504

Why did the Trump administration back down?","Advertisement

The tense standoff between the Trump White House and the District of Columbia reached a critical juncture this week. Facing an imminent restraining order, the administration abruptly scaled back its unprecedented attempt to seize direct operational control of Washington D.C.’s police force, marking a significant, though incomplete, victory for local autonomy.

DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit on August 15th challenging the administration’s move, arguing it illegally usurped the District’s authority. The situation escalated rapidly, drawing public criticism from DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Pamela Smith, who questioned the legality of White House orders forbidding police action without federal permission.

How Did DC Challenge the Trump Police Takeover?

The legal showdown reached a boiling point in court. As reported by The Guardian (August 16, 2025), U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes made her skepticism of the administration’s position abundantly clear during a hearing. Faced with Schwalb’s arguments for a restraining order, Judge Reyes directly challenged Justice Department lawyers: “I still do not understand on what basis the president, through the attorney general, through Mr. Cole, can say: ‘You, police department, can’t do anything unless I say you can.’”

Facing the near-certainty of an adverse judicial ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi swiftly issued a revised directive. The initial plan, placing Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole directly at the helm of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), was retracted. The new order states Cole will only direct Mayor Bowser “to provide such services of the Metropolitan Police Department as the attorney general deems necessary and appropriate.” This represents a significant, albeit partial, rollback of the attempted federal takeover.

What Sparked the Federal-Local Conflict?

The Trump administration justified its intervention by labeling Washington D.C. as “crime-ridden,” a claim starkly contradicted by official data showing crime at record lows. President Trump had vowed on Truth Social to reverse the perceived crime wave. However, the administration’s strategy quickly morphed into a broader clampdown on immigration, flooding DC streets with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, sometimes with chaotic results.

A core casualty was DC’s status as a sanctuary city. Previously, like Newark, New Jersey, DC generally limited cooperation with federal immigration enforcement unless an individual was implicated in a serious crime. The Trump administration’s orders effectively dismantled this policy. Under the new regime, routine interactions, like traffic stops, could potentially escalate into immigration checks and deportations, fundamentally altering the relationship between local law enforcement and immigrant communities.

What Does This Legal Win Mean for DC’s Future?

While the court’s pressure forced a retreat on direct operational control, the victory for DC remains partial. The city has lost its sanctuary city designation. Federal influence over policing priorities, particularly concerning immigration enforcement, remains significantly heightened. Chief Smith has assured the White House of continued information sharing with federal agencies.

The confrontation underscores a critical boundary. Judge Reyes’ intervention demonstrates that even a president asserting broad authority faces limits when attempting to directly commandeer local police functions without clear legal justification. However, the underlying policy shift driven by the White House – the end of DC’s sanctuary status and the increased federal role in local law enforcement – largely persists. The legal battle may have paused the most extreme power grab, but the fundamental conflict over jurisdiction and policy continues.

This partial win proves citizens and local leaders can push back against federal overreach, preserving essential checks on power even amid sweeping political agendas.

Must Know

1. What was the Trump administration’s initial goal with the DC police?

The administration cited reducing crime as the primary reason, claiming DC was “crime-ridden” despite data showing record low crime rates. The strategy quickly expanded into a major immigration enforcement operation within the city limits.

2. What specific action did DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb take?

Schwalb filed a lawsuit on August 15, 2025, challenging the legality of the White House directive and sought a temporary restraining order to block the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department.

3. Why did the Trump administration back down?

Faced with a lawsuit and strong indications from Judge Ana C. Reyes that she would grant a restraining order due to the lack of legal basis for the takeover, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a revised directive scaling back federal control before the judge could rule.

4. Did DC completely win against the Trump police takeover?

No, it was a partial victory. While the administration retreated from direct operational command of the MPD, DC lost its sanctuary city status. Federal influence over policing, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, remains significantly increased.

5. What did Judge Reyes say that was pivotal?

Judge Reyes directly questioned the legal basis, asking DOJ lawyers how the President could order the DC police not to act without White House permission, signaling she found the argument legally unsound.",https://inews.zoombangla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-cruel-law.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 01:57:03.174787

According to Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security, ICE had no involvement on campus. Her office issued a statement, shared by ICE’s San Diego Field Office, clarifying that ICE agents detained a man—identified as an unauthorized immigrant from Mexico—after he pulled into a nearby parking lot, not on school property.

Detained on Aug. 14, the man taken into custody is the father of a student at the local elementary school. Dr. Fabiola Bagula, superintendent of San Diego Unified School District, confirmed he had been waiting to pick up his child when the situation unfolded. Meanwhile, McLaughlin says he has since been placed in removal proceedings.

Despite the official explanation, the incident left many in the Linda Vista neighborhood feeling alarmed. Witnesses described seeing federal agents allegedly hitting the man’s car with their hands as they demanded he get out—and this all occurring just minutes before school let out for the day.

Dr. Bagula decried the action at a press conference on Friday morning, stating, “You can have your immigration reform without traumatizing children.” She added, “To our families and to every child, documented or not, every child had the legal right to attend public school in the United States. We will protect that right and we will do so together.”

This marks the second such incident in recent weeks, amplifying fears among families. Earlier this month, a mother was detained near Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista.

As immigration enforcement actions near schools continue to garner scrutiny, local officials maintain that schools remains a safe zone, but some parents—and students—understandably remain shaken.",https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/08/Father-picking-up-child-from-school-detained-by-ICE.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 22:56:51.472924

ICE did not respond to NPR requests for comment, but in the past agency officials have said they need more officers and detention spaces to meet administration goals. With billions of dollars of new money from Congress, ICE has launched a drive to recruit more officers and build more detention facilities.

But in the near-term, protesters and activists believe they may be able to slow the pace of arrests and deportations. Oregon is a case in point.

Creating ""noise"" and ""presence""

In Portland, demonstrators have gathered almost nightly outside ICE's field office, yelling curses through megaphones and occasionally crossing onto federal property. Federal officers have responded by shooting pepper balls and other crowd-control weapons. The building's lower windows are boarded up, covered with spray-painted curses aimed at the people working inside.

Chandler Patey, one of the few protesters who's not masked, said the group's presence keeps public attention on deportations. ""We need to be here and we need to create some amount of noise and a presence here,"" he says. ""And when ICE is here, they're not out kidnapping people, right?""

The protests have been going for more than two months, and sometimes just a few dozen people come out. They're far smaller than the protests outside of Portland's federal buildings in 2020.

Nevertheless, ICE has capitalized on the image of its Portland office under siege, and this summer White House ""border czar"" Tom Homan has twice pledged to go to Portland. So far there's no sign he has.

The late-night protests have also angered some nearby residents, and one has sued the city to get police to enforce its noise ordinance.

Despite the protests and the plywood, the ICE facility is still functioning. During the day, people with immigration cases are let in for ""check-ins,"" and some are detained. Government cars still come and go — though they often require an escort down the driveway by armed officers.

""Rapid-response"" system may also play a role

The greater impediment to large-scale arrests may be the ""rapid response"" system run by the Portland Immigration Rights Coalition and other non-profits. They run a state-wide hotline that collects ICE sightings and quickly connects arrestees with legal help.

Isa Peña is director of strategy for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups involved. She says one strategy, when they get word of an arrest, is to file a habeas corpus petition asking a court to review the legality of the detention, before ICE can transport someone to the nearest overnight detention center, across the state line in Tacoma, Wash.

""If we are able to file a habeas petition in Oregon, we have gotten orders from the judge that the individual cannot be removed out of the state,"" Peña says. ""Because ICE does not have any detention facilities [in Oregon], they are often let go.""

The fact that ICE doesn't have an overnight detention center in Oregon makes it harder to rack up arrest totals here —which lag behind neighboring states. According to data collected by the Deportation Data Project, the state saw only 103 arrests in June, and 67 from July 1-29.

""Sanctuary"" states continue to get federal criticism

Another factor complicating ICE's efforts is Oregon's long-standing ""sanctuary"" law, which limits the ability of local police and jails to hand over potential immigration law violators unless the federal agents have a warrant.

The state also funds legal services for non-citizens facing immigration charges.

Earlier this week Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was on Fox News, criticizing ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions that offer this kind of aid to people accused of immigration violations.

""These individuals that are in our country undocumented, they're breaking our laws,"" Noem said. ""What I find so astounding by so many of these leaders in these sanctuary cities and in these sanctuary states is that they're willingly encouraging and protecting people who break our laws.""

In response to this kind of criticism, Isa Peña says she doesn't think the hotline system and legal aid is making it harder for ICE to do its job.

“It does not dictate the operation of immigration law,” the judge countered, explaining that the agreement dictates the conditions of children in immigration custody.
Moreover, Gee said, the government bound itself to the consent decree nearly 30 years ago.
Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.","A federal judge in downtown Los Angeles has rejected the Trump administration’s move to terminate a 28-year-old edict governing how immigrant children are detained in federal custody.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee issued her ruling Friday, finding that “defendants fail to identify any new facts or law that warrant the termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement at this time.”

The so-called “Flores agreement” — overseen by Gee in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California — remains one of the only legal tools to prevent the prolonged incarceration of immigrant children detained at U.S. border crossings.

Approved in 1997, the settlement — named for lead plaintiff Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old detainee when the class-action complaint was filed in 1985 — requires that children be held in licensed, child-appropriate facilities and released to family members or guardians as quickly as possible. Under the terms of the settlement, Flores co-counsel are permitted to visit detention sites where children are being held and hear directly from them about their treatment and the duration of their detention.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the agreement is out of date and needed to be dissolved in order to reflect changes brought by the second Trump administration, including modifications to law, compliance, “facts,” shifts in policies and executive function.

During a hearing on Aug. 8, U.S. Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge that the Flores settlement was unusual in that it “dictates the operation of immigration law,” which should not be under the supervision of the court.

“It does not dictate the operation of immigration law,” the judge countered, explaining that the agreement dictates the conditions of children in immigration custody. Moreover, Gee said, the government bound itself to the consent decree nearly 30 years ago.

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.

Arguing for the plaintiffs on the motion to terminate, Carlos Holguin, an attorney at the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said the government wants to terminate the settlement “so it can detain children for as long as it wishes … given this administration’s propensity for hardship on children.”

Joshua McCroskey, a Justice Department attorney, responded that “there have always been difficult cases where processing takes longer periods of time. … (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) does try to transfer minors out of its custody as quickly as possible.”

The agency is looking to reopen shuttered prisons in Hudson northeast of Denver and Walsenburg in southern Colorado.

The federal government has allocated more than $170 billion for immigration enforcement. It's part of President Trump's promise of mass deportations.

This week Colorado members of Congress said ICE is close to signing a deal to add detention beds in Hudson.

On Friday, the Washington Post reported it obtained federal documents showing what ICE is planning for Colorado and other states.

That includes adding 1,400 beds in Walsenburg, 1,100 in Hudson, 28 in Ignacio on the Southern Ute reservation and 170 more beds at the current facility in Aurora -- bringing that capacity to more than 1,500 detainees, according to the Washington Post.

People in Walsenburg are wondering if a shuttered private prison will reopen as early as this fall.

""No, not in Colorado,"" said protestor Valerie Harper with Grassroots Pueblo. ""These are no longer criminals they're picking up. They're targeting Brown people and sorting it out later.""

""They're doing everything under wraps, nobody knows if they're going to open, where they're going to open,"" said protestor Eliott Kahn, who said he traveled to Walsenburg from Pueblo West.

Protestors gathered at the Huerfano County Correctional Center, where private prison company Core Civic has bid for a contract with ICE.

Kahn is concerned where this is headed.

""Everyone wants criminals deported, I mean these people in MS13 and Tren de Aragua, they're terrible people nobody minds that those people are deported. We want to stop the illegal deportations as well as the arrest of hard working immigrants. Everything is secretive. They wear masks, everything it's just all very illegal, very scary because if they come for these people they can come for us.""

Walsenburg's Mayor Gary Vezzani says reopening the Huerfano facility to detain immigrants will be a boost as the town tackles debt.

""I think ICE does a lot better more good things than they do bad things, it's too big an agency to say there isn't some bad but all in all I think you've got to support your country and they're part of our country,"" the mayor said.

Vezzani said that he's heard nothing official about the expanded detention plans for his town.

""Core Civic has never really contacted us, told us anything. They've kept it up all these years and they're just expecting back in. They have not asked our permission, they have not asked to be in joint contact, there's nothing in writing, nothing.""

ICE is close to signing a deal to reopen a facility in Hudson, according to Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat who represents Colorado's 7th Congressional District.

Vera Palyo welcomes the move.

""We need more facilities to take care of America. We don't have enough places for these people to go so they can be processed whether to stay or to go,"" Palyo said.

Rural Colorado communities are being tasked to solve a problem they say originated long ago in Washington.

""It's the Congress's fault all these people are here illegally,"" added Kahn. ""If they would pass some sensible immigration law. And then Trump killed the last immigration law so he could use it in the election.""

ICE sent a statement:

Since Jan. 20, ICE has increased detention bed space to approximately 62,000, reflecting the urgent operational need created by the prior administration's open-border policies. The reckless lack of enforcement during that time overwhelmed our systems and made these expansions not only necessary but critical to restoring law and order.

ICE has worked with private detention operators, local governments, and other federal partners to identify and bring online over 60 new detention facilities and added permanent and temporary capacity to its existing facilities for a total of approximately 18,000 additional beds active or pending activation (see attached list).

These contracts ensure ICE has the resources and infrastructure required to carry out its enforcement mission and detain illegal aliens who commit crimes and violate our immigration laws.

HAPPENING NOW: Temporary restraining order hearing in DC v. Trump, a suit filed this morning over Trump's effort to takeover the DC police. Judge Ana Reyes just took the bench. I'm listening in for @lawfaremedia.org Follow along ⬇️

Judge Reyes starts off by explaining why we're here. At the outset, she says she WON'T rule on Trump's determination that there's an ""emergency"" under section 740 of the Home Rule Act. She also won't address the ""federal purpose"" issue. Wants to focus on AG Bondi's order.

Here's Bondi's order. Judge Reyes starts by saying that the AG orders the Mayor and the DC police department to do things directly and provides that Commissioner Cole shall have authority of the Chief of Police.

Judge Reyes: I mean, why can't the executive order just actually track the language of the statute, which is to say the President is requesting of the mayor the services of the MPD to help with X, Y and Z, and Mr. Cole is going to be the liaison.

Judge Reyes: Why is it that MPD can't go out and fight street crime [without permission from feds], or that they need Mr. Cole's permission to determine how you know where to whether to send people?

Judge Reyes: Are you saying if I was the chief of police and I wanted to issue directive that everyone wear dress blues on Tuesday, I wouldn't be able to do that unless I go through Mr. Cole? I mean, that's, this is incredibly broad DOJ: They haven't identified anything like that happening

Judge Reyes: You're making the argument that the President can basically run the entire police department based on language that doesn't even allow the President to talk to the police department. He has to go through the mayor. He has to issue the order through the mayor of DC.

DOJ: In the context of an emergency application, they do have a burden of showing that this poses a real problem. Because what is the order they want to give that they can't [bc of the AG's order]? Is it wearing dress blues? What are we talking about here, and why does it need to be addressed today?

DOJ: We want this to be successful over the 30 day period. It's not a long time. We want to work with DC police/leadership in a way that doesn't create confusion and delay. And we were doing that until this suit was filed...

Judge Reyes: Every wants this to be successful but my job is to make sure it's within constitutional and statutory bounds....By the way, did you just get this today? DOJ: Yes Reyes: Nice job.. I wonder if some of this is just cleaning up the language [in the federal orders]

Now counsel is up to argue on behalf of DC. He begins: The statute says, clear as day, that the President shall ask the mayor. What I took my friends to suggest is he thinks the president can ask of the mayor to tell everyone to listen to me. If that's right...hard to know where to begin

DC: Having the mayor in the middle of the statute would be completely negated. The statute would have a self destruct button because they could say, from day one, that the president can cut the mayor out of it.

DC: Another problem is that it allows the president to make the effective appointment of the police chief. And the Home Rule act clearly gives that power to the mayor. Nothing in the statute refers to appointments....

DC: The notion that any time the district and the federal government disagree about the manner of policing, the federal government has a tool in its back pocket that says ""Home Rule is over"" as it relates to the police department...that is clearly not authorized by the statute

Reyes: If the President called the mayor and said, ""I need the services of the MPD to help ICE""...I don't think that she could say no....Would that be appropriate? DC: I think that still is directing the mayor to provide a district-wide policy

DC: It would ask the mayor to provide services in a manner that violates DC law....This is not a federal preemption provision...I see nothing in this statute that involves having some ability to override commands [of DC law]

Counsel for DC mentions other provisions of the Home Rule act, says they support idea that Congress didn't intend to give power to the president to compel DC to adopt new policies or revoke policies that the federal government doesn't like

Counsel for DC says Bondi order is subject to arbitrary and capricious review under the APA. Reyes isn't sure. DC says president delegated power to her (head of an agency, DOJ) and she took final agency action so it is subject to that review.

Reyes is back to her assist ICE hypo. Reyes: What you're saying is that you're not going to answer the question of whether or not, if the President says, ""I'm asking mayor for help from the police department to assist ICE"", that is something he can do?

In response, DC takes position that president can't direct the provision of services that otherwise violate or are inconsistent with DC law. Reyes wonder if that negates Section 740 altogether by allowing DC council to get around it by passing laws saying MPD can't assist the President

Reyes: What relief do you want me to do? I don't think I can say the full order violates the statute. I don't think statute is as narrow as you think or as broad as DOJ thinks.

DC: I think you should enjoin in two buckets. One is installation of AG's hand picked person as chief of police to operate direct control over MPD. That's flagrantly unlawful. Should be enjoined from doing that.

DC: Second bucket is to enjoin the orders in the memo...those are directed directly to the MPD. Reyes: Well, it does say in intro that she's order mayor to implement the orders....I want to get to practical solution. I agree 2, 3, and 4 may be contrary to statute but answer isn't to say start over

Reyes: We've been going for an hour and I want to give court reporter a 15 minutes break. During recess, I want counsel to try to work something out for sections 2, 3, and 4... She warns DOJ that if they don't work something out and she enters a TRO that is then violated, that's contempt of court.

Update: We're still waiting! In the meantime: If you appreciate our @lawfaremedia.org live coverage of court proceedings, I hope you'll consider supporting our non-profit newsroom. Thanks to all who already have! ❤️🥹 www.givebutter.com/journalism

ALSO: My @lawfaremedia.org colleagues will discuss this case (and other legal happenings) during our live show at 4 pm ET. With special guest @chrismirasola.bsky.social! I'll likely join the show later on, depending on when this hearing is over

We're still waiting. Perhaps DOJ and DC are still trying to work something out with respect to sections 2, 3, and 4 of Bondi's order. Not sure. Those sections of the AG's memo purport to rescind certain local orders/policies that apply to the DC police.

We're back! Judge Reyes: Alright, how am I spending my evening? Counsel for DC says that they've had productive discussions, want to continue discussions as to 2, 3, and 4. Want court to hold in abeyance (not rule yet) as to those sections. Still think section 1 unlawful, want to be heard on 5

Reyes says she'd be happy to hear argument on Sectio 5 but she doesn't see how she can enjoin that section, essentially tells police to follow existing DC law",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-16 20:57:41.315046

Red scare committees used a variety of tactics to subdue their radical foes.
Indeed, compelling troves of data from radical movements has long been a core red scare tactic.","AS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE took to the streets of Los Angeles to defend their communities against state-sanctioned abductions of immigrants this June, the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism (SSCC) put three organizations—Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA), and the independent political organization Unión del Barrio (UdB)—on notice. Led by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, the SSCC normally oversees anti-terrorism enforcement and policy, and directs the work of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Justice Department Criminal Division. But in a letter dated June 11th, the SSCC accused the three leftist organizations of supporting “coordinated protests and riots” against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal law enforcement agencies. The letter called the LA uprisings “lawless mob actions,” and demanded the organizations “cease and desist” any further actions “aiding and abetting” the “criminal” protests. Even more notably, the three groups were instructed to preserve all communications and contractual, financial, travel, and strategy information related to their role in “planning, coordinating, or funding” the protests; failure to do so could result in a criminal investigation.

On the surface, the SSCC letter appeared to home in on a grassroots resistance campaign against the Trump regime’s escalation of the U.S.’s already draconian immigration policies. However, the commitment of government resources to criminalize, harass, and intimidate social justice organizations, and the express intent to seize their communications, signals a broader campaign of anti-radical repression—one that has historically been known by the name “red scare.” Though “red scare” is commonly used to refer to discrete historical moments of anti-left attack, most notably the periods of 1919-1920 and 1950-1954, historian Robbie Lieberman has argued that the term can be used more broadly to characterize any campaign of “attack on civil liberties in the name of Americanism aimed at undermining movements for justice and equality.” This broader definition illuminates how red scares have been an enduring feature of 20th and 21st century U.S. politics, and clarifies the outlines of the iteration that is developing in our own time.

Historically, red scares arise to suppress protest movements that emerge at the intersection of war, economic turmoil, and racialized violence. The red scare of 1919-1920, for instance, took place in the aftermath of World War I and amidst U.S. intervention in Russia against the Bolsheviks in 1918, in a period also characterized by high inflation and the “Red Summer” of anti-Black riots across the U.S. in 1919. At the time, organizations including the Socialist Party, the Industrial Workers of the World, the Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the African Blood Brotherhood arose to challenge U.S. imperialism, racism, and capitalist exploitation, drawing the ire of the government and triggering a red scare. Similarly, in 1950-1954, another red scare emerged as the Korean and Cold Wars took off alongside a fierce capitalist class assault on unions and rampant state and societal violence against African Americans that the 1951 “We Charge Genocide” petition described as constituting genocide. Once again, movements for peace, racial justice, economic redistribution, and international solidarity emerged, only to find themselves facing a protracted campaign of anti-radical repression.

The resulting red scares routinely codified militant challenges to U.S. racial capitalism as foreign-inspired or otherwise un-American. In the 1919-1920 red scare, for example, the Overman Committee, a subsidiary of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was created to investigate un-American activities and the influence of Bolshevism in the U.S. In the 1950-1954 red scare, the Attorney General’s List of Subversive Organizations, a compilation of primarily leftwing organizations deemed threatening to the order and stability of the United States, identified groups for censure. These efforts launched congressional hearings meant to discredit dissident organizations, leading to left groups being blacklisted, their members barred from participation in other groups and institutions, hounded by the FBI, and worse. (Indeed, as evident in the case of the Peekskill Riot in 1949—where civil society, police, and the New York governor colluded to violently attack accused communists, leading to attempted lynchings and thousands of injuries from knives, rocks, and fists—such red scares could even legitimate the use of armed force to crush radical protest.) Through the use of such anti-left committees and a range of other repressive measures—the convergence of all three branches of government in curtailing freedom of speech, assembly, and association; the central role of the corporate media in demonizing “enemies”; bans on “heretical” literature; and anti-intellectualism and attacks on the university—past red scares wreaked havoc on progressive politics in the U.S. They encouraged the expulsion of accused communists, who were some of the left’s most effective organizers, from mainstream organizations. They also led to the narrowing of the struggle for racial justice by removing its internationalist focus; created the groundwork for a repeated misconstruing of domestic peace protest as abetting the enemies of the U.S.; and generally cultivated an atmosphere of fear and suspicion that discouraged militancy over the decades.

Today, we are in another such red scare conjuncture. The U.S. is the enthusiastic partner of Zionist aggression across historic Palestine and the region more broadly, including the genocide in Gaza, the savage bombing of Lebanon and Syria, and most recently, the “12-Day War” between Israel and Iran. The U.S. has also used bombing as a key instrument of foreign policy, launching more than 500 airstrikes in 249 locations, from Somalia to Yemen, in the past seven months; imposing and maintaining brutal and deadly sanctions on more than two dozen countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe; and most recently, taking aim at international institutions like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court in an effort to illegitimize them. Domestically, meanwhile, the government has eroded almost all social safety nets; promoted deregulation and corporate price gouging, leading to inflation and widespread economic suffering; engaged in mass firings and layoffs; and escalated its bid to weaken a resurgent labor movement. All this has been accompanied by escalating government and vigilante white supremacist assaults on racialized minorities, including migrants (documented and undocumented), Palestinians, Arabs, Muslims, and Black people.

As in the past, the violence and dehumanization of U.S. imperialism has not gone uncontested. There have been mass mobilizations, like those in LA, against ICE; rebellion against the construction of “cop cities,” most prominently in Atlanta; and nationwide student encampments and grassroots campaigns fighting for Palestinian liberation. Black and brown people have confronted white nationalist vigilantism; women and LGBTQ+ folks have established national networks to protect their rights and bodies; and workers and labor unions have launched strikes for better wages and conditions. Unsurprisingly, another red scare has emerged that aims to degrade and demoralize these movements with well-worn tactics of red-baiting, charges of conspiracy, targeted harassment, criminalization, deportation, and other repressive measures. As this anti-radical campaign escalates, it becomes important to look back into how these tactics have been deployed in the past. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.

RED SCARES RECAST legitimate political thought and action as threats and conspiracies. Speaking in 1949 before the House Committee on Foreign Relations, W.E.B. Du Bois, the Black intellectual and co-chair of the Council on African Affairs (CAA), referred to this practice of mischaracterization as the invention of “witchwords.” “If in 1850 an American disliked slavery, the word of exorcism was ‘abolitionist.’ He was a ‘nigger lover.’ He believed in free love and murder of kind slave masters. He ought to be lynched and mobbed,” Du Bois said.

Today the word is ‘communist’. . . If anybody questions the power of wealth, wants to build more [Tennessee Valley Authorities], or advocates civil rights for Negroes, he is a communist, a revolutionist, a scoundrel, and is liable to lose his job or land in jail.

In the red scare moments after World War I, in the midst of the Great Depression, during the early Cold War, at the start of the civil rights movement, and beyond, such witchwords have allowed the state to circumscribe the rights and privileges of its critics. That trend continues into the present, with today’s witchwords including diversity, equity, and inclusion, or “DEI,” aimed at crushing any modicum of power, privilege, or access gained by minoritized people, particularly Black women; “antisemitism,” bastardized to mean any criticism of Israel or Zionism; “wokeness,” meant to denigrate racialized people generally, and Black people particularly, who challenge racial domination; and “domestic terrorism,” applied to any number of militant protestors, from those who reject cop cities to those who support Palestinian liberation. Prior to the June 2025 LA uprising, PSL had already been accused of antisemitism by mainstream media outlets for its pro-Palestine positions, demonstrating the way that witchwords help establish narratives of subversiveness that red scares can later capitalize on.

In addition to using witchwords, red scares justify crackdowns against left militancy by casting it as a pre-eminent threat to the law and its enforcement. Starting in 1919, J. Edgar Hoover, the founding and longest-serving director of the FBI (formerly the Bureau of Investigation) who worked closely with various anti-radical Congressional committees, continually asserted that it was the violent criminal elements that believed in and proffered radical doctrines like communism. “Disrespect for law and order is a fundamental cornerstone of communist tactics,” Hoover asserted. “Charges of ‘police brutality,’ ‘illegal arrest,’ and ‘persecution’ have long echoed in the Party press. These false communist charges, unfortunately, have been taken up by other groups whose basic purpose is to destroy law and order and to create chaos.” In its June letter, the SSCC employed the same line of argumentation, casting anti-ICE protests as “lawless mob action” and “criminal conduct,” and construing protestors as a danger to law enforcement—despite the latter maintaining a monopoly on force and violence.

Alongside the witchwords and accusations of lawlessness used to vilify radicals, red scares are marked by the deployment of Congressional committees to harass, humiliate, and discredit radicals through vicious, biased interrogations intent on establishing their “un-Americanness.” Examples of such committees abound. The 1918 Overman Committee was organized to investigate “pro-German” and “Bolshevik” elements in the United States. The 1930 Special Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the United States, also known as the Fish Committee, was convened at the urging of American Federation of Labor leader Matthew Woll to investigate radicals accused of being funded by the Soviet Union. In 1934, the McCormack-Dickenstein Committee was formed to investigate Nazi propaganda in the United States but quickly turned its attention to the “dangers” of communism. There was the 1938 Dies Committee, which was a select committee organized to investigate “subversive” and “un-American” activity and was later transformed into the permanent House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1945, perhaps the most notorious and damaging of the anti-radical committees. The Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) was formed as a result of the passage of the McCarran Act of 1950, and required communist and communist “front” organizations to register with the government or face five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee was created in 1951 to oversee the enforcement of the McCarran Act and to investigate subversive activities including espionage, sabotage, and infiltration by those under the control of a foreign government or organization. The list goes on.

Congressional committees continue to be used to anti-radical ends today. In addition to the SSCC, the House Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security’s effectiveness in fulfilling domestic security and counterterrorism measures, recently held a hearing on “The Rise of Anti-Israel Extremist Groups and Their Threat to U.S. National Security,” which conflated advocacy for Palestinian liberation with antisemitism and support for terrorism. Likewise, the Committee on Education and the Workforce, charged with overseeing an array of programs and policies related to legislation such as the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, and the Higher Education Act, convened the hostile show hearings investigating “antisemitism” on college campuses, in addition to the hearing “Examining the Policies and Priorities of the Department of Labor,” which aimed to further curtail the power of unions and to root out the “radical DEI agenda” from the workforce. Taken together, these committees continue what American Studies scholar Michael Paul Rogin called a “countersubversive political tradition” aimed at creating, stigmatizing, and revoking the rights of critics of the U.S. government.

Throughout the 20th century, the dissidents who most interested red scare committees were those organizing on behalf of racialized groups. For instance, W. Alphaeus Hunton (dubbed the “unsung valiant” by his wife and biographer Dorothy Hunton), who worked alongside the likes of famed singer and activist Paul Robeson and W.E.B. Du Bois from the 1930s to the1960s in movements on behalf of Black equality, workers’ rights, and African decolonization, faced more than two decades of government attack in his role as the chairman of the labor committee of the Washington, DC, chapter of the National Negro Congress (NNC), trustee of the Civil Rights Bail Fund, and educational director of the CAA. In particular, during World War II, Hunton was branded a communist and a subversive by the Fish Committee because of his instrumental role in organizing Black workers in a campaign against the Glen Martin Aircraft Factory for refusing to hire them. The NNC was accused of attempting to sabotage the defense industry by infiltrating the factory with Black communist workers, leading Hunton to later note that “the history of all the congressional investigating committees from Martin Dies on down to the present McCarthy and Velde committees has been one of victimizing the fighters against Jim Crow.” Hunton’s assessment can be just as easily applied to today’s SSCC, which seeks to intimidate and discipline PSL, CHIRLA, and UdB for opposing the United States’ racist, imperialist immigration policy and the cruel and unusual tactics being used to enforce it.

Red scare committees used a variety of tactics to subdue their radical foes. The Fish Committee, for instance, did not call Hunton to testify, but it nonetheless spread “slanderous testimony without making the slightest effort to corroborate facts,” in the words of Dorothy Hunton; it was only when Hunton insisted that he had the right to face his accusers that he was told he had been “exonerated” of charges of subversion and disloyalty. More aggressive techniques were also used: In 1951, Hunton was imprisoned for contempt for six months for refusing to “name names” during a HUAC hearing. Specifically, he would not disclose the names of those who donated to the Civil Rights Bail Fund, which had been organized in 1946 to aid in the legal defense of those radicals who were rejected by private bond companies because of their politics. Here, HUAC not only turned Hunton’s activism into a crime, but also reframed the right to confidentiality into a threat to national security as it sought to expose radical groups’ donors to potential harassment and persecution. In demanding the same type of information from PSL, CHIRLA, and UdB on pain of a criminal investigation, the SSCC is similarly poised to cast a pall of criminality on radical organizations and their associates alike.

Indeed, compelling troves of data from radical movements has long been a core red scare tactic. The purpose of this is twofold. First, access to these records allows investigative committees to establish guilt by association to criminalize not only direct targets, but also anyone affiliated with the organization, however loosely, through donations, sympathy, indirect engagement (such as being on a mailing list), and so forth. Second, demanding an astronomical amount of information allows red scare committees to drain left organizations of resources, time, and manpower; to distract them from important organizing work; and to open them up to penalty for non-compliance. An example of the effectiveness of this tactic is the Subversive Activities Control Board’s demand for all correspondence between Hunton’s CAA and the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress. The committee demanded all communications and materials published and circulated from 1946 to 1955, and all records of funds sent internationally; it later accused the CAA of potentially violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act in order to gain access to the organization’s records. The resulting pressure was so insurmountable that in 1955, on Hunton’s recommendation, the CAA closed down after 18 years because ongoing government harassment had made it “difficult if not impossible to function.” Read in this context, it becomes clear that the SSCC’s attempt to strongarm sensitive information from a handful of left organizations portends a much broader strategy aimed at creating a wide dragnet to extirpate today’s radical movements.

The cumulative effect of these red scare tactics has been devastating for the U.S. left. As a result of these anti-radical campaigns, some of the ablest organizers in the U.S.’s long civil rights movement were ostracized and abandoned; the Black struggle for human rights was diluted to narrowly focus on civil rights; the peace movement was sidelined by charges of Soviet inspiration; and anti-colonialism became tolerable only when it was framed as a means of combatting communist influence in the Global South. It became commonplace for the threats of incarceration, deportation, passport suspension, and financial ruin to stalk those who levied militant challenges to the status quo, and these threats routinely discouraged everyday citizens from taking on political views that could be construed as “un-American” or subversive (or, in today’s parlance, “woke”). The aim of red scares, past and present, has been to get the public to become quiescent in the face of interlinked crises; it is a goal at which the government has too often succeeded.

But government success is not totalizing, especially when the oppressed fight back. One relevant lesson would be a willingness to work together across sectarian differences in order to combat state repression. In Hunton’s time, progressive groups such as the NAACP and the International Labor Defense worked together despite stark ideological differences to combat white supremacy. We should continue that practice today; the collaboration of PSL, CHIARA, and UdB during the anti-ICE protests demonstrates its efficacy. Secondly, mid-century radicals knew that in the face of government repression, the left needed to mount a defensive front. To that end, they organized defense committees and bail funds, mobilized the grassroots, and cultivated national and international allies in the cause of mutual protection. Collectivized resources, people power, and knowledge sharing are our best hope for effectively combatting U.S. government attacks.",https://mronline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-15-at-102020-AM.png,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:37.457845

New Zealander Sarah Shaw and her son were detained by ICE at the Canadian border last month after she dropped off her two eldest children at Vancouver International Airport.

Shaw, an employee at the state Department of Children, Youth, and Families, works at Echo Glen Children’s Center, a medium/maximum security juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie.

Thorward said Shaw holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that authorized her to work in the U.S. The combo card can also function as a travel document, but Shaw didn’t realize that part of the card was no longer valid, Thorward said. Only the work authorization part had been recently renewed.

It should have been a simple issue to fix, but instead it led to Shaw’s detainment at the border, Thorward said.

“It was completely unnecessary for that to happen,” she said. “There was no reason for it.”

A DCYF spokesperson confirmed earlier this month that Shaw’s employment eligibility was verified when she was hired. Her son had valid travel authorization, their attorney said.

Following their detainment, the mother and son were held at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, Thorward said.

Shaw’s two older children are in New Zealand visiting their grandparents, Thorward said.

Victoria Besancon, Shaw’s close friend, said “being detained in the facility was very difficult for both her and her son.”

Shaw is her kids’ only financial support, and she’s worried about her bills and providing for the family, Besancon said. Besancon, who said she met Shaw almost four years ago when she came to the U.S., organized a GoFundMe fundraiser for her friend.

In the past year, there have been multiple cases of families with children — some U.S. citizens — being detained by immigration officers. Four American children were released last month after being detained with their mother for two weeks by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. In May, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported a pregnant mother of four spent three weeks in custody at Blaine Border Patrol Station.

Besancon noted Shaw’s son moved to the U.S. when he was around 2.

“All he’s ever known is America as his home,” she said. “So he didn’t understand why they were being treated like criminals.”

People of any age can contact 988, teens included.
And I think that’s what teens need.” Teen Line isn’t intended to be a replacement for long-term therapy or other necessary professional services, Didi Hirsch Chief Executive Lyn Morris said.","There are a lot of reasons why people reach out to Teen Line, a Century City-based hotline that connects young people in crisis to trained teenage volunteers.

They call because someone is hurting them or they are afraid of hurting themselves. They text because an important relationship has ended or a troubling conflict has started. They feel disrespected, disregarded, dismissed.

At the heart of almost every call, text or email is the same cry of pain: Nobody is listening.

So the teenagers on the receiving end do what they wish adults would make time for more often, the thing nobody seems to be doing enough of these days: They listen.

Almost every single time, for at least the length of a call or a chat session, it’s enough.

“Even if their situation is really difficult, the best that we can do at the start is always just to listen,” said volunteer Mendez, 18. (The volunteers’ last names are withheld to protect their privacy and anonymity.) “And even if we don’t have a solution for them, I feel like that is one thing that just helps them so much.”

A project of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, Teen Line is helping to fill an ever-widening gap between the need for mental health support and the resources available.

The phone and text lines are available to youth throughout the U.S. and Canada, and the email address can be used by teens anywhere in the world. Volunteers fielded 8,886 calls, texts and emails in 2024. Managers expect the total will surpass 10,000 this year.

The percentage of high school students who report feeling consistently sad or lonely has risen steadily in the last decade. A study published last fall by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 39.7% of students said they experienced persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and 20.4% had seriously considered dying by suicide.

At the same time, government spending cuts have hit many support services.

The Trump administration announced in April that it will stop paying $1 billion in federal grants that school districts nationwide have been using to hire psychologists and social workers.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” that Congress passed in May proposes major cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which millions of Americans rely on to access mental healthcare for themselves and their kids.

In July, the administration removed an option on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Hotline that allowed young people identifying as LGBTQ+ to connect directly with counselors specially trained in supporting queer youth. More than 1.3 million queer young people in the U.S. have used the service since its launch in 2022.

None of this has deterred the 60 to 70 young volunteers at Teen Line, who commit to 65 hours of initial training and a minimum of two five-hour shifts per month. The program receives no federal funding and relies entirely on grants and private donations.

Each evening, eight to 12 high school students file into a sunny office in Century City, often after a long day of classes, homework, practices and part-time jobs.

They raid the snack room, settle into cubicles, pick up headsets and spend the next few hours talking and typing with fellow teens seeking support.

The lines are open for calls and texts from 6 to 10 p.m. Pacific Time each evening (the text option closes one hour earlier). Emails can be sent any time of the day or night.

They share an office with adult volunteers for the 988 hotline. With its collection of hand-painted canvases and stuffed animals, though, the Teen Line corner is easy to pick out in the sea of staid cubicles.

Didi Hirsch is by far the largest of the 12 centers in California that respond to 988. Last year, the organization fielded nearly 40% of the 454,146 calls to 988 placed in the state.

Total calls to the crisis hotline this year have already surpassed last year’s number, with more than 462,000 calls from California alone, a Didi Hirsch spokesperson said.

People of any age can contact 988, teens included. But a call or text to Teen Line, which has its own 800 number, guarantees a response from a peer who likely understands better than most well-meaning adults what it’s like to be a teenager today.

The public discussion about the youth mental health crisis “really becomes removed from the actual reality of what it’s like to be a teen, because the people having these conversations aren’t teens. They’re people kind of trying to look through the window from outside the glass,” said volunteer Max, 15.

The stereotype of today’s teenagers as anxious loners hunched over their phones is limiting and inaccurate, she said, as four fellow volunteers nodded in agreement.

It’s not that teens are cut off from real life. It’s that so much is coming at them that it can be hard to know how to field it all.

“Being a teen is a time of huge responsibility, but with so little control and so little power,” Max continued. “You’re not the one making decisions about your education. You’re not the one deciding where you live or what you’re doing until you get to college, and there’s so much pressure to succeed. ... We encourage them to think about their situation differently. We don’t hand them a different set of cards, but we encourage them to approach it differently. And I think that’s what teens need.”

Teen Line isn’t intended to be a replacement for long-term therapy or other necessary professional services, Didi Hirsch Chief Executive Lyn Morris said. But it can be a “stepping stone” for overwhelmed young people who aren’t sure where to turn or how to ask for help, she said.

Members of every generation have complained in adolescence that adults don’t understand them. But given the number of stressors that didn’t exist until recently — social media, school lockdown drills, accelerating climate change — today’s teenagers are very often justified in feeling that way.

“We don’t have experience in that stuff,” Morris said. “Thank God the teens have each other.”

It’s too soon to know how cuts to 988 and other services will affect Teen Line’s caller volume. Volunteers said they’re already hearing from people affected by recent policy changes. This includes teens who live in states that ban abortion and are worried that they might be pregnant, and those who tried calling the 988 suicide hotline but couldn’t get through to any operators in their state.

In the meantime, for adults concerned about the adolescents in their own lives, volunteers offered some sage advice.

Before whisking the phone away from a teen who’s too absorbed in their screen, ask what they’re trying to distract themselves from. Listen to teens’ opinions when they’re moved to share them. And don’t be afraid to say the hardest things out loud.

“Beating around the bush can be really suffocating,” said Jules, 17. “Suicidal ideation, suicidal thoughts, self-injury, stuff like that — just not calling it for what it is can be really harmful. ... Just letting them get it off their chest, and not keep it in or be ashamed of their thoughts, can have a really big impact. You don’t realize how much of a relief speaking and talking about it and being listened to can have.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e87f48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc1%2F2c%2F4289902f44f5b78cbd0b562d2bbf%2F517468-la-me-teen-line-volunteers-help-peers-in-need-jey-16.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:25.144430

Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience.
Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.
Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed.
Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on.","Late last month, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it waspreparing to slash $1 billion from grants that it gives communities to prepare for disaster, even though the agency’s internal memos acknowledge that this will leave the U.S. more vulnerable to “catastrophic incidents.” The cuts will target everything from transport infrastructure to the much-touted Next Generation Warning System, which used local media to help communities issue alerts to residents in the face of extreme weather events.

In an era of multibillion-dollar climate disasters, Donald Trump’s administration is fixated on both denying the realities of climate change — and hence the need for government agencies to prepare for climate-related disasters — and on eviscerating the roles of key federal government agencies, including FEMA.

In 2023, FEMA’s budget was just shy of $30 billion. This year, it was more than $33 billion. But that increase in overall spending hasn’t protected certain parts of FEMA’s budget from significant cuts, particularly those that are aimed at protecting communities from the worst impacts of disasters. The agency has seen mitigation efforts it coordinates reduced by $25 million; port security grants have lost $40 million; education, training, and exercises have lost $100 million; and federal assistance programs have seen a whopping $700 million hit.

Unless Trump follows through on his stated plans to scrap the entire agency, the overall FEMA budget for next year will again grow to $36 billion if the administration’s current budget proposals are enacted. But FEMA’s fiscal year 2026 budget hides a vast redistribution of funds away from disaster preparation and response, especially around climate change and anti-homelessness efforts.

Showcasing the new priorities, in a truly obscene departure from FEMA’s traditional disaster-relief mission, the agency is offering up more than $600 million to states to help them build immigration jails. And, earlier this year, FEMA froze the distribution of more than $10 billion to help rebuild disaster-hit hospitals, community centers, and other organizations, in an effort to root out any agency or group that might in any way be aiding undocumented immigrants. It has also slow-walked the distribution of funds to help rebuild Los Angeles’s Altadena and Palisades areas following the historic fires, likely worsened by climate change, this past January. Moreover, FEMA has put a hold on dollars already allocated to the Emergency Food and Shelter Program spending, while, according to reporting by the American Prospect, preparing to divert dollars from its Shelter and Services program to reimburse Florida for costs associated with building the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp.

The latest cuts to federal grants come on top of a tranche of other reductions in spending on vital climate change-related areas — and in addition to ongoing Trump administration efforts to eliminate the agency. Some of these cuts are to FEMA programs, and involve the elimination of jobs specifically focused on building climate resilience. Others are to NOAA weather stations and climate change monitoring outposts, as well as cuts to the National Weather Service.

Since Trump’s inauguration in January, roughly one-third of FEMA’s staff have either been fired, resigned, or retired, leaving the agency desperately short-handed. At the same time, the federal government is raising the financial damage threshold for when to declare a disaster, and is limiting how much the feds will reimburse victims of these disasters. The Urban Institute has calculated that had these more restrictive criteria been in place between 2008 and 2024, 71 percent of disasters would not have qualified for federal relief, shifting more than $40 billion in disaster-response spending from the federal government onto the backs of already cash-strapped states and local governments.

None of this is accidental. The Trump administration appears to be operating on the assumption that if it just denies the realities of the climate crisis loudly enough, then magically, global warming will not occur. Witness the news that the Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of unraveling its own rules that allow it to regulate, and set limits on, the emissions of CO2, methane and the other gases that contribute to global warming. The result will be massively increased emissions (as much as 7.2 billion additional tons by 2055); an accelerated climate calamity; billions of dollars a year in health expenses related to global warming and dirtier air; and a federal government emergency response system that simply shrugs in the face of disaster.

Of course, not all disasters will be responded to equally. We are getting a glimpse of the desperately uneven and politicized disaster response future in the denial of FEMA assistance to communities in the western part of Maryland after heavy flooding in May. Maryland is Democrat-led (though the most-flooded counties voted for Trump in 2024). By contrast, West Virginia, which is heavily pro-Trump, quickly received assistance following flooding from a similar weather system a few weeks later. And Trump went out of his way to say GOP-dominated Texas would be taken care of following the deadly floods this summer, quickly signing a disaster declaration to allow federal dollars to flow to the state, even while he continued to threaten to deny disaster-response dollars to California because of its opposition to his immigration policies.

Yet in this era of stark cuts, even the reddest of states aren’t guaranteed that the feds will open the financial spigot. Communities in Arkansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina have also had their aid requests nixed in the wake of massive tornado, hurricane, and storm damage, with the feds arguing — in language reminiscent of the anti-welfare arguments long used by conservatives — that if FEMA is seen as being too lax on states, it encourages something of a dependency culture.

State and local officials are warning that they are struggling to hold the line. Agencies with only a handful of staff can’t generate the sort of response that a huge federal agency — with extensive pools of manpower, equipment, and expertise — can draw on. Anyone who has ever bought insurance can understand this concept: A large insurer has the resources to pay out claims allowing homeowners and communities to rebuild after a disaster that those individuals wouldn’t have if simply left to their own devices. Yet, under Trump, FEMA’s role of pooling resources in order to marshal large responses to disaster is being deliberately eviscerated by the ideologues now in charge of the federal government. As a result, many communities — especially those that are smaller and poorer (and, paradoxically, oftentimes more Republican) — will struggle more than would otherwise have been the case to recover from disasters.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2221173527-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:28.984715

The latest wave of immigration enforcement raids began earlier this summer and has continued despite ongoing legal challenges that have placed limits on some enforcement tactics.","A new report from the University of California, Riverside warns that aggressive immigration enforcement practices in the United States are fueling a public health emergency for children in mixed-status families.

The report, published in Psychiatric News, was authored by mental health professionals in the UCR School of Medicine and outlines how detention, deportation and workplace raids are contributing to widespread emotional trauma among both immigrant and U.S.-born children.

“Psychiatry, as both a clinical discipline and a social institution, cannot remain on the periphery,” the authors wrote. “The current moment calls for a reexamination of how structural and intergenerational trauma are diagnosed, understood, and treated.”

The study details how children experience chronic anxiety, developmental disruptions and academic difficulties due to fear of family separation. Infants and toddlers may suffer attachment issues, while school-age children show signs of fear and anxiety, and adolescents often take on adult responsibilities, a phenomenon known as “parentification.”

“We are witnessing the effects of chronic fear, disrupted attachment, and intergenerational trauma on a massive scale,” said Dr. Lisa Fortuna, chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at UCR and lead psychiatrist on the report. “The threat or reality of separation from a caregiver fundamentally reshapes a child’s development and mental health.”

The report urges members of the media, policymakers and clinicians to confront the “human costs” of enforcement-driven immigration systems and to prioritize the emotional wellbeing of the youngest and most vulnerable.

“It’s hard to see how current enforcement can ever be humane,” said coauthor Dr. Kevin Gutierrez. “These practices create chronic stress and trauma in children and meet criteria for PTSD.”

The report also includes case studies and community data that researchers say illustrates how trauma transfers across generations, and is made worse by poverty, racism and the constant threat of enforcement.

Fortuna and Gutierrez sat down with UCR News to discuss the report, which can be found here.

The latest wave of immigration enforcement raids began earlier this summer and has continued despite ongoing legal challenges that have placed limits on some enforcement tactics.

Federal agents have conducted high-profile operations across Southern California, including one this week in Los Angeles that coincided with a speech by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Since the surge began, at least two people have died during these immigration enforcement operations, including a farmworker in Camarillo who fell from a greenhouse in July, and a man struck by a vehicle after fleeing a Home Depot in Monrovia on Thursday.

The Los Angeles Unified School District celebrated the new school year earlier this week, but the joy was short-lived after a 15-year-old boy with disabilities was detained outside Arleta High School on Monday, according to District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho.

“This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,” Carvalho told reporters.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/AP25192726071193.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:34.135149

“Fight the Trump Takeover” was anchored in Austin, Texas, with other sites spread nationwide.
“Texas House Democrats are blocking a redistricting vote in the Texas House right now to Stop the Trump Takeover,” a website for the protests says.
“Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a statement.
In June, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, millions turned out to more than 2,000 sites nationwide for “No Kings” protests.","Thousands gathered in cities and towns across 34 states on Saturday for a national day of protest against Republican redistricting plans in Texas and elsewhere.

“Fight the Trump Takeover” was anchored in Austin, Texas, with other sites spread nationwide.

In Austin alone, more than 5,000 protestors gathered at the city’s capitol in a show of defiance. Videos and photos on social media showed protestors holding various signs that read: “Abbott is a vote thief,” referring to the state’s Republican governor and “Fight the Trump takeover.”

Others chanted in a rally, yelling: “Shame on Abbott” and “The people, united, will never be divided.”

Speakers at the rally in Austin included the 95-year-old labor activist Dolores Huerta, Texas congressman Greg Casar and former congressman Beto O’Rourke.

“Texas House Democrats are blocking a redistricting vote in the Texas House right now to Stop the Trump Takeover,” a website for the protests says. “But Trump has made it clear that he’s not stopping at Texas. He’s targeting Missouri, Ohio, Florida and every state he can twist to help him steal Congress.”

The protests came as Texas Republicans are considering a mid-decade redistricting plan at Donald Trump’s request that would add five additional Republican House seats to the red state. In response Democratic lawmakers have left the state in protest, depriving the statehouse of a quorum needed to move its plans ahead.

“Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn’t end here,” Drucilla Tigner, executive director of Texas For All, said in a statement. “This isn’t just about redistricting or one state’s politics. It’s about the future of our democracy.”

Before the rally, O’Rourke wrote on X: “Thanks to everyone who has joined us in this fight for Texas, we’ve been able to donate over $1 MILLION to the Texas Legislative Black Caucus, the Texas House Democratic Caucus, and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus during the special session.”

On Thursday, the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, announced Democrats there would move ahead with a plan to redistrict the blue state in response to Texas’s effort. But, Newsom said, the plan for new California maps would only take effect if Texas or other red states pushed ahead with their own plans for partisan redistricting.

Texas Democrats said on Thursday that they would return to the state after a nearly two-week absence if certain conditions were met, including Republicans ending their special session and California introducing its new map that would add five Democratic seats to offset Texas’s proposal.

“The incredible support we’re seeing – not just back home in Texas, but from Democrats, Republicans and independents across the country – proves this fight is bigger than any one state,” said congressman Gene Wu, chair of the Texas house Democrats. “We’re defending our entire country from the Trump takeover, and I’m honored to stand with every patriotic American who refuses to let extremists rig the system.”

Major left-leaning organizations including Indivisible and MoveOn helped organize and support the protests, as is the Democratic National Committee. “Trump knows the only way he can hold the majority after his budget betrayal is by changing the rules in the middle of the game to avoid accountability for ripping healthcare and food away from millions of Americans,” the DNC chair, Ken Martin, told NBC News.

Organizers used an approach they have honed in the second Trump administration – holding protests in places big and small to show that dissent against the administration exists in all corners of the country.

Saturday’s protests also took place across the country, including in Washington DC where hundreds staged a demonstration outside the White House, carrying signs and banners that read: “No Kings in America Since 1776” and “Not Normal, Not American”.

An April day of protest called “Hands Off” drew people to more than 1,000 sites. In June, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, millions turned out to more than 2,000 sites nationwide for “No Kings” protests. Other days of action themed around labor and immigrants rights and voting rights also brought out tens of thousands of people on weekdays.

Planning is under way for another mass day of protest set for Labor Day, on 1 September.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc94b52b74e3a8efff1a032be075958524fa553/139_0_2861_2289/master/2861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff306338ce504ccfe2612d8766e182ad",N,,2025-08-16 18:56:30.675845

One of the administration’s first actions was to rescind Biden-era guidance that restricted immigration enforcement operations “in or near” certain protected places, including schools.
It happened to an entire school community,” San Diego Unified School District Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said Friday at a news conference outside the school.
In December, the San Diego Unified School District passed a resolution reaffirming its commitment to being a “welcoming district” for all students.","A parent waiting nearby to pick up his child from Linda Vista Elementary School was arrested Thursday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, school officials said.

The arrest occurred days after the start of the school year, and a week after another parent — who an immigration judge had ordered deportation in absentia — was taken into custody by federal immigration agents outside an elementary school in Chula Vista during morning drop-off.

Immigration enforcement arrests have increased locally within the first months of the Trump administration. One of the administration’s first actions was to rescind Biden-era guidance that restricted immigration enforcement operations “in or near” certain protected places, including schools.

Families and officials alike said such enforcement actions during school drop-off or pickup can send fear through the community.

“This did just not happen to one household. It happened to an entire school community,” San Diego Unified School District Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said Friday at a news conference outside the school. “It left children, families and staff, with questions and fears that no one, especially our youngest learners, should have to carry.”

Thursday’s arrest happened about 3:10 p.m., just before school dismissal, as the man waited in a line of cars near the campus, school officials said. Other families were present, but not students, officials added.

On Saturday, Tricia McLaughlin, the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement that ICE did not target the school, and that the arrest did not took place on school grounds.

She said the operation was targeting a man originally from Mexico who was “fraudulently using an American’s social security number.”

McLaughlin said officers approached the man after he pulled over in a parking lot. He was arrested and placed in removal proceedings, she added.

“Any smears that ICE targeted an elementary school are contributing to the 1000% increase in assaults against our brave ICE law enforcement.”

Homeland Security officials called the school’s principal, Miriam Atlas, following the arrest. She then informed the child’s mother of the situation, Bagula said.

“We have added counselors and district staff at the school today because the ripple effects of an incident like this extend far beyond the moment itself,” Bagula said. “They live in the stories that children will tell for the rest of their lives, in the questions they ask and in the worry that they carry home.”

Sabrina Bazzo, a trustee on the San Diego Unified School District board, referred to the incident as “unacceptable.”

“How do we expect our students to stay focused on learning when they have to worry about their parents and family members not feeling safe right outside this door,” she said.

Bazzo said she had heard that some parents had started organizing to pick up other students in case their parents felt uncomfortable about coming to school.

While dropping off their children at school Friday, some shared concerns about such enforcement near schools.

The mother of a first-grade student, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, said she learned of the arrest on social media. “I’m afraid. I don’t know what might happen,” she said in Spanish. “The situation is worrying.”

Another mother, who walked her two children to school, said they have told her they are afraid. She also asked not to be identified out of fear for her safety.

Her 10-year-old daughter said that she fears for her family. “This has really changed my life,” she said. “I used to come to school feeling calm, knowing my mom would pick me up every day. Now, with everything that’s happening, I’m worried she won’t come back for me. It’s not just me; other children are worried, too.”

In a letter to parents on Thursday, Principal Miriam Atlas stressed that “school grounds are safe spaces that cannot be accessed by ICE without a proper, signed warrant.”

“We have reiterated our policies and protocols to all staff to ensure everyone understands these critical guidelines. In California, schools cannot ask about immigration status during enrollment or share student records without parental consent or a court order,” the letter reads.

Atlas said they were working with school agencies to make sure the affected family had access to the resources they needed.

In December, the San Diego Unified School District passed a resolution reaffirming its commitment to being a “welcoming district” for all students. Their actions included informing the school community about their rights and creating a new website with resources and additional information.

Federal agents arrested people at Charlotte’s immigration court, raising concerns about basic fairness in the legal system, the Observer reported in June.","ICE deportation fears prompted organizers to cancel the popular Hispanic Heritage Festival of the Carolinas at Truist Field in uptown Charlotte Friday.

“After much thought and with the well-being of our community at heart, we have decided not to hold the Hispanic Heritage Festival at the Knights baseball stadium this year,” organizers said on social media.

The stadium on South Mint Street is home to the Charlotte Knights Triple A minor league baseball team.

“This would have been our fourth anniversary, but the current immigration climate has created a challenging environment for large Latino events in our city,” organizers said in a statement.

“This decision was not made lightly,” Ashley Manzano, vice president of Charlotte-based Ultra Festivals Group, told The Charlotte Observer on Saturday. “But it comes in response to the current political climate surrounding immigration in the country.”

“We believe that the festival should be a time of unity and celebration,” Manzano said in an email. “However, given the sensitive and challenging environment, we feel it is in the best interest of our community to pause this year’s event.”

Friday, event organizers said their priority “is to ensure safety, great entertainment, and a full house for all who attend. We believe this is not the right moment to celebrate in such a large format, and we prefer to step back this year so we can return even stronger next year.”

“We look forward to hopefully resuming next year under more favorable circumstances,” Manzano said.

Organizers said they were “deeply grateful” for the community’s “support and love” over the years, “and we promise to make our 2026 festival one to remember.”

“Until then, we stand with our Latino community and look forward to celebrating together in the future.”

ICE has arrested people near a Charlotte school, the Mecklenburg County Courthouse and other locations this year, sparking fears and calls for law enforcement transparency as new state laws increase local-federal cooperation, the Observer reported.

If there is one company most associated with the immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, it's Home Depot. Its stores have been the location of dramatic federal raids targeting day laborers. But the company has largely been quiet. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Welcome to the Home Depot. Please enjoy your shopping experience.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Ray Hudson came to his local Home Depot in Los Angeles, preparing for a move.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).

SELYUKH: He picked up plastic crates, and usually, he would hire day laborers for help. They tend to gather nearby looking for work.

RAY HUDSON: See, and I could have used a couple of them.

SELYUKH: But they weren't there. Earlier that day, there was an immigration raid during which federal agents in tactical gear jumped out of a rental moving truck. Hudson heard it on the news.

HUDSON: It's just not right. They're not hurting nobody. They're not bothering nobody.

SELYUKH: Immigration officials have raided several Home Depot stores around Los Angeles and more around the country. This week, a man died as he ran from a raid by a Home Depot onto a freeway and was hit by a car. Home Depot did not comment on the death and has generally said little about the raids. A statement to NPR was the same it has issued time and again, that the company does not get notified, it's not involved, it has to follow federal and local rules, and its employees are instructed not to engage for their safety. This hands-off response has Chris Newman growing frustrated with Home Depot.

CHRIS NEWMAN: I sympathize with the fact that they are now ground zero for a big polarizing political and cultural issue.

SELYUKH: Newman advocates for day laborer rights as the legal director of the National Day Labor Organizing Network.

NEWMAN: However, I think that they have a responsibility and certainly a moral obligation to defend day laborers, who are both customers and service the stores where they seek work.

SELYUKH: Home Depot does not have a formal relationship with day laborers, but their history runs deep. As the chain grew to the biggest home improvement store by the 1990s, it set the stage for new demand for day laborers. Contracting crews used to compete for business on the cost of their supplies, but now everyone shops at Home Depot, and that makes the cost of labor a key way to get the edge over rivals. And there is a cheap, on-demand workforce right outside the store.

NEWMAN: Immigration laws change. Attitudes toward immigration change. But, you know, the law of supply and demand is immutable.

SELYUKH: About half of Home Depot's sales are to professional contractors who might need quick help with demolition, construction or cleanup. The other type of customer, Home Depot essentially created. It taught home owners to DIY and skip the contractor. And those shoppers now hire day laborers, too, for quick repairs or landscaping.

NEWMAN: In general, day laborers love Home Depot, and Home Depot's bottom line loves day laborers.

SELYUKH: Home Depot has said that day laborers are not part of its business model, and Wall Street analysts argue they're not a huge customer base and people who hire them would shop at Home Depot either way. Investors, so far, have shrugged off the rates.

JOE FELDMAN: I don't think that it's had any impact really on their sales.

SELYUKH: Joe Feldman is a financial analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.

FELDMAN: It's more of a perception. Is it a safe place to go shop?

SELYUKH: As Home Depot stays quiet, critics have zeroed in on the company's perceived politics. Two of its three founders have supported President Trump, except they have not run Home Depot for about 20 years. One of them died last year. The company donates to both political parties.

Back at the same Home Depot in Los Angeles a few hours after a raid, shopper Margarita Ochoa is noticing a change.

MARGARITA OCHOA: This parking lot is always full. So right now there is, like, so many spaces.

SELYUKH: Ochoa runs a housekeeping business and usually sends her employee to stock up on cleaning supplies and liquids for her pressure washer. But today, she's here herself for the first time in a while.

OCHOA: Because they afraid to come. They afraid to be here, so they didn't want to come today.

SELYUKH: Ochoa says, she hopes Home Depot would say more against the raids and do more, maybe protect people who run inside by closing the doors to immigration agents. She says she is thinking of taking her business elsewhere. But for now, this Home Depot is still the most convenient, and it's been her store for 33 years. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

Dara Lindenbaum (Democrat)

Shana M. Broussard (Democrat)

Trey Trainor (Republican)

Former Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, also a Democrat, is no longer voting and is not listed as active. With no fourth member, the Commission lacks a quorum, meaning it cannot legally take action — including appointing new commissioners.

The FEC is supposed to be the referee that keeps our elections fair, transparent, and accountable. Instead, it’s been sidelined by years of intentional neglect, partisan obstruction, and political self-interest. And who benefits? Those who are willing to bend or break the rules to stay in power.

A System Designed to Fail

Congress created the FEC after Watergate to serve as a nonpartisan watchdog. But it has a fatal flaw: it requires four votes to take any action. With six commissioners split evenly between the two major parties, all it takes is one party refusing to play ball to stop enforcement entirely.

What we have today is worse: just three commissioners are seated. This means:

No investigations of illegal campaign donations

No rulings on dark money disclosures

No enforcement of super PAC coordination violations

No action at all

And with no quorum, there’s no way to even confirm new commissioners. This is not oversight; it’s sabotage.

How This Connects to Gerrymandering

The dysfunction of the FEC is precisely why, in The People’s Redistricting Act of 2025, I refused to entrust them with oversight. Instead, the Act proposes a new citizen-approved model that uses nonpartisan AI to generate district maps, which are then voted on directly by the people.

In contrast to the FEC’s gridlocked model, this process:

Requires no partisan appointees

Operates transparently and publicly

Returns power to voters rather than to entrenched elites

The lesson is clear: we cannot protect democracy using broken institutions. We must build new ones rooted in accountability and simplicity.

A Call for Structural Reform

If we’re serious about safeguarding our elections, we must:

Reform the structure of the FEC to eliminate the built-in deadlock.

Ensure timely appointments through fast-track confirmation procedures.

Expand the role of nonpartisan agencies, such as the Election Assistance Commission, to ensure continuity when the FEC fails.

But more than that, we need to listen to the growing cry from the American people: They are tired of being shut out, gerrymandered, and governed by systems that protect power instead of public trust.

We Can’t Wait

Every day the FEC remains broken is a day we accept an election system without referees. That is not democracy. That is a slow descent into democratic decay.

We don’t have to accept this. We can reform it. We can build something better.

Let's start by urging Congress to pass The People’s Redistricting Act — and by demanding that our institutions work for us, not against us.

Keith Davenport is a candidate for U.S. Congress, NC-06.

More than half a century later, Congressman (and later president) William McKinley championed tariffs and embraced Clay’s belief that import duties would protect domestic industries and workers from foreign competition. In 1890, he sponsored the legislation that raised tariff rates dramatically, saying that doing so would boost the American economy.

Today, all of this sounds very familiar, having been brought back into the American lexicon since President Donald Trump entered the political scene. On July 31, the president issued an Executive Order “imposing additional ad valorem duties on goods of certain trading partners.”

The order was another unilateral exercise of presidential authority rather than the result of democratic deliberation.

The order claims that tariffs are needed to protect “the domestic manufacturing base, critical supply chains, and the defense industrial base.“ However, it is challenging to discern how this purpose justifies the complex array of tariff rates it imposes on various countries.

No economic logic would result in a 25% tariff on goods from India and a 19% tariff for Pakistan, or a 15% rate for Jordan and a 41% rate for Syria. But that should not be surprising.

The president seems to care more about imposing tariffs as an exercise of power than about any such logic. That has been apparent for months as his on again-off again tariff policy unfolded. Or consider the president's actions with Brazil.

As the BBC notes, “Trump has raised Brazil's rate to a whopping 50% – potentially launching a trade war with Latin America's biggest economy, which sells large amounts of beef, coffee, steel and other products to the United States. The announcement on Wednesday means Brazil will face one of the highest US tariff rates in the world, at least so far.”

But, as the BBC observes, “this new policy isn't even really about trade….It's political, and part of a growing feud between the US and Brazil…..” Trump is using tariffs “as retaliation over the prosecution of his ally, right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.”

Since he took office in January, the president has ignored the fact that the Constitution assigns the authority to impose tariffs to Congress. He claims authority under “The International Emergency Economic Powers Act… (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended…and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.”

What’s the emergency?

As the Brennan Center for Justice argues, there is none. “Emergency powers,” it says, “are designed to let a president respond swiftly to sudden, unforeseen crises that Congress cannot act quickly or flexibly enough to address. Presidents can rely on these powers to create temporary fixes until the crisis passes or Congress has time to act.”

But, the Brennan Center continues, “Emergency powers are not meant to solve long-standing problems, no matter how serious those problems may be. Nor are they intended to give a president the ability to bypass Congress and act as an all-powerful policymaker.”

In fact, no president claimed emergency powers “to impose tariffs for 48 years…., until Trump did so this year.” But emergencies, real or not, and emergency powers are never good for democracy.

In May, the United States Court of International Trade recognized that when it ruled that nothing in the laws of the United States “delegates… powers to the President in the form of authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world. The court,” it added, “does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder.

The Administration’s position did not receive a better reception on July 31 in a hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The lawyer representing the administration conceded that “no president has ever read IEEPA this way.”

Members of the court, the Washington Post reports, “appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration’s insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval, and it hammered its invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so.”

Neal Katyal, Solicitor General in the Obama Administration, got it right when he told the court that what President Trump has done with tariffs is a “’ breathtaking’ power grab that amounted to saying ‘the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants so long as he declares an emergency.’”

The president is using tariffs to reward those he likes and punish his enemies. He seems to want to stand astride this country and the world, making them both bend to his will.

Tariffs are a key weapon in his arsenal to be wielded as the president wants, regardless of the economic damage they do or the pain they inflict. Many economists warn that such damage will be substantial both here and abroad. According to CNBC, “The tariffs are expected to cost U.S. households an average $2,400 in 2025, with the levies disproportionally impacting clothes.”

While Trump’s tariffs are bringing additional revenue to the federal government, they are slowing economic growth and destabilizing the world economic order that for decades has been important to the prosperity this nation has enjoyed.

They are also not good for our political system. In April, the economist Paul Krugman identified what he called “The secret sauce of the Trump tariffs….Nobody knows what they will be. Nobody knows what comes next.” That may be bad for businesses trying to make plans, but it is good news for a political leader seeking to make his will and whims the center of the political universe.

The president has compared his role in imposing tariffs to that of a storekeeper who owns the store where everyone wants to shop. As he told The Atlantic, “I have to protect that store. And I set the prices.”

Note the singular.

And President Trump is not shy about channeling Clay and McKinley and again emphasizing his singular role. “I’m resetting the table. I’m resetting a lot of years….Our country was most successful from 1850 or so to, think of this, from 1870—really, from 1870 to 1913. And it was all tariffs.”

“And then some great genius said, ‘Let’s go and tax the people instead of taxing other countries.’”

The president, who frequently refers to himself as a genius, is using tariff policy in a way that the people who wrote the American Constitution would never have imagined. It is just another sign of trouble for our democracy.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the name of the man arrested is Juan Jose Martinez Cortes, a Mexican national without legal status.

In an emailed statement Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary for public affairs, told KPBS Martinez was ""fraudulently using an American’s social security number.""

""Officers approached Martinez after he pulled over in a parking lot. On August 14, ICE arrested Martinez and placed him in removal proceedings,"" she said. “Allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are false. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was never on school grounds.""

On Friday, district officials held a press conference to address the incident.

“Let me be clear: Our schools and our neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” said SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula. “These are spaces for safety, for growth, for belonging, for joy. And there may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

San Diego Unified Trustee Sabrina Bazzo said Linda Vista Elementary experienced a decline in attendance Friday as a result of the arrest.

In a letter sent to parents, the district said it’s working “to ensure the impacted family has the resources they need during this difficult time.”

This is the second time in two weeks ICE has conducted a targeted detainment outside an elementary school. Last week, a mother was arrested at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista for allegedly overstaying her visa; her children were in the car at the time.

It’s Noah Goldberg, with assists from Julia Wick, Seema Mehta and David Zahniser, giving you the latest on city and county government.

Days after the Trump administration’s mass immigration raids came to Los Angeles, City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado started looking for money to help the city’s undocumented residents.

In a June 10 motion, she asked City Administrative Officer Matt Szabo to detail options for finding at least $1 million for RepresentLA, which provides legal services for undocumented Angelenos facing deportation.

A week later, an official from Szabo’s office said they were “unable to identify eligible funding sources” for the $1 million, which would come on top of $1 million the city has already allocated to RepresentLA.

This summer in L.A., an immigration crisis is colliding with a budget crisis, leaving some councilmembers frustrated that the city cannot do more, as federal agents whisk thousands of immigrants away to detention centers and potential deportation.

The city has been active in court, joining an ACLU lawsuit that temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. Mayor Karen Bass also announced a program to provide immigrants with gift cards, funded by private philanthropy, when many were afraid to go to work.

But coming up with another $1 million for immigrant legal defense, after city officials closed a nearly $1-billion deficit through cuts and slated layoffs, has proved a slog.

“Why is it that we can’t find the money for this?” asked Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martínez during a Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee meeting on Aug. 1. “It appears that level of urgency is not being transmitted through this report, because when we’re in other situations, we find the money.”

Jurado piggybacked off her colleague.

“This is an immigration legal crisis,” she said, adding that she felt “disappointment, frustration and, frankly, anger with the outcome here that we can’t find a single dollar to support immigrant communities and this legal defense fund.”

“I find it really hard to believe that the CAO couldn’t find any money for it,” she said in an interview.

RepresentLA, which is a public-private partnership with the county, the city, the California Community Foundation and the Weingart Foundation, has seen a surge in demand for legal services since the immigration raids began in June, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA, which manages RepresentLA.

“The need is higher than the needs being met,” Cabrera said.

The city has contributed funding for RepresentLA since its inception in 2021 — initially $2 million each fiscal year before dropping to $1 million in 2024-2025 and $1 million this year out of a total budget of $6.5 million, with the other $5.5 million coming from L.A. County.

RepresentLA, which has served nearly 10,000 people, provides free legal representation for undocumented immigrants facing removal proceedings, as well as other services such as help with asylum applications. Some attorneys are on staff, while others are outside counsel.

In April, Bass said in her State of the City speech that the city would “protect every Angeleno, no matter where you are from, no matter when you arrived in L.A ... because we know how much immigrants contribute to our city in so many ways. We will always stand strong with you.”

But behind the scenes, the city’s financial struggles put even the initial $1 million for RepresentLA in jeopardy, with the mayor proposing to slash it to zero for this fiscal year.

“Getting the initial $1 million back was quite a battle,” said Angelica Salas, CHIRLA’s executive director. “It had been zeroed out. We were able to get just the money enough to continue the program for those who are currently in the program.”

The City Council managed to claw back the $1 million during budget negotiations by slowing down hiring at the LAPD, as well as “ending duplicative spending,” said Naomi Villagomez-Roochnik, a spokesperson for Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who sits on the budget committee. (The mayor and Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson have since said they are looking for money to reverse the hiring slowdown.)

“It’s a crumb when you compare it to the rest of the city budget,” Hernandez said.

RepresentLA has 23 attorneys working on deportation hearings, and Salas said each represents about 35 clients at any given time. An additional $1 million “would allow us to expand our capacity for the new people — the thousands of people who have now been picked up in this new sweep,” she said.

At the committee hearing earlier this month, Councilmember Monica Rodriguez said the City Council should find savings in other areas to help pay for important programs like RepresentLA.

“Next time the city attorney comes asking us for outside counsel money, you could say ‘No’ and redirect those resources. ... When the mayor comes for Inside Safe, for additional discretionary money that she is unaccountable for, you could say, ‘No, we’re taking $1 million and putting it for RepresentLA,’” she said. “Let’s effing go.”

The committee called on the city administrative officer’s staff to research options for funding RepresentLA, including grants or reallocating money from elsewhere.

Szabo confirmed to The Times that things will be different at the next committee meeting.

“Our next report will provide options to fund RepresentLA at the level requested,” he said in a text message.

State of play

BALLOT ROYALE: Labor unions and business groups have been locked in a heated battle of ballot measures for the last three months, after the City Council hiked the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers. Each side is trying to get measures on the ballot that would have far-reaching effects, including one that would put the minimum wage increase to a citywide vote. Unite Here Local 11, which represents hotel and restaurant workers, has proposed four ballot measures that, according to critics, would wreak havoc on the city’s economy. Business leaders, in turn, have filed a ballot petition to repeal the city’s $800-million business tax — a move denounced by city officials, who say it would gut funding for police and other essential services.

— SAGE ADVICE: The Jurado staffer who was arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in June gave a heads-up to her boss that she planned to take part, according to text messages obtained by The Times through a public records request.

“Going to the protest at [City Hall] fyi,” Luz Aguilar wrote to Chief of Staff Lauren Hodgins.

Hodgins responded with words of caution.

“To reiterate what we spoke about a few mins ago, if you choose to take part in any community action, please ensure that you approach the event with peace and care for those around you and stay safe,” Hodgins wrote. “This is not a city-sanctioned activity and you are participating on your own accord so want to ensure your safety along with the safety of those around you.”

Aguilar did not text back. She was later arrested at the demonstration and ultimately charged with resisting arrest after allegedly assaulting a police officer.

— BACK TO COURT: Prosecutors filed two new corruption charges against City Councilmember Curren Price this week. The charges were connected to two votes he cast on funding for the city housing authority and the L.A. County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, both of which were paying Price’s wife, Del Richardson. Price’s attorney called the new charges “nothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.”

Sources told The Times this week that prosecutors tried to get Richardson to testify in front of a grand jury as part of Price’s case. She did not ultimately do so.

— IT’S FUN TO STAY AT THE YMCA: Bass, L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and City Councilmember Traci Park were all in the Palisades Thursday morning at a ceremony where Horvath pledged $10 million from her discretionary funds toward rebuilding the Palisades-Malibu YMCA.

— GIFT ECONOMY: Our public records request for all the gifts Bass received in the last year and a half came back, with the list largely composed of ceremonial gift exchanges with her foreign counterparts (chopsticks and a teacup from the mayor of Sejong, South Korea, estimated cost $32; a scarf and a hat from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, estimated cost $45).

There were a few interesting tidbits: Bass received flowers (~$72) from race and gender scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term intersectionality. There were also fancy Dodgers tickets and food (~$590, but marked as “paid down”) from her longtime lawyers at Kaufman Legal Group, along with flights and travel for two speaking engagements.

— NOT RULING IT OUT: When Bass appeared on the podcast “Lovett or Leave It,” host Jon Lovett gave her a “crazy pitch”: What if the city of Los Angeles broke off from the county, forming its own city-county? Bass said it “wasn’t that crazy” and asked (jokingly) whether Lovett would be taking on the messy ballot initiative … before reverting back to her standard line on the need for intergovernmental cooperation. Bass also told Lovett that the city is still looking at ways to carve out an exemption to Measure ULA taxes for Palisades fire survivors selling their lots. And, she said, the city is in the process of hiring its long-promised film liaison “as we speak.”

Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers launched a special election campaign on Thursday, urging California voters to approve new congressional districts to shrink the state’s Republican delegation, as Texas Republicans fight to redraw their own maps to favor the GOP. If the plan moves forward through the many hoops ahead, another district could be created in southeast Los Angeles County, which would undoubtedly kickstart frantic maneuvering ahead of 2026. (L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis’ name is already getting thrown around as a potential candidate, though her office didn’t respond to a half-dozen queries.)

— DON’T ASK, DON’T TELL: City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto came out swinging against SB 79, state Sen. Scott Wiener’s latest housing density bill, back in May. Now, both proponents and opponents are clamoring to know whether Bass will take a position on the controversial bill. The Times has been asking too, but so far the mayor and her team have not responded to questions.

QUICK HITS

Where is Inside Safe? The mayor’s signature homelessness program did not carry out any new operations this week. Her Shine LA initiative, which aims to clean up city streets and sidewalks, will be back Aug. 21.

On the docket for next week: The Charter Reform Commission will meet at City Hall twice — yes, twice — to discuss planning and infrastructure on Monday and “government structure” on Friday.

Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.
An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities.
The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.
The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.","WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser, who is dedicated to ensuring the safety of residents, workers, and visitors in Washington, D.C.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating the Justice Department’s new order.

“What we know is that D.C. residents are worried and concerned and we have a surge of federal officers,” Bowser said during an earlier news conference outside the courthouse.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said Trump’s earlier move to sideline her would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” she said in a court filing.

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president’s administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before US District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise, promising to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn’t agree.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major US cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier on Thursday to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!“

ANCHORAGE, Alaska: US President Donald Trump said that nearly three hours of direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday did not yield an agreement to pause Moscow’s war in Ukraine, though he characterized the meeting as “very productive.”

During brief remarks to reporters, the two leaders said they had made progress on unspecified issues, but they offered no details and took no questions.

“There were many, many points that we agreed on. I would say a couple of big ones that we haven’t quite got there, but we’ve made some headway,” Trump said, standing in front of a backdrop that read, “Pursuing Peace.”

“There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” he added.

It was not immediately clear whether the talks had produced meaningful steps toward a ceasefire in the deadliest conflict in Europe in 80 years, a goal that Trump had set at the outset.

In brief remarks, Putin said he expected Ukraine and its European allies to accept the results of the US-Russia negotiation constructively and not try to “disrupt the emerging progress.”

“I expect that today’s agreements will become a reference point, not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also launch the restoration of business-like, pragmatic relations between Russia and the United States,” Putin said.

There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.

The anticlimactic end to the closely watched summit was in stark contrast to the pomp and circumstance with which it began. When Putin arrived at an Air Force base in Alaska, a red carpet awaited him, where Trump greeted Putin warmly as US military aircraft flew overhead.

For Putin, the summit — the first between him and a US president since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — was already a big win, regardless of its outcome. He can portray the meeting as evidence that years of Western attempts to isolate Russia have unraveled and that Moscow is retaking its rightful place at the high table of international diplomacy.

Trump hopes a truce in the 3-1/2-year-old war that Putin started will bring peace to the region as well as bolster his credentials as a global peacemaker worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court, accused of the war crime of deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia denies the allegations, and the Kremlin has dismissed the ICC warrant as null and void. Russia and the United States are not members of the court.

Both Moscow and Kyiv deny targeting civilians in the war. But thousands of civilians have died in the conflict, the vast majority Ukrainian, and the war has killed or injured well over a million people from both sides.

No ceasefire

Trump and Putin, along with top foreign-policy aides, conferred in a room at an Air Force base in Anchorage, Alaska in their first meeting since 2019.

Trump’s publicly stated aim for the talks was to secure a halt to the fighting and a commitment by Putin to meet swiftly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate an end to the war, which began when Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.

Zelensky, who was not invited to the summit, and his European allies had feared Trump might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict and recognizing — if only informally — Russian control over one-fifth of Ukraine.

Trump sought to assuage such concerns as he boarded Air Force One, saying he would let Ukraine decide on any possible territorial concessions.

“I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine, I’m here to get them at a table,” he said.

Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters: “I want to see a ceasefire rapidly ... I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today ... I want the killing to stop.”

Zelensky has ruled out formally handing Moscow any territory and is also seeking a security guarantee backed by the United States.

Trump said he would call Zelensky and NATO leaders to update them on the talks with Putin.

The meeting also included US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Trump’s special envoy to Russia, Steve Witkoff; Russian foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov; and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Trump, who once said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours, conceded on Thursday it had proven a tougher task than he had expected. He said if Friday’s talks went well, quickly arranging a second, three-way summit with Zelensky would be more important than his encounter with Putin.

Zelensky said Friday’s summit should open the way for a “just peace” and three-way talks that included him, but added that Russia was continuing to wage war. A Russian ballistic missile earlier struck Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding another.

“It’s time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

LONDON: Microsoft has opened an external investigation into allegations that a top Israeli military intelligence unit used its cloud technology to carry out mass surveillance of Palestinians.

The probe follows a joint report by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call.

According to the report, Israel’s Unit 8200 spy agency, the rough equivalent of the US National Security Agency, used Microsoft’s Azure cloud service to store a vast archive of phone calls intercepted and recorded from Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

The joint media report also revealed extensive ties between Microsoft’s Israel office and the spy unit — a finding that prompted alarm among the tech giant’s US executives who feared that Israel-based employees might have concealed information about the nature of their work with Unit 8200.

Microsoft’s Israel office, as part of its work with the unit, created a custom, segregated suite within the Azure platform in order to store the archive of intercepted phone calls.

Unit 8200 chiefs aimed to use the surveillance project to record “millions of calls per hour” across the Palestinian territories.

In a statement, Microsoft said “using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank” would be prohibited under its terms of service.

The tech giant appointed lawyers from US firm Covington & Burling to oversee the inquiry.

It is the second external probe initiated by Microsoft in relation to its ties with the Israeli military.

The first, conducted earlier this year, found “no evidence to date” that the Israel Defense Forces had broken Microsoft’s terms of service or used the Azure cloud service “to target or harm people” in Gaza.

However, the latest investigation will expand on the previous one, with Microsoft agreeing “that The Guardian’s recent report raises additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review.”

Pressure is also mounting within Microsoft through an employee-led campaign group, No Azure for Apartheid.

The group, which is accusing the tech giant of “complicity in genocide and apartheid,” has called for Microsoft to cut all ties with the Israeli military.

Sources within Microsoft told The Guardian that the company’s leadership was scrambling to assess Azure data.

They are reportedly concerned about information revealed by Unit 8200 sources for the joint media report, which alleged that the data was used to identify targets for strikes in Gaza.

Microsoft pledged to “share with the public the factual findings that result from” the external review, a statement said.

LONDON: Britain’s human rights watchdog has urged ministers and police chiefs to avoid “heavy-handed” tactics when policing demonstrations over the war in Gaza, saying that such actions risk creating a “chilling effect” on the right to protest, it was reported on Friday.

In a letter to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley, the Equality and Human Rights Commission chairwoman Baroness Kishwer Falkner said the “right to protest is a cornerstone of any healthy democracy” and any interference “must be lawful and assessed case by case.”

Her intervention follows reports of individuals facing police action at recent demonstrations despite not expressing support for any banned organizations.

The EHRC cited the case of Laura Murton, who in July was threatened with arrest under the Terrorism Act by Kent Police in July for holding a Palestinian flag and signs reading “Free Gaza” and “Israel is committing genocide” during a demonstration in Canterbury.

Murton told officers she did not support any proscribed groups but was reportedly warned that her actions were linked to Palestine Action — which in July was banned by the government.

Membership of or support for the group is a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act, carrying a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.

“Heavy-handed policing or blanket approaches risk creating a chilling effect, deterring citizens from exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly through fear of possible consequences,” Falkner said.

“This concern extends beyond those directly affected by police engagement to the broader health of our democracy, because the perception that peaceful protest may attract disproportionate police attention undermines confidence in our human rights protections,” she added.

She called on the UK government and police to ensure “all officers receive clear and consistent guidance on their human rights obligations” so that “the appropriate balance is maintained between public safety and the protection of essential human rights.”

In a separate statement, she said that the right to peaceful protest was fundamental to British democracy and must be protected even when dealing with complex and sensitive issues.

“We recognize the genuine challenges the police face in maintaining public safety, but we are concerned that some recent responses may not strike the right balance between security and fundamental rights,” she said.

“Our role as the national human rights institution is to uphold the laws that safeguard everyone’s right to fairness, dignity and respect. When we see reports of people being questioned or prevented from peaceful protests that don’t support proscribed organisations, we have a duty to speak out,” she added.

Last weekend, more than 500 people were arrested in London, most on suspicion of displaying items deemed supportive of Palestine Action. Police figures indicate that half of those detained were aged 60 or older.

Downing Street has described Palestine Action as “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage,” citing evidence and security assessments presented in closed court. The group has rejected the claims as “false and defamatory,” saying they were contradicted by the government’s own intelligence.

Meanwhile, campaigners including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Quakers in Britain have urged Attorney General Richard Hermer to delay prosecution decisions for those arrested until after a High Court challenge to Palestine Action’s proscription, set for November.

They argued that moving ahead before the court’s ruling “raises significant legal and moral questions” and that delaying action “would demonstrate restraint, fairness and respect for the ongoing legal process.”

Murton’s lawyers have also issued a letter of claim to Kent Police over her case, which they said was intended to remind forces across the country of their obligations to protect peaceful protest.

LAMPEDUSA, Italy: Italian authorities on Friday were trying to identify the bodies of 27 people who died when two crowded boats sank off the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa.

One wooden coffin, marked with an “X,” could be seen at the local cemetery, where the bodies of some of the victims were being held, an AFP journalist said.

Broadcaster Rai reported that some of the coffins would be transported to Sicily for burial in several cemeteries there.

Lampedusa, just 90 miles (145 kilometers) off the coast of Tunisia, is often the first point of arrival for people trying to reach Europe in fragile or overcrowded boats.

Its reception center is currently home to 317 people, including about 70 mostly unaccompanied minors, said Giovanna Stabile of the Italian Red Cross, which runs the facility.

Most of them come from Egypt, Somalia and Bangladesh, she added.

Of the 60 survivors of Wednesday’s capsizing disaster, 58 were at the center. The two others were airlifted by helicopter to Sicily for treatment, she said.

“Last night, the procedures for identifying the bodies began,” said Stabile.

“This was a delicate moment, which was supported by the psychologist, the linguistic-cultural mediator and the multidisciplinary team,” she said.

“People reacted to the identification in a very composed manner.”

For some, however, it was too much.

One Somali teenager, in tears, identified a girl, his cousin, among the dead. “It can’t be! It can’t be!” he kept repeating, ANSA news agency reported.

The 27 victims, including three minors, died when two crowded boats heading from Libya capsized about 20 kilometers off Lampedusa.

The UN refugee agency said the boats were carrying at least 95 people. Italian news agency ANSA said 100 to 110 people may have been on board, meaning up to 23 could still be unaccounted for.

On Thursday, the Italian coast guard published a video of the rescue operation, showing young men desperately trying to cling to a floating rescue cylinder in the water.

The somber scene at the reception center was in stark contrast to elsewhere on the island, as throngs of tourists enjoyed Friday’s Ferragosto public holiday.

At the port, where dozens of migrants were still arriving by boat at the port, pleasure craft were bringing back tourists from sea trips to the sound of festive music.

At the cemetery, women came to pray and leave flowers for those who lost their lives, while a vigil in memory of the dead was held at a local Catholic shrine.

“Migrants continue to arrive... our arms are always open but when these deaths occur, it hurts us deeply,” one local woman, who gave her name only as Angela, told AFP.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/08/16/4630953-1299543667.jpg?itok=KcFiZuLf,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:44.343177

Guerrero-Cruz, who turned 18 this month, was set to start his senior year at Reseda Charter High School on Thursday, according to a GoFundMe page set up to support his family and legal fees. Instead, he’s being held in Department of Homeland Security custody pending removal from the United States, the agency confirmed in statement to The Times on Friday.

“Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an illegal alien from Chile, overstayed his visa by more than two years, abusing the Visa Waiver Program under which he entered the United States, which required him to depart the United States on March 15, 2023,” the statement read.

The department did not immediately respond to an email from The Times for further comment.

When he was taken into custody Friday morning, immigration agents tied his dog to a tree and then unclipped his collar, allowing the animal to run loose on Sepulveda Boulevard, according to the GoFundMe page.

“He is more than just a student — he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community. He carries a tremendous amount of responsibility at home, helping care for his five-month-old twin brothers and his six-year-old brother. He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family,” according to the GoFundMe page.

Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Alberto Carvalho said during a news conference Thursday that he spoke to the boy’s mother, who described the dismal conditions her son is facing in custody. She said her son was in a small holding area filled with 40 men, most much older than her son.

“He is 18 years old, but he’s a kid. He has not been exposed to anything in his life,” Carvalho said, recounting his discussion with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother. “He drinks water once a day. The food is insufficient. Mom said that there was not enough room for everybody to sit or lie down at the same time.”

During their conversation, Carvalho said, she “was having difficulty holding back tears. She was crying with every word that came out of her mouth.”

A friend of Guerrero-Cruz’s, identified as Ronny C., said in a statement that the young man’s soccer team was devastated by his sudden disappearance.

“On the field, he was rock-solid—always showed up, worked hard, and could be counted on week after week. Off the field, he was just as reliable: kind, respectful, and someone who lifted up the people around him. He brought consistency, heart, and a quiet strength that made the team better in every way,” Ronny C. said.

Guerrero-Cruz’s arrest comes amid already heightened fears among Los Angeles students and parents over whether they might be targeted by immigration officials while traveling to or from school.

A person with knowledge of Guerrero-Cruz’s situation who declined to be named for fear of reprisal confirmed that he attended the high school in Reseda for his junior year. The person added that teachers are working to “make sure all students feel safe” despite the ongoing raids.

Agents have already focused enforcement efforts at LAUSD schools at least twice since the Trump administration launched raids targeting undocumented immigrants this year.

In April, immigration agents attempted to enter two elementary schools seeking information about several students but were turned away by administrators.

On Monday, federal agents reportedly drew their guns on and handcuffed a 15-year-old boy with disabilities outside Arleta High School. Federal officials said they were looking to apprehend a suspected MS-13 gang member and instead took the person’s cousin by mistake. The teen was ultimately released.

Carvalho has called for limits on immigration enforcement near schools, saying it impedes student learning.

“When children witness peers, parents, or other individuals detained, the image is not easily erased,” Carvalho said in a statement Monday. “These moments imprint on young minds, distracting them from academic lessons and replacing intellectual curiosity with worry.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c04dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1338x702+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2Ff3%2F33eb1a374f63927dfd87a6685a96%2Fme-benjamin-guerrero-cruz-taken-by-ice-01.JPG,N,,2025-08-16 14:56:44.264223

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week's hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government's attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday's order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,"" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits. In May, CBP held 46 children for over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for over 20 days in April.

The federal government is looking to expand its immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated.

Gee still has not ruled on the request by legal advocates for the immigrant children to expand independent monitoring of the treatment of children held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. Currently, the agreement allows for third-party inspections at facilities in the El Paso and Rio Grande Valley regions, but plaintiffs submitted evidence showing long detention times at border facilities that violate the agreement's terms.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/immigrantchildrenpolicyAP25228073183977,N,,2025-08-16 13:57:37.656986

“By gutting this policy, the administration is actively choosing to return to a status quo where the biggest corporations dictate the terms of our lives.
“Competition is the cornerstone of a thriving economy.
We will continue to champion legislation and policy that breaks up monopolies, protects people and small businesses from abuse, and makes markets work for everyone.”","August 15, 2025 – The Monopoly Busters Caucus Chairs, U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Chris Deluzio (PA-17), Pat Ryan (NY-18), and Angie Craig (MN-02), released the following statement strongly condemning President Trump for revoking the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which had established a whole-of-government federal policy to address the harmful effects of market concentration across various sectors.

“We strongly condemn the decision to revoke the executive order on competition, a move that green lights more consolidation and signals to corporate America that they can continue padding their pockets at the expense of working people without fear of government intervention. This action proves that ‘make America competitive again’ was just a hollow slogan. President Trump can’t claim to care about competition while systematically dismantling the very tools designed to prevent concentration of power and monopolies in the hands of the very few largest players.

“The executive order made competition a national priority and gave agencies the mandate they needed to challenge corporate gatekeepers in every corner of the economy, from Big Tech’s control over our data to hospital mergers that inflate healthcare costs. It was a commitment to use the power of the government to fight for the people who are tired of paying more for prescriptions, getting hit with surprise airline junk fees, having their right to repair a simple tractor or smartphone stripped away, or trying to run a small business that competes on an uneven playing field.

“By gutting this policy, the administration is actively choosing to return to a status quo where the biggest corporations dictate the terms of our lives. The consequences of this decision will be felt when small businesses close and as people spend more, get less, and earn less – all so that billionaires can have more.

“Competition is the cornerstone of a thriving economy. We will continue to champion legislation and policy that breaks up monopolies, protects people and small businesses from abuse, and makes markets work for everyone.”",https://jayapal.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/hero.png,N,,2025-08-16 15:57:17.886546

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week's hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government's attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday's order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,"" Gee wrote, referring to the government's appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik said the man was fleeing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid at the Home Depot on Thursday morning. Witnesses said they saw him run across the store’s parking lot and onto the eastbound 210 Freeway, where he was struck by an SUV and killed.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for more information from Nexstar’s KTLA. But a representative told the Los Angeles Times that the man was not being pursued by their agents when he ran onto the freeway.

Protesters at Thursday’s event, however, believed the man’s death was a direct result of ICE raids like the one in Monrovia.

“I was heartbroken,” said Selene Lockerbie, who attended Thursday’s protest. “I feel like Monrovia was violated … to know that a man lost his life today just trying to work. Just trying to take care of himself and his family.”

Karen Suarez, another demonstrator, said she consoled the victim’s daughter at the scene.

“I just went up to her and said, ‘I’m really sorry about your dad.’ She was so shaken up,” Suarez told KTLA’s Sandra Mitchell.

Immigrant advocates say 13 people were detained by federal agents during Thursday’s raid. Several were also injured, according to Pablo Alvarado from the National Day Laborer Union.

“They’re afraid of going to the clinics and hospitals, so we’re going to make sure there’s a doctor who comes to see them,” said Alvarado. “The first thing is humanity of people.”

Read on... for details on the ruling.

A federal judge in Los Angeles denied a motion from the Trump administration Friday to throw out a decades-old settlement that outlines protections for immigrant children in federal detention.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee said the federal government had not shown that Homeland Security regulations satisfy the agreement's requirements, including that minors be released quickly and that family detention centers be properly licensed.

She also said the government failed to ""identify any new facts or law"" since she rejected an effort to end the agreement in 2019.

The White House did not immediately respond to LAist's request for comment.

Gee heard arguments from the federal government and immigrant advocates in a hearing last week. Lawyers representing immigrant children said minors were being held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities for extended periods of time and asked the judge to appoint an independent monitor.

The hearing centered on the Flores Settlement Agreement, a 1997 consent decree that outlines minimum standards for conditions for children in immigration custody. It broadly requires the government to quickly move minors out of immigration detention and into facilities licensed to care for children.

Last year, Gee ended part of that agreement for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees care for unaccompanied immigrant children in the U.S., with some exceptions. But the requirements of Flores are still in place for Homeland Security facilities like Border Patrol.

It's those requirements that the government was seeking to end, arguing that the executive branch needed more flexibility and citing recent legislation like the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which includes billions of dollars for new detention facilities including for families.

""We're raising this early in an administration that ran on immigration issues,"" Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge last week.

Multiple immigrant rights groups represented the Flores plaintiffs in court. Sergio Perez, executive director for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, told LAist the government's attempt was ridiculous.

"" It's an absurd and political move that reflects this administration's seemingly insatiable disdain for the checks and balances,"" he said.

The judge also heard a second motion from immigrant advocacy organizations alleging that the government is violating the Flores agreement by keeping children in ""prison-like"" conditions for extended periods of time.

"" Nobody's supposed to be held in Border Patrol facilities for more than 72 hours,"" Diane de Gramont is an attorney with National Center for Youth Law told LAist. ""But kids had been held for over a week, even two weeks, three weeks. And there have been children held for over a month in a holding cell with no access to daylight or recreation, and infrequent access to even showers.""

The judge has not yet ruled on that motion, but she expressed concern about holding times at Border Patrol facilities at last week's hearing.

The origins of the Flores agreement protections are in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Lawyers brought the federal government to court over the treatment of a 15 year-old girl from El Salvador in federal custody in a Pasadena hotel. That eventually led the government to agree to the national standards for the treatment of children in immigration detention that still stand today.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police.

The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive.

But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president's administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city.

The arrest happened around 3 p.m. outside a church just steps away from Linda Vista Elementary School, where parents were gathering to pick up their children. Witnesses said the man had been waiting to collect his child when ICE agents, with their faces covered, approached his vehicle.

“They were like hitting the car and telling the guy, ‘get out of the car,’ and he was like, ‘why? why?’” said Michelle, a bystander who recorded the arrest and asked not to be identified for safety reasons. She said she watched in horror as the man was handcuffed and taken away.

San Diego Unified Superintendent Fabiola Bagula condemned the timing and location of the arrest, saying it left families and staff shaken.

“It left children, families, staff with questions and fears that no one, especially our youngest learners, should have to carry,” Bagula said during a press conference. “A child did not get picked up from school by their parent. This is traumatic. There’s a reason why those people are wearing masks — because they know it’s wrong to do.”

Bagula emphasized that ICE agents are not allowed to enter campuses without a warrant and called on federal officials to avoid enforcement near schools.

“Our schools and the neighborhoods that surround them should be off limits to enforcement actions like this,” she said. “There may be a lot of debates about immigration reform, but there should be no debate that this kind of tactic is inhumane.”

Cody Petterson, president of the San Diego Unified school board, echoed those concerns.

“When you show up and cut out from work early to pick up your kids to make sure they are safe, you should not be abducted as you are waiting for your child to come out of school,” he said. “It doesn’t matter where you are on the political spectrum — no one thinks that’s a good thing.”

Thursday’s arrest comes one week after a similar incident outside Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista, where ICE agents detained a parent who had previously been ordered deported.

School officials said the Linda Vista student whose father was detained was later picked up safely by their mother.

Ester Soliman was deported to the Philippines on Friday after living in Lancaster for 25 years, her family said.

Her family said they received a call from their mother from the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, just before Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were putting her on a plane.

“We are heartbroken and reeling, and we want her home more than we can communicate,” the family said in an update on its fundraising page to pay for an immigration attorney. “Please keep our entire family in your prayers as we determine our next steps.”

ICE arrested Soliman on Aug. 4 when she reported to a meeting under the Alternatives to Detention program at the agency’s York office.

Soliman’s family never received notification from ICE that their mother was being deported, according to Damon Myers, a friend who has been acting as their spokesperson. Instead, the husband of a fellow detainee at the Clinton County Correctional Facility called Ester Soliman’s son, Sam, to say his mother had been moved. Sam and Soliman’s other two adult children, Sandra and Sanjee, remain in Lancaster.

As of 1 p.m. Friday, Soliman was still shown in ICE’s online detainee locator, but the correctional facility had been removed. Once people are deported, they are removed from the system entirely. Efforts to reach Soliman’s attorney on Friday were not immediately successful.

When ICE returned Soliman’s phone in the airport, she called her children, according to Myers. In another statement to the fundraising page, the family called the situation “a nightmare.”

ICE was not immediately available for a comment or to confirm the deportation but had previously released a statement on Soliman’s case.

""She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000,” Tricia McLaughlin, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s public communications, said Monday. “Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.”

According to state court records, Soliman has two traffic tickets on record and no other incidents. A Manheim Township police officer issued Soliman citations on July 28, 2025, for improper safety restraints for a child under four years and for driving without a license. She was allowed to leave the scene after the citations when someone came to pick her up, according to Manheim Township Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Barry Waltz, Jr.

Soliman came to the U.S. with her husband, Albert S. Soliman, who died in 2015, according to a death notice published in LNP. Soliman never went back to the Philippines, according to Myers. Soliman still has family there, who have been notified and who plan to be at the airport when she lands. Her full name, as used by ICE, is Estrelita Soliman-Ramos.

Earlier Friday, the family posted an update to the fundraising page that the government denied a legal motion, called a “stay of removal,” meant to postpone deportation.

In that post, they called for help from the public to amplify Soliman’s case by calling elected officials in the hopes of keeping her in-country.

The advocacy and affinity group Lancaster Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders released a statement Friday evening calling Soliman “a cherished mother and friend” and said her deportation was a worst-case scenario.

“We are overwhelmed with grief and fury that our beloved Ester is not with her family in Lancaster, a place she has called home for 25 years,” Cindy Lam, president of Lancaster AAPI, said. “We are holding the entire Soliman family in our hearts right now as we process and mourn this new tragic reality.”

Over the last week, the family raised $88,431 through a crowdsourced fundraising tool called GoFundMe, an outpouring of support that surpassed their original goal of $35,000.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday sought to install an “emergency police commissioner” to approve any new Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) policies, while also demanding the department aid in federal immigration arrests.

It has led the administration in the span of a week to lose the cooperative tone struck Monday, when Bondi claimed she had a “productive meeting” with D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) and said the two would “work closely” together.

City officials have had their own evolution, from the controlled disappointment initially conveyed by Bowser when she said she would “work every day to make sure it’s not a complete disaster” to the city’s attorney general launching a suit challenging the police takeover.

The week ended with the fight landing in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who at a hastily scheduled hearing raised concerns about portions of Bondi’s new order but urged the two sides to work together. After convening privately for nearly two hours, the administration agreed to walk back the new commissioner appointment and instead make him a liaison.

“I am very happy that it looks like hopefully this can get figured out without a judge having to do anything, because I think these are the kind of issues that should be decided between the district and the government,” Reyes said.

Despite the détente, it’s likely not the end of the legal battle. Reyes said she’ll hold additional proceedings next week, and the city made clear it stands ready to renew its emergency legal effort if it isn’t satisfied. The judge even gave out her clerk’s cellphone number so the parties could reach out if any issues come up over the weekend.

“My sincere hope is that we don’t have to be back fighting over this issue again,” D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb (D) said at a press conference at the close of the hearing.

The move to court is a shift from when Bowser initially shrugged off a legal challenge at her Monday press conference after Trump moved to take over MPD. When asked about the possibility, Bowser noted that once Trump declares an emergency, the Home Rule Act “authorizes the president to make those requests and it says the mayor shall comply with those requests.”

But city leaders’ tune quickly changed following Bondi’s order Thursday that installed Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole to effectively command the force.

Bondi also rescinded an hours-old D.C. order directing more MPD cooperation on immigration in favor of something stronger – likewise lifting policies that barred officers from conducting immigration arrests for individuals who have no other criminal arrest warrant and to not inquire about someone’s immigration status for the sole purpose of “enforcing civil immigration laws.”

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” MPD Chief Pamela Smith wrote in a sworn court filing.

Bowser said that she was caught off-guard by the late Thursday order.

“We were surprised,” Bowser said after the close of the court hearing, noting that Bondi had called their earlier meeting productive.

“And without notice, we got the order.”

But in court, Justice Department attorney Yaakov Roth suggested it was the city that was responsible for any breakdown in cooperation.

“We want it to work. We’re not looking to create delay and confusion,” Roth said.

The tensions come as the administration’s efforts in the capital ramp up, with 800 National Guard troops now having been mobilized to the city alongside a surge of federal law enforcement agents and city police.

They’ve been conducting checkpoints across the city along with other actions, with arrests nearing 200.

City and federal leaders are also at odds over the purpose of the policing activities.

Of the 33 arrests on Thursday, nearly half, 15, were of non-U.S. citizens.

And of the 135 arrests this week broken down by Bondi, 75 were listed as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests.

Federal officials have also stressed the seizure of illegally purchased weapons, something that Bowser indicated was a priority for her after decades of D.C. efforts to limit handguns, including in a ban that was struck down by the Supreme Court.

“We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx of enhanced presence, we know that it’s going to make our city even better,” Smith said earlier this week as she discussed how the city would be “working side by side with our federal partners.”

But immigration seems to be another matter, one where the city has traditionally sought to keep its officers outside of enforcement, though they may be compelled under the order.

D.C. officials on Thursday directed MPD officers to be even more cooperative with federal officials, allowing the sharing of citizenship information for those pulled over for traffic stops and also allowed local officers to provide transportation for detained subjects.

But under existing city policy, it still prohibited to use databases for the sole purpose of checking someone’s immigration status and for arresting people for civil immigration violations when they had no other outstanding criminal warrant.

It was that latest order, as well as the existing policies, that were targeted late Thursday by Bondi as she installed Cole, igniting the suit challenging the federal takeover.

The city asserts that Bondi went beyond the Home Rule Act’s emergency authorities, which only require D.C. to provide the president with MPD’s “services.” While that provision may mean Trump can ask for officers and resources, the city says it does not allow the administration to upend MPD’s command structure or upend D.C.’s immigration laws.

That suit said the shoving aside of D.C.’s protocols for officers when it comes to immigration matters failed to take into account the “considered judgment of MPD leaders who are deeply familiar with the District’s law enforcement and public safety needs.”

But even Schwalb’s office on Friday acknowledged the city may ultimately not have the power to resist demands to help with federal operations.

“Look we know that the law under the Home Rule Act allows the federal government, during a course of an emergency, to request the services of MPD in furtherance of a federal purpose.

The ACLU said HHS issued the directive last month, restricting access to 13 programs that had previously been open to everyone.
“It will deprive children of access to crucial early educational programming and undermine access to essential and life-saving health care for children and their families.
Those fears may now be worsened by the HHS directive, deepening health disparities and limiting critical services for immigrant communities.
Advocates including the ACLU continue to demand its withdrawal, warning that implementation will disrupt access to essential health care, education and social services for millions.","WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a comment Wednesday warning that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) new directive would exclude noncitizens from dozens of community health, early education and social support programs. In a press release Thursday, the ACLU called the directive both “unlawful” and “harmful” to vulnerable communities.

The ACLU said HHS issued the directive last month, restricting access to 13 programs that had previously been open to everyone. Under a reinterpretation of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), which allowed noncitizens to access federal public benefits, HHS now considers an expanded list of services as limited to U.S. citizens.

Programs at stake include Head Start, which provides early childhood education to low-income families, and community health clinics that offer primary care to underserved areas. Other restricted services include mental health and substance use disorder support programs, family planning, and homeless assistance projects—all of which were previously open regardless of immigration status, according to the ACLU.

Since the late 1990s, federal administrations from both parties have taken a narrower view of PRWORA, with the Clinton administration allowing undocumented immigrants to access such services on the grounds that they were not “federal public benefits.” The HHS directive reverses that approach.

“The directive conflicts with PRWORA and upends longstanding guidance respected by four prior administrations,” the ACLU said. The group warned that HHS’s reinterpretation ignores decades of administrative precedent.

Backing the directive, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration.” Kennedy added that the directive “enforces the rule of law.”

“This arbitrary and harmful directive exemplifies this administration’s tunnel vision, which prioritizes its anti-immigrant crusade, no matter the harm,” said Ming-Qi Chu, deputy director of the ACLU Women’s Rights Project.

Chu said the directive could strip medical and educational access from millions of children, immigrants with disabilities and individuals recovering from substance use disorder, as well as survivors of gender-based violence. “It serves no one’s interest to deny people these essential services, and HHS must withdraw this incredibly misguided directive,” Chu said.

The ACLU also warned that the directive fails to consider the toll on immigrant families who rely on these programs for health, education and basic stability.

“The directive has triggered chaos and uncertainty both for administering agencies and the individuals, families and communities who rely on the services at stake,” the ACLU’s filing said. “It will deprive children of access to crucial early educational programming and undermine access to essential and life-saving health care for children and their families. It will also disproportionately burden mixed-status families, people with disabilities and survivors of gender-based violence.”

Public health experts have highlighted the health and economic risks of the policy under a second Trump administration. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) has reported that immigrants, including those without legal status, contribute billions in taxes each year and play a crucial role in the health care sector. KFF warned that restricting access could harm public health and economic stability nationwide.

The foundation also noted that many immigrant families may already avoid seeking health care due to fear and confusion. The Trump administration’s “public charge” policy likely decreased coverage for millions of noncitizens under Medicaid or CHIP, as families feared assistance would jeopardize residency.

Those fears may now be worsened by the HHS directive, deepening health disparities and limiting critical services for immigrant communities.

The 30-day public comment period on the policy closed this week, and the revised directive is set to take effect immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, according to HHS.

Advocates including the ACLU continue to demand its withdrawal, warning that implementation will disrupt access to essential health care, education and social services for millions.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration.
This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.
The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration.","In the last month, ICE has launched a recruitment campaign of unusual scale and persistence. Reports document emails sent to county deputies in Florida, outreach to FEMA personnel, targeted solicitations to retired federal workers, and policy changes that expand the age range for applicants well past forty. The campaign is not framed as an emergency measure but as a permanent expansion, made possible by a $170 billion appropriation for immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. ICE’s leadership has portrayed this as necessary to fulfill the agency’s mission. Local law enforcement leaders, particularly in Florida, have voiced both irritation and unease, objecting to the federal government’s bypassing of their command structures and raising concerns about losing trained officers to ICE’s ranks.

The practical explanation is straightforward: ICE is attempting to rapidly scale up its workforce to meet the Trump administration’s stated political goal of removing an estimated 20 million Latino people from the United States. In 2024, Donald Trump described these individuals as “poisoning the blood” of the country. The recruitment model—its targets, its institutional framing, its bypassing of local intermediaries—mirrors patterns visible in the historical record of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazi mobile killing units deployed in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. The comparison is not rhetorical excess. It is a study in method. The question is not whether ICE today is equivalent to the Einsatzgruppen. It is whether the logic of building a force for extraordinary enforcement has recurring features that should trigger historical alarm.

The Einsatzgruppen emerged from the SS security apparatus as Germany prepared for the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. According to Richard Rhodes in Masters of Death, they were formed from an existing pool of police officers, security agents, and civil servants. Recruitment was highly targeted. Men with experience in policing, intelligence, and military command were sought out for their capacity to operate under orders and within a rigid hierarchy. History makes clear that these were not simply volunteer fanatics. Many were approached through professional networks, offered postings that promised status and advancement, and placed within a structure that normalized their assignments as legitimate state work.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions.

Stefan Kühl, in Ordinary Organizations, underscores that the Einsatzgruppen operated according to the routines of bureaucratic administration. Orders were written in formal language, couched in terms of security and order maintenance. Missions were framed as operational tasks rather than moral questions. Men were told they were combating “banditry” or “partisan activity,” categories that erased the civilian status of their victims. This was a central mechanism for recruiting and retaining participation: the transformation of killing into a technical job, embedded in the standard practices of an organization.

Zygmunt Bauman’s Modernity and the Holocaust identifies this as a hallmark of modern bureaucratic violence. The Holocaust was not an eruption of irrational savagery but the product of systems designed to translate political directives into manageable administrative processes. The Einsatzgruppen were a case study in how to assemble a killing force from ordinary professionals, train them to think in technical rather than moral terms, and deploy them with minimal overt coercion.

The contours of ICE’s recent recruitment push follow a comparable bureaucratic logic. The recruitment targets a pre-screened pool of law enforcement and security professionals. Florida deputies, FEMA personnel, and retired federal agents are not random job seekers. They are individuals whose careers have conditioned them to follow formal orders, work within hierarchical structures, and frame their actions in procedural rather than purely moral language. This mirrors the Nazi recruitment strategy: draw from those already trained to execute state directives.

ICE is actively lowering entry barriers. The policy change lifting the maximum age limit above forty broadens the eligible pool in a way that signals volume as the overriding goal. In Nazi recruitment, similar expansions occurred when the need for personnel outpaced the available pool, with the result that older men or those with less ideal physical profiles were nonetheless brought into field operations. ICE is also leveraging bureaucratic legitimacy. The agency’s recruitment messages describe “enforcement opportunities” and “critical response positions” in terms that emphasize lawful authority, federal mandate, and organizational purpose. This is the same language of legitimization that Kühl and Bauman document in the Einsatzgruppen’s framing: orders presented as components of a rational plan, embedded in established institutional structures.

The campaign shows a willingness to bypass local institutional intermediaries. Florida sheriffs’ complaints that ICE directly contacted their deputies without coordination recalls historical cases in which Nazi units were introduced into territories without consulting local military or police commanders. In both cases, central authority overrode local norms in pursuit of a larger strategic objective.

The deepest similarity lies in the bureaucratic ability to render extraordinary measures administratively ordinary. Bauman warns that this capacity is intrinsic to modern organizations. The division of labor fragments moral responsibility. Language reframes acts of violence as technical assignments. In the Einsatzgruppen, mass shootings of civilians were described as “executions” or “security operations,” terms that masked the nature of the task from the participant’s own conscience.

In ICE’s case, the recruitment pitch itself functions as this kind of framing device. Potential hires are told they will be part of “national security” and “public safety” operations. In the context of an administration that has already pursued mass deportations, family separations, and expanded detention, such language situates controversial or coercive actions within the acceptable vocabulary of law enforcement.

Franklin Mixon’s concept of the “entrepreneurial bureaucrat” sharpens this point. Bureaucracies, and the officials within them, seek opportunities to expand their remit. ICE’s leadership has seized on a political moment—backed by unprecedented funding—to expand its manpower. In historical terms, the Einsatzgruppen leadership did the same within the SS apparatus, enlarging their operational scope whenever political conditions permitted.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent. Judicial review now functions as a rubber stamp for the Trump administration, with courts repeatedly validating executive actions that stretch or disregard statutory limits. Congressional oversight is, in practice, nonexistent, with leadership unwilling to confront or even meaningfully question enforcement policy.

The United States is not operating under the same conditions as the Nazi Reich in 1941, but the present safeguards are functionally nonexistent.

National media outlets remain cautious to the point of self-censorship, their corporate owners fearing retaliatory measures against other business holdings. In this environment, the assumption that legal and institutional checks will restrain an expanded, specially recruited force is untenable. Political leadership can and does issue directives that push beyond the law’s original intent, and the mechanisms designed to resist such directives have already shown their willingness to accommodate them. When that reality is combined with a rapidly enlarging enforcement body trained to operate under centralized command, the potential for escalation is immediate and concrete.

The modern state’s capacity for violence is not determined by the moral character of its personnel but by the institutional and political boundaries within which it functions. Ordinary organizational processes can adapt to deliver extraordinary harm when circumstances shift. The Einsatzgruppen were assembled and deployed in exactly this way, with bureaucratic procedures serving as the mechanism rather than an afterthought.

The current ICE recruitment drive is not a historical aberration. It is a recognizable pattern in the history of state enforcement agencies preparing for expansive and potentially coercive missions. Its targeting of trained law enforcement personnel, lowering of entry barriers, bypassing of local intermediaries, and reliance on bureaucratic framing are all features visible in the assembly of past forces that went on to commit atrocities. To note this is not to equate the present with the past in outcome. It is to recognize the continuity in method, and to understand that method as a warning. The Einsatzgruppen remind us that the path from “ordinary” enforcement to extraordinary violence is often paved with administrative memos, recruitment drives, and appeals to professionalism. The time to interrogate such patterns is before the mission expands and the boundaries shift.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61468305&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C76,N,,2025-08-16 13:57:23.259753

Dayra, an Ecuadorian student at P.S. 89 The Jose Peralta School of Dreamers in Queens, and her mom were separated from her 19-year-old brother during an immigration check-in on Tuesday at 26 Federal Plaza, according to the family and their advocates. Her last name is being withheld as a minor.

“We were all very scared,” Patricio, Dayra’s mom’s boyfriend who lives with the family, said in Spanish. “Because we knew they were going to arrest them.”

Dayra and her mom, Martha, were shipped off to a detention center in Texas, advocates said. The U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement locator showed Martha as of Friday afternoon at South Texas Family Residential Center, one of the largest immigration facilities in the country. The center was reopened this year after the Biden administration shuttered it. (The locator does not provide information for detainees under 18.)

“She called me yesterday, she told me she was fine. But she is very afraid of returning to Ecuador,” Patricio said of Martha, who fled domestic violence in the country. An immigration judge had previously denied her asylum bid and ordered the family deported, according to court records, but they continued to report to their check-ins as required by law.

Dayra’s brother, Manuel, 19, was being held at 26 Federal Plaza, before being moved to a detention center in Newark, New Jersey, according to the locator. He recently graduated high school on Long Island and was supposed to start college this year, Patricio said.

The Department of Homeland Security, the agency that houses ICE, did not immediately comment.

“We are hearing extremely concerning reports about an immigrant family, including a 7-year-old local public school student and her 19-year-old brother, detained by ICE,” Councilman Shekar Krishnan (D-Queens) said in a statement. “My office is working actively to obtain all the details. We are in contact with the local school, DOE officials, and federal offices to learn more and fight to make sure the family can be reunited.”

“Family separation is horrific, and ICE must stop these cruel tactics.”

In the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, P.S. 89 hosts a Spanish dual-language program and is in the process of launching a similar program in Bengali, according to school data and social media. More than half of students are learning English as a new language.

“The abuses of the federal government and neglect from City Hall have created an environment of terror for families in the streets of New York,” said Naveed Hasan, an advocate for the city’s immigrant students. “7-year-old Dayra is among the youngest children taken by ICE, and if she’s not immediately released, our own government will illegally deprive her of her right to learn and thrive with her loving PS 89Q community.”

Dayra and Manuel are the latest in a slew of New York students to be swept up in President Trump’s deportation agenda, including two young men, Dylan and Mouctar, who attend the city’s alternative high schools for students behind on credits. On Thursday, local lawmakers and advocated rallied for their release ahead of the school year, which begins on Sept. 4.

The Patchogue-Medford School District, where advocates say Manuel attended high school, did not return a request for comment Friday.

Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.","SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — A father waiting to pick up his child from school in the Linda Vista neighborhood was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, sparking outrage and inciting fear within the local community.

Officials from the San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) publicly addressed the incident Friday morning, confirming that the situation unfolded around 3:10 p.m. the day before near Linda Vista Elementary School.

Though not technically on campus, SDUSD Superintendent Fabiola Bagula said the parent was detained about five minutes before the dismissal bell at a nearby location, with multiple families witnessing the encounter.

“I am told that the father who was detained was concerned about his child’s welfare and who was going to get them from school,” Bagula explained.

The Department of Homeland Security contacted the school’s principal, Dr. Miriam Atlas, after the parent was detained, according to the superintendent.

“She [Dr. Atlas] had the difficult responsibility of contacting the child’s mother to inform her of what happened,” said Bagula. “The mother was able to pick up the child from school.”

School officials emphasized that students at Linda Vista Elementary School are very young, just 3 to 11 years old. To that point Bagula added, “You can have your immigration reform without traumatizing children.”

The principal also explained that immigration status is not something that is discussed during school enrollment as California law mandates that all school-aged children residing in the state be enrolled in school, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Additionally, schools cannot inquire about documents related to a student’s or their family’s immigration status.

Bagula relayed the following message to the community:

“To our families and to every child, documented or not, every child had the legal right to attend public school in the United States. We will protect that right and we will do so together. As Americans and as neighbors and as democracy, we must demand more from our leaders. We must call for laws and policies that reflect both justice and humanity.”

The status of the Linda Vista Elementary School father who was detained and taken away by ICE is unknown.

This isn’t the first time a San Diego-area parent has been approached by ICE near a school. Earlier this month, another parent was detained after a morning drop-off outside of an elementary school in Chula Vista.

Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed.
If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said.
Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census.
A census citizenship question In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has instructed the Commerce Department to change the way the U.S. Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the United States illegally, he said last week.

The census' data collections will be based on ""modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,"" the Republican president said on his social media platform, an indication he might try to inject his politics into a head count that determines political power and how federal funding is distributed.

Trump stressed that as part of the changes people in ""our Country illegally"" will be excluded from census counts.

In Nevada, there were nearly 290,000 noncitizens and 2.7 million citizens, according to the 2020 census.

Excluding undocumented immigrants would have minimal impact on Nevada’s representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, said David Damore, a political science professor and executive director of Brookings Mountain West and the Lincy Institute. Nevada gained its fourth and newest congressional seat after the 2010 census.

“We are not positioned to get a new [House] seat and the likelihood of losing one is small given current [population] growth patterns,” Damore said in a statement.

He noted that Trump unsuccessfully tried to include a question on citizenship status in the 2020 Census and suggested this attempt was likely to be unsuccessful. Additionally, Damore noted, Trump’s presidential successor would have to carry out Trump’s plan.

Sondra Cosgrove, a College of Southern Nevada political science professor and executive director of civic engagement for the nonprofit Vote Nevada, agreed. She said the 14th Amendment clearly states “the whole number of persons in each state” shall be counted.

“[The amendment] does not say citizens, it does not say voters, it doesn't say men or women. It just says whole persons. And so the president is going to have the same problem if he tries to say to the Census Bureau, ‘Go out and only count people who are citizens,’” Cosgrove said in an interview.

What Cosgrove is worried about, however, is if Congress revokes or withholds funding from the Census Bureau to comply with Trump’s directives. That could be problematic right now as the bureau hires people and gears up for the 2030 census.

“Every state is basically going to be told we don't have enough money to accurately count the number of people in your state,” Cosgrove said in an interview. “So every state is probably going to have to then step up and backfill with enough money to make sure that the census happens.”

Cosgrove said that with other federal agency budget cuts, if Congress withholds funding for the census, Nevada will have to make difficult choices on which services the state can afford to provide.

If undocumented immigrants are not counted, the biggest impact to Nevada is how much federal aid the state gets, Damore said. Billions of dollars of federal aid are based on formulas that use census data to determine a state’s population.

Experts said it was unclear what exactly Trump was calling for, whether it was changes to the 2030 census or a mid-decade census. If it’s the latter, the question is whether it would be used for a mid-decade apportionment, which is the process of divvying up congressional seats among the states based on the population count.

A new census?

Any changes in the conduct of a national census, which is the biggest non-military undertaking by the federal government, would require alterations to the Census Act and approval from Congress, which has oversight, and there likely would be a fierce fight. While the Census Act permits a mid-decade census for things such as distributing federal funding, it can't be used for apportionment or redistricting and must be done in a year ending in 5, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who consults on census issues.

""He cannot unilaterally order a new census. The census is governed by law, not to mention the Constitution,"" Lowenthal said. ""Logistically, it's a half-baked idea.""

It would be almost logistically impossible to carry out a mid-decade census in such a short period of time, New York Law School professor Jeffrey Wice said.

""This isn't something that you can do overnight,"" said Wice, a census and redistricting expert. ""To get all the pieces put together, it would be such a tremendous challenge, if not impossible.""

Trump's Truth Social post fits into an overall pattern in which he has tried to reshape basic measures of how U.S. society is faring to his liking, a process that ranges from monthly jobs figures to how congressional districts are drawn going into the 2026 midterm elections. But there could be legal challenges if he were to reshape the census, which also guides the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal funds to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

A census citizenship question

In a 2019 decision, the Supreme Court effectively blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The 14th Amendment says that ""the whole number of persons in each state"" should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of allocating congressional seats and Electoral College votes among the states based on population.

The last time the census included a question about citizenship was in 1950, and the Census Bureau's own experts had predicted that millions of Hispanics and immigrants would go uncounted if the census asked everyone if he or she is an American citizen.

Changes to the census could also play into the efforts by Trump to urge several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redraw their congressional maps ahead of schedule in ways that would favor GOP candidates.

Redistricting efforts

Redistricting typically occurs once every 10 years following the census, as states adjust district boundaries based on population changes, often gaining or losing seats in the process.

Despite Texas having redrawn its maps just a few years ago, Trump is pressuring Republicans in the state to redistrict again, claiming they are ""entitled"" to five additional Republican seats. Texas Republicans have cited population growth as justification for redrawing the congressional map. The state currently has 38 House seats, 25 held by Republicans.

Trump's team is also engaged in similar redistricting discussions in other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri and Indiana.

Earlier this month, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after standard revisions to the monthly jobs report showed that employers added 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported in May and June. The revisions suggested that hiring has severely weakened under Trump, undermining his claims of an economic boom.

The White House insists that the problem was the size of the revisions and that it wants accurate numbers. But outside experts disagreed with that assessment.

""Trump is basically destroying the federal statistical system,"" said Margo Anderson, a professor emerita at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has written extensively on the history of the census. ""He wants numbers that support his political accomplishments, such as he sees them.""

After the citizenship question was stopped by the Supreme Court in 2019, Trump made another effort in 2020, announcing a plan to exclude people living in the country illegally from the apportionment figures.

After states, cities and organizations sued, lower courts ruled the plan was illegal. By the time the Supreme Court weighed in, Trump had lost his re-election bid.

The justices sidestepped a decision on the legality of Trump's plan, throwing out the case on technical procedural grounds. The court said in an unsigned opinion that spoke only for the six-justice conservative majority that ""we express no view on the merits of the constitutional and related statutory claims presented. We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time.""

The three liberal justices dissented, saying the effort to exclude people in the country from the population for divvying up House seats is unlawful.

""I believe this Court should say so,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

This story begins during the lead-up to our entry into World War II, when in response to concerns about so-called “fifth columnists” in the United States, Congress passed the “Alien Registration Act of 1940”, also known as the “Smith Act” after its primary sponsor, then-Rep. Howard W. Smith (D-Va.).

As Britannica explains, the Smith Act “made it a criminal offense to advocate the violent overthrow of the government or to organize or be a member of any group or society devoted to such advocacy”.

That’s true, but Title III of the Smith Act also required aliens 14 or older who were in this country for 30 days or more to be registered and fingerprinted (if they had not been registered and fingerprinted when they obtained their visas), while mandating that the parents and guardians of aliens under 14 years of age complete this process for their kids.

Aliens would register at the local post office or other locations designated by the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) commissioner, and those who willfully failed or refused to comply with these requirements (or a separate change-of-address requirement) were subject to a fine or imprisonment.

Aliens were then issued a Form AR-3 as proof they registered, but as Judge McFadden explained in his April order:

Over the decades, the administrative state would dilute these statutory requirements by regulation. In 1944, the [INS] eliminated the division responsible for universal registration and shifted registration from post offices to ports of entry and INS offices. ... And in 1950, the INS suspended the use of the AR-3. ... Instead, the INS subbed in preexisting immigration forms that were only available to aliens with legal immigration status, like the Form I-151 for lawful permanent residents or the Form I-94 for aliens with a record of lawful entry. ... So through regulation, aliens who had entered the country illegally were effectively exempt from the statutory registration requirements, since there existed no process by which they could register. [Internal citations omitted.]

Regardless, when the INA was first enacted in 1952, the Smith Act registration regime carried over to the immigrant visa requirement in section 211 of the INA and to the “Registration of Aliens” provisions in sections 261 through 266 of the INA.

Actually, as Judge McFadden noted, section 264(e) of the INA goes the Smith Act one better, requiring aliens 18 and older to carry and have in their “personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to” them or face a $100 fine and a 30-day jail sentence.

So, if you’ve never seen an actual “green card”, just ask one of your lawful permanent resident alien friends to show you theirs — nearly every LPR I’ve known carries it.

Trump’s Executive Order 14159

Illogically, for 80 years, the INS and DHS only required legal aliens who had been vetted and complied with the visa-issuance and admissions processes to register. Respectfully, that’s like requiring only DEA-certified physicians and licensed pharmacists to obey our drug laws.

That changed on January 20, 2025, the day Trump returned to the White House and issued Executive Order (EO) 14159, “Protecting the American People Against Invasion”.

Section 7 of that EO, captioned “Identification of Unregistered Illegal Aliens”, directed the DHS secretary, in coordination with the State Department and attorney general, to: “immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply with” the INA registration requirements; “ensure that all previously unregistered aliens in the United States comply with” those requirements; and “ensure that failure to comply with” those “legal obligations ... is treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority.”

The New “Alien Registration Requirement”

In accordance with EO 14159, as I’ve previously reported, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced on February 25 that she would begin enforcing the INA registration requirements as part of a suite of tools her department would use “to track illegal aliens and compel them to leave the country voluntarily”.

DHS then set up an “Alien Registration Requirement” web page for aliens to use to determine whether they are required to register, with a link to the new Form G-325R, “Biographic Information (Registration)”, which they can complete online.

And, on March 12, DHS published an interim final rule (IFR) laying out these new requirements (to take effect on April 11) and inviting public comments on them.

Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights v. U.S. DHS

Which brings me to the challenge brought against the new requirements in the IFR, and a complaint filed on March 31 in the D.C. District Court captioned Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights [CHIRLA] v. U.S. DHS.

In their complaint, CHIRLA and three other organizations — the United Farmworkers of America, CASA, and Make the Road New York — alleged that the IFR “violates the procedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act” (APA), and that “absent intervention” by the district court, “all [aliens] — as well as U.S. citizens wrongly suspected of being [aliens] — will be exposed to a new criminal enforcement regime and a ‘show me your papers’ country, ... without regard to the statutorily mandated guardrails of the APA”.

As my then-colleague Rob Law explained in February 2022, “before a regulatory change can occur” under the APA, “the relevant executive branch department must publish the proposed change in the Federal Register, explaining the justification for the revision and giving the public at least 30 days to provide feedback”.

DHS asserted, however, that it was publishing this rule as an IFR “without prior notice and opportunity for comment” because it is a “procedural rule”, that is, “a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice”.

On the contrary, the CHIRLA plaintiffs argued:

With just 30 days’ warning, the IFR abandons the eighty-year-old approach to registration and imposes a new universal registration scheme and attendant civil and criminal liabilities on an enormous number of people. According to Defendants’ own estimates, between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people would be newly required to register.

Judge McFadden’s Order

In his April order, Judge McFadden never got to the facts of that argument or any of the others that the plaintiffs raised in their motion or complaint, finding instead that they failed to show they have standing to bring the case to begin with.

As he explained:

Standing is a “bedrock constitutional requirement.” ... It requires that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” in the outcome, which “helps ensure that courts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as Article III [of the U.S. Constitution] requires.” ... Standing doctrine thus “serves to protect the ‘autonomy’ of those who are most directly affected so that they can decide whether and how to challenge the defendant’s action.” ... And it ensures that “the Framers’ concept of the proper — and properly limited — role of the courts in a democratic society” is vindicated, by ensuring decisions meant for the political process are left to the political process. [Internal citations omitted.]

The first ellipsis above referenced U.S. v. Texas, the 2023 opinion in which the Supreme Court rejected a challenge brought by Texas and other states to Biden administration’s policies that ignored INA mandates requiring DHS to detain criminal aliens, on the ground that even states lack standing to force the federal government to take enforcement actions.

Thus, enforcement advocates who were sore about the ultimate outcome of Texas should take comfort in the knowledge that what goes around comes around.

Judge McFadden’s standing analysis consumes 14 pages of his 21-page order, and it gets arcane, but the key takeaways are that none of the four plaintiffs showed that they had either “organizational standing” — that is, that they “suffered a concrete and demonstrable injury to [their] activities” because of the rule — or that it had “associational standing”.

With respect to associational standing, as the court explained:

An organization has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when three requirements are met. First, “its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.” ... Second, “the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose.” ... And third, “neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” [Internal citations omitted.]

Here, Judge McFadden concluded, none of the groups showed that “any of their individual members would independently have standing to challenge the” IFR.

Because the groups failed to demonstrate a “’substantial likelihood’ of standing”, the judge denied their motion to stay the effective date of the IFR and a preliminary injunction.

D.C. Circuit Court’s Per Curiam Order

On April 28, the CHIRLA plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of Judge McFadden’s order with the D.C. Circuit, and on May 2, they filed a Motion for Stay or, in the Alternative, Injunction Pending Appeal of his order.

Not surprisingly, they disagreed with Judge McFadden’s standing conclusions, arguing that each of them has organizational standing (and that CHIRLA had associational standing to boot) in the course of ultimately asserting that they would face “irreparable harm” if the IFR were to remain in effect.

On August 12, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit issued a brief per curiam order (unsigned but issued for the panel as a whole) denying plaintiffs’ motions for a stay or injunction pending appeal and allowing the IFR to proceed for now.

Simply put, the circuit panel concluded that the plaintiffs “have not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal”, but the panel did order expedited consideration of the case.

Note that this wasn’t what most would think of as a “pro-Trump” panel. Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson has been on the circuit court since she was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Judge Robert L. Wilkins was a 2014 appointee of President Obama, and President Biden nominated Judge Bradley Garcia, who was confirmed in May 2023.

Trump administration requested voter data.
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.","BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.

Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.

The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.

Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.

SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.

“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”

Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.

Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.

“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.

Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.

But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.

Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.

Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”

“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.

At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.

Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.

Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.

The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.

“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.

“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.

The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.

In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.

“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.

“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”

GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.

Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.

Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.

On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.

As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.

The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.

Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.

Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.

The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.

The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.

Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.

“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.

During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.

“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.

Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.

Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.

Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.

“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.

Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.

When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.

“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/naturalization-ceremony.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 06:56:30.368734

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June.","The Trump administration has intensified its efforts to limit California’s ability to impose clean air standards, filing a motion in federal court to join a trucking industry lawsuit that seeks to end the state’s Clean Truck Partnership, which includes a plan to switch to battery operated heavy trucks by 2045.

The motion, which would make the federal government a plaintiff in the industry lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Sacramento, is the latest in several actions taken by the administration to weaken California’s air quality regulations, many of which are more stringent than those imposed by the federal law and the Environmental Protection Agency.

It targets a decision by the California Air Resources Board to continue enforcing the state’s standards even after President Donald Trump signed a congressional resolution aimed at invalidating them. A similar motion was filed in a lawsuit in Illinois, and another that takes aim at regulations regarding light-duty vehicles such as automobiles was filed this week in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“In a stunning act of defiance, the State of California is attempting to use its own vehicle and engine emissions standards through a so-called ‘Clean Truck Partnership’ to ban internal-combustion engines in heavy-duty trucks, notwithstanding duly enacted federal statutes specifically providing that those regulatory standards are preempted,” the administration said in its motion.

Trump signed a congressional resolution in June revoking California’s ability to impose its own standards, which had been previously allowed under a waiver of federal rules what would otherwise have banned such state-level regulations.

However, the state continued to insist that an agreement it had reached with the trucking industry two years ago that required a reduction in emissions and a shift to electric trucks by 2045 was still enforceable. California is also challenging the congressional resolution in federal court.

The industry’s top manufacturers sued on Aug. 11, and on Thursday the Trump administration filed its motion to join the lawsuit.

The move highlights the administration’s determination to end what it sees as regulatory overreach by California and other Democratic-led states, and marks the latest in a series of lawsuits that have targeted California’s policies on immigration, rights for transgender people, environmental protection and even the price of eggs.

The motion was filed on the same day that California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a proposal to begin to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor more Democrats in response to actions by the state of Texas to draw more Republican seats as requested by Trump. It names the Air Resources Board, the board’s executive director Steven Cliff and Newsom as defendants.

“Agreement, contract, partnership, mandate — whatever California wants to call it, this unlawful action attempts to undermine federal law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement Friday.

In their initial lawsuit, truck manufacturers Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar, Inc., and Volvo Group North America said that they were “caught in the crossfire” between the federal government and the state of California.

California, they said, continues to insist on compliance with its stricter rules and has threatened sanctions against the companies if they do not do so. But at the same time, their lawsuit says, the U.S. Department of Justice has sent the manufacturers cease-and-desist letters ordering them to stop complying with California’s demands.

“California demands that (manufacturers) follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders (manufacturers) to disregard them,” the lawsuit says. “This situation is not tenable.”

In its motion, the federal government laid out the timeline for its decision to join the lawsuit. On Aug. 11, the day the trucking companies filed their complaint, a congressional committee sent a letter to the Air Resources Board demanding that it comply with federal regulations, the motions says.

The next day, the U.S. Department of Justice requested consent from the trucking companies to join their lawsuit. Government lawyers met via a video conference to discuss the matter on Aug. 14 and filed their motion the same day, documents in federal court show.

CARB spokeswoman Lynda Lambert said the agency continues to believe that the federal government’s actions limiting the state’s ability to enforce its environmental regulations were illegal.

“On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed unconstitutional and illegal resolutions purporting to overturn three of U.S EPA’s decisions to grant California waivers, including its Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks, and Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Omnibus regulations,” Lambert said. “CARB disputes the legality and effect of these resolutions, and they are being challenged in court.”

CARB chair Liane Randolph declined to comment on the lawsuit itself.

But she has harshly criticized the administration’s efforts to weaken California’s environmental rules.

“Despite the President’s signature, this remains an unconstitutional, illegal, and foolish attempt to undermine California’s clean air protections,” she said after Trump signed the resolution in June. The action, she said, was the latest in a series of “vindictive” moves aimed at trapping consumers into using fossil fuels.

“CARB will use every tool at its disposal to continue our critical work to clean the air and address the climate crisis,” she continued at that time. “The health and well-being of all Californians depends on it.”

A hearing on whether to allow the federal government to join the lawsuit has been set for Sept. 19 in federal court in Sacramento.

Rep. Gabe Evans' bill would provide legal status to some undocumented immigrants

As the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement efforts, farms have been among the locations U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have set their sights on.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 42% of farm workers in the U.S. are without legal work authorization.

The raids not only have leaders in the agriculture industry worried, but some leaders in the restaurant and hospitality industries are also concerned. They say increased enforcement actions and the lack of a clear path to legal status have created fear among workers and their families. They say that unless a solution is found, it will harm other parts of the economy.

“We're going down what I would call [a] great risk for the economy, and that is empty shelves, rising prices and businesses closing. That is the path we're on if we don't do something,” said Emily Knight, the CEO and president of the Texas Restaurant Association. “And that is not just a risk to our immigrant population, it is a risk to every American.”

Knight was among a group of restaurant and hospitality leaders who participated in a press conference on Thursday to mark the launch of a national campaign highlighting the contributions of immigrant food workers. The American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC) and the James Beard Foundation launched the campaign.

The group also urged President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers to provide work permits for food workers.

""There is a very large percentage of individuals that are preparing food every day, that are contributing in our kitchens, that are making a difference, that need to have a path to a work permit to continue paying their taxes and contributing to the economy and their communities,"" Knight said.

Colorado Congressman Gabe Evans also participated in the press conference. He said the Dignity Act, which he introduced along with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in July, would provide a long-term solution by giving agriculture, hospitality and other workers who are unauthorized a pathway to legal status.

“They want to work hard; they want to pay their taxes; they want to raise their families here. They want to be those contributing members of American society,” Evans said. “We just have to give them a pathway forward to be able to legally have that work authorization. And so that's what the Dignity Act does.”

The bill would create a program that would offer legal status to undocumented immigrants who were in the country before 2021. They would be required to pay any back taxes they owe and $7,000 in restitution. They must also remain in good standing.

""We know this is something that is critical, not just for those immigrants who are looking for that pathway forward, but for the American economy,” said Evans.

While immigrants who meet the conditions would be allowed to stay, they would not be eligible for federal benefits. The bill would also increase border security, target traffickers and criminal smugglers, and mandate the use of E-Verify for employers nationwide.

Knight described Evans' proposal as a ""common sense solution.""

Evans said now is the time to pass the legislation because the Trump administration has made significant progress securing the border.

""That's why I think now is the perfect time to have this conversation, because we do have that border security and that strong emphasis on the rule of law and making sure that the bad elements no longer can really taint this conversation,"" Evans said. ""We can actually have a productive conversation about how do we fix the broken immigration system.""

Evans has received criticism from some who call his proposal amnesty. He said those claims are inaccurate because the bill does not offer citizenship and requires immigrants to meet several requirements, including paying back taxes.

“This is not an amnesty bill,” Evans said. “This is a bill for people who want the accountability of earning a path to some sort of legal status.”

It’s unclear if the bill has enough support to make it through Congress. Other bipartisan immigration reform proposals have failed in the past.

“We have to work hand in hand with the administration to make sure that whatever we put together and whatever ends up on [the president’s] desk is something that he'll actually sign,” Evans said. “I can't really speak for the administration, but I don't think that this is lost on the administration. I mean, the president himself comes out of the hospitality industry, and so we've heard comments that he's made in the past about, you know, we can't leave our farmers with no one.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e7f3e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F45%2Fb8%2Fbce7dbcf4dc29907400b2aaf9449%2Fimmigration-and-labor-shortage.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 05:56:34.977106

Superior Court, the California Supreme Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act does not preempt California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.98. The statute, intended to deter the “strategic nonpayment of arbitration fees,” provides that a business or employer materially breaches its arbitration agreement if it fails to pay required arbitration fees within 30 days of the due date. Upon the resulting breach, a plaintiff may proceed in court and pursue sanctions against the defendant or seek an order compelling the defendant to pay the required fees and proceed in arbitration. Plaintiffs’ firms strategically leveraged these provisions to avoid arbitration, leading corporate defendants to argue that the FAA preempts the statute.

This question percolated in California appellate and federal courts with differing results. The California Courts of Appeal held that the FAA does not preempt the California statute while federal courts in California held the opposite. This split led the California Supreme Court to take up the issue in Hohenshelt.

The California Supreme Court held that the FAA does not preempt Section 1281.98, but explained that Section 1281.98 does not create a strict, unwaivable 30-day deadline to pay. The Court’s opinion does not disturb existing federal case law holding that Section 1281.98 is preempted by the FAA. The U.S. Supreme Court will likely need to take up the issue to fully resolve the question. Until then, businesses should consider procedures that limit or mitigate their potential liability related to arbitration fees.

Background

Section 1281.98 provides that “if a company or business that drafts an arbitration agreement does not pay its share of required arbitration fees or costs within 30 days after they are due, the company or business is in ‘material breach’ of the arbitration agreement. In the case of such a material breach, an employee or consumer can, among other things, withdraw his or her claim from arbitration and proceed in court.” The employee or consumer can also bring a petition for “an order compelling the drafting party to pay all arbitration fees that the drafting party is obligated to pay.”

The California Courts of Appeal interpreted the 30-day requirement to be a strict, unwaivable deadline, requiring that fees be received before the 30-day deadline with no exceptions for good cause. The statute provided plaintiffs’ firms a potent weapon in the arbitration space, particularly in the context of mass arbitrations.

In mass arbitrations, plaintiffs’ law firms file thousands of individual claims before a single arbitral forum and seek to leverage the threat of millions of dollars in arbitration fees to extract an early settlement from corporate defendants. Corporate defendants argue that these claims often are baseless, include claimants who never signed an arbitration agreement with the defendant, were not customers of the defendant or do not exist. In response to this tactic, corporate defendants at times refused to pay the hefty arbitration invoices, and plaintiffs’ firms used Section 1281.98 to obtain an order compelling the defendants to pay. If defendants continue to refuse to pay and plaintiffs proceed to court, the plaintiffs’ firms often relied on Section 1281.98 to argue in favor of sanctions under Section 1281.99 that might include a court-ordered prohibition on conducting discovery or a judgment of default. In response, corporate defendants invoked the protections of the FAA and argued that it preempts Section 1281.98.

Hohenshelt Litigation

In Hohenshelt, the plaintiff’s sexual harassment claims against his former employer were compelled to arbitration before JAMS pursuant to a pre-dispute arbitration agreement. The court case was stayed pending the arbitration. On July 29, 2022, JAMS sent an invoice to the employer defendant, and the employer failed to pay that invoice within 30 days. The plaintiff withdrew from the arbitration, citing Section 1281.98, and filed a motion to lift the stay in the trial court. Although the trial court denied the motion, the appellate court reversed, reasoning that Section 1281.98 does not empower the arbitrator to cure a party’s missed payment. The appellate court rejected the defendant’s argument that the FAA preempts Section 1281.98.

The California Supreme Court agreed and held that “section 1281.98, properly construed, is not preempted by the FAA.” The Court explained that California appellate courts have incorrectly interpreted the statute “to impose an inflexible and sometimes harsh rule resulting in loss of arbitral rights.” The Court rejected rigid construction of the statute and held that it “does not abrogate the longstanding principle, established by statute and common law, that one party’s nonperformance of an obligation automatically extinguishes the other party’s contractual duties only when nonperformance is willful, grossly negligent, or fraudulent.”

The statute was intended to deter “strategic nonpayment of arbitration fees” and not “to strip companies and employers of their contractual right to arbitration where nonpayment of fees results from a good faith mistake, inadvertence, or other excusable neglect.” With this construction in mind, the California Supreme Court concluded that Section 1281.98 is not preempted because it does not deviate from general state contract law principles, disfavor arbitration or invent a special arbitration-favoring rule. The statute’s default 30-day timeline encourages the speedy resolution and “makes arbitration contracts enforceable on the same grounds as those that apply to other contracts: When a party breaches its contractual obligations willfully, fraudulently, or with gross negligence, it cannot escape the consequences by pointing to a lack of harm to the other party.”

His enforcement of mass deportations has various communities fearful of the worst. We hear things online talking about people being taken and put into detention centers. Trump said he wanted to deport “the worst of the worst,” however, among these individuals there are many who come in hopes of having a better future for their children (“Los Angeles public schools to open with unprecedented protections for immigrant children,” Aug. 13).

These recent raids that have occurred all over the states are specifically affecting the minds of the younger generation, having to see the families of friends, people online and even sometimes their own family be separated. The children are now living in a world in which they have to be scared they won’t see their families anymore. This is bringing them so much stress, anxiety and depression.

The man who died on the 210 Freeway was identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez from Jutiapa, Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which said the Guatemalan consulate confirmed the identity.

Cellphone video from the deadly crash appears to show a passerby on the 210 Freeway, showing the body of a man who has been hit by a car just yards from where federal officers were arresting day laborers below.

The man ran from the scene, crossed Evergreen Avenue and entered the eastbound 210 Freeway, said Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik. CHP officers said they received a report just before 10 a.m. that someone had been hit by a SUV on the freeway near Myrtle Avenue.

What exactly led up to the man running onto the freeway is unclear.

“Was it intentional? I don’t think that is the case, but it ended up with a father, a brother being killed,” said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network.

The Department of Homeland Security told NBC Los Angeles in a statement that Montoya Valdez was not being pursued by federal officials. But Alvarado blamed the federal officials’ tactics that, he said, created fear.

“Whether they were chasing him or not, the fact is that when you have operations of this kind, the first reaction of any human being is to run,”

Many others in the same Home Depot parking lot also ran, according to people who witnessed or experienced the raid.

“My boss told me to run because immigration was there,” Mattias, a worker who escaped the raid, said in Spanish. “Some people ran regardless of their immigration status because nowadays, they don’t know if undocumented or documented people will be detained.”

Mattias said he hurt himself while jumping a fence.

“The DMV and ICE have remained in communication, have seemingly been collaborative,” ACLU Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said during a press conference.
It is not valid identification to obtain benefits or services for federal purposes, according to the Nevada DMV website.
During President Donald Trump’s first administration, it was revealed that at least three states shared drivers’ immigration information with ICE.
In June, The Indy filed a similar public records request with the DMV.","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nevada announced a lawsuit against the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for failing to disclose public records related to potential collaboration with federal immigration officers.

In the Thursday lawsuit, the ACLU said the DMV had failed to turn over correspondence between the agency and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in response to multiple public records requests since February. After sending a formal demand letter through the Nevada Attorney General’s Office, the Nevada DMV turned over heavily redacted and incomplete documents.

Exhibits the ACLU released Friday show email exchanges between the DMV and ICE where someone with an ICE email address gave the DMV the names, date of birth and driver’s license numbers of three individuals they were looking for, asking the DMV to turn over photos and information related to the three individuals.

The ACLU further said the records suggest there was a chat on Signal — an encrypted messaging platform known for its enhanced security — between staff at ICE and the Nevada DMV, which has never been disclosed to the public.

“The DMV and ICE have remained in communication, have seemingly been collaborative,” ACLU Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said during a press conference.

The DMV declined to comment because of “ongoing litigation.”

In an email between the agency and the ACLU, they said that “there are no records of memoranda, policies, trainings or guidelines in effect related to collaboration with immigration and customs (ICE) officers. The reason there are no policies is because we do not work with ICE.”

However, in another email exchange between the DMV and ICE, a DMV representative wrote, “we have confirmed that there are no faxes or Signal messages responsive to your request. Our research indicates that Signal is not a DMV-managed application and one of which our agency has never had access to, therefore no additional communications would be stored there.”

Nevada is one of 19 states that allow undocumented people to get driver’s licenses, known as driver authorization cards. Those cards allow people who cannot meet proof of identity requirements for a standard license to still drive. It is not valid identification to obtain benefits or services for federal purposes, according to the Nevada DMV website.

It was unclear whether the information that the DMV shared with ICE was related to driver authorization cards because the exchanges were heavily redacted, Haseebullah said.

During President Donald Trump’s first administration, it was revealed that at least three states shared drivers’ immigration information with ICE. Then Nevada DMV spokeswoman Brandi Alexandra Smith told the online outlet Governing that it does not release any information relating to immigration status, nationality or citizenship from license application files. She further said that state law prevents the DMV from sharing information with any other agencies “for the purpose of immigration.”

During the 82nd legislative session in 2023, Assm. Max Carter (D-Las Vegas) introduced AB407, which would eventually become the state law prohibiting the DMV from sharing personal information regarding a license, identification card or vehicle registration to federal entities for immigration enforcement.

“We brought AB407 to give some confidence to our communities that due process would be followed,” Carter said.

He called the communications between the DMV and ICE ""disappointing,” and noted Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the law in 2023.

A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“It's eroding that belief that the government respects the people who live here,” Carter said about the need to enact a law preventing state agencies from sharing personal information.

The only exceptions to the law are if the requester submits a written release from the person or the DMV director releases the information pursuant to a lawful court order, subpoena or warrant.

Without an act from Congress, the DMV is required to follow Nevada’s law, said Christopher Peterson, the ACLU’s legal director.

“When it comes to immigration enforcement, the federal government can't make the state help them. They can't force them to do it,” said Sadmira Ramic, an ACLU attorney.

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, federal agencies are supposed to tell the public how they intend to use and safeguard personal data before they begin collecting it. They are not supposed to use data beyond the intended purpose.

The lawsuit is the latest pushback against increasing collaboration between ICE and state officials. Last Friday, The Indy broke news that the state's national guard was authorized to help ICE with administrative tasks. Earlier that week, Nevada landed on a federal list of “sanctuary states” despite having no laws prohibiting collaboration between state officials and federal immigration agents.

Several police departments, including Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, have active partnerships with ICE, through which local officers are deputized to carry out federal immigration enforcement duties.

In June, The Indy filed a similar public records request with the DMV. The agency said that the request was “exempt from disclosure” as “any information between DHS and our compliance division are on-going cases, which are not public records and cannot be released.”

GPAI Code of Practice published

On 10 July, the European Commission (the ""Commission"") published the final General-Purpose AI Code of Practice (the ""Code""), which is intended to help providers of general-purpose AI (""GPAI"") models comply with certain provisions of the EU AI Act (the ""AI Act""). Although the Code is voluntary and non-binding, the Commission has stated that it will provide a practical way for providers to demonstrate compliance and reduce legal uncertainty.

The Code supports compliance with Articles 53 and 55 of the AI Act, which set out obligations for providers of GPAI models, including those defined in the AI Act as having systemic risk (i.e. when the cumulative amount of computation used for a system's training exceeds ""10(^25)"" or when the system has an impact equivalent to this amount). The AI Act's requirements take effect from August 2025, becoming fully enforceable for new GPAI models by August 2026 and for existing GPAI models by August 2027.

The Code is organised into three chapters: Transparency, Copyright, and Safety & Security. Some key takeaways from the Code are as follows:

Providers must maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation for each GPAI model, using a template supplied by the Commission. They are required to make contact information publicly available for information requests and ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of all documented information.

To comply with copyright obligations, providers need to implement a copyright policy in line with EU law, ensure only lawfully accessible content is used for training the models, and respect machine-readable rights reservations. Technical safeguards must be in place to prevent copyright-infringing outputs, and a clear complaints mechanism for rightsholders is required.

For GPAI models with systemic risk, providers must adopt a robust safety and security framework, identify and mitigate systemic risks, and implement cybersecurity protections. Providers are also required to prepare a Safety and Security Model Report, define clear internal responsibilities, and report serious incidents to authorities.

The publication of the Code marks a significant step in operationalising AI regulation in the EU. Organisations developing or deploying GPAI models should review their practices against the Code’s requirements to ensure good governance and regulatory readiness as the AI landscape continues to evolve.

Mandatory template released for GenAI model providers

In July, the Commission published a template to aid GPAI providers with summarising the content which they use to train their AI models. The Commission intends for the template to be an effective way for providers to increase transparency in line with their obligations under the AI Act. This template is a supplement to the guidelines on the scope of rules for GPAI models and the Code.

Designed to be user-friendly, its goal is to help providers of GPAI models fully comply with the AI Act. By streamlining compliance, the initiative supports broader efforts to build public trust in AI and unlock its full potential for economic and societal benefit.

Inquiry into Human Rights and the regulation of AI

On 25 July 2025, the Joint Committee on Human Rights (the ""Committee"") has launched an inquiry (the ""Inquiry"") into the impact of AI on human rights in the UK.

The Inquiry aims to assess both the risks and opportunities that AI presents for human rights and to determine whether current legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate to address these challenges as AI technology evolves and if not, what changes should be made to these frameworks. AI technologies offer clear benefits to society but also raise serious concerns, including the risk of reinforcing bias and discrimination through the use of flawed data. Their use in surveillance may threaten privacy and freedom of expression, while the data used to train AI models could lead to opaque decision-making and bias.

The Inquiry is particularly interested in the way that AI can influence individual human rights both positively and negatively in areas such as: (i) privacy and data usage; (ii) discrimination and bias; and (iii) access to effective remedies for human rights violations.

The Committee is seeking written submissions on the above key issues from any member of the public. It will also examine whether the UK's legal framework and government policies sufficiently protect human rights in the context of AI, and what future legislation might be needed.

Additional topics include the challenges of regulating AI given its international nature, accountability for human rights breaches, the appropriate point in the AI lifecycle for liability, and whether different types of AI require distinct regulatory approaches. The Inquiry will also consider lessons from other jurisdictions, such as the European Union.

Feedback can be submitted here until 5 September 2025.

Government publishes AI Action Plan for Justice

The Ministry of Justice's AI Action Plan for Justice (the ""Plan for Justice""), launched in July 2025, sets out a comprehensive strategy to integrate AI across the justice system in England and Wales. The Plan for Justice aims to make justice services faster, fairer, and more accessible through, among other things, the automation of routine tasks and personalising services for citizens and staff. Developed with input from both the judiciary and legal regulators, the Plan for Justice supports AI adoption across courts, prisons, probation, and supporting services.

It focuses on three main priorities which are as follows: (i) strengthening the foundations for AI adoption through establishing a dedicated Justice AI Unit, governance, creating an AI & Data Ethics Framework, and robust data infrastructure; (ii) embedding AI in courts, tribunals, prisons, and probation to enhance productivity and streamline work, such as by ensuring all staff have a secure AI assistant, using speech and translation AI, and using AI coding assistants to modernise legacy systems; and (iii) investing in people and partnerships by developing AI talent, fostering collaboration with legal service providers, and supporting responsible innovation. Importantly, the Plan for Justice emphasises the importance of human oversight when using AI, noting that ""[the Ministry of Justice] will monitor outputs, apply de-biasing techniques, and use representative datasets to ensure AI augments, not replaces, human judgment"".

The Plan for Justice emphasises transparency to maintain ethical standards and uphold public trust as this will ensure AI supports rather than replaces human judgment. Early pilots have shown promising results, with AI tools already reducing administrative burdens and improving service quality. The roadmap involves a phased approach, with continuous evaluation and adaptation over a 3-year period that starts in April 2025. The Ministry of Justice is committed to working with partners, regulators, and the wider justice sector to ensure AI delivers tangible benefits to uphold an equitable justice system.

The Plan for Justice can be read in full here.

Trump's AI Action Plan

On the 23 July the White House revealed its vision for future AI policy in the form of a 28-page AI action plan (the ""Plan""). According to the White House's press release, this Plan is part of a ""shift toward policy aimed at fostering U.S AI dominance in the fact of fierce competition from China."" This statement is just another example of the competitiveness between world powers and the interconnected nature of geopolitics and technology in the global AI race. Emphasising this, the first line of the Plan's introduction states that ""America is in a race to achieve global dominance in artificial intelligence.""

Key aspects of the Plan include: (i) using federal agencies to develop new standards and improve those that already exist; (ii) removing regulatory barriers and red tape to foster AI innovation; and (iii) improving risk prevention. It is expected that President Trump will use executive orders to put some of the Plan's points into action.

According to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director, Michael Kratsios, the Plan ""galvanizes Federal efforts to turbocharge our innovative capacity, build cutting-edge infrastructure, and lead globally, ensuring that American workers and families thrive in the AI era."" Organisations will welcome the Plan's explicit efforts to remove red tape.

The Plan has already been met with varying reactions from concerned parties, with several privacy and AI safety groups coming together to sign the People's AI Action Plan – a statement within which they urge the US government to focus on the environmental and social needs of the country rather than the wants of the technology industry.

Law Commission releases AI discussion paper

Last month the Law Commission published a discussion paper (the ""Paper"") focusing on AI and the law. The aim of the Paper is to raise awareness of legal issues concerning AI, to encourage discussion around the topic and to aid in identifying the areas that are in most pressing need of reform.

The Paper explores:

AI autonomy and adaptiveness;

Interaction with and reliance on AI; and

AI training and data.

While the Paper considers how legal issues may arise, it does not include any specific proposals for law reform. However, it does consider the ""perhaps radical, option of granting AI systems some form of legal personality"" which it considers might be a solution to the immediate problem of liability - likely to become a more pressing issue as AI becomes more sophisticated.

Sir Peter Fraser, Chair of the Law Commission, emphasised the rapid development and expanding use of AI across various fields, including automated driving and medical diagnosis. He noted that AI is likely to continue influencing many aspects of daily life in significant ways – posing both benefits and risks. Fraser stressed the importance of ensuring that the laws of England and Wales evolve to keep pace with the changes brought about by AI.

Enforcement and Civil Litigation

Voice actors sue AI startup for voice cloning

A federal judge in New York has allowed two voice actors who allege their voices were used without their permission to proceed with a lawsuit against AI voiceover company Lovo Inc. (""Lovo""). The actors claim they were hired through the freelancing app Fiverr for limited projects, but later discovered Lovo had sold AI-generated versions of their voices as digital personas which the actors deemed to be unauthorised ""clones"" of their voices. While the judge has dismissed most federal copyright and trademark claims, he permitted the actors to pursue claims under New York's right of publicity laws and to amend their complaint regarding copyright infringement related to AI training.

This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges against tech companies accused of using creative works to train AI systems without consent. Similarly in the UK, there was a prolonged ""ping-pong"" of debate between the House of Lords and the House of Commons around the inclusion of protective measures for rights holders in the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (the ""DUAA""), which we covered in a previous edition of Neural Network and more generally in our DUAA series (a deep-dive into various provisions of the DUAA, the most recent of which can be found here). The House of Commons consistently blocked the inclusion of any such clauses, noting that, among other things, the DUAA was not the right instrument for this change. Creatives, including Elton John and Dua Lipa were vocal about the issue, urging the Prime Minister to appropriately consider legislative protections for artists' copyright. Protective provisions were ultimately not included, but the government agreed to publish a report on copyright and AI proposals within nine months of the DUAA being passed.

Technology developments and market news

A new partnership: UK and OpenAI

Last month the UK government signed a ""strategic partnership"" with artificial intelligence organisation OpenAI.

This new partnership forms part of the government's strategy to attract increased investment into the UK's artificial intelligence sector - in January of this year, the digital secretary Peter Kyle announced an ""AI opportunities action plan"" in order to uplift the UK's AI sector. Currently, the UK is home to pioneering AI laboratories such as Google DeepMind. However, the levels of funding available within the nation are dwarfed by AI powerhouses such as the USA and China. This is best exemplified with the amounts of private AI investment each of these countries received last year; the USA boasted $109.1 billion, China had a healthy $9.3 billion while the UK lagged behind with only $4.5 billion.

The ""strategic partnership"" between the UK government and OpenAI is set out in a voluntary memorandum of understanding that includes a series of pledges from both parties. The government commits to discovering ways to adopt OpenAI's technologies in public services in a variety of sectors such as justice and education technology. On the flip side, OpenAI pledges to ""explore"" investing in AI infrastructure within the UK and to hire more staff in the UK.

This partnership seems promising and may help alleviate some of the concerns voiced by UK entrepreneurs regarding technology regulation, most notably highlighted by the recent enactment of the DUAA on 19 June 2025.

China proposes a global regulatory body for AI

China has announced an ambitious plan to expand its influence in global AI governance, aiming to establish a new international cooperation organisation and promote open-source technology sharing. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang highlighted the need for a unified global AI governance framework, criticising technological monopolies and export restrictions – arguably implicitly referring to US policies.

China's foreign ministry released a 13-point proposal advocating for new UN-led dialogue mechanisms and a safety governance framework. The plan emphasises collaboration on open-source platforms and sharing key technologies, including semiconductors, to benefit global development, particularly in the global South. This reflects China's strategy of continuing in its attempts to grow its global influence, also exemplified by gradually increasing its involvement in UN agencies, particularly those focused on development, technology, and technical standards. The aim of this could be to fill the political lacuna left since the Trump administration began pulling back from the UN. Despite contributing over 15% of the UN’s regular budget (second only to the US), China remains under-represented among the organisation's staff.

This initiative comes amid escalating US-China competition in the technology sphere, with Washington imposing export controls on advanced semiconductor chips with the aim of maintaining its technological edge. We previously reported that China is making the switch from Nvidia due to these restrictions, while the US is growing the number of data centres on its shores. Given that a key aim of the US's AI Action Plan is to ""Counter Chinese Influence in International Governance Bodies"", the extent of China's role in any prospective international AI governing body remains to be seen.

Despite these restrictions, Chinese AI groups like DeepSeek and Alibaba have continued to advance rapidly, raising concerns in the US about losing global dominance.",,N,,2025-08-16 12:57:40.847716

City leaders spoke out Friday afternoon following recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the community.

Officials said ICE agents entered the parking lot of the Norwalk Police Department on Thursday but were immediately asked to leave by local police. Mayor Harry Rilling said agents returned again Friday morning.

At a press conference, Rilling, joined by other city officials, criticized ICE’s tactics, including the use of face masks, plain clothes and unmarked vehicles, which he said made agents difficult to identify.

Rilling emphasized that Norwalk police were not involved in any ICE operations in the city over the past several days.

He said the city is working with the state attorney general, police and members of the Common Council to determine how best to protect residents moving forward.

“There’s no one person that is going to be able to assist us in interfering with the immigration and customs enforcement activities,” Rilling said. “The only thing we can do is protect the people who are in our community, make sure they’re not abused, and make sure that their constitutional rights are not violated.""

Immigration attorney Alex Meyerovich said the recent uptick in enforcement activity is unprecedented and may signal government overreach.

“This is getting ridiculous,” Meyerovich said. “Not because they’re trying to create some sort of order in the immigration world, it’s just because there are no stop signs, there are no brakes. When there are no brakes, it can go as far as the administration wants.”",https://images-cf.news12static.com/3kqcuzntcg31/6utrcFkKaOO98JwhR5nMMa/9c6ef05f1b3e3f778e451bfe4e70eb26/b244622f-4775-4ddd-afaa-03ed26c5984b.jpg?fit=thumb&w=600&h=340&q=80&fm=webp,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:53.190031

The Society of Professional Journalists has renewed its calls for an immediate end to the continued detention of journalist Mario Guevara.

A coalition of local and national press freedom organizations and civil liberties groups, including SPJ, sent a letter Thursday to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recognizing the “grim milestone” in Guevara’s case: He has been detained for two months.

“The case of Mario Guevara, an Emmy-winning reporter with thousands of subscribers, represents an erosion of democratic norms in the United States and a curtailment in journalists’ ability to do their jobs, as guaranteed by the First Amendment, without fear of prolonged detention,” says the letter from the coalition, which was led by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Free Press.

Guevara, a Spanish-language digital reporter, was arrested June 14 while livestreaming a protest in a suburb of Atlanta. Although all misdemeanor charges have been dropped and a federal immigration judge granted him bond on July 1, Guevara remains in custody at Georgia’s Folkston Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center. He has been transferred through five different detention facilities despite having legal work authorization in the United States.

“The continued detention of Mario Guevara is deeply troubling and sends a chilling message to journalists, especially those from immigrant and minority communities,” said SPJ President Emily Bloch.

SPJ previously joined CPJ in a June 20 letter to DHS, which has gone unanswered, as well as a July 22 initiative urging ICE to release Guevara, who remains in detention despite the dropped charges and a judicial order for his release.

“Despite all charges being dropped and a judge ordering his release, he remains behind bars. This is not just a violation of his rights, it’s a threat to press freedom. SPJ calls on DHS and ICE to immediately comply with the court’s order and release him,” said SPJ Executive Director Caroline Hendrie.

Even so, only a slim majority of Republican/conservative immigrants support banning birthright citizenship (52%), and an even smaller share back the administration’s approach to curbing inflation (59%).","Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown amid mass deportation raids, immigration protests, and a slew of judicial rulings on the birthright citizenship ban, have thrust immigrant communities squarely into the public eye. In this article, I analyze how foreign-born or first-generation immigrants (both with and without U.S. citizenship) view the administration’s policies during its initial months, how those views have evolved since the past election, and what this could portend, electorally, for future election cycles among immigrant communities.

Public approval among foreign-born immigrant voters varies across issue areas but overall is declining

November 2024 saw many naturalized citizen immigrant voters1, a traditionally Democratic-leaning bloc, rally around Trump’s campaign pledge to tame spiraling inflation and immigration. However, several months into his second term, overall approval of the president’s policy agenda has dipped, whereas some specific policies, such as immigration, remain relatively less affected.

During the prior election, according to Pew Research’s post-election findings, which confirm prior analysis conducted by Brookings, Democrats’ share of the total foreign-born vote steadily decreased during that period, even more so than the overall U.S. electorate, and was consistent across racial and ethnic lines. Between 2020 and 2024, the Democratic share shrunk from roughly 59% to 51%, whereas the Republican share increased from around 38% to 47%, a nearly 17+ point swing in favor of the Grand Old Party and a near even split between the two parties in 2024.

Trump flipped many of the key battleground states (including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and Pennsylvania) in 2024 where immigrant voters represent a sizable portion of the total U.S. electorate: 14% of all eligible voters in Nevada, 9% in Arizona, 7% in Georgia, and 5% in Pennsylvania are foreign-born. Additionally, based on pre- and post-election data from the American National Election Studies, roughly 43% of immigrants who voted in the 2024 election believed the Republican Party would do a better job of handling immigration: a positive nine-point spread over Democrats and a staggering reversal from the 2020 election where Democrats had a 25+ point edge over Republicans.

And several months into the Trump presidency, these policy issues continue to be important to voters today. According to a national survey2 of immigrant voters (fielded from April 22 to April 27, 2025), the top three issue area priorities ranked by them is still consistent with what drove them to the polls: inflation/prices (27.4%), jobs/economy (13%), immigration (9.2%), and health care (7.9%), respectively.

Still, similar to the general public, immigrant assessments of the president’s overall performance have slipped into negative territory across several key areas: 47.8% disapprove of the president’s overall performance while 45.1% approve; 50.4% believe the country is on the wrong track versus 42.1% who believe it is on the right track. Further, regarding inflation/prices and the economy, there is roughly a negative 10-point spread between those who disapprove and those who approve, respectively, for each area.

Nevertheless, the president’s immigration agenda garners the most support with a slight majority of immigrants in support of it (50.5% to 41.1%). This was also true of the broader public until more recently in August—where there is now a roughly negative 5.9point margin of disapproval across most major polls. What’s more, according to a recent Gallup poll completed in June, almost 80% of Americans now view immigration positively—the highest share on record—and only 30% of Americans want immigration reduced, a sharp decline from a year earlier in 2024 when the share was 55% of Americans. While this decline was spread across all parties, the shift was most prominent among Republicans: 88% of Republicans wanted immigration reduced in 2024 compared to 48% of Republicans today—a sizeable 40-point turnaround.

Additionally, across most of the key issue area priorities, there appears to be growing signs of a narrowing margin between foreign-born swing voters or switchers—the coalition who switched from voting for Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024—who approve and disapprove of the administration’s policies. Although, according to post-election data from Pew Research, swing voters were not the primary contributors to Trump’s gains among immigrants compared to the new, low propensity voters that were (roughly 22% of foreign–born 2024 voters were new voters with Trump netting roughly 57% of them), it is likely that both groups were motivated by similar cost of living and immigration-related concerns. Further, according to national-level perceptions after the first 100 days, only 46.8% of Biden-Trump foreign-born switchers say the country is better off, while 35.5% say it is worse off—a gap of just over 10 points

This pattern appears, generally, to be most pronounced along economic affordability, exhibiting only narrow to moderate majority levels of approval. A slim majority of overall Biden-Trump switchers believe their economic situation has improved after 100 days (33.4% to 32.1%); 35.9% are more confident in the president’s ability to handle inflation and prices, compared with 34.6% who are less confident; on jobs and the economy, 39% express greater confidence, versus 24.2% who express less. Conversely, immigration policy stands as an outlier—roughly 61% of Biden-Trump immigrant switchers, overall, are more confident in the president’s immigration policy after 100 days compared to about 17% who are less confident, a whopping 43.7+ point margin.

Remarkably, in stark contrast to public support for economic concerns, which have sunk since the election, public support for immigration appears to have instead relatively endured since last fall. The fact that the U.S. experienced the highest influx of immigration on record between 2021 and 2023, during the Biden administration, with a majority of those immigrants lacking legal status, may partly explain why.

Even so, there are important caveats to consider. First, while a majority of immigrant voters are in support of the president’s immigration policy, it is a fairly slim majority, and these sentiments, taken from the most recent publicly available data, were captured before subsequent developments such as immigration protests, intense deportation raids, travel bans, and other occurrences. The American public has since formed a more negative attitude about the administration’s handling of immigration, suggesting there is still room for immigrant public attitudes to follow suit as well.

Second, when the nuances of immigration policy are unpacked to show which specific parts elicit the most appeal, it’s evident that it’s context-specific, and there is seemingly a disconnect between policy goals and implementation. The administration’s overall goals appear popular, but support drops sharply for its specific tactics and implementation—especially on deportations—even among Trump supporters. When distinguishing between the two main immigration issues—border security and deportations—border security appears to garner more support, while deportation policies and their ties to the legal system receive far less.

While a very slight majority approve of deporting all undocumented immigrants, a one-point difference, the data suggests that this is narrower in scope and pertains only to more recent arrivals or those convicted of violent crimes. A plurality of both immigrant switchers and immigrant voters overall—roughly 60% to 75% in each group—largely disapprove of deporting undocumented immigrants who are employed, have strong family ties (such as being married to a U.S. citizen or parenting a U.S.-born child), or have lived in the country for a decade or more, with family separation drawing the strongest disapproval.Some of the margins are even wider in key swing states that flipped from blue to red, as in Nevada and Georgia. Similarly, a clear majority of immigrant voters oppose deporting non-U.S. citizens with legal status, such as student or work visa holders, as well as international students participating in protests.

What’s more, regarding other aspects of immigration policy such as enforcement in certain areas and perceived lack of adherence to court orders, immigrant public opinion largely disfavors the administration’s approach. A majority do not approve of deporting immigrants without proper due process or a judge’s order, deporting undocumented migrants to other countries—such as to the El Salvador prison, publicized by the high profile case of the mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia—or conducting enforcement activities in sensitive locations. Further, the bulk of both Biden-Trump immigrant switchers and overall immigrant voters, respectively, believe the administration should obey court orders regarding deportations and believe mistakes/errors are being made in who is being deported.

The continued flurry of immigration policy directives have helped to fuel this public backlash and have also led to widespread economic and social upheaval for many immigrant families. Mass immigration raids have rippled across shopping centers, farms, hotels, and workplaces—not only gripping many immigrants in a web of fear, chaos, and deep social unrest, but also shattering longstanding economic and socially vibrant communities.

International students with minor infractions or without any prior criminal record have faced abrupt visa cancellations and deportations, leaving their educational hopes and aspirations stranded overseas. What’s more, not only have policies to strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship due to certain crimes been enacted but U.S. citizens and other legal residents have found themselves swept up in deportation and detention efforts. Additionally, since Trump took office, only a minority (roughly 40%) of illegal immigrants being detained by ICE have been found to have a criminal record and only about 8% have a violent criminal conviction.

The combination of these developments may be fueling views that there is a growing gap between the administration’s intended policy objectives and actual implementation. Most of the shift in immigrant voter support was driven by Trump’s policy campaign mandate: mostly to ease economic burdens and immigration levels—largely centered on border security and deporting illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes.

However, on both accounts, immigrant public sentiment reveals that they believe this is not being adequately tackled, at least in the initial months, and that the broader scope of deportations of both undocumented and legal immigrants appears to be a departure from what he campaigned on. Still, even amidst the dampening of public support for immigration, the administration has sought to intensify its policy arsenal—injecting an additional $170 billion into immigration enforcement and $75 billion into ICE alone—making it the most funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. federal government.

Public approval among all immigrants is negative overall but varies across racial and party lines

Among all immigrants—not just those who voted—disapproval of the administration’s policies is higher across naturalized U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status (permanent residents or work/student visa holders), and undocumented immigrants, with notable differences by race and ideology.

According to a recent national survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, fielded from March 6 to April 13, 2025, the sentiment of immigrant voters is largely reflective of the broader immigrant community. However, among non-U.S. citizens, there are much higher levels of dissatisfaction, particularly on immigration-related issues. Overall, with respect to immigration, concerns for either themselves or a family member being detained/deported have almost doubled from 2023 to 2025 for nearly all immigrant groups. Roughly four in 10 immigrants overall, and six in 10 immigrants with legal status, express concern about detentions or deportations.

Among Latinos, these concerns have risen from 41% to 59%; and for Asians, from 14% to 19%. Fellow Brookings scholar Gabriel R. Sanchez and a team of researchers also arrive at similar conclusions in their recently released survey on Latino immigrant sentiment toward deportation policy. What’s more, AAPI data show that Asian Americans—who are the only racial group with a foreign-born majority at 65%—tend to oppose the administration’s deportation policies. Only 43% support deporting all undocumented immigrants, while roughly 80% support deporting those charged with violent crimes.

While Asians and Latinos represent the bulk of the immigrant pool (roughly two-thirds), there is limited statistically representative data of the early public views of other racial groups (i.e. Blacks, whites etc.). Further, on immigration policy, 54% of naturalized citizens express disapproval—but when all immigrant groups are considered, regardless of legal status, that share rises to 63%. This is largely driven by non-U.S. citizen immigrants3 who exhibit higher dissatisfaction numbers around immigration-related issues.

Nonetheless, as with the broader foreign-born electorate, breaking down specific immigration policies shows deportations are widely unpopular, while a slim majority of all immigrants support the administration’s border enforcement efforts (54%) and the deployment of additional troops to the border (53%).

Conversely, only 21% of all immigrants supported the proposed birthright citizenship ban, which would limit automatic citizenship to children with at least one U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. While the Supreme Court has not ruled directly on its constitutionality, it has restricted judges from issuing universal or nationwide injunctions against Trump’s executive orders. As a result, until the Court resolved the policy’s legality, some second-generation Americans could have faced a patchwork system in which their citizenship was recognized in some states but not in others.

However, beyond universal injunctions, the Supreme Court’s ruling left room for narrower injunctions or other legal avenues—such as class-action lawsuits—to challenge the birthright citizenship ban. Several recent lower court decisions have done so, finding the ban unconstitutional and either granting nationwide protection for U.S.-born children through class actions or upholding prior universal injunctions, arguing these do not constitute judicial overreach. Anticipating the issue’s return to the Supreme Court, the administration has released an implementation plan directing agencies like Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to require additional parental documentation to verify a child’s eligibility for U.S. citizenship. Until the Court rules, the ultimate impact on immigrant communities remains uncertain.

Still, while immigrant public opinion is less supportive of the president’s policies overall, it is sharply divided along party lines. About 64% of all immigrants disapprove of his performance, yet 75% of Republican immigrants approve compared with just 13% of Democratic immigrants. Likewise, 81% of Republican immigrants back his immigration policy, versus 19% of Democratic immigrants. Even so, only a slim majority of Republican/conservative immigrants support banning birthright citizenship (52%), and an even smaller share back the administration’s approach to curbing inflation (59%).

The policy path forward for immigrants

In sum, support for the administration’s policy agenda has waned—not only among the loose coalition of immigrant voters who helped secure victories in key battleground states, but also across the broader immigrant population. Public sentiment indicates that expectations for easing everyday economic hardship remain unmet, and that while border security enjoys broad backing, the administration’s broader deportation efforts and judicial tactics have been uneven and diverge from its original campaign mandate. While these findings draw from some of the most recent publicly available data on immigrant views, they were captured before the administration’s latest policy actions, and forthcoming data could paint a strikingly different picture going forward.

Overall, the socio-political views of foreign-born immigrants largely align with those of the broader American public, and—as in the last presidential election, when immigration and inflation were dominant issues—their electoral influence could again prove pivotal in future races. This underscores the need for elected officials and policymakers to advance policies that address the pressing socioeconomic needs and lived realities of a broad and diverse immigrant population.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-01-29T141931Z_1507208541_MT1CVMD54472355_RTRMADP_3_COVER-IMAGES-1.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:43.591127

Lawyers representing the children argued that they could not trust the Trump administration to uphold standards that it had previously violated.","A federal judge rejected on Friday the Trump administration’s second attempt to end a decades-old legal agreement that mandates basic standards of care and oversight for children in U.S. immigration custody.

Judge Dolly M. Gee of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California ruled that the Flores Settlement Agreement, in effect since 1997, must remain in place. Court-appointed monitors and lawyers will continue to have access to migrant children in border stations and family detention centers to ensure that the government is complying with the agreement.

The first Trump administration tried and failed in 2019 to dissolve the settlement agreement. And in a 20-page ruling, Judge Gee criticized the government for trying again, even though, she wrote, “they point to no meaningful change either in factual conditions or in law since their last motion to terminate.”

Under the 1997 consent decree, migrants who are 17 years old and younger must be held in the “least restrictive” setting while efforts are made to expeditiously release them. The minors must receive adequate meals, clean water, clothing, education and medical assistance, among other basic needs.

The judge said that neither the Homeland Security Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services, which are responsible for migrant children, were in “sufficiently substantial compliance to warrant termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement.”

The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling again, setting the stage for the case to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Leecia Welch, a lawyer with Children’s Rights who has for years interviewed children and parents in detention facilities, said that Friday’s ruling “comes as great relief.”

“Flores is the last line of defense against this administration’s plans to round up and detain children indefinitely in conditions no child deserves,” she said.

The government blames the Flores settlement for incentivizing parents to bring children so that they can be released quickly into the country.

In its motion, the administration said Flores had fueled unlawful border crossings by families and had hampered the government’s ability to effectively detain and deport families.

In her decision, the judge indicated that she was not persuaded by any of the administration’s arguments.

“Incredulously,” she wrote, government lawyers tried to argue that the “expeditious release” from detention under Flores was intended to apply only to children who enter alone and not to those who enter the country with their families.

“This is plainly incorrect,” she wrote.

In a motion filed in May, the Trump administration said that the Flores agreement was no longer necessary because Congress had enacted legislation and government agencies had established standards to guarantee proper care.

“The legal basis for the agreement has withered away,” the administration said, describing Flores as an “intrusive regime” that had “ossified federal immigration policy.”

“The Flores Settlement Agreement itself has changed the immigration landscape by removing some of the disincentives for families to enter the U.S. unlawfully,” the motion said.

Minors who cross the border are first held at Customs and Border Protection stations for processing. Those who arrive unaccompanied are then transferred to government-run shelters, where they remain until a relative in the United States can claim them. Children who arrive in the United States with family members are either released into the country with their parents or placed in family detention facilities while their immigration cases proceed through the courts.

Terminating the agreement would have eliminated independent oversight and left the government to monitor itself.

Lawyers representing the children argued that they could not trust the Trump administration to uphold standards that it had previously violated.

“Defendants demand release from the settlement not because they have complied with and will continue to observe its fundamental principles, but because they want the flexibility to treat children however they wish,” they wrote in court filings.

Preserving the agreement is “even more vital under this administration,” Carlos Holguin, lead counsel, who filed the lawsuit in 1985, said during a hearing last week.

Judge Gee appeared to agree. She said it was contradictory that detention conditions were deteriorating, even as the number of border crossings had plunged — “unless it’s willful,” she told government lawyers.

Reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions in border stations have mounted since President Trump took office, according to court filings that have included firsthand accounts from children who described being confined for days in frigid, windowless rooms without access to showers, private toilets or the outdoors. Migrants are taken to the facilities for processing immediately after they are apprehended, and successive administrations have kept them there for no more than 72 hours, the judge said.

After recent visits to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, lawyers reported inadequate medical care, stifling heat and limited access to recreation, as well as prolonged detentions, with no end in sight, that are taking a toll on mental health.

Signed during the Clinton administration, the Flores agreement resolved a lawsuit that had stretched over more than a decade, which was filed on behalf of unaccompanied minors held in poor conditions without access to medical care.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/HFO-NAT-IMMIG-FLORES-tzlv/HFO-NAT-IMMIG-FLORES-tzlv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 00:56:48.879971

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police.

The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

An attorney with the Department of Homeland Security moves to dismiss asylum-seekers’ cases during hearings, rendering the asylum-seekers without the protection from deportation they had when their cases were active. Next, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers swoop in, “re-encounter” the asylum-seekers as if they are back at the border, and fastrack them out of the country.

In San Francisco, judges rarely grant those moves to dismiss. But ICE officers nearly always arrest immigrants whose cases DHS has moved to dismiss anyway.

On Friday, ICE officers in San Francisco went a step further: arresting an indigenous speaker whose case the DHS attorney did not even move to dismiss. In fact, the Trump administration attorney agreed to hear her case in two months’ time, but that did not matter to ICE.

A woman from Guatemala, who appeared to be middle-aged, attended her hearing in Judge Joseph Park’s courtroom, at 630 Sansome St.

The woman spoke only Mam, a Mayan language. Park, who appeared via video, tried to speak to the woman through the court’s Spanish interpreter.

Do you speak Spanish? the interpreter asked.

“Very little,” she responded, in Spanish.

Park tried to find a Mam interpreter who could dial in over the phone. The task proved tricky. Park eventually gave up, and asked the woman to come back in October, when he had already scheduled several other hearings with Mam-speakers and would have an interpreter available.

By that point in the morning, the attorney representing DHS had already moved to dismiss three other cases.

Two of the three asylum-seekers had been arrested in the hallway the moment they left the courtroom.

The third, a woman from Colombia, clearly petrified, was still inside the courtroom. She would stay there for another hour, completely inconsolable, saying she was worried about her children.

Unlike the first three cases, the DHS attorney did not move to dismiss the Mam woman’s case. Instead, the attorney agreed to pick the case back up in October, when there would be an interpreter.

A lawyer with the Attorney of the Day program, which provides free legal advice to immigrants at their asylum hearings, seemed concerned anyway.

She pulled the woman aside, and tried to explain to her in Spanish that she could be arrested. The attorney resorted to communicating with the woman by phoning in a family member who could interpret from Mam to Spanish.

When the Guatemalan woman finally did leave the courtroom, ICE officers were waiting. They called her name.

The attorney of the day tried to protest: She told the ICE officers that the DHS attorney had not moved to dismiss the case.

It did not seem to matter. Two male ICE officers immediately whisked the woman out of the hallway and through an unmarked door.

Asylum-seekers who are held in immigration court are typically taken to be processed at an ICE field office on the sixth floor of 630 Sansome St. A lucky few have been released from there with habeas corpus petitions. Most are sent from there to longer-term detention facilities elsewhere in California, or the country.

Back inside the courtroom, Park wrapped up his 8:30 a.m. hearings, then called for a 45-minute break. He switched off his camera. The DHS attorney stayed in her seat at the front of the courtroom, working on her computer. She did not look back once at the rest of the courtroom.

The final of the four asylum-seekers who would be arrested that day — the woman from Colombia — was still inside the court and still crying. The DHS attorney had moved to dismiss her case almost an hour earlier.

At around 10:30 a.m., with a volunteer court observer and the attorney of the day, the woman managed to collect herself, and stood up to walk outside. When the door swung open, and she saw the ICE officers waiting for her, she panicked. She started to cry again, and turned around and immediately sat down in the courtroom.

It took another 30 minutes or so for her to calm down enough to stand up and leave the courtroom again.

As the democracy reporter for WITF, I will cover any kind of story that has to do with how we govern ourselves. That will include doing a lot of election coverage about how to access the ballot, how public officials administer elections, the technology used to run and secure elections, and the laws that govern it all.

My work will also include accountability coverage for elected officials that use their positions to then undermine democratic institutions, like the legislators that voted against the certification of the presidential election results on January 6, 2021. If that weren’t enough, I foresee covering some local government decisions, fights over public records and transparency, and some candidate coverage around the major elections. As seen in my coverage of immigrant of LGBTQ+ communities, I also report on the consequences of elections for minority groups.

Update: This story was updated Aug. 15 between 6 to 7 p.m. to include a statement from an advocacy organization and to clarify the nature of a traffic incident.

Ester Soliman was deported to the Philippines on Friday after living in Lancaster for 25 years, her family said.

Her family said they received a call from their mother from the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, just before Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials were putting her on a plane.

“We are heartbroken and reeling, and we want her home more than we can communicate,” the family said in an update on its fundraising page to pay for an immigration attorney. “Please keep our entire family in your prayers as we determine our next steps.”

ICE arrested Soliman on Aug. 4 when she reported to a meeting under the Alternatives to Detention program at the agency’s York office.

Soliman’s family never received notification from ICE that their mother was being deported, according to Damon Myers, a friend who has been acting as their spokesperson. Instead, the husband of a fellow detainee at the Clinton County Correctional Facility called Ester Soliman’s son, Sam, to say his mother had been moved. Sam and Soliman’s other two adult children, Sandra and Sanjee, remain in Lancaster.

As of 1 p.m. Friday, Soliman was still shown in ICE’s online detainee locator, but the correctional facility had been removed. Once people are deported, they are removed from the system entirely. Efforts to reach Soliman’s attorney on Friday were not immediately successful.

When ICE returned Soliman’s phone in the airport, she called her children, according to Myers. In another statement to the fundraising page, the family called the situation “a nightmare.”

ICE was not immediately available for a comment or to confirm the deportation but had previously released a statement on Soliman’s case.

“She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000,” Tricia McLaughlin, the head of the Department of Homeland Security’s public communications, said Monday. “Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.”

According to state court records, Soliman has two traffic tickets on record and no other incidents. A Manheim Township police officer issued Soliman citations on July 28, 2025, for improper safety restraints for a child under four years and for driving without a license. She was allowed to leave the scene after the citations when someone came to pick her up, according to Manheim Township Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Barry Waltz, Jr.

Soliman came to the U.S. with her husband, Albert S. Soliman, who died in 2015, according to a death notice published in LNP. Soliman never went back to the Philippines, according to Myers. Soliman still has family there, who have been notified and who plan to be at the airport when she lands. Her full name, as used by ICE, is Estrelita Soliman-Ramos.

Earlier Friday, the family posted an update to the fundraising page that the government denied a legal motion, called a “stay of removal,” meant to postpone deportation.

In that post, they called for help from the public to amplify Soliman’s case by calling elected officials in the hopes of keeping her in-country.

The advocacy and affinity group Lancaster Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders released a statement Friday evening calling Soliman “a cherished mother and friend” and said her deportation was a worst-case scenario.

“We are overwhelmed with grief and fury that our beloved Ester is not with her family in Lancaster, a place she has called home for 25 years,” Cindy Lam, president of Lancaster AAPI, said. “We are holding the entire Soliman family in our hearts right now as we process and mourn this new tragic reality.”

Over the last week, the family raised $88,431 through a crowdsourced fundraising tool called GoFundMe, an outpouring of support that surpassed their original goal of $35,000.

Several notable public figures and community leaders gave money, including Rep. Izzy Smith-Wade-El, a Democrat whose 49th District includes half of Lancaster city.

FAA Preemption The Supreme Court of California read the statute in a way that saves it from FAA preemption.","Quick Hits

The Supreme Court of California ruled that the FAA does not preempt a state law requiring prompt payment of arbitration fees, interpreting the requirement in the context of other statutes and legal principles that may excuse an untimely payment.

The court clarified that employers may not automatically forfeit their right to arbitration for late fee payments if those delays are not willful or grossly negligent.

The ruling emphasizes that parties can negotiate their own payment timelines in arbitration agreements.

In Hohenshelt v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (Golden State Foods Corp., Real Party in Interest), the California high court addressed a state court split over whether the FAA preempts Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.98, which imposes a thirty-day deadline to pay arbitration fees. California courts have interpreted the statute as deeming a failure to pay in a timely manner to be a material breach of the arbitration agreement, regardless of the circumstances, and automatically deny companies their rights to arbitration.

Some courts have held that such an inflexible rule hinders arbitration and conflicts with the FAA, which requires states to place arbitration agreements on equal footing as other contracts. According to those courts, because other contracts are not forced to comply with this stringent rule, the FAA preempts this law. Other courts have held that the statute is not preempted because it promotes the goals of the FAA by ensuring the timely payment of invoices and keeping arbitration proceedings moving without unnecessary delay.

In Hohenshelt, the California supreme court rejected a “rigid construction” of the statute The court held that the statute is not preempted by the FAA, but also concluded that the law does not stop a court from excusing the untimely payment based on established contract principles unless the “nonperformance is willful, grossly negligent, or fraudulent.” Importantly, the court also held that the parties to the arbitration agreement can set by agreement the due date for arbitration fees payments.

Background

Section 1281.98 was added as part of the 2019 amendments to the California Arbitration Act in Senate Bill (SB) 707. The statute provides that when an employment or consumer arbitration requires the drafting party to pay arbitration fees and costs, “if the fees or costs are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or consumer to proceed with that arbitration.” The statute then allows the employee or consumer to “unilaterally … [w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed” to court. The employee or consumer is entitled to mandatory sanctions and attorneys’ fees accrued in arbitration upon return to court.

In Hohenshelt, an employee of Golden State Foods Corp. sought to withdraw his claims from arbitration after the employer paid arbitration fees more than thirty days after the arbitrator invoiced them, but before a final payment deadline set by the arbitrator.

The California Second District Court of Appeal ruled that the clear language of Section 1281.98 requires that payments are “due upon receipt,” any extension of time for fee payment must be agreed upon by all parties, and that the statute does not let an arbitrator cure a party’s missed payment. The appellate court sent the claims back to the trial court even though the arbitration proceedings had been ongoing for a year and the employer had spent more than $50,000 in arbitration fees and costs.

FAA Preemption

The Supreme Court of California read the statute in a way that saves it from FAA preemption. The court said Section 1281.98 must be considered in the context of the “backdrop of longstanding statutes that authorize courts to prevent unjust forfeitures of contractual rights” and legislative history suggesting the law was meant to stop parties from “strategically withholding” the payment of arbitration fees and costs as a tactic to delay and frustrate the arbitration proceedings. (Emphasis in the original.)

The court interpreted Section 1281.98 as not mandating that fees “invariably be paid within 30 days of the arbitrator’s invoice regardless of the parties’ preferences.” Instead, the statute imposes a “default rule” for when fees are due, and “parties are free to contract for any due date they want by adopting their own ‘provision in the arbitration agreement stating the number of days in which the parties to the arbitration must pay any required fees or costs.’”

In this context, the supreme court found that the statute does not treat arbitration agreements differently from other contracts and does not undermine the goals of the FAA. The supreme court admitted that if the statute were read only by the plain text, without incorporating other elements of California law, “any failure to make timely payment, regardless of the circumstances, invariably results in forfeiture of arbitral rights, the statute would be anomalous in the context of general contract law principles.” This would result in FAA preemption. However, the court explained that “a drafting party can avoid forfeiture of its right to arbitration by showing that the delay was excusable” under other laws and background legal principles that generally apply to contracts.

Key Takeaways

The Supreme Court of California’s decision in Hohenshelt found that the FAA does not preempt Section 1281.98, by allowing courts to keep claims in arbitration even if arbitration fees are not paid in accordance with the statute. The ruling states that mere technical violations or oversights could excuse employers’ late payment so long as there is no evidence that the late payment was deliberate or due to gross negligence.

Additionally, the court said parties may agree to other terms as the statute only provides a “default rule.” That means employers concerned with the time limits in Section 1281.98 may include a provision in arbitration agreements setting when invoices are due. Employers may want to consider adding such a provision or revising and updating existing arbitration agreements with such a provision to avoid the deadline in Section 1281.98.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/California%20State%20Flag%20CA%20Litigation%20Gavel%20Court-467322005.jpg.webp?itok=7UnBuKDV,N,,2025-08-16 11:59:15.130214

Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.
An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities.
The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.
As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting ""Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!""","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president's administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,"" Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting ""Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!""

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has told members of the California congressional delegation that she is thinking about running for the new seat.","A decade and a half after California voters stripped lawmakers of the ability to draw the boundaries of congressional districts, Gov. Gavin Newsom and fellow Democrats are pushing to take that partisan power back.

The redistricting plan taking shape in Sacramento and headed toward voters in November could shift the Golden State’s political landscape for at least six years, if not longer, and sway which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections — which will be pivotal to the fate of President Trump’s political agenda.

What Golden State voters choose to do will reverberate nationwide, killing some political careers and launching others, provoking other states to reconfigure their own congressional districts and boosting Newsom’s profile as a top Trump nemesis and leader of the nation’s Democratic resistance.

The new maps, drawn by Democratic strategists and lawmakers behind closed doors, were submitted to legislative leaders by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Friday. They are expected to appear on a Nov. 4 special election ballot, along with a constitutional amendment that would override the state’s voter-approved, independent redistricting commission.

The changes would ripple across hundreds of miles of California, from the forests near the Oregon state line through the deserts of Death Valley and Palm Springs to the U.S.-Mexico border, expanding Democrats’ grip on California and further isolating Republicans.

The proposed map would concentrate Republican voters in a handful of deep-red districts and eliminate an Inland Empire congressional seat represented by the longest-serving member of California’s GOP delegation. For Democrats, the plans would boost the fortunes of up-and-coming politicians and shore up vulnerable incumbents in Congress, including two new lawmakers who won election by fewer than 1,000 votes last fall.

“This is the final declaration of political war between California and the Trump administration,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego.

How will the ballot measure work?

For the state to reverse the independent redistricting process that the electorate approved in 2010, a majority of California voters would have to approve the measure, which backers are calling the “Election Rigging Response Act.”

The state Legislature, where Democrats hold a supermajority in both the Assembly and Senate, will consider the ballot language next week when lawmakers return from summer recess. Both chambers would need to pass the ballot language by a two-thirds majority and get the bill to Newsom’s desk by Aug. 22, leaving just enough time for voter guides to be mailed and ballots to be printed.

The ballot language has not been released. But the decision about approving the new map would ultimately be up to the state’s electorate, which backed independent redistricting in 2010 by more than 61%. Registered Democrats outnumber Republican voters by almost a two-to-one margin in California, providing a decided advantage for supporters of the measure.

Newsom has said that the measure would include a “trigger,” meaning the state’s maps would only take effect if a Republican state — including Texas, Florida and Indiana — approve new mid-decade maps.

“There’s still an exit ramp,” Newsom said. “We’re hopeful they don’t move forward.”

Explaining the esoteric concept of redistricting and getting voters to participate in an off-year election will require that Newsom and his allies, including organized labor, launch what is expected to be an expensive campaign very quickly.

“It’s summer in California,” Kousser said. “People are not focused on this.”

California has no limit on campaign contributions for ballot measures, and a measure that pits Democrats against Trump, and Republicans against Newsom, could become a high-stakes, high-cost national brawl.

“It’s tens of millions of dollars, and it’s going to be determined on the basis of what an opposition looks like as well,” Newsom said Thursday. The fundraising effort, he said, is “not insignificant... considering the 90-day sprint.”

The ballot measure’s campaign website mentions three major funding sources thus far: Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign, the main political action committee for House Democrats in Washington, and Manhattan Beach businessman Bill Bloomfield, a longtime donor to California Democrats.

Those who oppose the mid-decade redistricting are also expected to be well-funded, and will argue that this effort betrays the will of the voters who approved independent congressional redistricting in 2010.

What’s at stake?

Control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance.

The party that holds the White House tends to lose House seats during the midterm election. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House, and Democrats taking control of chamber in 2026 would stymie Trump’s controversial, right-wing agenda in his final two years in office.

Redistricting typically only happens once a decade, after the U.S. census. But Trump has been prodding Republican states, starting with Texas, to redraw their lines in the middle of the decade to boost the GOP’s chances in the midterms.

At Trump’s encouragement, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special legislative session to redraw the Texas congressional map to favor five more Republicans. In response, Newsom and other California Democrats have called for their own maps that would favor five more Democrats.

Texas Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny the Legislature a quorum and stop the vote. They faced daily fines, death threats and calls to be removed from office. They agreed to return to Austin after the special session ended on Friday, with one condition being that California Democrats moved forward with their redistricting plan.

The situation has the potential to spiral into an all-out redistricting arms race, with Trump leaning on Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Missouri to redraw their maps, while Newsom is asking the same of blue states including New York and Illinois.

California Republicans in the crosshairs

The California gerrymandering plan targets five of California’s nine Republican members of Congress: Reps. Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa in Northern California, Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley, and Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa in Southern California.

The map consolidates Republican voters into a smaller number of ruby-red districts known as “vote sinks.” Some conservative and rural areas would be shifted into districts where Republican voters would be diluted by high voter registration advantage for Democrats.

The biggest change would be for Calvert, who would see his Inland Empire district eliminated.

Calvert has been in Congress since 1992 and represents a sprawling Riverside County district that includes Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Palm Springs and his home base of Corona. Calvert, who oversees defense spending on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, comfortably won reelection last year despite a well-funded national campaign by Democrats.

Under the proposed map, the Inland Empire district would be carved up and redistributed, parceled out to a district represented by Rep. Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills). Liberal Palm Springs would be shifted into the district represented by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Bonsall), which would help tilt the district from Republican to a narrowly divided swing seat.

Members of Congress are not required to live in their districts, but there would not be an obvious seat for Calvert to run for, unless he ran against Kim or Issa.

Leaked screenshots of the map began to circulate Friday afternoon, prompting fierce and immediate pushback from California Republicans.

The lines are “third-world dictator stuff,” Orange County GOP chair Will O’Neill said on X, and the “slicing and dicing of Orange County cities is obscene.”

In Northern California, the boundaries of Kiley’s district would shrink and dogleg into the Sacramento suburbs to add registered Democrats. Kiley said in a post on the social media site X that he expected his district to stay the same because voters would “defeat Newsom’s sham initiative and vindicate the will of California voters.”

LaMalfa’s district would shift south, away from the rural and conservative areas along the Oregon border, and pick up more liberal areas in parts of Sonoma County,

In Central California, boundaries would shift to shore up Reps. Josh Harder (D-Tracy) and Adam Gray (D-Merced). Gray won election last year by 187 votes, the narrowest margin in the country.

Valadao, a perennial target for Democrats, would see the northern boundary of his district stretch into the bluer suburbs of Fresno. Democrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster.

Democrats eye open seats

The maps include a new congressional seat in Los Angeles County that would stretch through the southeast cities of Downey, Santa Fe Springs, Whittier and Lakewood. An open seat in Congress is a rare opportunity for politicians, especially in deep-blue Los Angeles County, where incumbent lawmakers can keep their jobs for decades.

Portions of that district were once represented by retired U.S. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, the first Mexican American woman elected to Congress. That seat was eliminated in the 2021 redistricting cycle, when California lost a congressional seat for the first time in its history.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has told members of the California congressional delegation that she is thinking about running for the new seat.

Another possible contender, former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon of Lakewood, launched a campaign for state superintendent of schools in late July and may be out of the mix.

Other lawmakers who represent the area or areas nearby include state Sens. Blanca Rubio (D-Baldwin Park) and Bob Archuleta (D-Pico Rivera) and Assemblywoman Lisa Calderon (D-Whittier).

In Northern California, the southern tip of LaMalfa’s district would stretch south into the Sonoma County cities of Santa Rosa and Healdsberg, home to Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire. McGuire will be termed out of the state Senate next year, and the new seat might present a prime opportunity for him to go to Washington.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73bac84/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fe9%2F5a2d1f694926ab3532c6d847e055%2F1518278-me-newsom-redistricting-plan10-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:56:40.407533

On August 13, 2025, ICE arrested Noelia Saray Martinez-Avila—a criminal illegal alien from Honduras—who struck a vehicle while driving the wrong direction on a highway, killing 18-year-old Hallie Helgeson at the scene on July 20. Martinez-Avila also gravely injured 19-year-old Brady Heiling who died from his injuries on July 25.

The administration filed motions to join existing cases against the state over its rules seeking to reduce pollution and planet-warming emissions from trucks.

The moves come after the Trump administration axed California’s rules — but did so in a legally contested manner.

Now, the Trump administration and truckmakers are accusing the state of enforcing the now-overturned standards through its “Clean Truck Partnership” under which truck companies agreed to follow the state’s rules in exchange for some additional flexibility.

The California Air Resources Board, which is in charge of the truck rules, declined to comment.

At issue are California rules including the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which would require a large percentage of trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035.

Under the Clean Air Act, California is required to get federal approval for its auto regulations. The Biden administration approved the state’s rule.

This year, however, Congress and President Trump approved a resolution using the Congressional Review Act to overturn the approval of the California rule.

The move occurred despite determinations from the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, which said that it was not subject to the Congressional Review Act.

Now, the Trump administration is arguing in court that California has sought to enforce its rules through the Clean Truck Partnership, describing the state’s effort as a “a stunning act of defiance.”

The judge’s decision came just hours after D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued the Trump administration, alleging the attempted takeover violated the Home Rule Act of 1973, which allows D.C. residents to elect their mayor and council members.

Section 740 of the Home Rule Act allows the president to request the use of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal law enforcement purposes in emergency situations, but the act keeps control of the department with the mayor and police chief. The authority is also limited to no more than 30 days without congressional approval.

Bondi’s original directive claimed to replace MPD Chief Pamela Smith by appointing Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner,” granting him “all the powers and duties vested in the D.C. Chief of Police.”

During an evidentiary hearing Friday, Reyes appeared skeptical of the DOJ’s claim that Bondi could replace Smith and issue orders directly to the MPD. The judge said such an arrangement would effectively give Trump personal control over the police department.

“The statute would have no meaning at all if the president could just say we’re taking over your police department,” Reyes said.

Reyes also noted that the DOJ was arguing Trump could personally control the MPD even though the Home Rule Act bars the president from directly communicating with the department.

“You’re making the argument that the president can basically run the entire police department based on language that doesn’t even allow the president to talk to the police department,” she told DOJ lawyers.

Bondi’s Backtrack

By Friday evening, Bondi issued a revised directive. The new order abandons the provision giving Cole full control over the MPD and instead lists specific “services” the attorney general deems necessary under Section 740(a). The mayor must provide these services and Cole is tasked only with overseeing those limited functions.

The revised order still directs MPD to:

Assist with enforcing federal immigration law and locating undocumented immigrants.

Comply with all federal law enforcement database and information requests.

Strictly enforce D.C.’s unlawful public space occupancy law.

The changes avoid directly replacing the chief or requiring all MPD orders to go through Cole, but they maintain aggressive policy shifts on immigration enforcement and homelessness.

Legal Stakes

In his suit, Schwalb alleged Trump, through Bondi’s directive, far exceeded his authority under the Home Rule Act and violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution.

The lawsuit argues Bondi’s original directive endangered public safety by upending MPD’s command structure.

“There is no greater risk to public safety in a large, professional law enforcement organization like MPD than to not know who is in command,” the complaint reads.

During the hearing, DOJ lawyers acknowledged Trump will have no authority to continue using the MPD if Congress does not pass legislation extending his order federalizing the department — contradicting the president’s earlier claims that he could act without Congress in an emergency.

“If it’s a national emergency we can do it without Congress, but we expect to be before Congress very quickly,” Trump said earlier this week.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

In addition to attempting to federalize the MPD, Trump has sent hundreds of federal law enforcement agents and deployed the D.C. National Guard to the capital.

He claimed the National Guard deployment and surge in federal personnel were needed to address rampant homelessness and violent crime, even as MPD data show crime is declining.

Trump’s use of the National Guard within the district could be affected by an upcoming court decision over his deployment of military troops in Los Angeles earlier this year.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2229574059-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 20:56:45.706741

The detention has been condemned by the county’s top judge and the man’s lawyers, who said such operations will deter people from showing up to court.

Video obtained by the Los Angeles Times shows the man being carried away with his hands bound behind his back. Those detaining him are in plainclothes, and some are wearing masks. The detained man repeatedly screams, “Can you help me, please?” as his body flails.

The man is then pushed into the back seat of an unmarked car. It’s not clear where he was taken.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to CNN’s questions about whether ICE was involved in the detention or why the man was detained. But the incident happened as ICE increasingly make arrests at courthouses under recent guidance from the Trump administration.

Los Angeles County Superior Court’s presiding judge issued a critical statement in response to questions about Wednesday’s incident, saying such operations will have a negative effect on the judicial system.

“While the court is rarely notified of federal immigration enforcement activity occurring outside our courthouse, I am deeply disturbed by such actions,” the presiding judge, Sergio C. Tapia II, said in a release.

“These intimidating and unnecessary displays undermine public trust in the justice system, deter people from seeking justice, and send a dangerous message to immigrant communities that they are not safe to fully and freely participate in the legal process.”

In Wednesday’s video, an onlooker asks for the name of the man being detained, and he replies, “Steven Reyes.”

Court records show a man named Steven Reyes, who is represented by the Los Angeles County Alternate Public Defender’s Office, had an appearance at the county’s criminal justice center Wednesday on a state felony charge of having or buying illegal drugs with the intent to sell them. Records show he had pleaded not guilty to the charge on July 31 and was free on his own recognizance.

The man detained in the video is represented by the Los Angeles County Alternate Public Defender’s Office, spokesperson Jenny Cheng said. She did not confirm if the man detained is the same Steven Reyes with the drug charge.

“These alleged ICE agents, without a warrant or any explanation, clearly deprived our client of his liberty without due process,” Cheng said in an email to CNN.

“It shocks the conscience to see any human violently abducted by a group of mostly masked unidentified individuals. Such aggressive ICE abductions threaten the integrity of the court system and discourage participation.”

Wednesday’s detention happened outside the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center, according to the Times and the LA Public Press, which told CNN it obtained the video from a witness and published a shorter, edited clip on social media.

In the longer video published by the Times, an onlooker asks one of the men detaining Reyes whether he is from ICE. The man responds, “yes.”

When further questioned by an onlooker, the man quickly flashes a badge twice. While the footage is too blurry to show exactly what the badge says, it resembles a Homeland Security Investigations badge.

The person who appears to be taking the video asks if the men have arrest warrants, and the men do not respond to that question.

CNN has reached out to ICE for information about the arrest, whether Reyes is in the country illegally, whether he is in ICE custody, where he is being held, and exactly what charges he faces.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security previously operated unde r guidelines that limited immigration enforcement at or near courthouses, but the Trump administration rescinded those guidelines shortly into the president’s second term. Masked law enforcement officers have been showing up at courthouses across the country to arrest migrants.

Trump officials have argued the previous guidance hampered the ability of immigration enforcement officers to apprehend people they say are dangerous individuals.

“The ability of law enforcement to make arrests of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a May news release. “It conserves valuable law enforcement resources because they already know where a target will be. It is also safer for our officers and the community. These illegal aliens have gone through security and been screened to not have any weapons.”

Immigrant rights groups have said th e increasing number of courthouse arrests by ICE reflect a broader trend of enforcement extending into places once considered out of bounds and no longer confined to border crossings or work sites.

The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office, which is prosecuting Reyes for the drug charge, said it had no prior knowledge of and played no part in Wednesday’s detention outside of court.

“Our ultimate goal is to seek justice for victims and hold criminals accountable,” the district attorney’s office wrote in a statement. “Detaining a defendant before the judicial process has concluded interferes with our ability to prosecute cases and is not to the advantage of the pursuit of justice.”

Despite public dispute, Dane County apparently released suspect into ICE custody After Martinez-Avila's arrest, the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, asked Dane County law enforcement officials to help transfer her to ICE custody so she could be deported.","MADISON — A Dane County judge raised bail to $5 million for a Honduran woman accused of killing two teens in a drunken-driving crash and ordered federal immigration authorities to return her to county custody.

State prosecutors are fighting for custody of 30-year-old Noelia Martinez-Avila amid a dispute with federal immigration authorities over whether she can be deported before she faces homicide charges.

Martinez-Avila's attorney posted her $250,000 bail on Aug. 13, and she was taken into federal custody as soon as she was released from Dane County Jail.

That prompted prosecutors to request a hearing to raise her bail amount and raised questions about how federal authorities knew of her release despite the sheriff's public pledges that he does not cooperate with immigration agents.

According to a press release by the Department of Homeland Security, Dane County Sheriff's Office gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, less than an hour’s notice before Martinez-Avila was released.

The sheriff's office did immediately not respond to questions Friday evening about why it notified ICE despite pledges not to cooperate with the agency.

Martinez-Avila is accused of drunkenly driving the wrong way on Highway I-90 in DeForest on July 20 and crashing into a car carrying Hallie Helgeson, 18, and Brady Heiling, 19.

Helgeson died at the scene. Heiling, her boyfriend, died from his injuries five days later.

President Donald Trump's efforts to ramp up his nationwide immigration crackdown have led ICE agents to increasingly go after people who have been charged but not yet convicted of crimes. Some have been deported before they could face trial or serve their sentence.

Some prosecutors have criticized this practice, saying it makes communities less safe and denies victims the opportunity to get justice.

Martinez-Avila faces six felony and three misdemeanor charges, including two counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle. Her initial $250,000 bail was set before Heiling died and before her immigration status came into question.

In Wisconsin, defendants are required to post their entire bail amount before being released. Prosecutors can request judges hold defendants without bail for certain serious offenses, but that does not include homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle.

At an Aug. 15 hearing, Heiling's mother begged Dane County Circuit Judge Dianne Schlipper to raise or revoke bail to force Martinez-Avila to face the charges.

""She took my baby, my beautiful boy,"" said Jennifer Heiling through tears, while she was flanked by her husband and two children on a video call. ""She chose this, and they were just trying to come home to us.""

Deputy District Attorney William Brown asked the judge to increase Martinez-Avila's bail amount to $20 million, noting she was able to post a $250,000 bail within a few weeks.

Brown said if she remains in federal custody, it's likely ICE will move to deport her to Honduras, effectively ending the case against her.

""My fear is if bail is not raised that will likely happen very soon, and as soon as she is out of the country, there is little to no chance we will ever prosecute this person,"" he said.

After setting bail at $5 million, the judge also agreed to sign an order proposed by Brown to transport Martinez-Avila back to Dane County Jail.

Martinez-Avila did not appear in person and remained in custody at Waukesha County Jail on an ICE hold. An interpreter relayed the court proceedings by phone.

Her attorney, Anthony Delyea, opposed the order to return her to Dane County. He said prosecutors were seeking to ""get around the constitution"" by denying her right to face federal proceedings.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Aug. 15.

Despite public dispute, Dane County apparently released suspect into ICE custody

After Martinez-Avila's arrest, the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, asked Dane County law enforcement officials to help transfer her to ICE custody so she could be deported.

DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin also called out Dane County as having ""a history of not honoring ICE arrest detainers, often leading to the release of murderers and other heinous criminals.""

At the time, those demands were resisted by Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, who said allowing her to be deported would amount to a ""get out of jail free"" card.

But this week, ""it appears the jail released the defendant into ICE custody after business hours"" on Aug. 13 after her bail was posted, wrote Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Keyes in a court filing.

In a press release, DHS said ICE was given less than an hour’s notice by “this sanctuary jurisdiction” to arrest her.

Prosecutors also argued the jail did not follow court-ordered conditions of her release, including giving her a GPS and alcohol monitor and obtaining prior approval by Pretrial Services.

The Dane County Sheriff's Office disputed that, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the jail is a 24/7 facility and deputies followed her bail conditions. It is common practice not to use a GPS device if they know a person is being taken directly to another secure facility, according to a statement from the office.

In addition, Martinez-Avila was under the custody of the sheriff's office when ICE detained her, and federal agents had legal authority to do so, the sheriff's office said.

In an email Aug. 14, the sheriff said he stands by his previous statements that Martinez-Avila's deportation would rob victims' families of the opportunity for justice and closure.

""Still, I am fully aware that, as sheriff, certain aspects of the justice system are beyond my control,"" Barrett said.

ICE requests cooperation from local jails as national crackdown continues

Because of the large territory they cover, ICE agents often rely on local sheriff's offices to give them a heads up before people who may be subject to deportation are released from local jails.

ICE often does this through non-legally binding ""detainer"" requests. These are requests from federal immigration authorities to local law enforcement agencies to delay releasing immigrants from their jails until immigration agents arrive to take them into custody.

Amid Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown, local law enforcement officials have been scrutinized for how much — or how little — they cooperate.

Barrett is one of a few sheriffs in Wisconsin who has stated he will not honor detainers, earning the county a reputation as a ""sanctuary"" jurisdiction and the scorn of federal immigration officials.

In July, Barrett told the Journal Sentinel he would not cooperate with ICE unless immigration agents presented an arrest warrant signed by a judge.

Months earlier, he had told the Journal Sentinel that his office does not actively cooperate with ICE unless its cooperation is required by law as part of an effort to build trust with immigrant communities.

The case in Dane County is similar to another playing out in Milwaukee, where local prosecutors and federal immigration officials are in a back-and-forth over the custody of a 36-year-old man charged with sexual assault.

In Milwaukee, prosecutors argued that deporting the defendant, Kevin Lopez, before the end of the case would deny his alleged victims their rights as crime victims. Lopez is being held in Milwaukee County Jail without bail. His trial date is scheduled for December.

Research has shown that undocumented immigrants have lower crime arrest rates than both native-born U.S. citizens and legal immigrants.

Immigration and criminal justice advocates have also pointed out that people charged with crimes are presumed innocent under the law.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2018/08/15/PMJS/3276c9cd-f2e1-4371-8d22-45e3e31e498f-115_W_Doty_St_in_Madison._.jpeg?crop=2399,1349,x0,y240&width=2399&height=1349&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-15 22:56:33.241022

The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds.

Colorado is currently home to one ICE detention facility, an Aurora processing center operated by private prison company The GEO Group.

Indiana dubbed the Speedway slammer similar in size to Florida's high security so-called alligator at pass facility Speedway slammer will triple triple the amount of ice beds in the Chicago region.

Let's to cities the Department of Homeland Security has said a quota of 3,000 arrest per day.

And joining us here today is Indiana State Representative Victoria.

That's Wilburn who represents parts of Indianapolis in Brandon Lee communications director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Now, he also invited a number of Illinois and Indiana Republicans to join the conversation.

But the either declined or didn't respond.

Well, thank you both for joining Representative Wilburn, I want to start with Indiana Governor Mike Braun stated Indiana is taking a comprehensive and collaborative approach to combat illegal immigration and will continue to lead the way among state.

Where do you stand?

It's unfortunate that, you know, we have made light of a very grave situation.

>> Dubbing the facility Speedway slammer is dehumanizing at best.

And so Democrats in the state have been vocal all session about their apprehension towards plans.

What are your thoughts?

Pregnant?

You know?

>> As as you mentioned in the introduction, this has the potential to increase you know, it increase capacity 3 times in the in the region overseen by the Chicago office.

And that is the type of that is the type of move by the Trump administration and the governor of Indiana that really sets off the alarm for us that increased enforcement could become a talent as well.

>> And representative the detention center is set to house up to 1000 people awaiting deportation.

Are you concerned about the fiscal responsibilities these new facilities will impose on the state?

That's what I'm concerned about.

Obviously, the humanity issue is what I'm mostly concerned about.

But honestly, Indiana had a hard time making a neutral budget this year.

We had a 3 billion dollar deficit in our state.

Medicaid and we have called for transparency about how much as a state we are looking to fit this bill.

I think it's an egregious error to Hoosiers with what we call Indiana residence and should lawmakers have a say in these centers popping up in their districts?

Absolutely.

I think if we're going to be using state resources, we should be able to have an opinion about how these resources are spent.

And in all transparency, we also have a deficit in public safety officials.

We have a recruitment and retention problem for both our local departments and our sheriffs.

And I'm wondering if that is going to have the implication at detention centers as well.

What are you hearing from people live there?

The residents in Indiana?

Yeah.

I think there's apprehension.

Protests have started.

I have heard from my constituents directly that they don't want their law enforcement officers.

We've asked our law enforcement officers to do multiple things in Indiana.

Everything from mental health ambulance, Ryans to obviously fighting crime.

In addition to being in our local schools.

And now we're asking them to do another thing.

Our citizen see that our law enforcement is stretched very thin.

And this is a federal issue and we need to make sure that their federal resources that are being allocated to this.

But unfortunately, there's not a lot of transparency and Brandon members of ICE or have been active in traveling from Illinois to Indiana detention centers in the past.

What would you say?

They have observed and reported yet.

So.

>> In Illinois, we have supported state boat state legislation that has prevented the opening of additional ICE detention centers within our state.

We have also had members, individual leaders, faith leaders who have taken up the call to speak out against ICE detention in Indiana and elsewhere in the Midwest.

Truthfully.

It has been in conditions in ICE detention centers have been an ongoing concern for immigrant rights advocates for many, many years across multiple administrations.

And now the Trump administration is time to stand up additional detention centers seemingly overnight to house thousands of people.

With no oversight from the federal government are from representatives who aren't even being allowed view detention.

Reading what you said let's just say people who have been.

>> Residents here who of Chicago, lived here in called Chicago home for decades.

And, you know, our undocumented should they be worried?

>> I think that.

The worry is.

Brought on by the Trump administration creating this atmosphere of fear and by ice having seemingly no oversight and no accountability as coming to Chicago and the suburbs and everywhere across the country so I think that the best defense against Trump and the best way to sort of overcome that, the feeling the fear is to build community to be organized, to know your rights to look out for your neighbors and to know the resources that are available within your community and within your state.

Representative, what are your thoughts on what Brandon is saying?

Absolutely agree.

And I'm I'm so thankful for the strong coalitions that do exist here.

And Alan >> We in Indiana, really don't want to make another negative headline.

And unfortunately with Governor Braun at the how it's really difficult to say national headlines for all the wrong reasons.

And so there are several immigrant groups that mobilizing in Indiana as well.

The irony is that one of the detention centers was a former welcome center for Afghan refugees.

And we have come so far and that time, I mean, it's almost a cruel joke to now see it being used as a detention center and how many members would just save your community have been responding to the presence of ICE agents in a negative way.

I would say that, you know, there are people wanting to create and continue to create a sense of community and mobilization.

And so I think that they have been more vocal.

They have been more present and they're demanding lawmakers to pay attention and talking about there.

Is there any legislative action that can help that he needs in the facility?

Us?

We are working very hard to think about a bipartisan approach to humanity.

And so my caucus were certainly be working for towards next session towards offering a bell to make sure that I'm human rights are maintained.

And let's talk about agriculture as we know mass deportation efforts have cause a significant impact on the agriculture industry.

What have you seen in district?

Absolutely.

I mean, make no mistake about it.

Indiana isn't high cultural state.

That house is migrant seasonal farm workers.

Now the word migrant does not mean illegal.

There are several migrant farm workers from states like Texas and Colorado that choose to farm that are American citizens that we have seen cases in California and being swept up in this process and wrongfully detained.

Do you plan to offer any protections for these immigrant workers currently meeting with interested farm will be thinking about some creative legislation to make sure that their rights are preserved or use a passion about this.

I come from a migrant farm worker family.

So my father used to always say that they didn't cross the border.

The border crossed Generations of Americans.

My parents got very poor.

My mother actually farmed this tomato fields of Indiana.

And so if the irony isn't lost on me that I am proud to serve in the state legislature seemingly the highest seed of government.

that's why I'm so passionate about it for stories like my mother's and Brandon, what would use would like to see from legislative leaders as deportation efforts continue?

Yeah.

So.

>> You know, we're we're very pleased that a federal court recently upheld the state and local welcoming bus that community the immigrant community members and allies have fought for over the course of of years that trust at the Chicago.

city ordinance in the county detain policy.

And what we are hoping for is to strengthen those policies, including the trust act.

“OK, it looks like they’re starting,” the camera operator said into the radio to the Border Patrol agents.
They hear you guys.” The camera operator and the other personnel spoke in the professional, matter-of-fact tone of 911 operators.
“If you cut due south from your current location,” the drone pilot said to the camera operator.
“You should pick up some sign.” The camera operator, as directed, panned across the desert, scanning farther and farther south.","Inside a windowless and dark shipping container turned into a high-tech surveillance command center, two analysts peered at their own set of six screens that showed data coming in from an MQ-9 Predator B drone.

Both were looking for two adults and a child who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border and had fled when a Border Patrol agent approached in a truck.

Inside the drone hangar on the other side of the Ft. Huachuca base sat another former shipping container, this one occupied by a drone pilot and a camera operator, who pivoted the drone’s camera to scan 9 square miles of shrubs and saguaros for the migrants. Like the command center, the onetime shipping container was lit mostly by the glow of the computer screens.

The hunt for the three migrants embodied how advanced technology has become a vital part of the Trump administration’s efforts to secure the border.

The Department of Homeland Security allocated 12,000 hours of MQ-9 drone flight time this year at the Ft. Huachuca base, and says the flights cost $3,800 per hour, though an inspector general report in 2015 said the amount is closer to $13,000 when factoring in personnel salaries and operational costs. Maintenance issues and bad weather often mean the drones fly around half the allotted hours, officials said.

With the precipitous drop in migrant crossings at the southern U.S. border, the drones are now tasked with fewer missions. That means they have the time to track small groups or even individual border jumpers trekking north through the desert.

This type of drone, first used in warfare, was operated by the National Air Security Operations division of Customs and Border Protection at the Army base about 70 miles south of Tucson. A reporter was allowed to observe the operation in April on the condition that personnel not be named and that no photographs be taken.

The drone flying this day was mounted with a radar, called Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VaDER, that could identify any moving object in the drone’s sight, and pinpoint them with color-coded dots for the two analysts in the first container. The program had already located three Border Patrol agents, one on foot and two on motorcycles, searching for the migrants. The analysts had also identified three cows and two horses, headed toward Mexico.

Then, one of the analysts spotted something.

“We got them,” he said to his colleague, who had been scanning the terrain. “Good work.”

The analyst dropped a pin on the migrants and the VaDER program began tracking their movement in a blue trail. Now, he had to guide agents on the ground to them.

“We’ve got an adult male and a child, I think, tucked in this bush,” the analyst radioed to his team, as he toggled between the live video to an infrared camera view that showed the heat signature of every living thing in range. The analyst saw his Border Patrol colleagues approaching on motorcycles.

The roar of the oncoming machines scared up a bird, the tracking program showed. The migrants began running.

“OK, it looks like they’re starting,” the camera operator said into the radio to the Border Patrol agents. “They’re hearing the bikes. They hear you guys.” The camera operator and the other personnel spoke in the professional, matter-of-fact tone of 911 operators.

One adult and the child began scrambling up a hill. “They’re moving north and west, mainly,” the camera operator said. “Starting to pick up the pace going uphill.”

The agents rushed in on the pair and detained them. It was a mother and her child. The drone team turned its attention to the third person, who was stumbling through the brush and making a beeline for the Mexican border.

“If you cut due south from your current location,” the drone pilot said to the camera operator. “You should pick up some sign.”

The camera operator, as directed, panned across the desert, scanning farther and farther south.

“I’ve got them,” he said when he spotted someone running. He radioed the coordinates to the Border Patrol team.

By now, the man, carrying a backpack, had scaled a hill.

“He’s on the ridgeline right now, working his way up due south, slowly,” the camera operator radioed.

Then the man dropped something.

“Hey, mark that spot,” the camera operator said. “He just threw a pack, right here where my crosshairs are at. ”

Agents would go back later and see if the backpack contained drugs, an analyst said. “Usually, if it’s food or water, they’re not going to do that,” he said.

On this spring morning, the drone wasn’t the only airborne asset deployed. A helicopter had joined the chase to catch the southbound man, who stumbled, got up and kept running.

“He took a pretty good spill there,” an analyst said into the radio.

“We have a helo inbound, three point five minutes out,” the camera operator said.

A helicopter came into the drone’s view. It swooped in, circling the location of the man, who was by now hiding under a bush.

“You just passed over him,” the camera operator radioed the helicopter pilot. “He’s between you and that saguaro.”

With a keystroke, he switched to infrared vision to find the man’s heat profile through the brush to make sure he still had him.

Guided by the camera operator, the pilot landed the helicopter in a cloud of dust near the cowering target. The video feed showed agents jump out of the aircraft, detain the man and load him into the helicopter. The chopper lifted off and tilted back north toward a nearby Border Patrol post. “Thanks, sir, appreciate all the help,” the analyst said to the helicopter pilot.

Mission accomplished, the drone pilot turned the MQ-9 back along the U.S.-Mexico border, scanning the vast desert in search of more migrants. The military is planning to deliver a third MQ-9 drone to the base this fall after spending a year retrofitting it for civilian authority use.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/695d826/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F97%2Fba%2F45c8cf0f493483009efa171c3d04%2Fborder-drone-patrol.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 18:57:08.324052

The parties will continue to meet and discuss other issues raised against Bondi’s order in the DC attorney general’s lawsuit.
Reyes was appointed to the DC District Court by former President Joe Biden in February 2023.
The order misspelled Cole’s name as “Terrence.” “They misspelled his name on his badge” and on the order, Reyes said to DOJ attorney Jacob Roth.
Trump’s takeover of the Washington, DC, police places officers and residents at “grave risk,” the Metropolitan Police Department chief said Friday.","Under the changes to the Justice Department order directed by Judge Ana Reyes, DEA Administrator Terrance Cole will essentially be a liaison to the DC government, but the end result will be the same: The Trump administration retains control of the Metropolitan Police Department.

Mayor Muriel Bowser would still be required under the law to fulfill policing requests made by the Trump administration.

In effect, this does not change the overall impact of Bondi’s order or Trump’s emergency crime declaration earlier this week but instead creates a slightly more cumbersome process.

Attorneys for DC retain the right to go back to the judge if they are not satisfied with DOJ’s changes to the order.

The parties will continue to meet and discuss other issues raised against Bondi’s order in the DC attorney general’s lawsuit.

The Justice Department has until 6:30 p.m. to revamp an order that placed the DEA administrator in charge of DC police, or a federal judge will issue a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration.

Judge Ana Reyes ordered DOJ to rewrite the section of the executive order issued Thursday by Attorney General Pam Bondi that sought to take control of DC police by placing Terrance Cole in charge under President Donald Trump’s crime emergency declaration.

The change would direct Cole to issue directives through Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office, rather than directly to Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith.

“He’s going to have to go through the Mayor,” Reyes said after attorneys for the Justice Department and the DC attorney general said they needed 45 minutes to re-write that part of Bondi’s order.

“This lawsuit looks like a serious uphill climb for the DC Attorney General,” says Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, “because the law – Section 740 – says the mayor shall provide such services of the Metro PD as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

“That is very broad language,” Honig said. “And what DC is trying to argue is, well, ‘provide such services’ does not mean take over our personnel.’”

But that argument, Honig noted, might not get very far in the long term given how it is up to the president to determine what actions are necessary.

Judge Ana Reyes is overseeing the hearing over Washington, DC’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop Trump’s takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department and appointment of an emergency commissioner.

Reyes was appointed to the DC District Court by former President Joe Biden in February 2023. Before being appointed to the court, Reyes spent much of her career as a litigation attorney for Williams and Connolly, LLP. She handled a variety of cases, including international litigation and representing foreign government officials.

Reyes has dealt with a handful of high-profile cases since joining the court. In February, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Reyes and accused her of misconduct while she was overseeing hearings regarding Trump’s executive order that called for banning transgender service members from the US military.

Reyes is often seen around the DC District courthouse with her golden retriever, Scout.

Judge Ana Reyes took a break during Friday’s hearing before telling both parties to try and come to an agreement over the order from Attorney General Pam Bondi at issue.

“I want to get to a practical solution because time is short and and there are people who need to know who they are taking direction from and what they are doing,” Reyes said.

Bondi’s order sought to have DEA Administrator Terrance Cole take over the DC police and void certain DC laws regarding immigration enforcement.

Reyes noted, however, that the Home Rule Act, which Trump relied on to take over MPD, allows for making law enforcement requests of the mayor, but not have direct control over the police force.

“The answer necessarily isn’t just to say this is wrong, start over,” Reyes said of Bondi’s order.

According to Reyes, the wording of the order, which instead of requesting services makes demands to override laws and impose an outside head of police, is the biggest issue.

“The problem is in the details,” Reyes said.

Reyes also questioned attorneys for the DC’s Attorney General over whether Trump’s requests could supersede DC laws and if the mayor is required to follow the president’s requests.

“There is no wiggle room in the statute,” Reyes said, “It says ‘the mayor shall.’ Not the mayor should or the mayor can, or if the president asks nicely. ‘The mayor shall.’”

The Trump administration agreed with the judge that President Donald Trump’s control over the DC police will end after the 30-day period without approval from Congress.

“Does the federal government agree that if the, if the Congress does not act within 30 days to extend the period, then … basically we’re done?” Judge Ana Reyes asked.

”Yes,” Roth responded.

Under the DC Home Rule Act, a request from the president to control the DC police department for over 30 days must be passed into law by Congress.

Trump has indicated he will ask Congress to extend the takeover.

Reyes has focused on the difference between the White House requesting services of the Metropolitan Police Department as opposed to telling the MPD what it cannot do regarding sanctuary city laws in the capital.

Several parts of the Trump administration’s takeover are at issue including whether the president can install an interim police commissioner to take control of the DC police or act more as a liaison between the president and the mayor’s office.

“This is also not a semantic issue,” Reyes said. “The president can’t say, ‘Mayor, I am asking you for the services of your entire police department. I need every single one of them to be at my beck and call, and I want them to listen to every federal agent out there.’”

Reyes added: “I still just do not understand on what basis the president through the Attorney General, through Mr. (Terrance) Cole, can say ‘You, MPD, have to do whatever I say.’”

DEA Director Terrance Cole’s name was misspelled in Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order Thursday evening that solidified his position as “emergency police commissioner,” Judge Ana Reyes pointed out at the hearing Friday.

The order misspelled Cole’s name as “Terrence.”

“They misspelled his name on his badge” and on the order, Reyes said to DOJ attorney Jacob Roth. “Doesn’t give a lot of confidence if we can’t get his name right.”

Reyes also pushed Roth to recognize that, though Cole was tapped by Bondi to act temporarily as the commissioner, Pamela Smith is still in charge of the Metropolitan Police Department.

“He is not the chief of police,” Roth said. “The chief of police is still the chief of police.”

The judge overseeing the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit against the Trump administration’s takeover of MPD said she will not rule today on whether there is a national emergency in the district.

“I am not going to rule today based on whether or not there is a national emergency,” Judge Ana Reyes said. “I am going to take the federal government position on that for today’s purposes.”

Reyes also said it was her understanding that prior to the attack of a former DOGE employee that set off Trump to begin the federal increase in agents on the ground and eventual takeover of the DC police, both Trump and AUSA Ed Martin claimed separately “that the crime rate in the district has been down” despite the administration’s current position.

The hearing on other DC challenges is ongoing.

Demonstrators gathered outside Washington, DC’s, police headquarters on Friday to protest President Donald Trump’s federal takeover of the city’s law enforcement.

One of the protesters – 29-year-old Katie Garcia – has lived in Washington, DC, since last year, and says she now feels unsafe leaving her house.

“I’m in DC Ward 2, and I’ve lived here for about a year, and it’s wild, because I came here for work, and I was really excited about the energy that this city brought. And I’ve always wanted to live here,” Garcia said.

“With Trump’s takeover, I felt what’s going on in DC is terrifying,” she added.

Marta Ames, a 74-year-old DC resident who has been in the city since the 2000s, says she doesn’t participate in protests, but felt compelled to come to the rally today.

“I’ve never seen anything like this. I was stunned. I mean, I’m someone who believes in my First Amendment right, and we know he does not believe people should protest against anything he does,” adding that she’s “scared to death.”

“I’m curious what the federal troops … what they think and feel, because this is a waste of their time.”

CNN observed dozens of protesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Police Department as part of the rally.

Another protester, Michael Segal, 64, lives on Capitol Hill, and says he’s seen people get stopped and asked for documentation to show they are US residents.

“The fact that I’m walking down the street, and I can get stopped for my papers at any time … it’s just mind boggling to me.”

DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration over its moves to take over the city’s police department and appoint an emergency commissioner, the latest sign of pushback from district officials against the federal takeover.

“By declaring a hostile takeover of (the Metropolitan Police Department), the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District’s right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,” Schwalb said in a statement.

DC is also seeking a temporary restraining order.

It comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday ordered the city’s mayor and police department to accept Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the district’s “emergency police commissioner” and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover.

Trump’s takeover of the Washington, DC, police places officers and residents at “grave risk,” the Metropolitan Police Department chief said Friday.

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Chief Pamela Smith said in a filing in DC’s lawsuit filed Friday to end the takeover.

It is, Smith wrote, “placing the lives of MPD officers and District residents at grave risk.”

The order would also cause officers to not know how the command structure operates because they are still “required under District law to respect and obey the Chief of Police as the head and chief of the police force.”

Smith confirmed that she was “unaware of President Trump’s plans to assume control of the local police force until he announced it at a press conference” on Monday.

Thirty-three people were arrested in Washington, DC, Thursday night, according to a White House official.

The official highlighted that 15 were undocumented immigrants, though it was unclear if this was why they were arrested.

Twenty multi-agency teams were deployed across the District “to promote public safety and arrest violent offenders,” the official said, adding that over 1,750 participants were involved in last night’s operations.

On average in 2024, DC had about 55 adult arrests per day, according to data kept by the city’s police department.

The White House official noted that eight illegal firearms were seized, and other arrests included warrants for first-degree murder and first-degree rape, aggravated assault, a juvenile carrying a pistol without a license and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, including crack cocaine and driving under the influence.

Additionally, three multi-agency teams were assigned to clear homeless encampments in Washington, DC, but the official would not confirm the locations.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2229222360.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-15 17:56:59.534387

At Friday's hearing, plaintiffs' attorneys sought an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect, pending the outcome of the court challenge.
""The posting of the Ten Commandments violates our clients' and Texas families' religious freedom.
If U.S. Judge Fred Berry grants a temporary injunction to block SB 10, it would apply only to the school districts directly involved in the case.
All other school districts would have to decide on their own whether to follow SB 10.","A federal court in San Antonio heard arguments Friday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Texas law mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in all public-school classrooms in the state.

Senate Bill 10 mandates that, starting Sept. 1, all public-school classrooms in Texas must display a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments, using an explicitly Protestant translation derived from the King James Bible. At Friday's hearing, plaintiffs' attorneys sought an injunction to prevent the law from going into effect, pending the outcome of the court challenge.

Lawyers for those objecting to the law said in court that posting the Ten Commandments ""quote obviously violates"" the freedom of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

""The posting of the Ten Commandments violates our clients' and Texas families' religious freedom. It violates our Constitution's promise of separation of church and state, and the First Amendment guarantees that our clients should be able to decide what they believe in, or not, not politicians,"" Amy Tai, senior litigation counsel for the Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told Houston Public Media.

Americans United is one of four civil liberties organizations representing 16 Texas families of varying religious and nonreligious backgrounds in the lawsuit, filed against school districts in the Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio areas. The Houston-area schools listed as defendants are Houston ISD, Cy-Fair ISD and Fort Bend ISD.

A lawyer for the Texas Attorney General's Office, representing the school districts, said the required classroom Ten Commandments poster is a ""passive display,"" ""does not create injury,"" and there is no enforcement provision in the law – so school districts could decide to ignore the law.

The state also argued the Ten Commandments are foundational for the American system of laws. That reiterates arguments the authors of SB 10 made on the floors of the Senate and House during debates prior to voting on the law.

The first witness called by the plaintiffs testified that many of the ideas in the commandments were ""parallel"" to American law but not unique.

We’ve been investigating abusive detention space conditions and the private prison industry’s ties to Trump’s mass detention and deportation goals.","President Trump’s strongman act is on full display in the nation’s capitol.

In a move straight out of the authoritarian handbook, Trump this week declared a crime emergency in Washington, D.C. and took federal control of the city’s police force and deploying National Guard troops into its streets. This federalization of the nation’s capitol is another attempt by the president to project an image of strength and resilience in the face of opposition — and to show what he is willing to do to punish his perceived adversaries.

In targeting D.C., Trump has spewed lies about the city’s history, population, and safety, many of which are based on and perpetuate racist rhetoric and narratives about the city’s large Black population.

That same rhetoric has been used to disenfranchise D.C.’s citizens for decades, and was used as a basis for the city’s lack of representation in Congress in the late 19th century.

Despite Trump’s claims of lawlessness and chaos in D.C., data from both the F.B.I and Metropolitan Police Department shows the city’s crime rate is currently at its lowest in nearly 30 years.

Trump has named specific and vulnerable targets in his takeover of the nation’s capitol; unhoused people and juveniles suspected of being members of “violent gangs” are at the top of his arrest priority list.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that unhoused people who refuse to leave D.C. “will be subjected to fines or jail time,” but advocates have pointed out that there is limited bed space in area shelters.

“This is not about preventing crime, it’s about political theater and federal control,” Clinique Chapman, the chief executive of D.C. Justice Lab, told the New York Times. “Young Black boys will bear the brunt of this, as they are the most likely to be stopped, to be questioned, to just really encounter the police interactions.”

We’re investigating Trump’s brazen efforts to seize control of Democratic power centers. Immediately following his federalization of D.C., we submitted a suite of public records requests to the departments of justice and the interior, as well as to the National Parks Service, the D.C. Mayor’s Office, and the D.C. City Council, for information that could help determine whether the administration’s public-safety rationale is a cover for a broader political effort to strip power from D.C.’s locally elected leaders.

D.C. residents have the right to elect their own mayor and council, but Congress retains power to override local governance.

Trump’s comments and the task force’s sweeping mandate raise concerns that the president could wield that authority to permanently revoke local control.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called Trump’s actions an “authoritarian push” and an “intrusion on our autonomy.”

This isn’t the first time we’ve witnessed Trump’s willingness to deploy military personnel on American soil to advance his political agenda and suppress opposition — and it seems like it won’t be the last.

On Monday, Trump vowed, “This will go further,” threatening to extend similar federal crackdowns to New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, and Oakland — all cities led by Black Democratic mayors.

In June, Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard and Marine troops to quash protests in Los Angeles, despite local and state officials’ objections — a stunning abuse of power that flies in the face of Americans’ right to free speech.

The administration also dispatched thousands of military troops to the southern border in another political stuntearlier this year.

And new reporting suggests that the Trump administration is now evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” of National Guard troops to be deployed into U.S. cities to quash protests or other civil unrest. Such an endeavor could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and poses a serious threat to Americans’ constitutional rights to free speech and assembly.

Congress Must Investigate IRS Commissioner Billy Long’s Ousting

Trump ousted IRS Commissioner Billy Long last weekend, after he reportedly raised concerns about the agency’s data-sharing agreement with ICE. We’re calling on Congress to immediately investigate Long’s removal.

Long, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, was hand-picked for the role by Trump, but was removed after just two months, following a reported dispute with the administration over its use of IRS records for immigration enforcement.

According to the Washington Post, last week the Department of Homeland Security sent the IRS a request for personal tax information about 40,000 individuals. The IRS refused to provide most of the information, citing privacy laws. Long was removed soon afterward.

“Removing the head of the IRS for refusing to violate this already controversial agreement is as alarming as it is telling,” American Oversight’s executive director Chioma Chukwu said. “That the Trump administration reportedly sought to weaponize confidential taxpayer information to advance its nativist and anti-immigrant agenda — and, when Commissioner Long appeared to stand in the way, pushed him out after only two months on the job — should alarm all Americans.”

“If this kind of abuse goes unanswered, it will embolden the administration to further trample privacy protections for immigrants and citizens alike,” Chukwu added.

We previously uncovered details of a data-sharing agreement between ICE and the IRS that showed ICE was seeking IRS records containing the addresses and other personal information of people it was investigating.

The government repeatedly attempted in federal court to keep the details of the agreement hidden. Our successful efforts to lift the redactions revealed the government’s apparent expectation that it could use the law-enforcement privilege to shield the records without proper justification or reason.

On the Records: Texas and ICE are Coordinating Immigration Detention Spaces in the State

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office has been coordinating with federal immigration authorities to prop up detention spaces in the state, emails show — another indication of states’ willingness to bend to President Trump’s extreme goals of mass arresting, detaining, and deporting immigrants.

Texas could become the most recent state to announce it will prop up new detention facilities in support of Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, following similar moves by Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana, and others.

Emails show that Abbott’s Chief of Staff Robert Black asked top Trump administration officials working in immigration enforcement about possible detention spaces in Texas in February.

“Attached is the list of facilities we visited about,” Black wrote. “Workforce will be a challenge but that can be contracted. … “I would recommend we set up a conference call to see if we can hammer out an agreement if you want to proceed.” The suggested facilities were redacted in the version of the email we obtained.

Other emails include references to a meeting about detention space that was held that same month between Abbott’s Deputy Chief of Staff, Angela Colmenero, and officials at ICE, DHS, and the National Security Council.

“It was a pleasure speaking with you and Trevor this morning,” an NSC official wrote to Colmenero on February 13. (Colmenero noted that the director of the state’s prison system also joined the meeting.)

“We sincerely appreciate your support for the administration’s agenda of expanding our detention portfolio nationwide,” the official continued. “We need to iron out some significant details regarding terms of use, length, cost, and any other facility or structural requirements needed.”

ICE recently announced that it plans to convert a Texas military base, Fort Bliss, into a detention facility to hold thousands of detainees.

The $1.2 billion site — which is still under development — will begin detaining individuals on August 17. As planned, it will be the largest federal immigration detention space in U.S. history.

Legal battles over other recently-opened detention facilities are ongoing. Last week, a judge ordered a 14-day halt of construction at the Florida Everglades detention space, citing environmental concerns.

That order doesn’t include any restrictions on law enforcement or immigration enforcement activity, though, and detained individuals are still being held in the swampy space, where conditions include sweltering heat, abrupt air conditioning cut-offs, and bugs in the food.

We’ve been investigating abusive detention space conditions and the private prison industry’s ties to Trump’s mass detention and deportation goals. Read more here.

“We are grateful to Mexico’s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.” The U.S. war on drugs, first declared by Richard Nixon in 1971, has been an abject failure.

Melding two failed American wars — the war on drugs and the war on terror — would “put people at risk of violence and destabilize hemispheric relations while hindering, not helping, efforts to protect communities from drug trafficking and other crime,” according to the organizations, which include the Alianza Americas, Center for Civilians in Conflict, Drug Policy Alliance, Public Citizen, and Win Without War.

President Donald Trump has secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against select Latin American drug cartels that his administration has deemed terrorist organizations, according to an Intercept interview with a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak to the media. The authorization was first reported by the New York Times.

The decision to involve the American military in what has previously been considered a law enforcement effort comes as Trump has increasingly turned to U.S. troops for law enforcement purposes on American soil and taken over the D.C. police. These efforts are seen as dangerous escalations of the use of military force and violations of long-held norms.

The letter, sent to top congressional leaders on Friday, urges lawmakers “to use the full slate of its powers to prevent the administration from launching a new war in Latin America without democratic debate or public accountability” by “organiz[ing] hearings to assess the scope of the administration’s envisioned use-of-force policy and its likely diplomatic, economic, and human impacts” and “withhold[ing] funding for unauthorized, undebated, and unaccountable military action.”

In January, the State Department declared eight Mexican drug cartels — the Sinaloa cartel, CJNG, the Northeast cartel, the Michoacán family, the United Cartels, and the Gulf Cartel — to be foreign terrorist organizations. The Salvadoran MS-13 and the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang were also named. That designation activates U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions and bans on U.S. citizens from providing support to the groups.

That same month, Trump mused that he might send U.S. commandos into Mexico to battle cartels. “Could happen,” he said. “Stranger things have happened.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened military action on Mexican soil. And a Justice Department guidance document urged employees to work toward the “total elimination of cartels.”

The coalition of groups pointed to the potential blowback of expanding the forever wars to Mexico and beyond. “Unilateral and hastily conceived military action could contribute to the considerable human rights abuses, criminal violence, and forced displacement already harming communities in Latin America,” reads the letter. “Militarized approaches to countering narcotics trafficking have often backfired. They have inadvertently incentivized criminal groups to traffic smaller and more potent drugs to evade interdiction, acquire deadlier weapons, and expand their networks of corruption to protect their profits.”

Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum last week rejected the use of U.S. troops in her country. But earlier this week, Mexico extradited 26 alleged cartel members to the United States. Attorney General Pam Bondi hailed the cooperation. “These 26 men have all played a role in bringing violence and drugs to American shores — under this Department of Justice, they will face severe consequences for their crimes against this country,” she said. “We are grateful to Mexico’s National Security team for their collaboration in this matter.”

The U.S. war on drugs, first declared by Richard Nixon in 1971, has been an abject failure. It’s estimated that the United States has spent more than $1 trillion battling the drug trade and drug use with dismal results. Nearly 1 million arrests are made for drug law violations in the U.S. each year, according to FBI statistics, making it the leading cause of arrest in the United States. One in 3 people in the U.S. has lost someone they know to a drug overdose. In 2024, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called the worldwide war on drugs a “clear failure” and called out “militarized law enforcement responses” around the world.

“Overseas military strikes certainly won’t solve drug overdose deaths in the U.S., which are far better addressed through public health measures,” said Stephanie Brewer, the director for Mexico at the Washington Office on Latin America or WOLA, another signatory of the letter. “What military action abroad would do is open the door to increased violence, forced migration, and incalculable damage to U.S. relations with neighboring countries.”

Trump has already sent thousands of National Guard and active-duty troops to the southern border to ostensibly halt the flow of drugs as well as immigrants. More than 10,000 troops are deploying or have deployed there, according to Northern Command. Under the direction of NORTHCOM, military personnel have deployed under the moniker Joint Task Force-Southern Border since March, bolstering approximately 2,500 service members who were already supporting U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s border security mission.

One-third of the U.S. border is now completely militarized due to the creation of four new national defense areas, or NDAs: sprawling extensions of U.S. military bases patrolled by troops who can detain immigrants until they can be handed over to Border Patrol agents.

“Launching military action in Latin America without congressional authorization would be illegal, reckless, and a betrayal of our democratic process — and Congress must intervene to stop it,” Sara Haghdoosti, the executive director of Win Without War, told The Intercept. “We’ve seen this ‘war on drugs’ playbook before in the region, and it has failed time and again — fueling violence, displacing communities, and doing nothing to address the root causes of drug trafficking.”

Haghdoosti added, “What makes this even more egregious is that the Trump administration is pushing for war while slashing the very public health programs that save lives. People need healthcare, treatment, and support — not military posturing and strikes.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP20175730870255-e1755272809958.jpeg?fit=6000%2C3000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-15 16:57:57.403696

Dear Chairman Comer, Ranking Member Garcia, Chairman Paul, and Ranking Member

Peters:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 126 undersigned organizations, we write to express our profound concerns with the recent decision by President Trump to assert control over the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and to deploy the National Guard throughout the city. This unprecedented and needless takeover of a local government’s law enforcement mechanisms poses a dire threat to public safety as well as to civil and human rights, not only of the people who live in D.C., but ultimately throughout the entire country.

This administration has proven that it will push every boundary to test for exploitable weakness in Congress and the courts. Given the role of your respective committees in matters affecting our nation’s capital, we urge you to promptly call for hearings into this decision, and to engage in vigorous oversight moving forward.

While President Trump has pointed to several high-profile instances of crime in the District of Columbia, the fact remains that there simply is no “crime emergency.” Violent crime in D.C. fell by 35 percent in 2024 compared to the previous year, and it is now at a 30-year low. One of the key drivers of this decrease has been widespread investments in community-based violence intervention and crisis response, including through COVID recovery dollars and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Until recently, when Congress inexplicably forced D.C. to slash its budget by more than $1 billion, D.C. was also able to utilize its own local tax revenue to address the issue.

In the place of proven strategies aimed at reducing and preventing crime, President Trump’s decision to commandeer the police and fill the streets with National Guard servicemembers – who are not trained to act as police officers – is not simply a matter of political theater and distraction. It also poses a dire threat to longstanding efforts to foster trust between the police and the communities they serve, especially in light of President Trump’s claim that he would allow the police under his command to “do whatever the hell they want,” raising concerns that the civil rights of D.C. residents may be sacrificed in the process.

President Trump has once again declared a false emergency to access executive powers that were not meant to be used as political tools to amass power. It is a terrible precedent that could harm cities, communities, and people well beyond D.C. What he is able to achieve in D.C., he will try to do elsewhere. He has already threatened to do the same in other major cities around the country.

The simple fact is that President Trump is not seriously interested in reducing crime. He is interested in misleading about crime to justify abhorrent practices, including rapid expansion of criminalization, unprecedented abuses by federal law enforcement agents, and dangerous executive power grabs. Time and time again, he has shown that his real goal is to create a police state, as he has repeatedly weaponized law enforcement to quash dissent and to serve his own personal and political ends. For example, since taking office, his administration has:

• Defied court orders;

• Unlawfully punished law firms, private charities, and universities perceived as being hostile to him or his agenda;

• Locked up and tried to deport students simply because they criticized U.S. foreign policy;

• Filed criminal charges against a sitting U.S. representative for trying to engage in oversight of an immigrant detention center;

• Arrested and charged the president of a state chapter of a major labor union while peacefully engaging in protected First Amendment activity;

• Warned that protestors in D.C. were “going to be met with very big force”;

• Violently handcuffed a sitting U.S. senator for merely trying to ask a question at a press conference;

• Carried out senseless and unlawful immigration raids that have terrorized communities, instilled fear in families, and eroded trust in public institutions; and

• Threatened homeless populations in D.C. and elsewhere with arrest, exile, and involuntary commitment.

The federal government should respect the laws and policies of D.C. enacted via its democratically elected government. Instead, D.C. is an easy testing ground for President Trump, because while its residents pay federal taxes and comply with all the other duties of citizenship, they have no vote in Congress and limited control over their own local governance. Given his record to date, it would be naïve to think that President Trump will stop there. We urge you to ensure that our rights under the Constitution and under our federal laws are being fully protected and enforced.",https://www.lwv.org/themes/custom/primary_bootstrap/img/lwv-favicon-500.png,N,,2025-08-15 16:58:02.020942

This is unprecedented, unnecessary, undemocratic, and unjustifiable.

As an organization based in D.C., we reject President Trump’s offensive and baseless lies about the vibrant communities here that many of our staff love and belong to.

This moment is a reminder of the urgent need for statehood for the more than 700,000 district residents who have been denied representation for too long.

This move is also part of a broader, disturbing pattern of authoritarianism and militarism that we have seen from this administration.

Here at home, we’ve seen tanks in our streets and masked ICE agents carrying out war-like raids on our communities. When people in Los Angeles protested these raids, President Trump deployed troops to suppress them.

Now, as D.C. is placed under military occupation, the administration is threatening to do the same in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York.

“To our dismay, this is America 2025,” FCNL’s Bridget Moix wrote in RNS in last month. “Due process, rule of law and core principles of our democracy are all being swept aside in a systematic shift toward authoritarianism and rule by fear and force.”

We have also seen this disturbing shift toward militarism in our foreign policy. The administration and Congress have turned ploughshares into swords, dismantling diplomacy, international aid, and peacebuilding programs while bloating annual military spending to more than $1 trillion.

The administration has continued to arm the Israeli government’s genocidal assault on Gaza. It has bombed Yemen, surged U.S. strikes in Somalia, and waged war on Iran.

Now, President Trump has also approved plans to illegally use U.S. military force against cartels in Latin America without Congressional authorization.

As we have long said, war is not the answer. We must continue to oppose it – both at home and abroad –and advocate for real solutions that foster peace, prosperity, and dignity for all.

Palestinians are facing famine and people are starving to death as hundreds of civilians are shot and killed by the Israeli military trying to access food aid. Civil society is speaking up and international condemnation is growing. Germany halted arms deliveries to Israel, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has divested, and leaders from France, Australia, and China are speaking out forcefully against the mass starvation of civilians.

Pressure is also growing inside Israel. Hundreds of retired Israeli security officials urged President Trump to pressure the Israeli government into ending the war in Gaza. Retired Israeli pilots protested the war outside of the Israeli military’s headquarters. A group of high-profile Israeli public figures have called for “crippling sanctions” to be imposed by the international community on Israel.

Trump-Putin Summit Must Address Nukes

President Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia are meeting in Alaska today. Although the meeting is focused on the Russia-Ukraine war, it also provides a crucial opportunity to address nuclear arms control. Since the New START Treaty is set to expire in February, the safety of the world demands immediate action.

Senator Condemns Sending Immigrants to be Tortured

For months, the Trump administration has been forcibly sending immigrants to countries they are not from. Once there, their human rights have been violated, and they have been tortured. This happened in El Salvador and may be continuing as people are sent to South Sudan and other countries. Senator Tim Kaine (VA) introduced legislation to condemn this practice and demand that the United States not support torture.

Trump fights challenges to his power aggressively in court, and in many cases, federal judges have given him big wins.","D.C. is fighting back.

On Friday, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Trump’s most recent push to take day-to-day control over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), calling it “brazenly unlawful” and the “gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced.”

The lawsuit follows hot on the heels of an order issued by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday that sought to put the Trump administration in full daily control of MPD, sidelining current leadership and enabling it to dictate not just what police should do – but also the way they should do it.

The move shocked D.C. officials who were carefully trying to balance working with Trump – who on Monday used his legal powers to expand federal presence in law enforcement in the city – with protecting what limited local control they already have. That balance has now been thrown off; it’s more clear that Trump is aggressively testing the bounds of the law, and that what he’s trying now could be just the start of a broader push to control D.C.

What this is all about

As you probably know, on Monday, Trump invoked a provision of the Home Rule Charter that lets him take over MPD for 30 days. That provision is carefully worded, though: it gives the president the right to “direct the Mayor to provide him, and the Mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.”

On Thursday night, Bondi seemed to take this a step further. She declared that DEA administrator Terry Cole was taking daily control of the police department, largely pushing aside current Chief Pamela Smith. Bondi also repealed a number of police orders – documents detailing how cops should operate – related to the city’s sanctuary law, which limits cooperation on federal immigration enforcement.

What D.C. is arguing

D.C. officials were quick to respond to Bondi, and their response was clear: Not so fast.

Citing a legal opinion from Attorney General Brian Schwalb, Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted: “There is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.” Put more plainly, she said that while Trump can ask MPD to do certain things, he can’t order officers to do them in a certain way, much less can he take over the daily operations of the department wholesale.

Now, Schwalb and Bowser aren’t challenging Trump’s ability to “request services” from MPD, services that MPD has to provide. Rather, they are more narrowly pushing back on exactly how much control Trump has over MPD. The president seems to think it’s essentially absolute; Bowser and Schwalb say it’s actually pretty limited.

“[Bondi’s order] installs a handpicked federal official as chief of police, grants him sweeping power to issue commands directly to MPD, and bars MPD senior leadership from acting without his approval. It also purports to suspend MPD policies that Defendant Bondi dislikes, impose enforcement policies she favors, and rescind any existing orders that stand in the way. In short, it attempts to divest the District and its residents of any control of their local police force and place it, for all purposes, under the control of the federal government,” reads the lawsuit. “[The Home Rule Charter] does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District’s authority over its own government.”

Additionally, the lawsuit targets two other issues: for what purposes Trump can actually request services from MPD, and whether he’s even allowed to request them right now.

The Home Rule Charter says the president can request MPD’s services when “special conditions of an emergency nature exist.” According to the Trump administration, crime in D.C. is that emergency. But the charter also says the president would need MPD for “federal purposes.” In the lawsuit, Schwalb says there’s no actual crime emergency in D.C., and that even if there was, Bondi’s order is pushing way beyond just “federal purposes” and directly into local policing.

Why D.C. is fighting back now

As we’ve reported plenty, ever since Trump took office, Bowser has largely tried to stay out of his way and occasionally throw him a symbolic or real bone to keep him thinking he’s getting his way. It’s been a tenuous and uncomfortable balance she’s tried to strike, and it started falling apart this week when Trump claimed control of MPD and deployed federal law enforcement officers and the National Guard in D.C.

Even then, Bowser tried to play the role of cooperator-in-chief, saying MPD would work with the federal government and even throwing Trump a big bone by saying police would now help – a bit – on immigration enforcement.

But Bondi’s Thursday order completely shattered the illusion that Bowser could cooperate on friendly terms with Trump. Instead, it made clear that this is about power – and that Bowser shouldn’t actually think she has any. (Sources tell The 51st that Bowser was skeptical of the value of litigation until Bondi's order, which changed her thinking.) And just as Trump has pushed aggressively to claim the broadest powers possible in many other areas, so too would he do so when it comes to D.C.’s already limited ability to govern itself.

In essence, this lawsuit is the first attempt to head off what could be future legal fights over MPD and D.C.’s self-governance as a whole. Trump has already foreshadowed what those fights might be – and the main one is just how long he can claim to control MPD. The charter says 30 days, unless Congress agrees to an extension. Trump said this week he wants those extensions, and he will get them whether or not Congress agrees.

But this legal fight is also more broadly about how best MPD can fight crime. While Trump has clearly said he wants police to play rougher and be more aggressive, Bowser and Smith have highlighted the importance of MPD being trusted by the communities they police. Should Bondi’s order hold, that trust could take a huge hit. That’s because her order specifically gives her the authority to change the rules and regulations governing how police operate — rules and regulations that are nominally crafted in response to local expectations and lived experiences.

Take body cameras. D.C. officers have been using them for almost a decade; when they were first rolled out, city officials said they were a means to increase transparency and accountability. Now, there are remaining questions as to how much they have done that, but there is no question that they have changed local policing. (Every time a D.C. police officer shoots someone, there is video evidence of it – and it is often made public.) Under Bondi’s expansive order, Trump could just declare that MPD officers no longer need them, or they can more freely stop anyone on the street for any reason – or no reason at all — or that they’re more free to use deadly force. The list goes on.

In a declaration that accompanies the lawsuit, Smith warned that the Bondi order “would upend the command structure of MPD, endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike. In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive.”

Finally, this does come back to D.C.’s ability to govern itself. Bondi said her order repealed the police orders on how they should and should not deal with immigration enforcement. (MPD officers have not traditionally asked about immigration status when someone is arrested, and won’t hold someone longer than legally allowed because ICE wants to pick them up – unless there is a warrant out for them.) But those orders are based on a law passed by the D.C. Council. Bondi is in effect telling police to ignore an existing law passed by the city’s elected representatives.

If she and Trump can do that with immigration enforcement, what else?

What’s next

Schwalb is asking for an immediate temporary restraining order — for a federal judge to temporarily stop Bondi from enforcing her new order. But he’s also asking for a judge to do the same with Trump’s broader executive order issued earlier this week. A hearing is set for 2 p.m. Friday.

Should those be granted, D.C. and MPD would enter something of a holding pattern where things mostly return to normal, minus all the federal enforcement officers and National Guardsmen everywhere.

But it wouldn’t be the end of the story, obviously. Trump fights challenges to his power aggressively in court, and in many cases, federal judges have given him big wins.

Catholic advocates push Trump administration to address religious worker visa backlog

By KATE SCANLON, OSV News | Published August 15, 2025

WASHINGTON (OSV News)–Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers–such as Catholic priests and nuns–legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

“One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you’ve got huge backlogs,” Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests–released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America’s Catholic Project–indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins’ office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, “We’re continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we’re encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.”

“We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,” the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

“For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you’re going to be moving parishes right?” she said. “And under the current framework, you can’t do that without jeopardizing your status.”

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

“It’s a very modest fix,” she said. “One of the things we’ve seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can’t be consensus on.”

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don’t become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.”

“Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,” Corbett said.

Corcoran said, “We’ve seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.”

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called “the largest deportation in U.S. history.”

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN’s “The World Over,” that the administration is trying to “create its own standalone process” for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

“And I’ve been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,” Rubio said. “And it’s not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we’re trying to streamline that process.”

“We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,” Rubio said, adding, “We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here … some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here. So we’re not interested in that. That’s really not the aim here. It’s more caught up in the structure of it. We’ll have a plan to fix it. We’re working on it. We know it’s an issue, and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today, that federal prosecutors in the district filed 232 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 8 through 14.

Two Mexican nationals were arrested in Seguin on Aug. 8, when they were caught allegedly transporting 137 kgs of methamphetamine and 7.5 kgs of heroin. A Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office K9 deputy conducted a traffic stop on Roberto Moreno-Rangel and Martin Gomez-Cisneros near the intersection of Highway 90 and Interstate Highway 10. After the two individuals allegedly provided conflicting stories to the deputy, the K9 conducted an open-air sniff inspection of the vehicle and allegedly alerted to the presence of illegal narcotics on the rear driver side fender well area of the vehicle. Further investigation of the vehicle allegedly revealed 48 bundles concealed in an aftermarket compartment. 47 of the bundles were allegedly found to contain methamphetamine, while the remaining bundle allegedly contained heroin. Charged with possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, Moreno-Rangel and Gomez-Cisneros each face 10 years to life in prison, if convicted.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Heriberto Monsivais Lopez aka Erik Lopez, was arrested in San Antonio as part of an investigation into firearms trafficking to Mexico. On Wednesday, Homeland Security Investigations agents, along with officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety (TX DPS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations, allegedly observed Monsivais Lopez sell two 9mm pistols and 28.93 g of suspected cocaine. He was previously removed from the U.S. to Mexico on March 14, 2019. Monsivais Lopez is charged with one count of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years imprisonment.

Salvadoran national Samuel Chulo-Aguilar was charged with illegal re-entry in Del Rio, having been previously deported in 2012 through Phoenix, Arizona. In 2007, Chulo-Aguilar was sentenced to six years in prison following a conviction in Los Angeles, California, for lewd acts with a child under 14.

In Austin, Honduran national Jose Carcamo-Santos was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after he was arrested during a traffic stop by TX DPS on Aug. 9. Carcamo-Santos is charged with illegal re-entry and has been removed from the U.S. seven times between 2004 and 2022. He’s been thrice convicted for illegal re-entry and has three other convictions for controlled substance charges.

Rosell Bladimir Ortiz-Garcia, also a Honduran national, was arrested and charged with illegal re-entry in Eagle Pass. Ortiz-Garcia has been deported seven times, the last one being on Feb. 26, after being convicted for assault causing bodily injury.

Victor Aaron Vargas-Leon, a Mexican national, was arrested near El Indio on Aug. 10 and charged with transporting illegal aliens. A criminal complaint alleges that Border Patrol agents found three illegal aliens and another deceased individual in the brush. Vargas-Leon was allegedly determined to be a foot guide for the group.

In El Paso, Mexican national Victor Hugo Lopez-Murillo was allegedly found in a storm drain just over a mile west of the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry. He is charged with illegal re-entry, having been previously removed from the U.S. four times, the last time being in February following a felony conviction for trespassing in a habitation.

Mexican national Jorge Santillan-De La Cruz was arrested in El Paso and charged with illegal re-entry after he allegedly applied for admission into the U.S., presenting himself as a U.S. citizen who had lost his documents in Mexico. Customs and Border Protection officers found that Santillan-De La Cruz had previously been removed from the U.S. for the fourth time in March. Additionally, he has been convicted five times for theft and burglary offenses and twice for illegal re-entry.

Raul Robledo, a U.S. citizen, was charged with conspiracy to transport illegal aliens after allegedly being observed acting as a look-out during a failed alien smuggling scheme in El Paso on Aug. 4. A criminal complaint alleges that, during the scheme, Border Patrol agents responded to subjects exiting a storm drain and observed multiple vehicles suspected of being involved in the smuggling operation. One subject was allegedly observed lifting the storm drain grate, then dropping it, injuring a female subject who was later transported to a hospital with finger amputations and a head injury. Border Patrol agents located four additional illegal aliens inside the storm drain. Further investigation revealed that Robledo had allegedly fled the scene and had served as a look-out on three other occasions.

Mexican national Luis Heriberto Baca-Baca was arrested while crossing the Rio Grande River with nine other individuals determined to be in the U.S. illegally. Baca-Baca allegedly served as the foot guide for the group and had been observed entering the U.S. illegally with a group of 14 individuals the day prior.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

The resolutions, which have little chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Congress, would terminate the state of emergency that Mr. Trump declared in his executive order on Monday that federalized the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order D.C.’s mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate the authority.

The resolutions were introduced the same day that D.C.’s local government filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump’s efforts. It argued that he and Attorney General Pam Bondi had exceeded the scope of their authority under the Home Rule Act, which in 1973 granted D.C. a limited degree of self-government. The city of about 700,000 people has no voting power in Congress.

Representative Jamie Raskin, whose Maryland district includes the Washington suburbs, accused Mr. Trump in a statement of a “hostile takeover of D.C.’s police force” that was part of larger pattern of abusing presidential power.

Mr. Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced the resolution in the House, with Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and Robert Garcia of California, the leading Democrat on the Oversight Committee, which oversees Washington. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland brought the resolution in the Senate.

Their legislation faces long odds given Republicans’ lock on power on Capitol Hill and their unwillingness to break from Mr. Trump. G.O.P. leaders in both chambers have voiced support for the president’s actions in Washington. Democrats would need support from Republicans to ever allow the matter to proceed to the floor.

But the effort offers a hint at how Democrats may try to fight Mr. Trump’s actions in Washington and use them to make larger political arguments to the American public.

In their resolutions, the Democrats cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in D.C. as evidence that there is no emergency to justify Mr. Trump’s actions.

The resolutions, which have little chance of advancing in the Republican-controlled Congress, would terminate the state of emergency that Mr. Trump declared in his executive order on Monday that federalized the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order D.C.’s mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate the authority.

The resolutions were introduced the same day that D.C.’s local government filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump’s efforts. It argued that he and Attorney General Pam Bondi had exceeded the scope of their authority under the Home Rule Act, which in 1973 granted D.C. a limited degree of self-government. The city of about 700,000 people has no voting power in Congress.

Representative Jamie Raskin, whose Maryland district includes the Washington suburbs, accused Mr. Trump in a statement of a “hostile takeover of D.C.’s police force” that was part of larger pattern of abusing presidential power.

Mr. Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, introduced the resolution in the House, with Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and Robert Garcia of California, the leading Democrat on the Oversight Committee, which oversees Washington. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland brought the resolution in the Senate.

Their legislation faces long odds given Republicans’ lock on power on Capitol Hill and their unwillingness to break from Mr. Trump. G.O.P. leaders in both chambers have voiced support for the president’s actions in Washington. Democrats would need support from Republicans to ever allow the matter to proceed to the floor.

But the effort offers a hint at how Democrats may try to fight Mr. Trump’s actions in Washington and use them to make larger political arguments to the American public.

In their resolutions, the Democrats cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in D.C. as evidence that there is no emergency to justify Mr. Trump’s actions.

Washington’s police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure.

Washington’s police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

It's part of a push from Washington’s top legal official to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation's capital.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc."" Conflicting commands and confusion about who is in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said.

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday morning.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Many immigrant religious workers — such as Catholic priests and nuns — legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas.
“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.","WASHINGTON (OSV News) — Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers — such as Catholic priests and nuns — legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

“One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you’ve got huge backlogs,” Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

“And this affects these religious workers,” she said.

Impact of backlog

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests — released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America’s Catholic Project — indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins’ office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, “We’re continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we’re encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.”

“We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,” the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

“For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you’re going to be moving parishes right?” she said. “And under the current framework, you can’t do that without jeopardizing your status.”

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

“It’s a very modest fix,” she said. “One of the things we’ve seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can’t be consensus on.”

Bill’s outlook

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, “Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don’t become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.”

“Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,” Corbett said.

Corcoran said, “We’ve seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.”

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called “the largest deportation in U.S. history.”

Process for religious workers

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN’s “The World Over,” that the administration is trying to “create its own standalone process” for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

“And I’ve been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,” Rubio said. “And it’s not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we’re trying to streamline that process.”

“We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,” Rubio said, adding, “We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here … some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here. So we’re not interested in that. That’s really not the aim here. It’s more caught up in the structure of it. We’ll have a plan to fix it. We’re working on it. We know it’s an issue, and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Congress is scheduled to return from its August recess in early September.

Homan’s comments come after Attorney General Pam Bondi sought to roll back the District’s “sanctuary” policies around migrants, including lifting the block on local police cooperating with immigration enforcement.

“Law enforcement needs to work with law enforcement,” Homan told NewsNation, The Hill’s sister network. “We’re not asking Metro PD to be immigration officers, but when you’re enforcing criminal law and when you find an illegal alien not only in violation of immigration law here illegally but involved with criminal activity, they absolutely should call us.”

He added that he hopes the administration’s crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital could be an example for the rest of the country.

FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday that authorities have made more than 120 arrests since Trump announced the federal takeover, writing on the social platform X, “the good cops are getting the job done.”

Democrats have warned that Trump’s move to take over the District’s police department and deploy hundreds of federal police and National Guard troops to the streets could be a test case for crackdowns on blue cities in the future — especially given the president’s insistence that the level of crime in D.C. is far higher than recorded statistics indicate.

Homan told NewsNation he believed the increased police and military presence in the nation’s capital has deterred crime in the city.

“It’s not just the people that are arresting that are making D.C. safer, it’s the message we’re sending that we’re out here in force,” he said. “I think there are a lot of criminals staying off the street because they know the city is overwhelmed with law enforcement.”

The Trump administration’s federalization of the city’s law enforcement has already triggered at least one legal battle and many protests. D.C.’s Democratic attorney general sued the federal government Friday morning over its move to install Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief Terry Cole as the city’s “emergency police commissioner.”

Angela Garcia was on her way to work with her older son when she was ambushed by federal officials on July 6. The intense moment was caught on camera as masked officers surrounded the family and smashed through Garcia’s car window to make an arrest.

“They had no patience with her,” Alexander Fabian Garcia, the younger son, described the federal agents, adding that his mom had never had any legal problems. NBC Los Angeles also found no criminal history with Garcia.

The single mother has been in the country for over 25 years after moving from Mexico. She’d made a life for herself and her two boys by opening a beauty salon, which remains closed since her arrest.

“It’s been a big shock and more stress for us,” Alexander said. “It’s hard figuring out what we are going to do.”

Garcia, 41, was being held at the Adelanto Detention Center, according to her sons, as she is finding ways to help others while being detained.

“We just recently found out that she’s volunteering at the center, helping people get a haircut,” Sofia Spencer, her niece, said.

Alexander and his 18-year-old brother said they are trying to stay strong while trying to make sense of what happened to their beloved mother.

“I love her, and I don’t want her to be sad,” the teenager said, hoping to reassure their mom that he and his brother are safe. “I will keep pursuing my dreams and goals. I wish she could see me accomplish them.”

Garcia’s sons do not know what will happen to her beauty salon, which has been shuttered for a month.

Many immigrant religious workers -- such as Catholic priests and nuns -- legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas.
""And this affects these religious workers,"" she said.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.","Some immigrant religious workers are facing legal limbo, and Catholic advocates are pushing the Trump administration to address the backlog in their visa category.

Many immigrant religious workers -- such as Catholic priests and nuns -- legally enter the country on R-1 non-immigrant religious worker visas. These are initially granted for a 30-month period, with one possible renewal allowing for a total of 5 years, so they can be in the U.S. to carry out ministry work. While within that window, they can apply for employment-based EB-4 status so they can legally remain in the U.S. without interruption.

""One of the challenges is that because the number of green cards that are issued every year is not representative of the number of people that are eligible, you've got huge backlogs,"" Erin Corcoran, an associate teaching professor and executive director of the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, told OSV News.

""And this affects these religious workers,"" she said.

That backlog could have a grave impact on the church in the U.S. The National Study of Catholic Priests -- released in 2022 by The Catholic University of America's Catholic Project -- indicated 24% of priests serving in the U.S. are foreign-born, with many of them also subject to visa renewals.

In April, bipartisan legislation, titled the Religious Workforce Protection Act, was introduced in the Senate by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and in the House by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Richard Neal, D-Mass. In statements at the time, Kaine and Collins both cited priest shortages in their states. All five of those members are Catholic.

If signed into law, the bill would permit religious workers already in the U.S. on temporary R-1 status with pending EB-4 applications to stay in the U.S. while waiting for permanent residency, Collins' office said at the time.

Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA and the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, also known as CLINIC, have backed the legislation.

A spokesperson for the USCCB told OSV News on Aug. 6, ""We're continuing our education efforts about the pressing need for the RWPA, and together with our interfaith partners, we're encouraging grassroots supporters to raise this issue with their members of Congress while they are back in their states/districts during the August recess.""

""We remain hopeful that Congress will have an opportunity to move the bill forward before the end of the year,"" the spokesperson said.

Corcoran said the legislation would allow, for example, a Catholic priest with temporary R-1 status, to move from one parish to another in accordance with diocesan needs without jeopardizing that status.

""For many religious workers, as part of your job or part of your vocation, you're going to be moving parishes right?"" she said. ""And under the current framework, you can't do that without jeopardizing your status.""

The bill, however, would not increase the limit on how many visas are granted.

""It's a very modest fix,"" she said. ""One of the things we've seen historically is that there are a lot of small, little fixes that could happen through legislation for these exact kinds of immigration dilemmas. But historically, Congress has always wanted to pass everything at once, so this provision has been put in comprehensive immigration reform bills in the past, but the problem is that there are other provisions in (broader immigration packages) that there can't be consensus on.""

Despite bipartisan support, it was not immediately clear what the prospects might be for the bill once lawmakers return from their August recess, or whether President Donald Trump would be willing to sign it.

The White House did not return a request for comment from OSV News by publication time on whether the Trump administration would support the bill.

But several proponents of the legislation who spoke with OSV News pointed to the bipartisan nature of the bill as cause for optimism.

Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute, a group that works to apply the perspective of Catholic social teaching in policy and practice to the U.S.-Mexico border region, told OSV News, ""Congress and the Trump administration have a good opportunity to make an urgent targeted fix to ensure clergy and religious from abroad serving our communities throughout the country don't become casualties of an increasingly broken immigration system.""

""Here the Biden administration really fumbled the ball. If we can get this done, the broader lesson can be that it really is possible to come together and find common ground to build an immigration system that is workable, efficient and meets our national needs,"" Corbett said.

Corcoran said, ""We've seen so little bipartisan solutions to problems, and to me, this is the kind of thing that this administration should be embracing, because it can show that they can be compassionate, that there are bipartisan solutions that are available for certain sub-populations within the immigration backlog, and that we all benefit, right, from these people being in our parishes.""

Advocacy for the bill comes as the Trump administration seeks to implement hardline immigration policies, including its pursuit of what it has called ""the largest deportation in U.S. history.""

However, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview that aired Aug. 7 with Raymond Arroyo on EWTN's ""The World Over,"" that the administration is trying to ""create its own standalone process"" for religious workers, instead of having them conflated with other immigration categories.

""And I've been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well,"" Rubio said. ""And it's not only the Catholic Church. I mean, our other places are being impacted by it but we're trying to streamline that process.""

""We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others,"" Rubio said, adding, ""We don't want to read headlines that some Catholic Church had to close because it couldn't get their priests here ... some order closed because some nun couldn't get here. So we're not interested in that. That's really not the aim here. It's more caught up in the structure of it. We'll have a plan to fix it. We're working on it. We know it's an issue, and we're committed to fixing it.""

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges.
The First Step Act does not provide grounds for courts to write a prohibition on considering disparities in § 924(c) sentences into § 3582(c)(1)(a).
The court below was wrong to prohibit the sentencing judges from considering major changes in the law that result in sentencing disparities solely based on when a person was sentenced, and the Supreme Court should reverse.","Drawing on a centuries-long tradition of granting wide discretion to judges when imposing sentences, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows federal judges to reduce a previously imposed sentence when they conclude that there are “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to do so. Petitioners in these cases moved for reductions in their sentences under the Sentencing Reform Act because of significant difference between the sentences they are serving and the sentences that they would have received if they were sentenced for those same offenses today.

The petitioners are serving federal sentences under § 924(c), which criminalizes the use of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking or a crime of violence. When they were initially sentenced under § 924(c), the law required judges to impose a 25-year minimum sentence for each § 924(c) violation after the first, even if the defendant was convicted for both violations at the same time. Because this interpretation led to sentences that many judges felt were unjust, Congress enacted the First Step Act to clarify that judges are not required to impose these sorts of stacked sentences when sentencing first-time offenders. If the petitioners had been sentenced after the First Step Act’s enactment, their sentences would have been significantly shorter.

According to the court below, the sentencing judges in the petitioners’ cases could not consider the decades-long disparity between the petitioners’ sentences and those of individuals who commit similar crimes today when assessing whether “extraordinary and compelling reasons” exist for a sentence reduction. In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.

The text of § 3582(c)(1)(A) of the Sentencing Reform Act gives judges broad discretion to determine the existence of “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for a sentence reduction. The statute contains only one instruction about the scope of judges’ authority to assess the “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release: courts must abide by the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements. And in tasking the Sentencing Commission with providing guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling reasons,” it provides only one stipulation: “[r]ehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.” The clear inference is that other reasons are permissible within a judge’s discretion.

Congress’s use of the phrase “extraordinary and compelling” bears this out. In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent. The plain language of the statute indicates that the sentencing judge should make an individualized assessment of the case, considering all relevant factors, to decide whether there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce the individual’s sentence, and no factors other than rehabilitation alone should be categorically excluded. Legal dictionaries and case law at the time reinforce this definition.

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges. Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, courts imposed the sentence, but parole officers exercised absolute discretion over the actual duration of imprisonment. Congress felt that the system of indeterminate sentencing had unjustified consequences, like creating uncertainty as to the time an offender would actually spend in prison, producing serious disparities between sentences imposed for similar offenses, and letting parole boards usurp the function of the judiciary. In response to these concerns, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the federal sentencing scheme, creating a more structured system with a compassionate release provision acting as a “safety valve” in unusual cases. Lawmakers described this safety valve authority as a response to judges’ requests for the power to deal with what one congressman described as “the very exceptional situation where someone obviously slips through the cracks and gets a much longer sentence.” In granting judges this “safety valve” authority, Congress ensured that they would have the same broad discretion to consider a wide variety of different factors that parole officials had enjoyed under the previous regime.

The First Step Act does not provide grounds for courts to write a prohibition on considering disparities in § 924(c) sentences into § 3582(c)(1)(a). In 2018, Congress enacted the First Step Act, which “clarif[ied]” that district court judges are not required to impose stacked 25-year sentences when sentencing first-time offenders under § 924(c) and provided that these amendments “shall apply to any offense that was committed before” the First Step Act’s enactment. According to the court below, courts cannot consider the fact of the First Step Act’s change to § 924(c) in the compassionate release eligibility context because doing so would “sow conflict within the statute.” This is wrong. Though the First Step Act provided that “the changes to the § 924(c) mandatory minimums would not apply to people who had already been sentenced,” considering the fact of an amended penalty when assessing whether “extraordinary and compelling reasons” exist for a sentence reduction is not the same as applying the amended penalty. A sentence reduction is not an application of the First Step Act at all—if that were the case, the court would not need to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for the reduction. The history of parole and other “safety valve” mechanisms also makes clear that disparities between the penalty a defendant received and those applied to people who committed similar offenses can be considered under § 3582(C)(1)(A). Indeed, this history illustrates that parole decisionmakers were responsive to changes in how society perceived an offense over time, meaning that disparities produced by Congress’s decision to reduce a penalty would be especially relevant to their decisions.

Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.
Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.
Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said.","Washington’s police department chief said Trump’s move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle playing out Friday showed the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican presidential administration that exists in its midst. Trump’s takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

Washington’s top legal official was pushing in court Friday to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation’s capital.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” Conflicting commands and confusion about who’s in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said.

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief’s duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump’s authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district’s lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from the federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president’s role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump’s takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

At a Friday afternoon hearing for the District’s request for a temporary restraining order against sidelining Smith, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes indicated the law likely doesn’t allow the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said in court that the move to sideline Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

Washington’s top legal official was pushing in court to reverse U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s order Thursday to put the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of Washington police.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the president’s role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes. He wrote in court filings that the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.”

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond to the new policies. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing through the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting a specific individual. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

“I always feel safe in every quadrant and every ward of this city,” said Anthony Leak, a lifelong Washingtonian. He attended the Nationals game Thursday and said he didn’t think the presence of federal agents meaningfully changed the regularly rowdy scene of sports fans and lively bars.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters for a rally, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

The order, handed down Tuesday, blocks HHS from sharing data on Medicaid enrollees in these states with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the purpose of targeting migrants for deportation.

""Using CMS data for immigration enforcement threatens to significantly disrupt the operation of Medicaid—a program that Congress has deemed critical for the provision of health coverage to the nation’s most vulnerable residents,"" Chhabria wrote.

CALIFORNIA SUES TRUMP ADMIN AGAIN, THIS TIME OVER MEDICAID DATA TRANSFER TO DHS

The judge wrote that while there is nothing ""categorically unlawful"" about DHS collecting data from other agencies for immigration enforcement purposes, ICE has had a policy against using Medicaid data for that reason for 12 years.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has also long maintained a policy of using patients' personal information only to run its healthcare programs.

""Given these policies, and given that the various players in the Medicaid system have relied on them, it was incumbent upon the agencies to carry out a reasoned decision-making process before changing them,"" Chhabria wrote, adding: ""The record in this case strongly suggests that no such process occurred.""

Chhabria said the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until HHS provides ""reasoned decision-making"" for its new policy of sharing data with immigration officials or until litigation concludes.

The disclosure of Medicaid data is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to give DHS more data to help locate migrants and carry out the president's mass deportation plan. In May, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with ICE officials.

BIDEN-APPOINTED JUDGE HALTS TRUMP HHS OVERHAUL AFTER DEMOCRAT-LED LAWSUIT

""The Trump Administration’s move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement upended longstanding policy protections without notice or consideration for the consequences,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. ""As the President continues to overstep his authority in his inhumane anti-immigrant crusade, this is a clear reminder that he remains bound by the law.""

HHS first provided the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees in June, prompting a lawsuit from the 20 states to block the new policy.

In July, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services entered into a new agreement that allowed DHS to have daily access to the personal data of the country's 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including their Social Security numbers and home address.

Neither agreement was announced publicly. HHS has insisted that its agreement with DHS is legal.

Medicaid officials had attempted to block the data transfer, but they were overruled by top advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Immigrants – both legal and illegal – are not authorized to enroll in the Medicaid program, which offers nearly free coverage for health services. However, under federal law, all states must offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that only covers lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including people who are not U.S. citizens.

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network identified the man as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala. He ran from a Home Depot in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began the operation Thursday morning, Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik said in a statement.

He was heading north across eastbound Interstate 210 when he stepped in front of an SUV going about 60 mph in the far-left lane, the California Highway Patrol said in a release, citing investigators. The vehicle’s right front end hit the man, who suffered major injuries and died at a hospital.

The person who ran onto the freeway was “not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,” the Department of Homeland Security told CNN in a statement. “We do not know their legal status. We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.”

Home Depot locations increasingly have become targets for immigration raids as the Trump administration amps up deportation operations as part of a broader crackdown. The home improvement retailer traditionally has been a place documented and undocumented day laborers gather to pick up jobs as roofers, painters and construction workers.

Thursday’s death followed that of a farmworker fatally injured in a fall during a chaotic ICE raid in July at a California cannabis facility. It also came as the Trump administration asks the Supreme Court to halt an order barring immigration authorities from stopping or arresting people in and near Los Angeles based solely on factors like what language speak or where they work.

At least 10 people were detained in the ICE operation in Monrovia, said California Assemblymember John Harabedian, whose district includes the city. He called the incident “frightening and chaotic,” adding in a statement:

“Raids like this do not make our streets safer – they terrorize families, instill fear, and put lives at risk.”

CNN has reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.

Home Depot wasn’t “notified that ICE activities are going to happen and we aren’t involved in the operations,” the retailer told CNN on Thursday.

“The crash, including circumstances surrounding how and why the pedestrian was on the freeway, remains under investigation by the CHP’s Baldwin Park Area,” the highway patrol said.

The National Day Laborer Organizing Network said it has connected with Valdés’ family to provide support following his death.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-21869160-189059-359-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-15 15:56:34.104937

Moving forward.” If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text START to 8788.","A woman who claims she was assaulted by her boyfriend is now in a detention center in Louisiana after he called the police to accuse her of assault and then contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and told them she didn’t have legal immigration status, the woman’s mother alleged to Noticias Telemundo.

In a separate case from April, a Salvadoran woman in Houston called 911 to report being a victim of domestic violence. Legal records reviewed by the Houston Chronicle indicate that police then called ICE.

The women’s stories are not unique, activists and experts tell Noticias Telemundo, explaining that in some cases abusers use immigration status to control or abuse their victims — who come from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Experts say victims are more fearful now amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and recent immigration raids.

Isaret Jeffers, founder of the Tree Collective, which supports farmworkers in the Tampa, Florida, area, said several undocumented women farmworkers have told her they’re enduring abuse from their partners for fear that reporting them will lead to their deportation.

Isabel Martínez, manager of the social services program at the Tahirih Justice Center, focused on helping victims of gender-based violence, said women fear that “not only will nothing happen to the abuser, but now I will have to be deported, or be detained, or get into trouble if I call the police.”

Since January, Martínez said, women have told her organization that they’d decided they couldn’t call the police and were too afraid to call the group because they feared it would have to call the police and report the abuse.

“Since the deportations began and they’re targeting people more severely, that’s where we’ve seen people become more afraid,” Martínez said. “They’re thinking twice about reporting.”

Though women represent 84% of victims of spousal abuse and 86% of victims of intimate partner abuse, according to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Statistics, anyone can be a victim of abuse, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation or national origin.

Fear of reporting — and deadly consequences

Immigrant victims’ fear of reporting crimes against them is not new. As early as 2019, the Tahirih Justice Center said its social workers had observed that women often refused to report gender-based violence for fear of deportation.

In a national survey released by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors this June, 76% of immigrant advocates reported that victims of domestic violence were afraid to call the police for fear of ICE. It also found that half of immigration advocates had worked with immigrants who had dropped their criminal or civil cases for fear of deportation.

A similar study of two U.S. hospital emergency departments (one in San Francisco and one in Oakland, California) found almost 1 in 5 (19%) domestic violence victims avoided going to the police for fear that the police would report them to immigration authorities.

Francesco Duberli, CEO and founder of Survivors Pathway, a Miami-based center that offers counseling and legal help for survivors of domestic violence, sexual abuse and human trafficking, said that “what we’re seeing is an exaggerated, and also very sad, increase in the psychological aspect of being terrified of immigration authorities.”

ICE reopened the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office, created during Trump’s first administration. Its main focus is to provide help to victims of crimes perpetrated by immigrants and to “acknowledge and serve the needs of victims and families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration violations,” according to its website.

Under one of the “frequently asked questions,” it states that it “provides releasable information to all victims of crime with a nexus to immigration, regardless of the immigration status of the victim.” Noticias Telemundo contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security about the office, but didn’t receive a response. VOICE said it did not have a spokesperson available and referred any questions to its website.

A failure to report domestic abuse can have fatal consequences: More than 50% of homicides committed by intimate partners were preceded by violence, and in cases where the victim is a woman, the figure rises to 75%, according to studies by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In Houston, an immigrant woman who is not being identified because she fears reprisals told Noticias Telemundo of a November 2024 incident in which she felt her life was in danger. She recalled clutching the steering wheel while driving as her partner was grabbing it and threatening to kill her. She said the man, who is her child’s father and had been drinking, poured a drink on her and then punched her in the stomach and later in the head, rendering her unconscious for a time.

She said she later drove to a friend’s house, called the police and reported the violence. The police arrested him, and upon his release from jail on that charge, he was detained by ICE and eventually deported. In November, following the violent episode, the woman, a Mexican immigrant, applied for a U visa for victims of crimes such as domestic violence, and is awaiting its approval.

Immigrant victims' challenges, risks

Certain factors make it hard for immigrant victims of domestic violence to leave or report their abusive situations, including being financially dependent on their abuser and having children who depend on them.

The Houston woman’s partner threatened to take away her son, and the stress affected both her and her baby. “That was the saddest part of this whole process,” the woman said. “He was a baby, he was a 1 1/2-year-old. If I didn’t eat, he didn’t want to eat either. He knew when I was sad. He knew when I was crying. And you say, ‘How could such a little person know I’m sick?’”

Leaving a partner and filing a complaint with the court system “requires reflection and asking, ‘What’s going to happen next? How do I pay the rent? How do I feed my children?’” said Duberli, of Survivors Pathway. If the children belong to the abuser, he can file for legal custody, which can cost thousands of dollars.

“It’s a conglomeration of socioeconomic and psychological factors, and when you put them all together, you realize they become an immense wall that prevents immigrants from seeking justice,” he said.

Low-income women have a higher incidence of domestic violence. Of the women who sought legal assistance after experiencing intimate partner violence, 85% lived at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to a 2024 study by the University of Cambridge.

Victims also fear that their partner will attack them further if they report it, or they feel ashamed and believe they’re to blame for their situation. A key factor, according to therapists, is victims’ self-esteem: As the Texas immigrant woman described it, “Feeling like you’re nobody” as psychological abuse escalates, with taunts like “What are you going to do without me?” and “How are you going to get ahead?” she said.

Some victims have suffered abuse in home countries where domestic violence is more normalized and they’re used to abusers having impunity, Duberli said.

Martínez, of the Tahirih Justice Center, said the first step to leaving an abusive relationship is to break the strong psychological control the perpetrator can have over the victim. “You don’t deserve abuse,” she said.

It’s also common for immigrant victims to lack a support network of family or friends in a country with a foreign culture and language.

Some immigrants face greater risk if they rely on an abusive spouse to obtain legal status, as the American Immigration Council (AIC) has stated on its website, since abusers can use immigration status as a “tool to silence their victims” and may delay, withdraw or fail to file petitions for their relatives or threaten to report them to authorities.

Emergency exits: The U visa and the VAWA petition

For victims of violent crimes such as domestic abuse who can demonstrate cooperation with authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the crime, there is the U visa. If approved, the applicant receives a work permit valid for four years, and after three years, they can apply for permanent residence (green card).

However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently told Noticias Telemundo that “a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.”

Duberli said victims can also file a petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Those who file a complaint, Duberli explains, can continue their immigration process without the abuser’s involvement or knowledge.

In the case of the Texas immigrant woman, she cooperated with authorities regarding the crime, a key step to getting her U visa status approved and regularized.

For now, the woman said, “I continue working on myself, on my self-esteem — I continue with everything. Moving forward.”

Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey revealed the denials to attorneys for Sydney Lori Reid and later granted their request to remove all bond conditions and release her on her own recognizance over prosecutors’ objections. He will resume a preliminary hearing on Friday afternoon to determine whether to dismiss the case entirely.

“Two presentations to the grand jury returned no bill both times,” Harvey said. “Suggesting the evidence is wanting, given the standard for indictment is probable cause. Suggesting the government may never get an indictment.”

Grand juries are tasked with deciding only whether there is a reasonable basis to support charging someone with a crime – a much lower burden for prosecutors than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of criminal juries – and typically make their decisions after hearing evidence only from the government. At the federal level, grand juries return indictments, or “true bills,” in the vast majority of cases.

Reid, 44, was charged last month with an enhanced felony version of an assault charge that requires inflicting bodily injury on a federal officer and carries a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The charge is the same offense filed this week against a former DOJ employee accused of throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent.

In a press release last month, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office accused Reid of trying to impede the transfer of two alleged members of the 18th Street gang who were being arrested by ICE outside the D.C. Jail prior to transfer to the custody of the FBI.

Federal prosecutors declined to call the injured FBI agent or any of the ICE officers involved in the incident during Thursday’s hearing, however. Instead, they had an investigator with the U.S. Attorney’s Office testify about his review of video of the incident and brief conversations with the officers. The investigator, Special Agent Sean Ricardi, said he’d had no involvement in the case until he was asked to prepare for testimony Thursday morning.

Video played by prosecutors shows Reid approaching the ICE officers while holding up her phone, which she says is for her protection. She is then later seen being held by multiple officers against a wall while she asks, “How do you feel about stealing f***ing people?”

“Mind your own business!” an unidentified ICE agent can be heard responding.

Ricardi said while officers were attempting to control her, Reid’s “flailing arm movements made contact” with the FBI agent. No injury is shown on the videos played in court, although prosecutors submitted photographs of the agent with small abrasions on the back of her hand, which Ricardi said did not appear to be present prior to the incident.

Eugene Ohm, an assistant federal public defender representing Reid, said prosecutors were presenting the court with nothing but “hearsay” from an investigator who wasn’t present. He asked Harvey to review the grand jury testimony himself before ruling on probable cause, although Harvey declined.

“We should be able to get to the bottom of why all the citizens of the District of Columbia seem to think there’s no crime while the government continues to allege one against my client,” Ohm said.

Because Reid is charged with a felony, under federal law, prosecutors must secure an indictment within 30 days of her arrest. That clock was paused temporarily until Thursday’s hearing, but is now running. Following a rejection by a grand jury, prosecutors can attempt again to seek an indictment as many times as they want with Pirro’s permission. Alternatively, they could charge Reid with a lower-level misdemeanor offense that does not require indictment.

Harvey ordered the parties to return to court on Friday afternoon to resume the preliminary hearing. Reid’s attorneys have asked him to decline to find probable cause and dismiss the case against her entirely.",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/cd6fa579-b53f-4738-9b1c-53130bb410e5/20250506T205125/cd6fa579-b53f-4738-9b1c-53130bb410e5_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 13:57:18.842299

Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen those without criminal histories targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their political advocacy.
The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency.
The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.","Four years have passed since Hanifa Girowal fled Afghanistan on a US evacuation flight. But every August, her mind returns to the same place.

Like many Afghans evacuated amid the August 15 Taliban takeover of Kabul, Girowal, who worked in human rights under the former Afghan government, still remains stuck in “legal limbo” in the United States. She is steadfastly pursuing a more stable status in the US, even as the political landscape surrounding her, and thousands of other Afghans in similar situations, shifts.

“I somehow feel like I’m still stuck in August 2021 and all the other Augusts in between, I can’t remember anything about them,” Girowal told Al Jazeera.

She often recalls the mad dash amid a crush of bodies at the crowded Kabul International Airport: people shot in front of her, a week of hiding, a flight to Qatar, then Germany and then finally, the US state of Virginia.

Followed by the early days of trying to begin a new life from the fragments of the old.

“Everything just comes up again to the surface, and it’s like reliving that trauma we went through, and we have been trying to heal from since that day,” she said.

The struggle may have become familiar, but her disquiet has been heightened since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20. His hardline immigration policies have touched nearly every immigrant community in the US, underscoring vulnerabilities for anyone on a precarious legal status.

There is a feeling that anything could happen, from one day to the next.

“I have an approved asylum case, which gives a certain level of protection, but we still don’t know the future of certain policies on immigration,” Girowal said. “I am very much fearful that I can be subjected to deportation at any time.”

Four years after the US withdrawal, much remains unclear about how Trump’s policies will affect Afghans who are already in the US, estimated to total about 180,000.

They arrived through a tangle of different avenues, including 75,000 flown in on evacuation flights in the immediate aftermath of the withdrawal, as the administration of US President Joe Biden undertook what it dubbed “Operation Allies Welcome“. Thousands more have since sought asylum by making treacherous journeys across the world to traverse the US southern border.

Some have relocated via so-called Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs), reserved for individuals who worked directly with the US military in Afghanistan, under a notoriously backlogged programme.

Others have been resettled through a special State Department programme, known as Priority 1 (P1) and Priority 2 (P2), launched by the administration of President Biden, meant for Afghans who face persecution for having worked in various capacities on behalf of the US government or with a US-based organisation in Afghanistan.

Adam Bates, a supervisory policy counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Programme, explained that some of those pathways, most notably the SIV and refugee programmes, provide a clear course towards US residency and, eventually, citizenship.

But, he clarified, others do not – a fact that advocates have warned leaves members of the population subject to perpetual uncertainty and political whims.

“A lot of the advocacy to the Biden administration officials was about finding more permanent legal pathways for Afghans,” Bates told Al Jazeera. “That was with one eye towards the potential of giving the Trump administration this opportunity to really double down and target this community.”

Pressure on Afghans in the US

During Trump’s new term, his administration has taken several concrete – and at times contradictory – moves that affect Afghans living in the US.

It ended “temporary protected status” (TPS) for Afghans already in the country at the time of the Taliban takeover, arguing the country shows “an improved security situation” and “stabilising economy”, a claim contradicted by several human rights reports.

At the same time, the Trump administration added Afghanistan to a new travel ban list, restricting visas for Afghans, saying such admissions broadly run counter to US “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism”.

These actions underscore that “the situation in Afghanistan seems to be whatever it needs to be, from the Trump administration’s perspective,” according to Bates.

Trump has offered his contradictory messaging, criticising the Biden administration on the campaign trail for its handling of the withdrawal, and as recently as July, pledging to “save” evacuated Afghans subject to deportation from the United Arab Emirates.

Meanwhile, the administration terminated a special status for those who entered the US via the CBP One app in April, potentially affecting thousands of Afghans who entered via the southern border.

Advocates warn that many more Afghans may soon be facing another legal cliff. After being evacuated in 2021, tens of thousands of Afghans were granted humanitarian parole, a temporary status that allowed them to legally live and work in the US for two years, with an extension granted in 2023. That programme is soon set to end.

While many granted the status have since sought other legal avenues, most often applying for asylum or SIVs, an unknown number could be rendered undocumented and subject to deportation when the extension ends. Legislation creating a clearer pathway to citizenship has languished in Congress for years.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not publicly released how many evacuated Afghans remain in the US on humanitarian parole, and did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for the data.

Evacuated Afghans’ unease has been compounded by Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has increasingly seen those without criminal histories targeted for deportations and permanent residents targeted for their political advocacy.

“It’s just an escalation across the board and a compounding of fear and instability in this community,” Bates said. “It’s hard to make life decisions if you aren’t sure what’s going to happen tomorrow or next week or in a year”.

‘Pulled the rug out’

Meanwhile, for the thousands of Afghans continuing to seek safety in the US from abroad, pathways have been severely constricted or have become completely blocked.

The Trump administration has paused asylum claims at the US southern border, citing a national emergency. It has almost completely suspended the US Refugee Program (USRAP), allowing only a trickle of new refugees in amid an ongoing legal challenge by rights groups.

Advocates say the special P1 and P2 programme created for Afghan refugees appears to have been completely halted under Trump. The administration has not published refugee admission numbers since taking office, and did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for data.

“It feels as if we have pulled the rug out from many of our Afghan allies through these policy changes that strip legal protection for many Afghans in the US and limit pathways for Afghans who are still abroad to come to the US safely,” Kristyn Peck, the chief executive officer of the Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, told Al Jazeera.

She noted that the SIV pipeline has continued to operate under Trump, although there have been some limitations, including requiring those approved for relocation to pay for their own travel.

Meanwhile, resettlement agencies like Lutheran have been forced to seriously curtail their operations following a stop-work order from the administration on January 24. As of March, Peck said, the organisation has been forced to let go of about 120 of its staff.

Susan Antolin, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women, a non-profit organisation that offers mental health, legal and social support to Afghans in the US, said organisations like hers are also bracing for sustained uncertainty.

“We are diversifying our funding and trying very hard, as so many other organisations are, to find other avenues to bring in that funding to continue to support our programmes,” she told Al Jazeera. “As organisations that deal with this kind of work, we have to step up. We have to do 10 times more, or 100 times more, of the work.”

‘No more a priority for the world’

The unstable situation in the US reflects a broader global trend.

The Taliban government, despite promising reforms in a push for international recognition, has continued to be accused of widespread human rights abuses and revenge killings. Still, it has upgraded diplomatic ties with several governments in recent years, and in July, Russia became the first country to formally recognise the group as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

At the same time, the governments of Pakistan and Iran have accelerated expulsions of Afghans back to Afghanistan, with more than 1.4 million Afghans either being expelled or leaving Iran alone from January to July of 2025, according to UNHCR.

The Reuters news agency also reported in July that the UAE had notified Washington that it had begun returning evacuated Afghans.

Germany, too, has begun deporting Afghans back to Afghanistan, in July, it conducted its second deportation flight since the Taliban came to power, despite continuing not to recognise or maintain diplomatic ties with the group.

The collective moves send a clear message, evacuee Girowal said: “We know that Afghanistan is no more a priority for the world.”

Still, she said she has not abandoned hope that the US under Trump’s leadership will “not forget its allies”.

“I know the resilience of our own Afghan community. We are trained to be resilient wherever we are and fight back as much as we can,” she said.

“That’s one thing that gives me hope.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21237791720218.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-15 11:58:33.996728

O'Loughlin has spent 60 years advocating for immigrant rights in South Florida, including legal battles and founding the Guatemala-Mayan Center.

The mass serves as a peaceful protest against conditions at the detention center and part of O'Loughlin's 60th Jubilee.

O'Loughlin has a history of activism, including suing the U.S. government and winning a lawsuit against Chiquita Brands International.

He criticizes the Trump and DeSantis administrations' immigration policies for separating families and harming communities.

LAKE WORTH BEACH — Frank O'Loughlin has never been a typical Catholic priest.

Instead of preaching from a pulpit, the 83-year-old Irish immigrant has devoted the past 60 years of his life to taking his fight for immigrants rights to the streets of South Florida and even the U.S. Supreme Court.

But on Saturday, Aug. 16, he'll celebrate the most prominent Mass of his career at a location that has drawn attention worldwide: the shadow of Alligator Alcatraz in the Everglades, where he will call attention to the plight of the immigrants held there as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented residents.

It's part of O'Loughlin's 60th Jubilee, a time when priests reflect and recommit to their calling. The founder of the Guatemala-Mayan Center in Lake Worth Beach said the Mass will serve as a peaceful protest against to the reported conditions of the people detained in the center.

""This is the dismantling of the U.S.A. to which I came when I was 23 years old,” said O'Loughlin, who was arrested once in 1991 for sneaking into the barracks of injured sugarcane workers in Belle Glade to inform them of their rights and prevent them from getting deported.

""When you protest you are standing up for someone and the mass at the detention center is not simply a protest, it's an affirmation of faith.”

O'Loughlin — even non-Catholics call him Father Frank — found his place among the immigrant communities across South Florida, where he has become a symbol of hope. Some call him a hero, others tout him of being a saint but O'Loughlin sees himself as a peacemaker and an activist.

""I’d rather be a doer than a preacher,” O'Loughlin said.

It's 1965: A 23-year-old Irish priest arrives in South Florida

O'Loughlin was born and raised in a tight Catholic community in Ennistymon, Ireland. Growing up, he excelled in math and science and after high school graduation he was set to study accounting with a full ride scholarship.

The last weeks of exams, O'Loughlin told the headmaster and his family he wanted to enroll in the seminary. To his surprise, the headmaster said he already knew O'Loughlin would go into priesthood from an essay he had written as a student.

To his relief, his parents, who were Catholics but somewhat anti-clerical, also supported his decision. ""My dad just very quietly said, 'Be a good priest',"" O'Loughlin recalled.

From the beginning, O'Loughlin said he knew he didn't want to be like the traditional, serious and at times intimidating priests in his town. When he was offered the opportunity to move thousands of miles away to South Florida as a missionary, he took it.

In 1965, he arrived in Miami at age 23 during a time of unrest in America. He was assigned to Holy Name of Jesus, a church along Military Trial in suburban West Palm Beach that remains open 60 years later.

There was so much to get used to in the Sunshine State. Accustomed to cool summers, O'Loughlin felt hot and sweaty. The humidity made Bible pages stick together and caused mildew to grow on shoes he left in the closet. Two years after his arrival, air conditioning revolutionized South Florida, O'Loughlin said.

O'Loughlin said he learned the reality of living in Florida through the renowned Edward Murrow documentary ""Harvest of Shame."" The CBS special exposed the working and living conditions of farmworkers in Belle Glade.

O'Loughlin said he was horrified by the stories of the immigrant families in his congregation that recounted how they escaped violence in their home countries, their dangerous journeys to reach the U.S. and their tough, long days of picking in the fields, all to give their children a better life.

O'Loughlin learned Spanish and Creole to talk with farmworkers in Belle Glade, Indiantown and northern Palm Beach County. He became their advocate and took it upon himself to find them legal representation.

""There is no way migrant workers can progress unless they are organized,” O'Loughlin said. ""You need to have unity to counter the strength of their employers and strength among the workers.""

During the 1970s, O'Loughlin was sent to St. John the Apostle Catholic Parish in Hialeah. There, he organized his first boycott of supermarkets that bought produce from farms where workers had protested their labor conditions. He marched with Cesar Chavez to organize farmworkers and demand better working conditions and wages.

He returned to Palm Beach County as the priest at the Cathedral of St. Ignatius Loyola in Palm Beach Gardens, where he established the first Spanish-language Mass and Hispanic ministry. He said he duplicated that model at many of the other churches where he has served.

The Spanish masses quickly filled up, O'Loughlin said. And he saw how they created diverse communities of immigrants from Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala who came together to pray and help each other.

""I remember from the very beginning hearing from Spanish-speaking people, 'There are two things you do in Spanish: You say your prayers and you make love,'"" O'Loughlin said with a laugh.

O'Loughlin launches education, housing programs for migrant workers

During his time in Palm Beach Gardens, O'Loughlin led the effort to launch multiple projects to improve access to jobs, education and housing opportunities to immigrant workers. His mission: Give farmworker families, who moved between work sites, a sense of stability.

He co-founded Indiantown's Hope Rural School, which serves immigrant children. He also helped organize a sewing co-op that employed female migrants who learned to sew from a group of nuns.

O'Loughlin said one of his biggest accomplishments came the day he welcomed families into the New Hope Community, a neighborhood in Indiantown for immigrant workers 25 miles northwest of Jupiter.

""I'm looking at this man, I put the keys in his hand and now for the first time he could give his daughters a safe home,"" O'Loughlin said. ""It was a glorious experience. I could see it like it was last night.""

Then in 1985, O'Loughlin had a heart attack. A year later, he suffered a second one, which robbed him of the deep voice he often used to sing at church.

Undeterred, O'Loughlin took the lead of the Migration and Refugee Service of the Archdiocese of Palm Beach.

""All my life I've been saying to Floridians, when you meet a farmworker and shake his hand, you are meeting a hero,"" O'Loughlin said.

How Father Frank started the Guatemalan-Mayan Center in Lake Worth

When the first Mayans arrived to Palm Beach County, O'Loughlin was the first to received a call. The families belonged to indigenous tribes in Central America, but nobody knew where they came from or what language they spoke.

O'Loughlin set out to find out their origins, studying their factions, language and handmade clothing. He learned the Mayans had fled civil war in Guatemala, the first groups spoke Kʼicheʼ. Then their problems rose to another level of seriousness.

In 1990, a doctor at St. Mary's Medical Center alerted O'Loughlin that the neonatal unit was overwhelmed with babies born with deficiencies and deformities stemming from the lack of prenatal care from mothers exposed to pesticides while working in the fields.

In 1992, O'Loughlin founded The Guatemalan-Mayan Center with volunteers who were tasked with going into farmworker communities to offer mothers free prenatal care. During the past 30 years, the nonprofit has become a crucial resource for Palm Beach County's growing immigrant population.

It helps families access social services, has a food pantry and operates the ""Escuelita Maya"" VPK, preschool and after-school programs. The center still provides medical services through its ""Clinica Maya,"" which offers free prenatal care, dental care and health screenings.

It also offers ParentChild+, pairing families with early learning specialists that make in-home visits. And it works with Legal Aid Services to provide representation for clients when needed.

Amid the COVID pandemic, O'Loughlin helped farmworkers get access to COVID-19 vaccines and said public prayers for them. The center, on Lake Worth Road, also hosted testing sites that served thousands in the county.

Maria De La Guardia, a counselor at the Guatemalan-Mayan Center, says the center has allowed immigrants to preserve and celebrate their culture while also receiving the tools they need to succeed in the U.S. A member of O'Loughlin's youth group in Hialeah, she calls it ""a river of abundance in the middle of a drought.""

""Father Frank doesn't preach the religion. He lives the religion,"" she said. ""That is why we are all here.""

In 1991, Father Frank took a case to the Supreme Court and won

In 1991, O'Loughlin sued the U.S. Department of Labor to extend a legal status for the undocumented workers that worked in South Florida's larger farms. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court and the judges sided with O'Loughlin, granting legal status to all the workers represented in the lawsuit status as seasonal agricultural workers.

""It was beautiful. They had been vindicated,” O'Loughlin said. ""They had been legalized.”

That afternoon, O'Loughlin and Jean Juste, founder of the Miami-Based Haitian Refugee Center, walked down the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court in triumph. Then they stormed into pubs where law students discussed the case.

Years later, O'Loughlin sought to sue the U.S. Labor Department, again. This time, to win the same the protections but for sugarcane workers.

""When you walk in to a bishop and you say and 'I want to sue the federal government,' it's not exactly smooth,” O'Loughlin said with a chuckle.

""Let me tell you how it affects the people … ,"" O'Loughlin recalled making his case. ""He would always cave in when I said that.”

This time, state prosecutors argued O'Loughlin lacked standing to represent the workers because he had never sliced sugar canes stalks or worked in the field. A federal court ruled otherwise.

A federal judge in Washington D.C. found O'Loughlin was so closely associated with the workers and identified so much with their cause, he had enough standing to continue pursuing the case.

O'Loughlin's team however, lost the case. Judges determined sugar was not considered a foodstuff because it is not a perishable crop, a requirement to grant them status as seasonal agricultural workers.

""That was really a setback,"" O'Loughlin said. ""And the sugarcane workers never got any relief.”

In 2024, O'Loughin was part of the team that won a $38 million lawsuit against Chiquita Brands International for funding Colombian terrorists who killed men in the South American country. The 16-year case marked the first time an American jury has found a major U.S. corporation liable for human-rights abuses committed abroad.

""My memory of people that I did sign up, I often worried about them, felt guilty about the regret that I seemed to promise them something and never delivered,"" said O'Loughin, whose work has won human rights awards from organizations such as Americans for Immigrant Justice and the National Association of Social Workers.

""But now, we were delivering.""

Mass at Alligator Alcatraz to let people pray outside detention fence

O'Loughlin said the Mass outside Alligator Alcatraz, which begins at 10:30 a.m. will allow him to lead those who gather at the site, 35 miles from Naples and 70 from Miami along the Tamiami Trail, to pray for all those held there ""outside the detention fence."" Many are undocumented, and some are on the verge of deportation to their home nations.

He said the Trump and DeSantis crackdowns on undocumented workers, even those not suspected of crimes in the U.S., are undermining the years of work it took to create a support network for immigrants in South Florida.

He has seen the pain firsthand. A female farmworker he has helped for more than 18 years was deported in June. She attended a routine immigration appointment and was given 60 days to exit the country, leaving behind a U.S.-born son who lives with disabilities.

“How can you turn away that woman who has been a constant contributor to the community in which she lives?"" O'Loughlin asked. ""It's an incomprehensible hatred of people.”

The now 83-year-old priest has been outspoken against Trump's rhetoric describing immigrants as criminals. He hopes the Mass reminds people of all spiritual beliefs about the importance of being empathetic to one another.

""We have failed,"" he said, invoking the Book of Genesis, ""to persuade MAGA that they are talking about persons: moms, dads, children, bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh.""

The company has hired 130 employees, including 75 detention officers, and plans to hire more.

Legal battles between CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth continue, with the company facing a temporary injunction.

The detention center's reopening has sparked protests and national media attention.

Seemingly undeterred by legal setbacks, private prison company CoreCivic is on a hiring spree to staff a Leavenworth, Kansas, detention center that currently has no detainees.

It’s been two months since a Kansas court temporarily blocked the company from reopening the former private prison. The city of Leavenworth sought the order because CoreCivic has not obtained a special use permit — a requirement the company rejects.

There is no clear end in sight for those legal proceedings. Yet CoreCivic shows every sign that it intends to fulfill its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to hold up to 1,000 federal detainees in Leavenworth.

Echoing the company’s rebrand from the Corrections Corporation of America in 2016, the sign in front of Leavenworth’s former maximum-security prison has been replaced. The complex of gray and beige blocks is now called the “Midwest Regional Reception Center,” or MRRC, which reflects its potential role as a central hub for President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts.

Besides the sign switch, CoreCivic has paid for roof repairs and run ads for jobs at the new facility. Job listings run the gamut from administrative clerk positions ($17.75 per hour) to a lead psychiatrist (up to $300,000 per year).

“I’m very confused by that,” said Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman after a court hearing related to the facility on Wednesday. “What are they paying them to do?”

Why is CoreCivic hiring?

In an email to the Kansas News Service, CoreCivic spokesperson Ryan Gustin said the company has hired 130 people so far, including 75 detention officers, at the MRRC.

That’s out of over 2,300 applicants, Gustin said. He expects the facility to employ 300 people once it’s fully operational.

Pay for correctional officers, which make up the lion’s share of the facility’s staff, starts at $28.25 per hour. The company is offering to pay a $3,000 signing bonus for those who are hired from August through October.

But until the legal battle between CoreCivic and the city of Leavenworth reaches a resolution, detention officers will not have any detainees to watch.

“Our hiring and training efforts continue at MRRC while we pursue all the avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Gustin said. “Doing so better prepares us to serve our government partners at ICE.”

Gustin said rank-and-file detention officers undergo 200 hours of training. He said CoreCivic will continue paying them post-training — even if there are no detainees at the MRRC.

Federal audits and former employees blamed understaffing and insufficient training for dire conditions at the facility in years past. Before, it housed pre-trial federal inmates for the U.S. Marshals Service, or USMS.

The former Leavenworth Detention Center shuttered at the end of 2021. An executive order by then-President Joe Biden caused many federal contracts with private prisons to expire.

For years, the facility had been mired in reports of mismanagement and abuse. Former staff and inmates said they saw preventable drug use, injury and death on a regular basis — problems exacerbated by chronic understaffing, according to a 2017 review by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Gustin said in a previous email to the Kansas News Service that most issues with safety and staffing were concentrated during an 18-month period coinciding with the pandemic.

Gustin said CoreCivic trains its employees at or above federal standards, though guidelines for ICE differ in some ways from those of the USMS.

The court of law

While activity flourishes at the facility, legal cases surrounding it slog through the courts.

The latest hearing was Aug. 6. CoreCivic’s attorneys asked Leavenworth County District Judge John Bryant to unblock the company from holding detainees in Leavenworth.

That would represent a reversal of a temporary injunction Bryant placed on the company less than a month prior. He did not make an immediate decision in the court hearing.

One possible sticking point: CoreCivic also plans to challenge Bryant’s block in the Kansas Court of Appeals. That could raise confusing questions of jurisdiction between the district and appellate courts.

Meanwhile, the company has filed a separate lawsuit against the city. It argues Leavenworth officials unlawfully revoked CoreCivic’s permission to use its facility as a prison. Bryant discussed combining the lawsuits for simplicity.

Joe Hatley, an attorney for the city of Leavenworth, said he expects the legal knot will take many months — and dollars — to untangle.

“Trials are expensive and lengthy and bothersome for everybody involved,” Hatley said in an interview.

CoreCivic revealed in legal filings that they miss out on $4.2 million every month that the courts keep them from fulfilling their contract with ICE. Hatley did not want to speculate as to why the company would continue setting up shop despite the legal uncertainty.“If they want to spend money hiring people and doing all that, that's their money,” he said.

The court of public opinion

Even without substantial changes in the legal fight, attention has continued to snowball in the conflict between the historic prison town and a multi-billion dollar private prison corporation.

National outlets have sent correspondents to northeast Kansas to cover what is, legally speaking, a mundane dispute over local development regulations. Protests against CoreCivic draw crowds of 40 or 50, greater than when the controversy began this spring.But some in the Leavenworth community have voiced support for CoreCivic reopening its steel doors. Republican state Rep. Pat Proctor, whose district overlaps with the city, said in an email that the MRRC would be part of a national immigration agenda he favors.

“CoreCivic’s new facility fulfills a critical need for detention space, as DHS struggles to manage a huge operation, deporting the millions of illegal immigrants that flooded our country through Joe Biden's open borders,” he said.

The company presents itself as an economic boon for Leavenworth. In addition to providing hundreds of jobs, the company said it will give the city a one-time impact payment of $1 million, $400,000 per year in recurring impact payments and over $1,000,000 in annual property taxes.

Proctor said his last hang-up was the possibility that the MRRC would poach staff from the nearby Lansing Correctional Facility. But in the latest state budget, the Kansas Legislature approved more than $4.1 million to cover a pay differential when the MRRC opens.

CoreCivic has also donated $10,000 each to local chapters of organizations like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Salvation Army.

“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying,” Warden Misty Mackey said in an April press release, “potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth.”

While courts have momentarily foiled CoreCivic’s ambitions in Kansas, federal immigration authorities have been able to use a different facility down the road.

The lockup run by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, called FCI Leavenworth, has an agreement with ICE to detain immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union said in May that those detainees are held in “crowded, unsanitary conditions” and that some have attempted suicide.

Since Trump took office in January, Leavenworth has landed in the middle of a national push for, and outcry against, the deportation of millions of people living in the country without full legal status.

Outside of the Leavenworth County District Court before an Aug. 6 hearing on the CoreCivic case, dozens of protesters heard speeches through tall black speakers.

A few passing cars honked in support. But during remarks by Anne Parelkar, a former immigration attorney who is now running as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate in Kansas, a goateed man stormed out of the courthouse.

“They’re here illegally,” he yelled.

A protester holding a sign that read “no human is illegal” tried to continue arguing with the man, but others dissuaded him.

“Not all of them,” Parelkar said to the man, and returned to her speech.

“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything's 45 minutes from everything. It's a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history. The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials' continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.

The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.

ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”

Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.

Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.

“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”

Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that's the only accusation, in my mind that's pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.

The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.

After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.

Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”

Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.

In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.

“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/EMbIID5gTXPpEsVMP_hWF124zRkMPmYSKD1hgZ-MxII/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC94MGd3dmVmZnFj/d2gyeWhxbDhnenFr/bmc1MmR5L3Byb21v/XzI1MDgxNS1JTU1J/R05BVElPTi1MT1ct/TEVWRUwtSGVjdG9y/LmpwZw,N,,2025-08-15 11:59:20.174974

Behind that number is an incipient human rights crisis.

While the Trump administration waited for massive new detention centers to open, it turned to federal prisons and jails, hastily constructed state facilities, and temporary holding cells that were never meant to house people for any extended amount of time.

The overcrowding, combined with negligence and malevolence, has led to inevitable abuses that are too large to ignore or deny.

On August 12, a federal judge ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to drastically improve conditions in migrant holding cells in its New York City offices, where detainees were kept in overcrowded, squalid cells for days and even weeks at a time.

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered officials to provide more spacious cells, bedding for each detainee, adequate hygiene supplies, three meals a day and water on request, and access to calls with lawyers. The order was in response to a lawsuit filed by an ICE detainee, who alleged he and other detainees were not given access to medical care or showers and were kept in cells so crowded that they didn't have space to lie down.

Another federal judge found similar deficiencies in a temporary ICE holding facility in Los Angeles, ruling in July that plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the government were likely to succeed on their claims that detainees there were being unconstitutionally denied legal access.

A report published July 30 by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D–Ga.) identified 510 ""credible reports"" of human rights abuses against individuals held in the archipelago of federal lockups, county jails, and military bases that comprise the Trump administration's mass deportation program.

""Among these reports are 41 credible reports of physical and sexual abuse of individuals in U.S. immigration detention, 14 credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 credible reports of mistreatment of children,"" Ossoff's office wrote.

In one case reported to the senator's office, a woman in ICE custody ""was pregnant and bled for days before facility staff would take her to a hospital. Once she was there, she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.""

The Ossoff report also mentions poor conditions at Federal Detention Center (FDC) Miami, a jail operated by the Bureau of Prisons that holds immigration detainees.

Investigations earlier this year by Reason and the Miami Herald uncovered overcrowding, lack of access to lawyers and phone calls, and major dysfunction inside the facility. A separate July report by several human rights and legal aid groups on abuses inside South Florida detention centers included an incident at a Miami center where officers allegedly made men wait hours for lunch and then forced them to eat with their hands shackled behind their backs.

""We had to bend over and eat off the chairs with our mouths, like dogs,"" Harpinder Chauhan, a British entrepreneur who was detained by ICE this spring, told the researchers.

These conditions prevail in detention facilities across Florida. A former detainee at the Krome Detention Center in Miami-Dade County, whose lawyer requested that he only be identified as ""A.S.,"" told Reason he spent four days in an overcrowded holding cell with 50 to 60 other people.

""There was a dude, he passed out. He was crying for his medicine for like two or three days,"" A.S. says. ""They didn't give him his medicine until he finally passed out, right before they were gonna put him on the plane.""

Likewise, stories of lack of legal access, horrid living conditions, medical neglect, and brutality have been flooding out of ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" the Everglades detention camp built by the State of Florida.

These sorts of abuses aren't exclusive to the Trump administration; they're a feature of mass detention. During the Biden administration, Reason obtained whistleblower audio recordings from a tent camp for migrant youths inside the Fort Bliss Army base in Texas. In the recordings, officials frankly discussed filthy conditions, lack of medical care, and inappropriate staff contact with minors.

The Trump administration's reaction, though, has not been to slow down its deportation efforts, but to supercharge them.

But that tone changed late Thursday after Ms. Bondi issued an order rescinding the city’s policing policies governing immigration enforcement.
The city’s lawsuit argues that this order was a violation of the Home Rule Act, which does not grant presidents “operational control” over the police.
A federal judge ruled that the deployment was unconstitutional, but an appeals court disagreed, arguing that the president had acted within his authority.
President Trump has said he will seek from Congress “long-term extensions” of his control over the D.C. police.","The District of Columbia government filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the Trump administration’s “brazen usurpation” of the city’s authority by trying to take control of the D.C. Police Department, in a marked escalation of tensions between local and federal authorities in the nation’s capital.

The suit argues that both President Trump’s executive order on Monday federalizing the Police Department and a follow-up order by Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, “far exceed” the president’s authority under the Home Rule Act of 1973, which granted D.C. its limited degree of self-government.

Such an attempt to “upend the command structure of the Police Department” risks “endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers alike,” the suit says, using the Trump administration’s argument for public safety against it.

The suit asks the court for an injunction against Ms. Bondi’s order and a declaration that the administration’s actions are unconstitutional and a violation of the Home Rule Act.

Mr. Schwalb, a Democrat who was elected in 2022, has been outspoken from the outset in criticizing the federal takeover of the D.C. police and the deployment of the National Guard, calling the moves “unnecessary and unlawful.”

In a statement on Friday morning, Mr. Schwalb said that the administration was “abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the district’s right to self-governance and putting the safety of D.C. residents and visitors at risk.”

“This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the district has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” he said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mayor Muriel Bowser had been, for the most part, diplomatic in her comments this week. But that tone changed late Thursday after Ms. Bondi issued an order rescinding the city’s policing policies governing immigration enforcement. That order also declared that Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was now the “emergency police commissioner,” with “all the powers and duties” invested in the city’s police chief, Pamela A. Smith.

Mr. Schwalb issued a legal opinion saying that Ms. Bondi’s order was “unlawful,” and that the mayor was “not legally obligated to follow it.” Ms. Bowser posted the letter on social media, saying that the city had followed the law but that “there is no statute that conveys the district’s personnel authority to a federal official.” The lawsuit, which lists Mr. Trump, Ms. Bondi and Mr. Cole as defendants, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and the D.E.A., expands upon that opinion.

Mr. Trump’s executive order was based on a section of the Home Rule Act that explicitly gives presidents temporary authority to “direct the mayor to provide him” such services of deemed “necessary and appropriate” to address “special conditions of an emergency nature.”

That order declared a “crime emergency” in the city, and in announcing the order, Mr. Trump said that he was “placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police under direct federal control.” While Ms. Bowser later that day acknowledged that the president had the authority to order the services of the Metropolitan Police, she said that Chief Smith was still in command.

But on Thursday, Ms. Bondi issued her order installing Mr. Cole in command of the police.

The city’s lawsuit argues that this order was a violation of the Home Rule Act, which does not grant presidents “operational control” over the police. It also says that the law limits presidents to using the police for “federal purposes,” not the managing enforcement of local laws. The suit challenged that the emergency the president cited to justify his order was overly broad, saying it refers to crime in general, “and declining crime at that.”

The president’s executive order on Monday said that crime in D.C. had “a dire impact on the federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests.”

The suit is the latest attempt by local jurisdictions to push back legally at the administration’s broad assertion of federal power.

The state of California sued the Trump administration after the president deployed thousands of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles this summer, after protests broke out against aggressive immigration enforcement. A federal judge ruled that the deployment was unconstitutional, but an appeals court disagreed, arguing that the president had acted within his authority. While most of the soldiers have returned home, that litigation is ongoing.

Washington is in a different position, given the many limitations on its autonomy under federal law.

The section of the Home Rule Act giving the president some authority over the local police says that this authority terminates after the end of the declared emergency, an act of Congress or a period of 30 days, whichever comes first. President Trump has said he will seek from Congress “long-term extensions” of his control over the D.C. police.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/HFO-nat-dc-lawsuit-trump-kbct/HFO-nat-dc-lawsuit-trump-kbct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:59:24.630444

""I am a very involved friend,"" Victoria Besancon said. Besancon said when she didn't hear anything from Shaw that evening, or the next morning, she knew something had gone wrong during Shaw's trip to Vancouver.

""We didn't know where she was; her lawyer figured she was in one of the two family facilities,"" Besancon said. ""I started Googling and calling the facilities until I got some kind of answer.""

Shaw and her six-year-old son, Isaac, were detained at the South Texas ICE Processing Center in Dilley, Texas. That facility is one of the few family detention centers in the country.

""Had Sarah been able to be detained here in Tacoma, her lawyer would have had a much easier time representing her; things would have moved a lot more quickly,"" Besancon said.

Shaw's lawyer said a simple clerical error is to blame for Shaw's visa issue. However, although her son Isaac's documents were in correct order, they were detained together anyway.

""Isaac has spent his entire summer locked in a detention facility despite having all of his paperwork done properly; it's been devastating,"" Besancon added. ""I would say, given the situation, he's doing the best as you can hope. Sarah honestly used all her commissary to get him ice cream, coloring pencils, anything to make him feel like he's at home. They have one play station in a community of about 60 children, so they all took turns ferociously trying to play with that.""

Besancon reiterated Shaw has no criminal history, and said she believes border officials could have helped Shaw correct the visa issue on the spot.

It’s unclear how quickly a judge will act, but the emergency nature of the filing could lead to proceedings as soon as Friday.

The suit is the biggest pushback from city officials since Trump invoked a provision of the Home Rule Act — the 1970s law that allows for limited self-governance by Washington’s government — that allows the president to direct the Metropolitan Police Department’s services to address “special conditions of an emergency nature.”

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee known for her take-no-prisoners approach from the bench. Reyes, most notably, blocked Trump’s transgender military ban before her injunction was paused by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Amid the litigation, the Justice Department filed a complaint against Reyes for her pointed comments to government attorneys — though she at times also praised their advocacy and made similarly pointed comments to lawyers for the transgender service members.

In a declaration accompanying the city’s bid for an immediate restraining order, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said the administration’s gambit is “endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers.”

“In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive.”

The suit underscores that no president in history has invoked the authority to manage the city’s police department. And the city’s lawyers say the president’s power to do so requires cooperation between city officials and the federal government, not a hostile takeover.

Bondi on Thursday issued an order that directed Drug Enforcement Administration head Terry Cole to assume “all the powers and duties” of the city’s police chief as the new “Emergency Police Commissioner,” “effective immediately.”

Bondi’s order also purported to rescind or suspend several Washington police orders — including one issued by Smith earlier on Thursday that allowed for limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and Schwalb — both Democrats elected by Washington residents — insisted late Thursday that Bondi could not legally disrupt the typical chain of command for MPD officers by requiring them to report to Cole.

“Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” Schwalb wrote in a letter Thursday to Smith that was circulated by Bowser. “Regardless of the Bondi order, no official other than you may exercise all the powers and duties of the Chief of Police.”

A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump on Monday issued an executive order invoking the Home Rule Act, insisting that the District was overrun by violence. He also deployed the National Guard to the city.

But before Bondi’s order Thursday looking to replace the MPD chief, city officials have largely limited their criticism of the Trump administration, noting that Washington was in a fairly unique situation that gave the federal government broad powers and authorities.

“The feds have an outsize role in D.C., we all know that,” Bowser told POLITICO Wednesday morning. “Right now, having a surge of officers enhances our MPD forces on a temporary basis. We’re going to stay focused on hiring more MPD or, when this temporary surge is over, figuring out more permanent partnerships to tap into when we need a surge of officers.”

But Trump’s Monday press conference went far beyond what his executive order said, with the president saying his administration would “take our capital back.”

“Giving us additional resources is a good thing, but that’s also quite different than federalizing our police force,” D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson said Wednesday in an interview. “Donald Trump is not going to tell our police how to police.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Fca%2F779951fd452cbd8ba3b34c85ae99%2Fdistrict-of-columbia-97352.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 11:58:23.345717

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

CBP releases July data showing migration hitting new low at the border: Due to the unavailability of asylum and word of a growing crackdown throughout the U.S. interior, the number of migrants entering CBP custody at the border in July fell again, to a level not seen since the 1960s. Zero asylum seekers were released from custody at the border, while Border Patrol’s El Paso Sector saw the most migrant apprehensions. Fentanyl seizures continue to decline sharply, while cocaine seizures are rising.

Notes on “mass deportation”: DHS made striking, and hard-to-verify, claims about the number of undocumented migrants choosing to leave the United States voluntarily, and the number of people signing up for employment with ICE. Some of the agency’s online recruitment messaging evoked 20th-century White supremacist themes. Several controversies, including growing public health concerns, surrounded the Florida state migrant detention facility in the Everglades.

Notes from Mexico: The New York Times followed fentanyl smugglers and found evidence of corruption on both sides of the border. Groups that preyed on migrants in Ciudad Juárez are now preying on the local population and getting more involved in street drug sales. A migrant “caravan” in Chiapas does not seek to reach the United States but intends only to gain the right to live and work elsewhere in Mexico.

THE FULL UPDATE:

CBP releases July data showing migration hitting new low at the border

Migration

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported another decrease from June to July in the number of migrants its agents and officers encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border. With a near-total ban on asylum access still in place and a growing climate of fear among migrants living in the U.S. interior, numbers are at 60-year lows.

Border Patrol apprehended 4,601 migrants between ports of entry (official border crossings) at the U.S.-Mexico border in July, or 148 per day, down from 6,070 (202 per day) in June and 8,723 (291 per day) in May, and down sharply from 56,400 (1,880 per day) in July 2024.

Data table

Sixty-seven percent of Border Patrol’s apprehended migrants in July were citizens of Mexico, similar to June (68 percent). That is far higher than the 35 percent share of the apprehended migrant population that has come from Mexico since fiscal 2020. Eighty-seven percent of Border Patrol’s July apprehensions were of citizens of Mexico or northern Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador), much more than those nations’ 61 percent share since fiscal 2020.

CBP’s statement noted that Border Patrol did not release a single asylum seeker or other migrant into the U.S. interior with parole or a notice to appear in July. There have been no such releases since April. All apprehended migrants were detained, deported, or, in the case of unaccompanied minors, sent to the Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Border Patrol’s apprehensions of family unit members and unaccompanied minors fell 16 percent from June to July, from 917 to 770 (17 percent of all apprehensions), and by 48 percent from May (1,468). Eighty percent of parents and children (both accompanied and unaccompanied) entering Border Patrol custody in July were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, up from 58 percent since fiscal 2020.

Data table

Overall, CBP—which combines Border Patrol agents operating between ports of entry and Field Operations officers operating at the ports of entry—took 7,842 people into custody in July, down from 9,304 in June and 12,449 in May, and down sharply from 104,100 in July 2024. The July 2024 figure had included 45,210 people with CBP One appointments at ports of entry—a program that no longer exists.

Data table

Migrants encountered at the ports of entry remained few in July, as the Trump administration stopped using the CBP One smartphone app to help asylum seekers make appointments. CBP’s port of entry encounters totaled 3,231 people or 104 per day in May, down from a nearly identical 3,234 in June, 3,726 in May, and 47,700 in July 2024.

Data table

Ninety-four percent of migrants encountered at ports of entry in July were citizens of Mexico, similar to 92 percent in June and 93 percent in May. Only 191 in July and 245 in June were from elsewhere.

Of the nine geographic sectors into which Border Patrol divides the border, El Paso, which includes far west Texas and all of New Mexico, was the number one sector for migrant apprehensions for the sixth straight month. The El Paso sector’s 1,099 apprehensions were 24 percent of the July total, similar to 27 percent in June. The Rio Grande Valley Sector (Texas, 951) was second, followed by the Tucson Sector (Arizona, 671), and the San Diego Sector (California, 555).

Data table

Drug seizures

CBP’s July releases also included data about illegal drugs seized at the border. It showed a continued slide in the agency’s seizures of fentanyl. Ten months into fiscal year 2025, fentanyl seizures are on pace to end the year 45 percent below 2024 levels and 56 percent below 2023.

Data table

Seizures of cocaine, however, are up significantly, on pace to rise 36 percent over 2024 levels and 50 percent over 2023.

Data table

Seizures of methamphetamine have been less volatile. They are on pace to drop 9 percent from 2024 levels, which would be 18 percent above 2023.

Notes on “Mass Deportation”

ICE recruitment

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on August 12 that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) received 100,000 job applications in the previous two weeks. “New hires will be eligible for a one-time bonus of up to $50,000” and “up to $60,000 in student loan repayment,” the Washington Examiner recalled. There is no way to independently verify that claim, or to predict how many applicants would clear background checks and other recruitment criteria.

DHS also announced on August 6 that ICE is doing away with age restrictions for recruits. Until now, recruits had to be at least 21 years old and no older than 37 or 40, depending on the role. Now they can be as young as 18, and there is no upper age limit. In coverage at the Bulwark, Adrian Carrasquillo raised the specter of “gun-toting, masked teenagers with minimal training and experience… swarming restaurants, shops, factories, churches, and homes looking for immigrants.”

On August 11 DHS posted an ICE recruitment message to Twitter with an image of Uncle Sam and the text “Which way, American man?” This closely parallels the 1978 book Which Way Western Man? by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist writer. That book includes virulently antisemitic prose, some of which is cited in Simpson’s Wikipedia entry.

That further moves the boundaries of DHS’s growing use of right-wing meme imagery on social media. Wired reported on the DHS communications team’s often cruel and mocking online messaging using pop-culture references to tout its crackdown on undocumented immigrants. “Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.”

CBP Home and voluntary deportations

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on August 8 that more than 1 million undocumented migrants have departed the United States of their own volition since President Trump’s term began. This number, too, is impossible to verify. “We’ve seen a complete lack of transparency when it comes to immigration from this administration,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona) told the Washington Examiner when questioned about Noem’s claim.

A DHS spokesperson told the Examiner that “So far, tens of thousands” of undocumented people have used the “CBP Home” smartphone app to “self-deport,” a method that purports to help fund airfare along with a $1,000 payment. “Last time I looked, it was about 7,000” people who had used the app, White House “Border Czar” Tom Homan told reporters, the Examiner noted. “That was weeks ago.”

Meanwhile, the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Survey claims that the population of foreign-born people in the United States dropped by 2.2 million during the first six months of this year. Experts interviewed by USA Today cast doubt on this estimate, noting this survey’s small sample size and the likelihood that many immigrants are refusing to participate out of fear.

Deported Venezuelans in Venezuela

Since January, the United States has deported more than 10,000 Venezuelan citizens back to Caracas, EFE reported. There, according to the Associated Press, most migrants are struggling, often saddled with debt and not earning enough to pull them out of poverty despite working two or more jobs. “Some migrants enrolled in beauty and pastry schools or became food delivery drivers after being deported. Others already immigrated to Spain. Many sought loan sharks.”

Venezuelans deported to third countries

The Trump administration has sent another 2,900 citizens of Venezuela to third countries so far this year, according to a Miami Herald analysis of data obtained by the University of California, Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project. Venezuelan citizens make up two out of every five migrants who have been sent to third countries, often Mexico.

Once in Mexico, “They’re put on buses and told they’re going to an office to apply for asylum in Mexico, but that never happens,” South Florida-based immigration attorney Elizabeth Amaran told the Herald. “When they arrive, Mexican officials tell them there’s no such process and just give them a 10-day pass to leave. They can’t go north, they can’t stay. They’re trapped.”

Retroactive credible fear interviews

NPR reported that “dozens of immigrants across the U.S. have received letters in the mail notifying them that their asylum cases have been dismissed” and that they must apply all over again. The stated reason is that when they entered the United States at the border during the pandemic or at times of high migration, they did not receive initial screening through credible fear interviews. As they reapply for such interviews or await further instructions, these asylum seekers no longer have work authorizations and are stuck in limbo.

Judge rules on New York holding facility

Responding to a lawsuit from the ACLU and Make the Road New York, a federal judge ruled on August 12 that ICE had to improve conditions and place limits on detention in a holding facility inside the 26 Federal Plaza building in downtown Manhattan, which has been the subject of many reports of migrants forced to endure extended stays in inhumane, crowded, inadequate circumstances. The Justice Department’s lawyer’s statement conceded that those circumstances have included, as CBS News reported, detainees given only blankets with which to sleep on floors, only two meals per day, toilets amid sleeping areas, no in-person visitations even by attorneys, and no access to needed medications.

The City relayed reports of far worse: “A 20-year-old high school student forced to wear blood-soaked clothing for days when Immigration and Customs Enforcement failed to provide her a maxi pad. Dozens of people crammed in a room so tightly they had to try to sleep sitting up. A man who watched another prisoner have a seizure for a half an hour before medical help came.”

Long detention times even after cases end

At Beyond the Border, Kate Morrissey reported that ICE detention centers have a growing population of people who have already agreed to be deported, but have remained confined for months with no clear end in sight. Many are from nations, like Ecuador or Mexico, whose governments place few limits on the number of deported people they accept.

Flores settlement agreement challenged

Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the 28-year-old Flores settlement agreement governing CBP’s treatment of children in custody, heard arguments on August 8 about the Trump administration’s ongoing legal effort to dissolve the agreement. Gee sounded skeptical, asking the government’s attorney to explain why, at a time of historically low CBP migrant apprehensions, the agency has been holding children for more than 72 hours—something that the Flores agreement only allows under exigent circumstances.

Detained population

Data published by ICE on August 14 revealed that the agency’s detained population is now a record 59,380. Of that total, 30 percent have prior criminal convictions, 25 percent face charges, and 45 percent have no criminal record.

Florida detention center

That total still does not include those being held in the facility that Florida’s state government has established in the Everglades swamp west of Miami.

On August 7, a federal judge ordered a two-week freeze to new construction at that facility as she considers whether its existence in the ecologically fragile Everglades violates environmental laws. A scientist testified that recent construction has added at least 20 acres of asphalt to the site.

The New York Times and Miami New Times reported on the case of Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez, a 38-year-old Venezuelan man detained in the Florida facility. According to accounts from detainees, after Mr. Rivas fainted in his cell, guards “left him lying on the floor” and did not seem to know even how to check his pulse. Mr. Rivas eventually recovered—perhaps due to CPR administered by a detainee who had been a nurse in Cuba. This case mainly came to light because, as Rivas has 250,000 followers on Instagram, his sister appealed on the platform to Florida authorities to produce his body after she hadn’t heard from him for two days.

The New Times reported that Mr. Rivas suffered from a respiratory infection, and raised concerns about a possible COVID outbreak in the Florida facility. While “cases across Miami-Dade and Broward counties have increased by more than 50 percent from June to July,” New Times reporter Alex DeLuca could not get Florida officials to confirm or deny whether the disease is prevalent in the facility, despite repeated attempts.

“We are all sick in this jail. Some are worse than others, it is an emergency,” Rivas said in a statement from his attorneys. “They are treating us like dogs, like animals.”

Last week, more than a month after the facility opened, Florida’s state government and ICE “signed an updated agreement spelling out how state corrections officials should handle federal immigration detainees at non-correctional facilities,” the Associated Press reported. A federal judge had demanded to see a document indicating, among other things, whether the state or the federal government had custody of the people detained in the facility.

Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, told reporters on August 11 that 81 Mexican citizens were being held in the Florida facility. “Obviously, we are not in agreement with these detention sites, which are run by the states,” Sheinbaum added. Diplomatically, we are working so they stay there the least number of days.”

The state government of Tennessee plans to use a closed prison in the town of Mason as a detention center in coordination with ICE and private contractor CoreCivic, the Washington Examiner reported. “The redesigned facility will hire 240 employees, and pay starts at $26.50 per hour.” Indiana, too, plans to open a 1,000-person migrant detention facility.

Sen. Kelly’s tweet

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) posted to Twitter about an August 7 visit to Arizona’s Eloy ICE detention facility, where he met a woman named María. “She’s been in the U.S. for twenty years. Has no criminal history. She was detained at the Marine Base in Yuma. Her son is a U.S. Marine stationed there. He’s married to another Marine. And they have a two-year-old kid, Maria’s grandson. Maria was in Yuma because her son was leaving for training, her daughter-in-law had a hip surgery, and so they needed help watching her grandson. When she came back to the base after a grocery run, she was detained and reported to CBP. Now, she’s being held in an ICE facility.”

POGO on congressional access

David Janovsky of the Project on Government Oversight’s Constitution Project detailed the steps that ICE has taken to avoid congressional oversight, including delaying and circumscribing congressional visits in defiance of written law. This, Janovsky concluded, “puts the situation in stark relief: The agency is hiding abuses from Congress and the public.”

Restaurant raid in Pennsylvania

Video appeared to show ICE agents raiding restaurants outside Pittsburgh, emptying an establishment’s walk-in refrigerator, and loading food into their vehicles. Emiliano’s Mexican Restaurant issued a statement denouncing that ICE “tore through our spaces… Our kitchens were flipped. Our walk-ins emptied. Food trashed. Doors broken. Lives shattered.”

Border Network’s abuse documentation campaign

Border Report profiled the work of the Border Network on Human Rights, an El Paso-based group that for 25 years has had volunteers survey residents about experiences of abuse and mistreatment at the hands of local law enforcement. For its latest abuse documentation campaign, BNHR “is setting up 30 tables near international ports of entry, in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with a high Hispanic or immigrant population from El Paso to Del Rio, Texas, and from Anthony, New Mexico, to Albuquerque.” They will report findings in October.

Meta smart glasses

404 Media reported that a CBP agent participating in a June 30 immigration raid outside a Los Angeles Home Depot was wearing AI-enabled “smart glasses” produced by Meta, the company that runs Facebook and Instagram. “Meta does not have a contract with CBP, and 404 Media was unable to confirm whether or not the agent recorded any video using the smart glasses at the raid.” The revelation still raises regulatory issues even if the agent wore the glasses, equipped with a camera and three microphones, for personal use.

Bakers found guilty of “harboring”

A federal jury in Brownsville, Texas found on August 13 that a couple who ran a beloved bakery in the nearby border town of Los Fresnos was guilty of “harboring undocumented workers,” a crime that could carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. “The case was one of the first brought against business owners as Immigration and Customs Enforcement was ramping up arrests of undocumented workers,” the New York Times reported. Critics noted that while large companies usually have to pay fines for hiring undocumented workers, this is an example of “mom and pop” business owners threatened with the greater penalty of imprisonment.

Essays and analyses

“This goes beyond simply getting ‘tough’ on immigration,” wrote Nayna Gupta of the American Immigration Council at MSNBC. “The administration is undertaking an unprecedented realignment of the federal government, turning it into a detention and deportation machine that threatens communities, upends legal norms and shakes the foundation of American democracy.”

Also at MSNBC, David Bier of the Cato Institute presented a recent data analysis finding a “shocking number of Latin American immigrants being arrested on the streets with no criminal convictions, no criminal charges and no deportation orders. Nothing that would have put them on the radar of DHS for removal. No reason to seek them out specifically.” Bier goes on to detail several disturbing recent episodes of DHS personnel roughing up U.S. citizens of Latino descent on U.S. streets.

Notes from Mexico

New York Times on fentanyl smuggling

Amid the decline in border fentanyl seizures discussed above, the August 10 New York Times published an in-depth investigation of how fentanyl smugglers are dealing with increased security. Despite obstacles like higher bribes, more checkpoints, more border security, and more seizures, “cartel operatives said the demand for fentanyl had not waned.” The article makes several mentions of corruption, including payments to Mexican security forces at checkpoints and the alleged role of a corrupt CBP officer at Arizona’s Mariposa port of entry in facilitating the arrival of a shipment in exchange for “tens of thousands of dollars.”

Ciudad Juárez

In Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso, a local official interviewed by InsightCrime estimated that criminal groups, often employing young people, were taking in about $100 million per month from smuggling migrants—and frequently kidnapping them for ransom—during the 2022-2024 migration increase. With the 2025 drop in migration at the border, these criminal groups are now making less money and turning their sights on the local population: the city saw a spike in kidnappings during the first half of the year.

WOLA and the Women’s Refugee Commission noted the same phenomenon in a dispatch from a recent visit to Ciudad Juárez, posted on August 11. Many whom we interviewed “reported that the kidnappings have become increasingly violent, with sexual assault and amputations becoming common means of extorting ransom.”

InsightCrime concluded that the kidnappings have begun to ebb amid a security crackdown and low profitability, and that criminal groups are now resorting to increased street-level drug sales to partially make up for the lost income from migrant smuggling and kidnapping. Still, investigator Victoria Dittmar noted, “migrant smuggling has not disappeared entirely,” and those who still try to cross are paying higher prices to smugglers.

Drone use

Axios reported on the increasing use of drones by law enforcement agencies on the U.S. side of the border, and by criminal groups on the Mexican side. Drones used by the Cochise County, Arizona Sheriff’s Department “have thermal imaging for search-and-rescue and nighttime operations,” while organized crime-operated drones can allegedly “fly for more than 45 minutes, reach more than 100 mph and carry more than 100 pounds.”

Chiapas caravan

More than 300 migrants from at least 12 countries continued a so-called “caravan” along the road leading away from Tapachula, Chiapas, a city near the Mexico-Guatemala border. “This time,” Milenio reported, “the migrants have indicated that the United States is not their destination and that they will seek to remain in Mexico City or reach Monterrey,” where they hope for more economic opportunity and faster processing of asylum claims or work permits. President Sheinbaum said that her government “will present options to the foreigners, such as repatriation to their countries of origin and the possibility of employment.”

A longtime migrant rights activist who accompanied this and previous caravans was released from prison following his arrest several days earlier. A judge determined that there wasn’t enough evidence to hold Luis García Villagrán, whom the Mexican government is accusing of helping migrants obtain false documents for a fee. Mexico’s attorney-general’s office is appealing.

“Luis’ arrest is not an isolated incident, but part of a systematic strategy that seeks to delegitimize the work of those who demand respect for human rights in the context of migration,” read an August 7 statement from the Southern Border Monitoring Collective, a coalition of local civil society organizations.

Cuban citizens stranded along the migration route

Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, David Adams profiled José Luis Tan Estrada, an independent journalist and professor who fled Camagüey, Cuba, only to find himself stranded in Mexico City by the Trump administration’s asylum shutdown, after traveling through 12 countries, including the Darién Gap.

CiberCuba reported that “the Cuban community in Nicaragua has been steadily increasing” as more are stranded in a country whose ruling regime does not require visas for arriving Cuban citizens. Cuban restaurants are opening all over Managua.

Remittances

The BBVA Foundation reported that remittances—money sent from people abroad to Mexico, mainly from the United States—have dropped 5.8 percent from the same period in 2024. Mexico could end the year with nearly $4 billion fewer total transfers. The drop “is due to a sum of factors led by a drastic change in migration policies in the United States,” Border Report reported.

Washington’s top legal official sought an emergency restraining order in federal court blocking a Trump administration move to put a federal official in charge of its police.
Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department.
Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.
Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

Washington’s police department chief said that a Trump administration order installing a federal official as its head would upend command structure and be a “dangerous” threat to law and order. Police Chief Pamela Smith’s statement came in a court filing as the city seeks to block the federal takeover of its police department in court.

Washington’s top legal official sought an emergency restraining order in federal court blocking a Trump administration move to put a federal official in charge of its police. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.""

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night that Drug Enforcement Administration boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city’s current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration’s unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday morning.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi’s directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city’s police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The district’s attorney general is an elected position and the city’s top legal officer. It’s separate from federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official.

Bondi’s directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District’s personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha’s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he’ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.’s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.

State Department Human Rights Report Scaled Back, Omits Details on Abuses in Politically Allied Countries

The US State Department on Tuesday released a pared-down version of its annual report meant to catalogue human rights concerns in countries around the world. The report covers the 2024 calendar year – before the Trump administration took office – and sources told CNN it was largely completed before the US president began his second term. However, it underwent significant revisions in the subsequent months. For some countries like El Salvador whose leaders are political allies of the Trump administration, there was far less criticism and detail about reports of their human rights abuses.

His death at a hospital was confirmed Thursday afternoon by Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik. The circumstances surrounding the fatal accident are under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.

Monrovia police received reports at 9:43 a.m. of immigration agents approaching the Home Depot, according to Feik, who said an officer observed possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the site.

In a emailed statement to The Times, the Department of Homeland Security said that “the individual was not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement” and that the agency was not aware of the freeway incident until hours after operations in the area had concluded.

A day laborer who asked that his name not be used, citing safety concerns, said he goes to the Monrovia Home Depot every day around 8 a.m. in search of work.

This morning started like any other, he said, until he heard people start to yell, “La migra, corre.” (“Immigration, run!”)

That’s when he took out his phone and started to record.

Although he avoided detention, he said he “felt powerless” that he couldn’t help his friends. “It feels horrible — I couldn’t do anything for them other than record what was happening.”

As workers scrambled away from the agents, one person fled the hardware store on foot, jumped a concrete wall and entered the eastbound 210 Freeway.

Just a few minutes later, Monrovia Fire & Rescue responded to a call of a vehicle collision with a pedestrian.

A motorist, Vincent Enriquez, said he saw the man soon after he was struck and he was still alive.

“By the time I was passing by ... he must’ve been struck no more than a few minutes prior,” said the driver. “He was still moving.”

The person was transported by ambulance to a hospital but did not survive his injuries.

“It just breaks my heart, because it’s just so inhumane,” said Robert Chao Romero, a UCLA professor of Chicano studies and Monrovia resident. “These horrible, unjust ICE policies led to someone dying.”

Monrovia resident Karen Suarez said she rushed to the Home Depot as soon as she heard about the raid and met the daughter of the man who was hit by a car.

“She was visibly very upset, and she was going to go to the hospital and try to find out about her dad,” Suarez said. “I feel so bad for her. I feel so bad for the families. These are people trying to escape whatever horrible atrocities they came from for a better life.”

At 6 p.m., a crowd of about 50 people rallied in front of the Home Depot, waving Mexican flags, carrying signs that read “ICE out of L.A.” and chanting, “When Trump says get back, we say fight back.”

A bouquet of flowers and two prayer candles were placed opposite the 210 Freeway as a memorial for the man who was killed.

CHP officers were asking for surveillance camera video from local businesses as part of their investigation into the incident.

Feik said in a statement that the city had not received any communication or information from ICE.

Palmira Figueroa, director of communications for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said 13 people were detained in the raid.

Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the network, said another day laborer was struck by what he believed was an immigration agent in a vehicle.

“His leg is very swollen, and he doesn’t want to go to the doctor because he’s afraid of going to the hospital right now,” Alvarado said.

When asked whether any of the immigration agents identified themselves or presented warrants, Alvarado said it wasn’t clear.

“They think that .. [Home Depot] is a good place where they can come to arrest as many people as they can and comply with their quotas, the quotas that the president, [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller are imposing on them.”

Romero, the UCLA professor, said the Home Depot operation appeared to be in violation of the federal court order barring the government from carrying out these types of raids. Last month, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents from carrying out indiscriminate immigration arrests based on a person’s race, language, vocation or location.

Immigrant rights advocates voiced their anger after Thursday’s fatality.

“We hold the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the Home Depot responsible for his death, and they must be held accountable,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps.

“This is a painful reminder for us that we must continue to boycott the Home Depot due to their complicity to the ICE raids at their stores,” he said. “The Home Depot and the agents that chased the man have blood on their hands.”

In July, Jaime Alanís Garcia, 57, was killed during an immigration raid at a farm in Ventura County. The circumstances of his death are still not fully clear, but it sparked concern among immigration advocates.

Alanís’ family said he was fleeing immigration agents at the Glass House Farms cannabis operation in Camarillo when he climbed atop a greenhouse and accidentally fell 30 feet, suffering catastrophic injury.

But the Department of Homeland Security said that Alanís was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.

The High Court held that the implicit withdrawal of the asylum claim was lawful and accepted the Home Secretary’s argument that changes made in 2023 were in fact “clarifications”. The case is R (Zoto) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWHC 2148 (Admin).

Background

The claimant came to the UK by boat on 29 June 2022 and was detained on entry. He claimed asylum the same day. He was referred to the National Referral Mechanism the following day for consideration of whether he was a victim of trafficking.

The claimant left his asylum accommodation on 2 July 2022. On 3 July 2022 his asylum claim was recorded as withdrawn by the Home Office, but no withdrawal decision was issued to his file.

On 5 July 2022 a positive reasonable grounds decision was made, the first in the two stage trafficking identification process. On 21 June 2023 a formal decision letter was issued to the claimant’s file stating that his asylum claim had been deemed implicitly withdrawn. The Home Office did not provide any evidence of attempts to contact the claimant, including by calling the mobile number they had for him.

On 1 November 2024 the claimant was encountered during a stop and search and was arrested. The claimant was subsequently convicted of possession with intent to supply a class A drug. He was sentenced to two years and nine months’ imprisonment and served with a stage one deportation notice letter.

On 16 October 2024 a negative conclusive grounds decision was made on his trafficking claim. A month later he was served with a deportation decision and on 27 November 2024 was served with a notice of intent to remove. Removal was scheduled for 12 December 2024.

The judicial review

A judicial review was issued on 3 December 2024. Interim relief was refused on 11 December 2024. The claimant sought permission to appeal from the Court of Appeal. Removal directions were cancelled at 9.14pm on 11 December 2024 and the appeal to the Court of Appeal was withdrawn by consent.

On 13 February 2025 permission was granted for the judicial review which was challenging the deportation decision and detention as being unlawful on the grounds that the claimant had an outstanding claim for asylum. The judge said that while it was not possible to have any sympathy for the claimant given his conduct, he was entitled to due process and:

Everything depends on whether the claimant had an outstanding asylum application at the date of the decisions to detain and remove him, and, because there is no doubt that the claimant did make an asylum claim, that in turn depends on whether the defendant’s decision to treat the asylum claim as implicitly withdrawn was lawful….

The court’s decision centred on the interpretation of paragraph 333C of the immigration rules at the time:

333C. If an application for asylum is withdrawn either explicitly or implicitly, consideration of it may be discontinued. An application will be treated as explicitly withdrawn if the applicant signs the relevant form provided by the Secretary of State. An application may be treated as impliedly withdrawn if an applicant leaves the United Kingdom without authorisation at any time prior to the conclusion of their asylum claim, or fails to complete an asylum questionnaire as requested by the Secretary of State, or fails to attend the personal interview as provided in paragraph 339NA of these Rules unless the applicant demonstrates within a reasonable time that that failure was due to circumstances beyond their control. The Secretary of State will indicate on the applicant’s asylum file that the application for asylum has been withdrawn and consideration of it has been discontinued.

The rules were amended effective from 7 August 2023 to widen the circumstances in which a claim could be treated as withdrawn. The claimant’s circumstances would have fallen within new paragraph 333C(b)(i) which says that a claim may be treated as withdrawn when the applicant “fails to maintain contact with the Home Office or provide up to date contact details as required by paragraph 358B of these Rules”. The disagreement between the parties in this case was whether the previous wording implicitly included this situation.

The new reasons for withdrawing claims had first been introduced in version 7 of the Home Office guidance “Withdrawing asylum claims” dated 5 May 2023.

The High Court got around the Alvi point by stating:

In the case of R (Alvi) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC 33, the Supreme Court made clear that as there is a statutory requirement in section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 that immigration rules must be laid before Parliament, it was not permissible for the Defendant to rely on any conditions (in that case a list of skilled occupations) which only appeared in an a supplementary Code of Practice which had not been laid before Parliament.

In the context of this case, the effect of the decision in Alvi is that the Defendant cannot rely on any additional criteria in the Guidance to supplement the scope of paragraph 333C. This does not mean however that the Defendant’s Guidance cannot throw some light on the intended meaning of the words in the Rules and the policy context and purpose which they were intended to address.

The court concluded that version 7.0 of the guidance “properly reflected the intended scope of paragraph 333C”. The judicial review was dismissed.

Conclusion

I raised concerns about these new reasons being added to the guidance but not to the rules in August 2023 and was of the view that it would not be lawful to rely on the new reasons prior to the rules change. I remain of that view and am still quite unconvinced by the High Court’s reasoning on this point, which included taking into account the fact that the Home Office had said that the changes to the immigration rules were made to “improve clarity”. To me, the use of those words seemed like an attempt by the Home Office to disguise the fact that significant changes were being made to the guidance before the rules, in breach of Alvi.

I don’t think it is too controversial to say that these are certainly not the facts I would have liked to see this argument first run on, as there will be many out there with far better merits. The need for due process regardless of personal circumstances is obviously an important one, and the court was careful to emphasise this, but the facts of these cases do still often have an impact.

It is easy to consider, for example, that the apparent failure on the part of the Home Office to attempt any contact before withdrawing the asylum claim may have been considered more significant in a different case. Knowing the litigation practices of the Home Office as I do, I wonder to what extent similar challenges with better facts have been settled to avoid them getting to this stage.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/royal-courts-of-justice-1-600x450.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 04:57:16.449361

Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho has urged immigration authorities not to conduct enforcement activity within a two-block radius around schools starting an hour before the school day begins and until one hour after it classes let out.

“Hungry children, children in fear, cannot learn well,” Carvalho said in a news conference.

He also announced a number of measures intended to protect students and families, including adding or altering bus routes to accommodate more students. The district is to distribute a family preparedness packet that includes know-your-rights information, emergency contact updates and tips on designating a backup caregiver in case a parent is detained.

The sprawling district, which covers more than two dozen cities, is the nation's second largest with more than 500,000 students. According to the teachers' union, 30,000 students are immigrants, and an estimated quarter of them are without legal status.

While immigration agents have not detained anyone inside a school, a 15-year-old boy was pulled from a car and handcuffed outside Arleta High School in northern Los Angeles on Monday, Carvalho said.

He had significant disabilities and was released after a bystander intervened in the case of “mistaken identity,” the superintendent said.

“This is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,” he added.

Administrators at two elementary schools previously denied entry to officials from the Department of Homeland Security in April, and immigration agents have been seen in vehicles outside schools.

DHS did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Carvalho said that while staffers and district police officers cannot interfere with immigration enforcement and do not have jurisdiction beyond school property, they have had conversations with federal agents parked in front of schools that resulted in them leaving.

The district is partnering with local law enforcement in some cities and forming a “rapid response” network to disseminate information about the presence of federal agents, he said.

Teachers say they are concerned some students might not show up the first day.

Lupe Carrasco Cardona, a high school social studies and English teacher at the Roybal Learning Center, said attendance saw a small dip in January when President Donald Trump took office.

The raids ramped up in June right before graduations, putting a damper on ceremonies. One raid at a Home Depot near MacArthur Park, an area with many immigrant families from Central America, took place the same morning as an 8th grade graduation at a nearby middle school.

“People were crying, for the actual graduation ceremony there were hardly any parents there,” Cardona said.

The next week, at her high school graduation, the school rented two buses to transport parents to the ceremony downtown. Ultimately many of the seats were empty, unlike other graduations.

One 11th grader, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be published because she is in the country without legal permission and fears being targeted, said she is afraid to return to school.

“Instead of feeling excited, really what I’m feeling is concern,” said Madelyn, a 17-year-old from Central America. “I am very, very scared, and there is a lot of pressure.”

She added that she takes public transportation to school but fears being targeted on the bus by immigration agents because of her skin color.

“We are simply young people with dreams who want to study, move forward and contribute to this country as well,” she said.

Madelyn joined a club that provides support and community for immigrant students and said she intends to persevere in that work.

“I plan to continue supporting other students who need it very much, even if I feel scared,” she said. “But I have to be brave.”

Some families who decide that the risk is too great to show up in-person have opted for online learning instead, according to Carvalho, with virtual enrollment up 7% this year.

The district has also contacted at least 10,000 parents and visited more than 800 families over the summer to provide information about resources like transportation, legal and financial support and are deploying 1,000 workers from the district's central office on the first day of classes to “critical areas” that have seen immigration raids.

“We want no one to stay home as a result of fears,” Carvalho said.

“Our leaders have to support our law enforcement.” Bondi’s letter asks the recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

Bondi’s letter asks the recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

Bondi cites an executive order issued by Donald Trump on 28 April which called for the attorney general to identify jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” then to “notify each sanctuary jurisdiction regarding its defiance of Federal immigration law enforcement and any potential violations of Federal criminal law” as a precursor to prosecution or withholding grants.

Each of the recipients appears to have received a near-identical letter, none of which specify what local laws or practices fail to comply with Bondi’s assertions.

Initial responses from state and local governments receiving the letters include a mix of incredulity and defiance.

“Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit,” said Barbara Pierce, director of communications for the city of Rochester, New York. “The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester. These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.

“We look forward to the opportunity to respond to attorney General Bondi’s letter, and continue to underscore the inaccuracies of the federal government’s position.”

Bruce Harrell, the Seattle mayor, said the letter’s portrayal of his city and its laws was untruthful.

“Immigration enforcement is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government. The city neither interferes with nor carries out those federal duties,” he said. “We have received and are reviewing the latest letter from Attorney General Bondi and strongly disagree with its assertions. Our laws and policies protect the safety, privacy and constitutional rights of all Seattle residents while remaining compliant with applicable law.

“We remain committed to our local values, including being a welcoming city for all. We will continue to defend our residents and our rights – and we will not hesitate to do so in court.”

The office of Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, a Trump ally and embattled re-election candidate, offered a less strident immediate response.

“The job of a mayor is to protect the safety of every single person in their city – and that’s exactly what Mayor Adams has worked to do every day for nearly four years,” said Kayla Altus, Adams’ press secretary. “Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows.

“That’s why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the city council, but he has also urged the council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to keep violent criminals off our streets.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ee23711d07648798bd098b5f3b2f8a1bc4ad55e/1104_0_8333_6667/master/8333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73977b10d584f94131e8432c6f7c7d23",N,,2025-08-15 03:56:47.397333

Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's ""emergency police commissioner"" with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume ""powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police."" The Metropolitan Police Department ""must receive approval from Commissioner Cole"" before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor.

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb responded late Thursday that Bondi's directive was ""unlawful,"" arguing that it could not be followed by the city's police force.

He said local officers must continue to follow Smith's orders under Schwalb's interpretation of the law, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that ""there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.""

Bondi's directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of ""sanctuary policies.""

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the administration has portrayed.

The late-night announcement came after an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement.

""That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,"" Trump said of Smith's order. ""That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that.""

A population already tense from days of ramp-up began seeing more significant shows of force across the city Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where, exactly, was often unclear.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park before and after a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. Drug Enforcement Administration agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers patrolled the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

A boost in police activity, federal and otherwise

For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

The response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.

Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

""They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital,"" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. ""The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.""

Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.

National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are ""protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.""

Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been diverted from priority assignments like counterterrorism. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a ""very small force"" of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown.

For homeless residents, an uncertain time is at hand

Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.

Several protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents.

The departures were voluntary, but they came in response to a clear threat from the Trump administration. Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments. In Washington Circle, which still contains a few tents, city workers put up signs announcing ""general cleanup of this public space"" starting at 10 a.m. Monday.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4626x2602+0+241/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Fe9%2Fa1ffdc134c27865a5b5f77aba3b2%2Fap25226579515755.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 03:56:30.097771

He amended to clarify he was a Louisiana citizen but was employed in Mississippi in 1968-69 in multiple towns including Sandersville (Jones County).

Parra died in 2011, at which point his wife, Peggy Parra, was substituted into the lawsuit as representative of his estate. She filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add wrongful death claims, but the motion was never pursued and never ruled upon.

Since then, the underlying case has remained on the Jones County docket without any forward progress. The plaintiff propounded discovery in 2009, and some discovery was exchanged in 2011, at which time it went completely cold in the trial court.

PARALLEL LITIGATION

One company Parra sued was Marsh USA Inc. Marsh was not a manufacturer or user of asbestos; rather, Marsh was the “primary insurance broker” for the Johns Manville Corp., which “[f]rom the 1920s to the 1970s … was, by most accounts, the largest supplier of raw asbestos and manufacturer of asbestos-containing products in the United States[.]” Travelers Indem. Co. v. Bailey, 557 U.S. 137, 140 (2009). In 1982, due to the volume of asbestos claims against Johns Manville, it filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. Consequently, its insurers contributed $770 million into a bankruptcy trust to pay off all asbestos claims against Johns Manville. Marsh, as insurance broker, contributed $29.75 million, and in 1986, it “received a release of, and injunction against,” relevant claims related to its service to Johns Manville. Id. at 108-09. The bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York ruled that these “1986 Orders,” as they subsequently became known, generally enjoined state court lawsuits against Marsh and other insurers, and enforcement of such enjoinment became routine over the following decades.

In 2016, Marsh filed a motion in the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York to enforce the 1986 orders. Notably, Marsh argued beyond enjoinment of the case, but wanted Parra’s claims against Marsh in state court to be completely barred. Parra argued that she was not enjoined by the 1986 orders because she was suing Marsh based on its own conduct, not Marsh’s actions on behalf of Johns Manville.

The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Marsh, and Parra, sought review to the district court, which agreed in part and remanded in part on the question of whether Parra had received due process stemming from the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court ruled in favor of Marsh again. Parra again sought review from the district court, which ruled in favor of Parra. Marsh appealed to the Second Circuit, which reversed, ruling that a party could only sue Marsh in the bankruptcy court, not in a state court, and that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over whether certain claims arise from Marsh’s own conduct, as a matter of res judicata.

Marsh requested the bankruptcy court find Parra and her counsel in civil contempt for violating the 1986 orders and subsequent case-specific enforcement orders. The bankruptcy court sanctioned Parra and her counsel for $65,481.60 in Marsh’s attorney’s fees.

LACK OF PROSECUTION

In January 2021, defendants Shell Oil and Bechtel filed separate motions to dismiss for lack of prosecution under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), based on Parra’s failure to take action for over nine years. On February 12, 2021, Parra responded in opposition that she had been enjoined in the parallel litigation in the federal courts of New York. The trial court of Jones County ruled against Parra, stating that Parra had not taken any substantive action for nine years, and that although Parra was enjoined against Marsh, there were many other defendants in the state court suit to proceed against. The lengthy delay in the case, the trial court ruled, indeed did prejudice the defendants in the state court case, and the appropriate sanction is to dismiss the case with prejudice against all defendants, whether they had joined the motions to dismiss (as Marsh did not). Parra then filed a motion to reconsider the ruling, and over the following 26 months, scheduled and cancelled a hearing on said motion to reconsider eight times. In 2023, the trial court denied the request to reconsider, and Parra appealed.

APPELLATE RULING

On August 12, 2025, the Mississippi appellate court upheld the dismissal. Marsh and several other defendants were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff pursuant to settlement on August 7, 2025. As such, in ruling, the Mississippi appellate court found it unnecessary to address the plaintiff’s contentions with regard to Marsh.

The relevant standard it applied was abuse of discretion. Pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), “For failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.” Rule 41 allows courts to dismiss actions involuntarily for want of prosecution as a penalty for dilatoriness. The test is whether there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff. Delay alone may suffice. Here, given the clear record of extreme and egregious delay by the plaintiff, there was no abuse of discretion for the trial court to dismiss the suit with prejudice.

Rather than explore potential abuse of discretion issues, Parra argued the enjoinment against Marsh in federal court should be construed as “good cause” for the years of inactivity. However, Parra never filed a motion to stay the action with the trial court or take any other relevant action. Furthermore, Parra was never enjoined against the other defendants in the case, nor did the parallel federal action actually delay Parra from maintaining the instant action in state court. Rather, the Second Circuit comprehensively held Parra could not maintain the state court action, and Parra was held in civil contempt for continuing to maintain it.

Given the circumstances, the harshness of the dismissal with prejudice sanction was appropriate.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16177_1251.png,N,,2025-08-15 12:58:25.290502

August 14, 2025 1:14 pm

OKLAHOMA CITY – In a win for freedom of speech, a suit filed against the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF) was dismissed by a federal judge this week. The suit, filed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE), sought to punish FFRF for sending advocacy letters to the department objecting to religious activity in public schools. FFRF filed a motion to dismiss in May, arguing that the suit was a frivolous attempt to silence their protected speech.

“This decision affirms a fundamental freedom: the right to petition the government for change,” said Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “The government has no business suing advocacy organizations for exercising their First Amendment rights, and we are grateful that the court recognized that government actors responding to the public doesn’t qualify as an injury.”

In the decision, the judge agreed that no harm had come to OSDE because of the letters, asking, “In what way are Plaintiffs precluded from administering Oklahoma’s public schools because of Defendant’s letters?” The case was dismissed without prejudice.

“As we enter a new school year, this judgement reaffirms our right to speak out against school policies and advocate for change,” said Megan Lambert, legal director at the ACLU of Oklahoma. “The right to dissent is now more important than ever, and we remain committed to ensuring that people can continue to advocate for better governance and equity in Oklahoma public schools. The Oklahoma State Department of Education is without the power to silence dissent.”

“We are pleased that this frivolous lawsuit by Walters was promptly dismissed,” says FFRF Co-President Annie Laurie Gaylor. “FFRF will continue to work to protect the constitutional rights of students and families in Oklahoma.”

FFRF is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Oklahoma. They argued that the lawsuit is a “Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation” (SLAPP), an abusive legal tactic that seeks to chill expression by saddling defendants with potentially lengthy and expensive litigation in retaliation for protected speech. The motion to dismiss was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma in May.

Colorado's most competitive congressional district is home to a significant Latino population - about 40% of residents. The seat is held by a freshman, Republican Gabe Evans, who finds himself walking a fine line on immigration as he seeks reelection. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland has more.

BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: It's a 100-degree weekday afternoon in Greeley, an agricultural city in the northern part of the district. Javi Gonzalez is a 32-year-old truck driver. He and his family are getting groceries at a local Walmart. He leans conservative and voted for President Trump. He says he's not against the federal immigration crackdown, but...

JAVI GONZALEZ: I mean, I guess it's been a little extra lately. But yeah, I don't mind it on the level of, like, criminals.

BIRKELAND: His wife, Anjelyka Flores, did not vote for Trump and doesn't like how his administration is handling immigration.

ANJELYKA FLORES: Obviously, like, crack down on the criminals. But it doesn't seem like they're focusing on what they said they would focus on.

BIRKELAND: Congressman Gabe Evans, like many living here, is Latino. He talks frequently about being the grandson of a Mexican immigrant. His grandfather crossed the border illegally as a young child, served in World War II and later gained citizenship. The first bill Evans introduced earlier this year in Congress focused on rolling back state laws, including ones meant to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. In an interview with Colorado Public Radio right before his election, he explained why he thinks illegal immigration has become a top concern.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GABE EVANS: It has to do with the crime and the drain on public resources that come from tens of thousands of illegal immigrants coming to the area and the crime that's oftentimes associated with, you know, the cartels and the transnational criminal organizations that are taking advantage of the southern border being open.

BIRKELAND: But recently, he's also offered a more moderate vision and signed on to the Dignity Act, a bipartisan-backed bill. It would create a pathway for some undocumented immigrants to get legal status to work in the country, but not citizenship. It faces significant pushback from parts of the MAGA base. Here's Evans again speaking to CPR last month.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

EVANS: You have critical, critical industries, like agriculture, where 42% of the ag labor force doesn't have legal documentation. We have to have some sort of way to protect American farmers, to be able to protect folks in my district.

BIRKELAND: Many voters at the shopping area in Greeley say they want those who aren't causing trouble treated differently.

MERVIN MILLER: I've worked with Mexicans. I was a roofer.

BIRKELAND: Twenty-two-year-old Trump voter Mervin Miller says he thinks it should be easier for workers to get citizenship. He's now a truck driver who hopes to move to this district soon.

MILLER: You won't meet a lot of people that are as nice as the Mexicans in general around here, right? Of course, there's the cartel and all that, but I don't think that's a reason to just say, oh, we're just going to not let anybody in.

BIRKELAND: Also buying groceries nearby is Julia Spruk, an independent who voted for Trump last November. When it comes to immigration, she considers her faith.

JULIA SPRUK: I do believe in Jesus. I do believe in God. And in the Bible, it says, owe no man anything except to love one another. And I think we're forgetting that. I think we're forgetting the love and the compassion part of the equation.

BIRKELAND: As he seeks reelection, Evans will have to contend with voters' complex views. After an afternoon spent talking with some of these voters, it's clear their opinions are more nuanced than political talking points often capture. What's not yet clear - how their views may influence their decisions at the ballot box.
