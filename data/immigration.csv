This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.
On Monday, rights group coalition the Council for Global Equality sued (PDF) the State Department to release report documents, alleging the department had potentially manipulated its latest human rights report.
For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.
In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened.","A key annual United States government report on global human rights abuses has drastically shifted focus, with references removed to abuses based on sexual orientation, and poor conditions downplayed in ally nations while taking aim at those who have clashed with President Donald Trump.

Released on Tuesday, the 2024 State Department Human Rights Report, was issued months late as Trump appointees altered an earlier draft dramatically to bring it in line with America First values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, and “Liberty,” and “Security of the Person.”

The department referred to its new report as “streamlined” and focused on remaining “aligned to the administration’s executive orders”.

While the 2023 report contains a lengthy introduction with numerous appendices and citations, the newest report has a single introductory page that stresses a desire to “minimize the amount of statistical data in the report”. An NPR analysis found individual country reports are, on average, one-third the length of the previous year’s.

There is no mention of discrimination against women, members of the LGBTQ community, or on the basis of race in the latest report introduction.

Instead, the report sounds an alarm about the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Any criticism of governments for their treatment of LGBTQ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appears to have been omitted.

The report’s section on Israel is much shorter than last year’s edition and contains no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. Some 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in October 2023.

While last year’s report underscored numerous acts of anti-Semitism in Hungary, noting that a local survey found half the population were “moderately or strongly anti-Semitic”, the new report says the close Trump ally has “made combating anti-Semitism a top priority, publicly emphasizing its welcoming and open environment for Jews”.

The report claims “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador – where Trump has gained help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house migrant deportees in a high-security mega-prison.

Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that the report “purposefully fail[ed]” to capture rights abuses in a number of countries.

This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.

On Monday, rights group coalition the Council for Global Equality sued (PDF) the State Department to release report documents, alleging the department had potentially manipulated its latest human rights report.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared following a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in April, wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

Taking aim at Brazil and South Africa

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation had declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the Supreme Court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 electoral loss to leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch hunt” and called it grounds for a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian goods.

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened. It stated that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

In last year’s report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.

Trump, earlier this year, issued an executive order that called for the US to resettle Afrikaners, describing them as victims of “violence against racially disfavored landowners,” allegations that echoed far-right claims but which have been contested by South Africa’s government.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-18T212340Z_299766331_RC20PFAHKLDB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ELSALVADOR-VENEZUELA-1755026732.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-12 23:57:31.666618

At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”.
“Let’s be clear, Black history is American history.
The museums all offer free admission and attract millions of visitors each year, with the National Museum of American History alone recording 2 million in-person visits in 2024.
The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.","The White House has ordered an extensive review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions in advance of next year’s 250th anniversary of the United States, with the goal of aligning the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of US history.

In a letter sent on Tuesday to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House laid out in detail the steps it expects the organisation to take so that museum content can be reviewed for a focus on “Americanism”.

The federal government will review public-facing museum content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals”, the letter said.

“This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter added.

In a statement responding to the letter, the Smithsonian said it remained committed to “scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history”.

“We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,” it said.

The White House said that the review is in line with the Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History Executive Order, which Trump signed in March.

At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”.

“Donald Trump’s idea that the National Museum of African American History and Culture is guilty of distorting our nation’s history or painting our ‘founding principles’ in a ‘negative light’ is patently ridiculous,” the caucus said in a statement.

“Let’s be clear, Black history is American history. Any rhetoric that opposes this notion is not only factually incorrect but blatantly racist,” the caucus said.

“It is the Trump Administration that bans books, words, and phrases that do not fit their narrative. It is the Trump Administration that wants to erase and retell our history,” the caucus added.

The White House said the review would initially focus on the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

The museums under review are all located in Washington, DC, where the president this week ordered the deployment of the US National Guard to tackle a purported crime wave that city officials in the capital have refuted.

The museums all offer free admission and attract millions of visitors each year, with the National Museum of American History alone recording 2 million in-person visits in 2024.

The Smithsonian has repeatedly denied allegations that it has changed or removed exhibit details in response to pressure from the Trump administration. Recently, the institution removed references to Trump’s two impeachments from an exhibit on the US presidency. The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.

“We were not asked by any Administration or other government officials to remove content from the exhibit,” the Institution said.

The Smithsonian Institution, which runs 21 museums and the National Zoo, said at the time that the impeachment section of the museum would be updated in the coming weeks to “reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25163573387889-1755043215.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:27.767375

I would suggest that you watch the actions that are taken by an administration and that commitment to human rights.","The State Department released its on Tuesday. However, the department is under fire for not including some sections of the report that were included in the past.

Poor prison conditions in El Salvador were not included. There was an entire paragraph from last year's report.

Instead, the report simplifies the conditions, saying there were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,"" which also appears again in the section for Hungary.

Human rights violations of peaceful assembly in China are also missing.

According to an analysis conducted by , this year's reports are about one-third the length of last year's. The reports on El Salvador and Moldova are more than 75% shorter.

During a State Department briefing on Tuesday, spokesperson Tammy Bruce emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to human rights, although she refused to comment on why exactly these sections were removed.

She pointed out that some of the edits stem from the changeover in presidential administrations.

We weren't going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration; it needed to change based on the point of view and vision of the Trump administration,"" Bruce said.

She said the report does not reflect a change in U.S. policy when it comes to human rights. The State Department also stopped ranking countries.

Bruce added that although reports are important, it is also about action.

Court has resumed for Day 2 of the Newsom v. Trump bench trial in U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's San Francisco courtroom.
He commands Task Force 51, the Guard contingent that Trump admin sent to LA in June.
The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.","As closing arguments began, the California DOJ gave historical context about the Posse Comitatus Act, which dates back to 1878. It prohibits the use of military to execute U.S. laws, without authorization of Congress or by the Constitution.

California noted the 8th Circuit has called PCA ""the embodiment of a long tradition of suspicion and hostility of military force for domestic purposes.""

CA DOJ: ""Occupation of a civilian city by nearly 5,000 troops for 60 days will have and has had a prescriptive effect on that population. That is exactly the kind of standing army the founding fathers feared. Each of the incidents is a PCA violation.""

CA DOJ goes back to the Trump administration's key defense, that the military deployment was solely for protection of federal property and personnel. Photographs were again shown of troops in a blockade line and interacting with a protestor. ""Defendants cannot wordsmith their way around the law. Calling it 'security' doesn't make it any less illegal.""

The CA DOJ concluded closing arguments asking for a permanent injunction to ""bring a halt to the unlawful military crusade across this state.""

Before US DOJ started closing arguments, Judge Breyer asked Eric Hamilton (US deputy asst AG) this: ""Is there any limitation to use of the military in an operation which is being conducted by federal agents? For example, one, does there have to be a threat? Two, does there have to be some evaluation for threat in terms of consequences of the threat? Three, is there anything, I haven't seen any evidence in this case, as to the adequacy or inadequacy of local law enforcement addressing that threat?""

Hamilton says there isn't anything in Posse Comitatus Act that requires some pre-operation threat assessment. The ""National Guard was federalized in early June because of violent protests in the LA area and we have seen at trial evidence of violence that persisted in July.""

Judge Breyer continued with many questions for Hamilton (US DOJ) in quite impassioned tone. ""Unless military is the first line of defense...it's usually local law enforcement that is the first line of defense. But there is no evidence in these situations...that they were unable or unwilling to enforce the law... Is that a correct analysis?""

Then Hamilton got into his closing arguments, also starting with the Posse Comitatus Act. He highlighted 9th Circuit cases that mention military being used as ""backup security."" Quote from Kahn (9th Circuit. 1994): ""The district court concluded that the Navy provided only logistical support and backup security...therefore did not violate the law.""

Now as to POTUS authority to federalize National Guard (see 10 USC 12406), Hamilton mentions the rebellion clause saying, ""It's a rebellion because (Trump) says it's a rebellion."" Judge Breyer does not seem satisfied with that answer and continued Q &A.

Hamilton referred back to witness statements, including Monday testimony from Army Deputy Chief of Staff William Harrington, who said the Guard had no interactions with civilians in reference to a July 7 MacArthur Park operation which took ""20 minutes."" Harrington testified that they did not engage in law enforcement activities.

Note: These were only closing arguments for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Judge Breyer said he's expecting arguments on ""legal issues"" Wednesday.

Court has resumed for Day 2 of the Newsom v. Trump bench trial in U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's San Francisco courtroom. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman is back on the witness stand first thing this morning. He commands Task Force 51, the Guard contingent that Trump admin sent to LA in June.

DOJ lawyer is questioning Sherman about a June 23 memo from Sec. Hegseth about the LA mission, reading: ""Service members may not perform direct law enforcement activities such as searches, seizures, evidence collection or arrest."" Sherman testifies troops did not violate that.""

Sherman says he wants the public to know ""we were doing exactly what we were told to do, exactly in line with federal law, and that we were not conducting law enforcement operations,"" adding the Guard was in LA to protect federal personnel and property, nothing else.

A U.S. Army North Fifth Army slideshow was shown in court again, which has guidance about ""prohibited law enforcement functions"" under the Posse Comitatus Act. It was a long list, but these are in red: security patrols, traffic controls, crowd control, riot control.

Sherman says his understanding, according to Trump and Hegseth memos, is those functions are red because the Guard can legally do under certain circumstances. Judge Breyer had a series of follow-up questions, asking why would those be listed as prohibited if soldiers can perform those duties.

Then came California Department of Justice Deputy AG Jane Reilley for the cross-examination. It was about a half-hour or so questioning from both parties largely about specifics of the Department of Defense's request for Guard assistance in LA.

Reilley asked Sherman if the DoD asked the Guard to set up perimeters, would he grant the request? He says without an identified imminent threat, it would have ""never gone past our legal review.""

The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.

It was this quote from President Trump: ""We have other cities also that are bad, very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem, and then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We're not going to lose our cities over this...we're going to clean up D.C. real quick.""

The CA DOJ asks Sherman if he has received any word or request for sending more National Guard troops to other California cities (like Oakland, as Trump mentioned Monday). Sherman said no.

With no further questioning, he was dismissed as a witness.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17503297_081125-kgo-ap-national-guard-2-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:31.537854

""I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,"" he added.
In Tuesday's order, Kaplan ordered immigration officials to provide 50 square feet per person.

U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) to reduce capacity, improve cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in holding rooms inside 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Lower Manhattan.

The order comes after a lawsuit filed on behalf of detained migrants claimed they were subjected to unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, extreme temperatures, and a lack of access to soap, toothbrushes, and other essentials, according to The Associated Press.

The migrants said they were fed inedible ""slop"" and were subjected to the stench of sweat, urine and feces, in part due to the rooms having open toilets.

One woman said that during her period, she couldn’t access menstrual products because only two were made available to an entire room of women, court filings revealed.

At a hearing Tuesday, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Heather Gregorio, described the facility as having ""inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

DOJ attorney Jeffrey Oestericher acknowledged that detainees were receiving only two meals per day and were not provided medication or sleeping mats. However, he pushed back on the overcrowding claims, according to reports by The Hill.

""Present conditions are relevant,"" Oestericher told the judge at the hearing. ""To the extent they are talking about overcrowding, it does not appear presently that there is overcrowding.""

""I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,"" he added. ""I think there is some factual disagreement.""

In Tuesday's order, Kaplan ordered immigration officials to provide 50 square feet per person. This means the largest hold room’s capacity will be brought down to about 15 people after detainees said there had been at least 40, according to The Associated Press.

The cells must also be thoroughly cleaned three times a day. Officials are additionally required to provide clean bedding mats and an adequate supply of soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste and other hygiene products.

The judge also ordered officials to ensure detainees have confidential telephone calls with lawyers, including interpreters for those who do not speak English.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”

On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order that mandated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to implement reforms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan where one floor contains holding cells for migrants and asylum seekers.

The restraining order requires the government to limit capacity at the holding facility, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said.

Under Kaplan’s order, the government will be forced to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products.

He has also instructed immigration officials to allocate 4.6 square metres (50 square feet) per person, shrinking the capacity of the largest room from 40 or more detainees to just 15.

Finally, to ensure access to legal representation, Kaplan said the government must ensure detainees have accommodations to make confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

Inside the complaint

The changes come in response to a complaint filed by lawyers for a Peruvian asylum-seeker named Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was taken into custody on August 8 after appearing for a scheduled court date.

He was imprisoned at 26 Federal Plaza after his arrest. But his lawyers have argued that Barco Mercado and others in the facility have faced “crowded, squalid, and punitive conditions”. They also said they were denied access to their client after his arrest.

Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York.

In court filings, other detainees complained that they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products while locked in the 26 Federal building.

They also said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and faeces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

A mobile phone video recorded last month showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four holding rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

ICE responds to allegations of ill treatment

At Tuesday’s hearing, a government lawyer conceded that “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York.

The government also tried to downplay allegations of overcrowding at the facility and inhumane conditions.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday.

That number was well below the 154-person limit imposed by the city fire marshal for the floor.

Zanello also said that each room was equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products were available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products.

The 26 Federal Plaza site has become a flashpoint in New York as the city contends with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration.

The holding cells are on the 10th floor, just two floors below an immigration court. The building also houses the New York field office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other government offices.

While ICE has conducted high-profile raids on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings.

Critics have denounced such arrests as violations of the right to due process. They warn that, by carrying out arrests in court buildings, officials could discourage foreign nationals from pursuing lawful paths to immigration.

But in January, the Trump administration rescinded guidelines that limited immigration arrests in “sensitive locations”, court buildings generally considered to be among them.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250808__2229095057__v2__MidRes__IceDetainsImmigrantsInsideNewYorkCityCourthou-1755036091.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-12 22:56:37.256848

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation significantly worsening.
The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year, the report said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticise restrictions on political speech by US allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration's focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration's view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown.

This year's reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners, the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to adjust the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know, the overview said. On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

The new reports reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe, Amnesty International said in a statement.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the US. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses in El Salvador in 2024 and that the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers' freedom of association.

Those governments did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation significantly worsening. The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country's apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.

It also said the government did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three Nato allies worsened during the year.

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior US officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro's speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump's ire by prosecuting his ally former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro and led to the imposition of massive US tariffs and sanctions against Brazil's Supreme Court chief justice.

The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year, the report said. The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users' access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.

Judge Lewis Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

Cellphone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products. They said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan ordered immigration officials to allocate 50 sq feet per person – shrinking the largest hold room’s capacity to about 15 people after detainees said 40 or more were being jammed in. The building, home to immigration court and the FBI’s New York field office, has become an epicenter of Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide an adequate supply of hygiene products. Addressing concerns that detainees were not able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

The lawsuit – filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union – sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions”.

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza far longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

Murad Awawdeh, the president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, welcomed Kaplan’s ruling as a “step forward” but said the facility “must be shut down permanently”.

New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June after he tried to lock arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain, said the decision “is a much-needed rebuke of Trump’s cruel immigration policies”.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, of Ice’s New York City field office of enforcement and removal operations, wrote that as of Monday, a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms – well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room has at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the lawsuit’s named plaintiff, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the US in 2022, said his holding room was “extremely crowded”, cold and “smelled of sewage”, and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the US when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration hearing. He said officers told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an officer showed him a cellphone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers blasted air conditioning and doled out meals that “looked like dog food”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768b50d6a459ff9e1ebc05b79455ec078fa390c0/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2fc6b26e867700091fab04b044d132a",N,,2025-08-12 22:56:49.344669

The video posted on Facebook shows Enforcement and Removal Operations officers — or arresting officers working under ICE — forcibly taking two people into custody.

The driver in the video drives onto the property, then stops next to three vehicles, including two large grey Ford SUVs. The officers are seen urging the driver to go away.

The driver gets out of the vehicle and says, “Why are you stopping my guys?” as one officer escorts a man with his hands behind his back.

As the confrontation continues, one ICE officer tells the driver that he is “impeding a federal investigation” and that the officers will arrest him, too.

“They’re my workers, they’re my workers,” says the driver in the video. “They didn’t do anything for you guys to stop them. They didn’t do anything.”

The situation escalates as two officers pull the passenger out of the stopped vehicle and pin him to the ground on his stomach.

The video later shows the two SUVs driving out of the property, with the two people in custody inside.

Property Manager at Alpine Mountain Ranch and Club Audrey Williams noted that she had seen the video and confirmed that it was on the ranch’s property, but she was not at work when the arrests occurred.

Williams added that the ranch gates open around 6:45 a.m. each morning and remain open during business hours for the public to access various construction sites across the property.

According to Jerry Hernandez, the executive director of the local organization Integrated Community, ICE activity has also been seen at a construction site in town and at a bus stop on 7th Street, where three people were said to have been arrested.

While Hernandez did not have an exact number of people who were taken into custody, he confirmed that two people in custody were currently en route to Denver.

“One of the things that we had confirmed was that ICE could not and did not engage in traffic stops,” said Hernandez. “So we were telling our clients, ‘Don’t worry, they can’t pull you over.’ But apparently, that’s not the case because of this branch (Enforcement and Removal Operations).”

Hernandez said one of the men arrested in the video was issued an “order of removal,” which was most likely the reason for the traffic stop. However, Hernandez noted that the man had been “compliant” with his court dates.

Police Chief Mark Beckett said law enforcement has not recently communicated with ICE about an increased presence or recent arrests, but noted that this isn’t unique to Steamboat Springs.

“We’re hearing from different sheriffs and chiefs across the state … ICE and (Enforcement and Removal Operations) are operating without any notification,” said Beckett. “We haven’t been approached. Our policy is still what it was (earlier this year), which is we’re not going to participate in enforcement action. That’s probably why they aren’t notifying any local agencies anymore.”

“What they told us originally was they were going to focus on those who were actually wanted criminally, like gang members,” continued Beckett. “But, you know, all I have to go on is the same thing you’re seeing.”

Beckett added that he couldn’t be sure if ICE is arresting migrants without criminal histories, but noted that the Steamboat Springs Police Department “continues to support all of our populations, including the undocumented community.”

Routt County Sheriff Doug Scherar also said he was unaware of an increased ICE presence in the county, and noted that the sheriff’s office does not participate in any immigration enforcement.

“Unfortunately … (ICE) has put themselves in a silo right now, so we don’t hear anything at all,” Beckett said. “And frankly, I don’t think we’re going to. I think that’s going to be how they will continue to move forward. They’re just going to do whatever they’re going to do.”

Scherar encourages anyone concerned about an increased ICE presence in the community should reach out to Integrated Community for assistance.

“I know the community is very, very afraid and concerned,” said Hernandez. “We have families that are not sending their kids to school or that are not going to work because of this.”

For those impacted, Hernandez stressed utilizing “Know Your Rights” websites and other resources provided by Integrated Community.

“These types of events can cause high levels of anxiety and mental health stress on children,” Hernandez added. “It’s important for us to continue to be supportive of each other.”

“We make (the links) available to our clients so that they can be informed when someone comes knocking on their door. Regardless of status, you have rights,” Hernandez explained.

Hernandez also emphasized taking steps to plan ahead, like putting a legal fund in place, establishing a caregiver for children or placing “Know Your Rights” cards in vehicles and houses.

“If (migrants and immigrants) are in a mixed-status household, who can pick your kids up from school? That all needs to be spelled out ahead of time,” said Hernandez.

“We understand that law enforcement has a job to do … We recognize that,” said Hernandez. “Our position is that we’re going to continue to be a source of help for the immigrant population in Steamboat because they’re a vital part of this community.”

The results were alarming.

“When we began in 2000, we recorded 150 to 160 cases of human rights and constitutional rights violations,” said Garcia, executive director of Border Network for Human Rights. “What we did with those findings is to educate the community about their rights during encounters with law enforcement and also approach the agencies we believed were engaged in a pattern of constitutional violations.”

The complaints included racial profiling, physical and psychological abuse, warrantless searches, arbitrary arrests and instant deportations without due process. Some things have improved during that 25-year period – there were years when no complaints were reported against the U.S. Border Patrol, for instance, and the agency reined in its vehicle pursuit policy to cut down on accidents.

“We educate the people and sometimes we educate the agencies themselves on how the community sees them and how they should always be cognizant of their rights,” Garcia said.

But new worries have surfaced with a new U.S. president bent on the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the arrival of thousands of soldiers to West Texas and Southern New Mexico. In addition, a federal immigration agency is rushing to hire new agents to look for and deport migrants.

Those are some of the reasons behind BNHR’s latest abuse documentation campaign set to begin this month. The group is setting up 30 tables near international ports of entry, in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with a high Hispanic or immigrant population from El Paso to Del Rio, Texas, and from Anthony, New Mexico, to Albuquerque.

“We will not prejudge. We have an objective documentation process. We ask if their rights are violated, they tell us then we go about verifying the allegations. Are there any witnesses? We learned that from journalists – that it is necessary to have who did what to whom, where and when. If we cannot verify, we won’t take the case,” Garcia said.

The volunteers range from moms of school-aged children to retirees. They will wear T-shirts with the documentation campaign logo and large badges with their names.

Some of them told Border Report they already have witnessed abusive behavior from law enforcement in their communities.

“They went into a place looking for one person and they took many. They detained a mother (in front of) a school and brought down her children from the bus. All the kids were upset,” said Maria Salazar.

She told the story of a neighbor who is a lawful permanent resident and whose vehicle was targeted by immigration agents looking for an unrelated individual. “They punctured her tires, and now they don’t want to pay for the damage,” Salazar said.

Lourdes Vasquez is a New Mexico activist who will be visiting churches, stores and other gathering places in Las Cruces, Anthony, Chaparral and Sunland Park.

“We see lots of worries in the community. They hear about ICE going into homes. They have been stopped walking in their neighborhoods,” Vasquez said, adding it is important for these residents to not be afraid of documenting these run-ins for the sake of accountability.

Garcia said he will present a report in October with the findings of the latest two-month documentation campaign. He said he will show the report to leaders of federal and local law enforcement agencies so they have a chance to respond.

Last year, Border Report reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection after Garcia released his 2024 abuse documentation report. CBP urged the complainants then to file formal complaints through official channels as soon as possible.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.

In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”

According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.

“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.

Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”

“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”

According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”

The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.

During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/lafromboise/original/20250812-161707-539-1vets.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:13.513576

WASHINGTON – In the Houston, TX area alone U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 356 criminal illegal alien gang members during the first six months of the Trump administration. In the first six months of the Biden administration, just 75 gang members were arrested in the Houston, TX area. To put these figures into perspective, it’s a 375% increase in arrests of gang members under the Trump administration in this area. In 2021, the ICE Houston field office arrested 115 gang members during the entire year.

These 356 gang members were collectively convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses including murder, child sex crimes, sex trafficking, arson, and theft.

In total, ICE arrested members of more than 40 different gangs including 39 MS-13 gang members, 25 Tren de Aragua gang members, six Latin Kings gang members, 159 Paisas gang members, and 26 Tango Blast gang members.

“Thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem, these illegal alien gang members are off America’s streets. Across the country, ICE law enforcement is targeting these vicious gangs that rape, maim, and murder Americans for sport,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to dismantle transnational criminal terrorist gangs. In Houston area alone, we have already arrested more than three times as many gang members as the Biden administration arrested in Houston in all of 2021. The days of unchecked gang violence are OVER.”

Some of the criminal illegal alien gang members arrested in Houston are below.

On May 8, 2025, ICE arrest Herson Barrera Vasquez, a Latin Kings gang member. His criminal history includes seven assault convictions, fraud, damaging property, drug trafficking, larceny, multiple DWIs, and disorderly conduct. ICE deported him on May 19, 2025. That was his FOURTH deportation.

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote.
I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.” Abbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats.","Texas Republican leaders said Tuesday that they were prepared to end their stalemated special session and immediately begin another standoff with Democrats in the GOP’s efforts to redraw congressional maps as directed by President Trump.

It’s the latest indication that Trump’s push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections will become an extended standoff that promises to reach multiple statehouses controlled by both major parties.

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans during a brief session Tuesday morning that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards to conduct official business because dozens of Democrats have left the state to stymie the GOP’s partisan gerrymandering attempts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Burrows said from the House floor that lawmakers will not attempt to reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent — and they have given no indication that they plan to return — the speaker said Republicans will end the current session and Gov. Greg Abbott will immediately call another.

The governor, a Trump ally, confirmed his intentions in a statement.

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote. “There will be no reprieve for the derelict Democrats who fled the state and abandoned their duty to the people who elected them. I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.”

Abbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people. Democrats balked when Abbott added Trump’s redistricting idea to the agenda. Burrows on Tuesday did not mention redistricting but chided Democrats for not showing up for debate on the flood response package.

The redistricting legislation would reshape the state’s congressional districts in a design aimed at sending five more Republicans to Washington.

The scheme is part of Trump’s push to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when the 2018 midterms restored Democrats to a House majority that blocked his agenda and twice impeached him. Current maps nationally put Democrats within three seats of retaking the House majority — with only several dozen competitive districts across 435 total seats.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats. Because they are out of state, those lawmakers are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.

Burrows said Tuesday that absent Democrats would have to pay for all state government costs for law enforcement officials attempting to track them down. Burrows has said state troopers and others have run up “six figures in overtime costs” trying to corral Democratic legislators.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bf2ddc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+267/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fed%2F1b0e203a942f3d3aa404f8533e53%2Fa7a8eb55acb240fb9e3778e27161ab8c,N,,2025-08-12 21:56:32.434549

As of July 15, HHS reclassified how it interprets the term “federal public benefit” under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

In the past it meant people living in the U.S. could receive benefits under this classification, regardless of immigration status. This is no longer the case.

But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Director Russell Vought might ""employ a pocket rescission sometime before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline,"" said The Hill.
The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission.""
A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress.
Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?","The Constitution unambiguously grants Congress the power to determine how tax dollars are spent, an uncomfortable reality for the Trump administration's efforts to unilaterally slash spending. Many of the cuts recommended by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the spring therefore needed the retroactive blessing of Congress, a process known as ""rescission."" And media reports suggest that the Trump administration is soon set to escalate its war on Congress' spending power by using something dubbed a ""pocket rescission"" to block funding without giving Congress enough time to consider the request.

What is the Trump administration trying to do?

Congress frequently rescinds money it has previously allocated for all kinds of reasons. But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Director Russell Vought might ""employ a pocket rescission sometime before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline,"" said The Hill. Vought's plan involves using not the ordinary rescission process driven by Congress but rather section 1012 of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. This allows the president to pause, or impound, allocated funding for 45 days. If Congress doesn't act to officially rescind the funds, the executive branch is obligated to resume the spending.

This actually happened quite recently. In July, the Republican-controlled Congress complied with the Trump administration's request to rescind $9 billion in spending, including funding for public broadcasting. While critics lambasted Congress for capitulating to the White House, the maneuver was legal. The Trump administration, however, is reportedly planning to use this provision in a way that the U.S. government has recently deemed unlawful. This so-called ""pocket rescission"" is ""when a president asks Congress to rescind (or cancel) funds very close to the end of the fiscal year,"" said the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Because ""not enough time is given to consider this request,"" the president is ""bypassing congressional authority over government funding"" and taking a knee to let the clock run down on spending he dislikes.

The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission."" The GAO is an independent, non-partisan agency located in the legislative branch that was created to ""make sure that the appropriation laws enacted by the Congress are properly implemented,"" said the American Enterprise Institute.

A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress. After all, a ""loophole that allowed the president to impound funds over the will of Congress"" would ultimately ""undermine the entire intent of the law."" But the ""OMB asserts that there is nothing controversial about pocket rescissions,"" said Lawfare. The record shows ""they have been used this way before,"" and past presidents, including Jimmy Carter, employed them without being accused of precipitating constitutional crises.

Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?

During the second Trump administration, the boundaries of legality are being redrawn by the president in conjunction with a Supreme Court determined to legitimize virtually every action by the White House. This dynamic was perhaps clearest when the Supreme Court blessed the Trump administration's decision to fire Democratic members of the bipartisan National Labor Relations Board, in clear violation of congressional statute and existing Supreme Court precedent on the matter. While the Supreme Court's May decision in that case was ""technically a temporary one,"" it nevertheless ""clearly forecasts the eventual outcome of the case when it is argued before the court,"" likely sometime in 2026, said NPR.

So while pocket rescissions are of dubious legality according to widespread understandings of the U.S. Constitution as it existed prior to Trump's second inauguration, the Supreme Court seems quite unlikely to halt them. Instead, in keeping with the doctrine of the ""unitary executive theory,"" the court will almost certainly grant the Trump administration wide latitude to interpret existing law as it sees fit.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HgQyeQACUm2GyfwU7ohNdL.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:38.163935

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold fewer people in the 10th-floor holding cells of its Lower Manhattan offices at 26 Federal Plaza. ICE has been accused of detaining dozens of migrants for days or weeks there in tight quarters meant to hold detainees for just a few hours.

The judge also ordered ICE to allow migrants to place calls to their lawyers and to ensure access to proper medical and hygienic care following allegations that detainees were deprived of showers, given meager meals and forced to sleep on the concrete floor without any bedding.

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday by legal organizations representing a Peruvian immigrant, Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was arrested by ICE and held at 26 Federal Plaza last week.

Judge Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order while he fully reviews the case and considers whether to issue a longer-lasting order. ICE has repeatedly denied that the cells at 26 Federal Plaza are overcrowded or that conditions are inadequate.

The ruling is a short-term victory for immigration activists who have spent months denouncing the conditions in the holding cells. They have filled up as ICE has increased arrests in New York’s immigration courts, straining the agency’s detention capacity. Many of the more than 3,200 people ICE has arrested in the New York City area since Jan. 20, when President Trump’s second term began, have been detained at 26 Federal Plaza at some point, according to new federal data released this week.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

While the White House deploys the National Guard in Washington, D.C., a judge in California is looking at how President Trump has used the guard troops in Los Angeles. Trump sent them in to confront protests, some violent, against immigration enforcement operations in the city. But legal questions remain. Here's Laura Fitzgerald with CapRadio in Sacramento.

LAURA FITZGERALD, BYLINE: Trump deployed around 4,000 National Guard troops to LA in early June. At the time, he said the protests against the immigration crackdown were out of control.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had some bad people. We have people, they look in your face and they spit right in your face. They're animals. And these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers.

FITZGERALD: In June, a federal judge ruled the deployment was illegal and ordered that control be returned to California. But an appeals court disagreed and allowed Trump to maintain control. The state alleges Trump illegally used the military for domestic law enforcement. David Carrillo, a constitutional law expert at University of California, Berkeley, who filed briefs supporting the state in the case, says it could set a precedent for when the guard is deployed elsewhere.

DAVID CARRILLO: I think it is fair to say this is the most significant modern example of a court taking a hard look at the factual justifications for the exercise of federal power in this area.

FITZGERALD: Witnesses Monday recounted what the troops were doing, setting the stage for lawyers to argue whether those were law enforcement duties or not. A couple hundred National Guard troops remain. The trial is scheduled to go through Wednesday.

“Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles?
And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.” Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds.
Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.
Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.","Several hundred workers, organizers and immigrant advocates gathered in palm-tree-dotted MacArthur Park on Tuesday to denounce the Trump administration and immigration raids it has carried out in the city and in other parts of California.

Rows of parked cars clogged a stretch of Park View Street in the morning, blocking traffic. Scrawled on windshields and bumpers in chalky white and printed on taped signs were slogans “ICE out of LA” and “Stop the Trump terror.”

From atop a truck, Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta addressed the crowd.

“Our fight is for working people. ... It’s a fight against authoritarianism. It’s a fight to restore democracy in this country,” said Huerta, who was injured and detained by law enforcement in early June while documenting the first major immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles this summer. “Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles? And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.”

Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds. The ongoing threat to the many immigrant workers that local labor groups count among their members, as well as criminal charges of conspiracy to impede an officer brought against Huerta, have ignited protests in recent months.

Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.

On Tuesday, speakers urged people not to purchase from major companies including Home Depot, Walmart, Target and fast-food restaurants that they contend are not doing enough to protect their employees.

A spokesperson for Home Depot previously told The Times the company had not been notified of any of the raids at its locations ahead of time and that the company was not involved in any of the operations.

“We are going to take back MacArthur Park,” said Felipe Caceres, an organizer with SEIU 721. “For 24 hours we are reclaiming our power to stop the Trump terror. For 24 hours we are going to boycott companies.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The park, which is nestled in the heart of a dense immigrant community, has become a symbol ever since July 7, when federal agents descended on it with horses and armored vehicles, carrying rifles and in tactical gear.

“It’s important to reclaim this space, where ICE staged a show of force. So that’s what we’re here to do,” said Marissa Nuncio, executive director of the Garment Worker Center.

Local unions and labor groups have rallied to support their members in recent months.

The Garment Worker Center has worked to deliver food to garment manufacturers sheltering at home and held “Know Your Rights” trainings. As car wash workers across the region have been snapped up in raids, the CLEAN Carwash Worker Center has scrambled to track deportations and connect families with legal services.

The union representing Southern California hotel workers, Unite Here Local 11, has pressed hotel owners to push back on the Trump administration’s rhetoric and provide additional protections for the many in its workforce who are asylum seekers, immigrants with Temporary Protected Status and recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Cooks and cashiers with the California Fast Food Workers Union this week penned a letter to fast-food businesses urging them to commit to protecting workers by barring federal agents from entering spaces that they do not have proper warrants to enter.

“Fast-food worker bosses, whose side are you guys on? Are you going to sit here and just let [the federal government] run all over us? We’re asking you today to stand up with us and protect us,” said Anneisha Williams, a member of the state’s Fast Food Council, at the Tuesday rally.

Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.

A cell phone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.
In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes and other hygiene products.

Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

A cell phone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes and other hygiene products. They also said they were fed inedible “slop"" and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period couldn't use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan instructed federal immigration officials to allocate 50 square feet (4.6 square meters) per person — shrinking the capacity of the largest hold room to about 15 people, down from the 40 or more individuals that detainees said were being jammed into the rooms. The building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day, provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products. Addressing concerns that detainees weren't able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,"" Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S. Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated.”

The lawsuit — filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union — sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza for days or even weeks before being sent to other facilities — longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, an assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that as of Monday a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms — well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room is equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap and teeth cleaning wipes, and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the named plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing. He was subsequently transferred to an upstate New York detention facility.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the U.S. in 2022, said his hold room was “extremely crowded,"" cold and “smelled of sewage,"" and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. ""There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the U.S. when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration court hearing. Officers pressed him to self-deport, he said, and told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an arresting officer showed him a cell phone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers kept the air conditioning blasting and doled out meals that “looked like dog food.""

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.","Immigrant-rights advocates undertook a daylong “community stoppage” Tuesday with a 24-hour boycott of various businesses, plus rallies opposing federal immigration enforcement operations.

The action, which began at midnight Tuesday, was organized by several groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, Service Employees International Union Local 721, Central American Resource Center of Los Angeles and the Garment Worker Center.

Participants were urged to join events scheduled throughout the day and to support individuals and families affected by immigration raids.

The coalition also called for a boycott of The Home Depot, Target, Walmart and fast food restaurants.

“These corporations whether implicitly or not have allowed their facilities to be used as places where federal agents violated workers’ rights and have inflicted pain and terror in our community and families,” Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for CHIRLA, said in an email to City News Service.

“These corporations benefit on a daily basis from our hard-earned dollars and yet remain silent in light of the attacks against Angelenos and workers,” he added.

Organizers said the boycott was aimed at showing the economic influence of immigrant communities and to demand an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and the expansion of private detention centers.

“This is an action that will involve supporters or our community who dislike the way the federal government is overreaching and violating workers’ due process and rights,” Cabrera said. “This community stoppage is the precursor of more actions to come later in the year calling on the federal government to stop these racist raids.”

The day of action began with a midnight fast-food workers strike at a restaurant near MacArthur Park, followed by a second walkout at 5 a.m. A “Take Back Our Park” coffee and breakfast was held early Tuesday morning at Park View and Wilshire Boulevard, followed by a 10 a.m rally at MacArthur Park involving hundreds of people.

Participants were expected Tuesday afternoon to march from MacArthur Park to the county Hall of Administration. A 5 p.m. rally was also planned at Placita Olvera (Olvera Street), followed by a march to the downtown federal detention center, where a vigil will be held.

A spokesman for The Home Depot issued a statement saying, “Immigration enforcement agencies are the best sources if you have questions. We aren’t notified that these activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

Target and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Plans for the community stoppage were announced last week at a news conference at MacArthur Park. The announcement came a day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security conducted a raid at a Home Depot on Wilshire Boulevard, where agents hid in a Penske truck and descended on day laborers at the site. ICE arrested approximately 16 individuals as a result of the raid.

Aggressive ICE raids began June 6, resulting in the arrest of 2,792 immigrants in Los Angeles County and six surrounding counties who are suspected of living in the United States without legal permission.

Homeland Security previously announced that fewer than 1,400 immigrants were arrested in the region last month.

Some immigration experts suggested the decrease was due to a federal court order limiting the scope of immigration-enforcement operations in the area.

A federal judge last month issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and requiring the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

The federal government appealed the ruling, but last week, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put a stay on the ruling. The federal government has appealed the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The restraining order, however, did not prevent last Wednesday’s operation involving the Penske truck. On X, U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles Bill Essayli acknowledged the operation, writing, “For those who thought immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again. The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable, and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.”

Essayli defended the raid as being within the scope of reasonable suspicion.

CHIRLA was among groups who sued the federal government for their “roving patrols” and enforcement tactics.

“We’re so proud of the work we did to document all of the abuses that led our courts to say you do need a temporary restraining from the federal agents as they are conducting immigration enforcement throughout the Los Angeles region,” Angelica Salas, executive director for CHIRLA, previously said.

“We believe in the courts, and we believe in the Constitution, and we’re going to continue to fight in the courts because we have rights, and we’re going to affirm those rights in every way possible,” she added.

Additionally, participants in Tuesday’s community stoppage were encouraged to purchase from local street vendors and, if possible, buy them out.

“There’s so many street vendors who feel terrorized, so if you can go to your local street vendor to buy their flowers, buy their food and buy the things that they’re selling because they deserve to have an opportunity in this moment that they are suffering,” Salas said.

Ike Silver, an assistant professor of marketing at the USC Marshall School of Business, told City News Service that he was pessimistic about seeing a clear impact as a result of a single boycott on the policy of any presidential administration.

“That said, to the extend that these kinds of events can add up through time, the cumulative impact can be to draw attention, raise awareness, change public opinion in the hopes that if enough of these happen over time, there will be sort of a shift in what’s demanded of leadership of business and of government,” Silver told CNS.

According to Silver, success of the boycott can be measured differently depending on the goals of the organizers.

“So my sense is that a 24-hour boycott is not likely to change Home Depot’s bottom line all that much in and of itself, but if it activates Angelenos who might otherwise not be paying attention or not be aware of Home Depot’s, or other businesses connection to this issue, then that can be sort of a different success metric, such that those people might demand action,” Silver said.

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.

“In the context of something like the Civil Rights Movement, it’s hard to say which boycott, which sit-in, which march was the one that changed things, but we can see that in aggregate over the course of history these kinds of actions do take effect — and so there’s an element of keeping faith,” Silver told CNS.",https://mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_1268966-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:58.669489

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.
In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids.
That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.","Dive Brief:

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies — which include allowing enforcement on school grounds, prolonged and increased immigration detention, and ambiguity around who may be targeted — are having “ripple effects” on immigrant children and children who are U.S. citizens living in mixed-status families, according to a new report from psychiatric researchers.

Chronic anxiety over detention or deportation is linked to absenteeism, classroom disengagement and heightened emotional distress, leading students “to avoid school or withdraw from public life.”

The July report calls schools “critical sites for early identification and support” but added they can also be places where immigrant youth “experience trauma-related avoidance, disengagement, or behavioral challenges.”

Dive Insight:

Students impacted by the current administration’s immigration policies face academic decline and social isolation, in addition to missing out on developmental supports that include access to trusted adults and school-based mental health services, per the report.

The researchers from University of California, Riverside and New York University suggest students may benefit from schools adopting trauma-informed practices, curbing punitive discipline, and ensuring students receive mental health support with special considerations for immigration-related issues.

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.

In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids. However, DHS has since clarified that it expects enforcement activity in schools to be “extremely rare.”

In April, officers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to enter two elementary schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, saying that they were conducting ”wellness checks.″ The officers reportedly made false claims that they had parents’ permission to speak with the students.

This month, ICE apprehended a parent during morning student drop-off hours in California’s Chula Vista Elementary School District while two children were reportedly in the car at the time of the arrest. That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.

“In this context, emotional distress becomes both an understandable and adaptive response to a life shaped by surveillance and exclusion,” the UC Riverside report said. “These dynamics underscore that immigration policy does not operate solely as a legal system—it functions as a structural determinant of health.”

The report confirms school leaders’ concerns that recent immigration policies are negatively impacting families and students, creating environments of fear and, in some cases, leading to absenteeism.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.

Denver Public Schools became the first school district to challenge the policy, saying in a February lawsuit that the Trump administration had created fear in students and families and led to a noticeable drop in school attendance across the district — particularly in schools with immigrant families.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3jfwuIvOgm52XyEnORvxzsp1O_GN6cj59Krr3SUUCWA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NDE2ODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-12 19:56:50.650961

The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s move to deploy 800 National Guard members in the District of Columbia over claims that crime is plaguing the city – despite historic lows – follows his use of the military in his administration's growing immigration crackdown.

“(D.C.’s) out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border,” Trump said at a Monday press conference where he was flanked by members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He vowed to do the same in more cities governed by Democrats.

Trump’s return to the White House was led by a campaign promise of mass deportations, tying newly arrived immigrants at the southern border with high crime rates and the need to use troops to detain and remove those migrants.

Since Inauguration Day, the president has sent thousands of National Guard members to be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border and has militarized strips of land along the border, putting migrants into contact with military personnel.

Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard in June in response to unrest over immigration raids was seen as a test case for use of the state-based military forces. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote on X on Monday that Trump “was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles” with that order.

“He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,” Newsom said. “This is what dictators do.”

‘Quick Reaction Force’

Now the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

The groups, who would be armed with riot gear and other weapons, would be split evenly between Alabama and Arizona, according to the Post.

The DOD proposal also calls for a rotation of service members from Army and Air Force National Guard units based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the Post.

National Guard members are typically in reserve and are some of the first responders to natural disasters.

The Department of Defense and the National Guard did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment about the “Quick Reaction Force” plans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Which cities are next?

At the Monday press conference, Trump specifically cited four cities that could see similar National Guard movements: Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors. Violent crime in all those cities has continued to trend downward, according to each city's police database.

Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, New York City and the entire state of California also all are on a new “sanctuary jurisdiction” list issued by the Department of Justice on Aug. 5. They are identified as “having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

But, unlike the district, where the president has control over the National Guard, state governors, under the law, have had control over their National Guard members.

Additionally, while Trump has seized control of the 3,400 officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department for 29 days due to the district's Home Rule Act, experts don’t see how that can legally be done with other local police departments.

“What they are doing in D.C. cannot be replicated outside of D.C. All of this is only possible because D.C. is not a state,” said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “There's no playbook for them to do what they seem to want to do outside of D.C.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Trump’s statements about sending in National Guard members into cities.

“The president is speaking about what he’d like to see take place in other cities across the country,” she said. “When the time comes we’ll talk about that. Starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin and it should serve as a model.”

Trump said he hoped other cities were “watching.”

“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.

Nunn said that even if the president were to federalize a state’s National Guard, those members would be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

“There is no statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that allows the military to participate in local law enforcement,” Nunn said.

Los Angeles

A trial is underway this week challenging the president’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.

The president deployed 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles after protests erupted against aggressive immigration actions by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting raids in Home Depot parking lots.

But the legal issue before a San Francisco court is not if the president’s actions were unlawful, but on the political question of who has authority over the National Guard.

Other governors in the states Trump mentioned as candidates for National Guard activation pushed back on the notion.

Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, said in a statement that the president’s decision to call in the National Guard to the District of Columbia “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”

Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the president could not send in the National Guard to Chicago.

“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” he said.

The conflict between Trump and the Democrats comes at the same time Newsom has threatened to launch a redistricting of California’s congressional districts in order to nullify Texas’ attempt to redraw maps to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.

And Pritzker is hosting in Illinois the Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session for redistricting.

Military forces

Since taking office for his second term, the president has signed five executive orders that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up Trump’s immigration crackdown.

More funding also soon will be at hand for Trump’s mass deportations. The massive tax and spending cut bill enacted in July has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown. It bolsters border security, increases immigration detention capacity and adds fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.

Some Republican governors have agreed to deploy their own National Guard members to aid the Trump administration in immigration enforcement, such as in Iowa and Tennessee. The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.

Nunn said that while it’s not typically normal for states to use National Guard members for local policing there is some precedent, such as when New York had members stationed in the New York City subway.

“What is unprecedented is the federal government using military personnel for sort of crime prevention, for regular policing,” Nunn said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/nationalguarddc.jpg?h=6eff8031&itok=1Y4cZBEi,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:48.777357

Testifying before Congress, Lutnick has faced questions from lawmakers about his position on who should be counted in the census.
In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the commerce secretary to follow a once-a-decade census schedule.
The press offices for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the White House did not immediately respond to NPR's inquiries.","Less than a week after President Trump said he has ordered a ""new"" census,"" the cabinet official who oversees the Census Bureau acknowledged Tuesday that Congress, not the president, has final say over the national head count that's used to reshape election maps and guide federal funding, NPR has exclusively learned.

Speaking at a town-hall event for the bureau's employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that when tallying the country's population, the census should differentiate people living in the U.S. without legal status from other residents, according to three Census Bureau employees, who asked NPR not to name them because they fear retaliation.

Lutnick said if a person has ""broken into the country,"" they need to be counted in the census, but they should be counted as someone who has ""broken into the country,"" the three employees confirmed to NPR.

Lutnick's remarks come amid a Republican-led campaign to use census data to redraw congressional voting maps in Texas and other states ahead of next year's midterm election in an attempt to maintain GOP control of the House of Representatives.

Amid this rare mid-decade redistricting push, Trump, Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and some GOP lawmakers in Congress have floated conducting a census before the next scheduled count in 2030 so that new results can be used to redistribute House seats among the states and redraw maps of congressional voting districts — all before the 2026 election.

Lutnick acknowledged legal hurdles facing any census before 2030

Given the short timeline, census experts have dismissed the idea of a 2025 or 2026 census as practically impossible. It usually takes the bureau more than a decade to prepare a count, and planning for the upcoming 2030 census began six years ago.

Lutnick's comments on Tuesday mark the first known acknowledgement by a top Trump administration official of the potential legal hurdles facing any attempt to carry out the president's census call.

The remarks also appear to reference Trump's Aug. 7 social media post calling for the U.S. census to, for the first time in the country's history, exclude people without legal status.

The 14th Amendment requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be counted in the 2030 census apportionment numbers, which are set to be used to determine each state's new share of House seats and Electoral College votes.

Testifying before Congress, Lutnick has faced questions from lawmakers about his position on who should be counted in the census. During his Senate confirmation hearing in February, Lutnick told Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii: ""Since the first sentence of the 14th Amendment of that clause says we will count each whole person, I promise you we will count each whole person. That's what the Constitution says. And we will stick right to it rigorously.""

But asked in June by Republican Rep. Dale Strong of Alabama about his thoughts on ""consistency from state to state not allowing non-U.S. citizens to be counted"" in the census, Lutnick said: ""Consistency makes sense.""

Some Republicans are still pushing for a census before the 2026 midterms

Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to carry out a national tally ""in such Manner as they shall by Law direct."" In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the commerce secretary to follow a once-a-decade census schedule. That federal law also allows for a mid-decade census in 2025, but it can't be used to redistribute House seats and a legal deadline to prepare for such a count has already passed.

Still, Trump said in the social media post that he instructed the Commerce Department to ""immediately begin work"" on a ""new"" census that excludes people living in the states without legal status. Trump has not clarified whether his post was referring to the 2030 census or an earlier one.

Hours after Trump's census call, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the Census Bureau ""will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data"" and ""accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

The department replied with that same statement when asked by NPR on Tuesday whether Lutnick has communicated to the White House his position on Congress' authority over the census and whether the commerce secretary plans to propose adding a census question about a person's immigration status, which the bureau has yet to test.

The press offices for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the White House did not immediately respond to NPR's inquiries.

Trump has publicly backed a proposal by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to change current federal law and allow for a new census, redistribution of House seats and a new round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election.

Greene's bill also calls for excluding not only people without legal status, but all people living in the states without U.S. citizenship, such as green card holders, from what the 14th Amendment requires to be the ""whole number of persons in each state.""

Last week, Republican Rep. Randy Fine of Florida, introduced a similar proposal. Together, both bills currently have less than a handful of sponsors and are stuck in committee.

On Monday, another Republican official from Florida weighed in on the census with a letter to Lutnick referencing Trump's ""recent census directive"" by social media post.

Florida's state Attorney General James Uthmeier — a former Trump administration official who helped come up with a failed plan to exclude people without legal status from the 2020 census apportionment numbers — made two proposals.

Uthmeier suggested states get new shares of House seats before the 2026 midterm election based on a census ""recount"" in areas of states that the Census Bureau estimates it over- or undercounted in 2020. He also proposed ""correcting"" the census data used to guide trillions in federal funding for public services in communities with those miscounting estimates. The bureau's researchers and an internal watchdog have raised concerns about the usability of those estimates.

""We are energized by President Trump's leadership,"" Uthmeier wrote, ""and we look forward to hearing from you and working together to resolve these issues.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbe%2Fcd3a700c4718b0bbab36ddb64f36%2Fgettyimages-2197465985.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:50.549900

It stated: “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.” In last year’s report, the state department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.","Donald Trump’s administration has significantly changed a key US government report on human rights worldwide, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president, such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have well-established histories of abuses.

Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”.

The report’s section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023.

The report was delayed for months as Trump appointees altered an earlier state department draft dramatically to bring it in line with “America First” values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, “Liberty” and “Security of the Person”.

“There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the 2024 report said about El Salvador, in sharp contrast with the 2023 report that talked about “significant human rights issues” and listed them as credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.

Washington’s bilateral ties with El Salvador have strengthened since Trump took office, as the administration has deported people to El Salvador with help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house the migrants in a high-security mega-prison.

The Trump administration has moved away from the traditional US promotion of democracy and human rights, seeing it as interference in another country’s affairs, even as it criticized countries selectively, consistent with its broader policy towards a particular country.

One example is Europe, where Trump officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they see as suppression of rightwing leaders, including in Romania, Germany and France, and accused European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration.

For decades, the state department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared after a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in April wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists”, saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the state department found the human rights situation declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the supreme court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 presidential election loss to the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch-hunt” and called it grounds for a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods.

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened. It stated: “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

August 12, 2025 4:40 pm

NEW YORK – In a win for immigrants’ rights, a U.S. District Court granted a temporary restraining order today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order would also require ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to medical care, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

The order comes just days after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit over the abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza. The order will remain in place for at least 14 days while the judge considers longer-term relief.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” said Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. ""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond.”

Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York, said, ""We welcome the decision by Judge Kaplan to place clear limits on the disturbing and unlawful conditions to which immigrants have been subjected at 26 Federal Plaza. This ruling sends a hopeful message, one that reinforces what everyone knows to be true: ICE cannot confine people in inhumane conditions, nor can it obstruct their access to counsel. We will remain vigilant to ensure ICE complies with the court’s order.”

“The conditions and lack of attorney access at 26 Federal Plaza have been horrifying and unconscionable,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “Judge Kaplan’s Temporary Restraining Order imposes basic accountability on ICE and requires that it meet constitutional standards, as all human beings deserve.”

“The Constitution requires that no one — especially someone unlawfully arrested at their immigration hearing, which happened to so many people in this case — should have to endure the dehumanizing conditions we've challenged in 26 Federal Plaza,"" said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We look forward to continuing this fight and stopping ICE's unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

Festivals take a stand Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.
And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said.","The week President Trump was inaugurated, Connecticut’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus spoke out against what they say is racial profiling of Latino communities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Over the summer, reggaeton artist Bad Bunny publicly shamed ICE after witnessing a detainment on the island. And Wesleyan alum and legendary Nuyorican Lin Manuel Miranda recently turned the 10th anniversary of his Broadway hit “Hamilton” into a fundraiser for immigrants.

Here in Connecticut, Puerto Ricans are increasingly standing with their fellow Latinos against the immigration crackdown.

When a New Haven high schooler from Guatemala was detained by ICE in July, it wasn’t just Latinos who came out to the rally for his return.

Rev. Nathan Empsall is the priest-in-charge at St. Paul and St. James Episcopal Church in Wooster Square. He says attendance at the food pantry and clothing closet the church partners with is down in recent weeks, and volunteers say it’s because of fears of ICE.

“If this was about enforcing justice and laws like the authoritarians tell us,” he told rallygoers, “they wouldn't arrest people outside courthouses, they wouldn't target Puerto Rican neighborhoods, and they wouldn't be arresting our 11th graders.”

Empsall says he was referring to cases reported in similar communities, like the detainment of a Puerto Rican veteran in Newark in January and the presence of a dozen ICE agents outside of a Puerto Rican museum in Chicago in July.

In a statement to Connecticut Public, ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington said “these rumors only serve to cause fear and incite violence toward our brave officers.” He said the idea that ICE is targeting Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the state is “not only ludicrous and dangerous, but completely false.”

“What I find as ludicrous and dangerous is the racial profiling that is happening right now and that is being advanced by ICE,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

Matos is Puerto Rican and has lived and worked as an advocate in Connecticut for over two decades.

“I will tell you personally that I have fielded a number of phone calls from Puerto Ricans asking me if they should carry their passports because they're planning to head to Puerto Rico, and they're afraid of the experience that they will have and the possibility that they will be stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said.

Why? Because of Newark, Chicago, the Puerto Rican restaurant that was raided in Philadelphia, the Puerto Rican family that was detained while out shopping in Milwaukee.

“There are examples throughout the entire country of Puerto Ricans being detained. That is why Puerto Ricans, Latinos, brown and Black people are afraid,” Matos said. “Even when they benefit from US citizenship, that does not stop the level of fear.”

Concerns spread at celebrations

Fear was a real concern for Elba and Carmelo Valle at the Salsa Meets Jazz Festival in downtown Hartford. Half of their Puerto Rican friend group headed to Parkville Market afterward to keep the party going. But that day, during a Peruvian festival at the market, a rumor started to spread that ICE was there and arresting folks.

“Who knows where it can happen?” Elba said. “And then, if we see that, it's just the anger. It's really anger. It's not right. It's not right the way they're going about it, I don't think.”

Carmelo brought up a common argument against the recent deportations: ICE is separating families.

“Yeah,” Elba agreed, “they're separating families. It's heartbreaking.”

At Parkville Market, it turns out EMS was just responding to a medical emergency that day. But the fear that any official in uniform could be ICE increasingly keeps many Latinos home — and some Puerto Ricans questioning what their role is in all this.

“What can we do?” Elba said. “What can we do but get closer together? You know what I'm saying? Come as a community and as a family to, you know, at least try to help out.”

Officials ‘call out’ the targeting of Latinos

The National Puerto Rican Agenda released a statement that reads, in part, “As a national organization rooted in the Puerto Rican diaspora, we know firsthand the importance of family unity, community stability, and the struggle for dignity and inclusion. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, we will not remain silent while our immigrant brothers and sisters are dehumanized.”

Connecticut State Rep. Christopher Rosario echoes that sentiment. He’s a member of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus and represents many Puerto Ricans in Bridgeport.

“Even though we — quote, unquote — shouldn't have anything to worry about, as we are citizens, Puerto Rico always gets second class treatment from the federal government, so it's just no different,” Rosario said.

Rosario says he’s heard the reports, too, of U.S Citizens being detained, even if briefly, in other states.

“And anytime there's an incident where there's a Puerto Rican, or anyone, for that matter, that's detained or held by ICE, we must call it out and work with our federal authorities to make sure this doesn't happen,” he said.

Festivals take a stand

Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.

Avelo Airlines is one of the cheapest ways to fly direct from New Haven to San Juan to visit loved ones on the island. But after Avelo signed up to run deportation flights for the Trump administration, pro-immigrant protesters and the group Puerto Ricans United came out against the decision. Joe Rodriguez is the president of PRU and a vice president at the National Puerto Rican Agenda.

“We're community first. And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said. “And when our brothers and sisters are reaching out to us for support, we need to be there, because they have been there for us in our time of need: be it Hurricane Maria and other natural disasters where our community has partnered with us.”

PRU puts on New Haven’s Puerto Rican festival each year, and for the last two, Avelo has been a sponsor of the event. This year PRU’s board voted unanimously to cut ties.

“We felt it only right, given who we are as an organization, our values and what we stand for, to stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters and say before we even engage in conversations, we're going to just nip it in the bud now and say, ‘No, we're not going to do it,’” he said.

In an emailed statement to NPR, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy called the decision to run deportation flights “a sensitive and complicated topic.”

""After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 Crewmembers employed for years to come,” he said.

Video obtained by ABC15 shows an ICE agent and a student walking together to Southwest School, which serves students from kindergarten to eighth grade, on Dobbins Road in south Phoenix on Tuesday, August 5.

Vehicles that appear to be from ICE are also lined up near school property lines, though not on the school's property itself.

People First Project, which tracks ICE encounters around the Valley, said the student was walked to school by the agent after their guardian was detained by ICE.

Roosevelt School District, which operates Southwest School, said it was aware of ICE's presence last week and was ""actively monitoring the situation,"" noting it had not been contacted by any immigration enforcement agencies.

“We understand how deeply concerning these reports may be for many of our families,” Dr. Ashley Hodge, President of Roosevelt School District Governing Board, said in a statement shared with ABC15. “On behalf of our entire Board, we want to assure you that the safety, dignity, and well-being of every student and family remain at the heart of our mission.”

On Monday, parents at the school were surprised to learn about the operation.

""That's kind of strange to me,"" Mark Childress, whose son attends preschool at Southwest, said. ""I think certain places are sacred ground... kids should feel safe coming to school.""

It's unclear how many people were detained during the operation, which took place around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, on the second day of school. People First Project said as many as three people were pulled over and potentially detained by ICE.

Clarissa Vela, founder of People First Project, says the group keeps its eye on ICE activity as a way to ensure agents are following the law.

""We're not anti-police, we just want to make sure that people are being treated fairly and their rights are not being violated,"" she said.

Vela said monitors in her group have witnessed ICE running plates at schools and picking up parents who were going through the legal immigration process. Vela said her group was unsure what, if any, crimes the guardians of the Southwest students were being accused of.

People First Project has seen an uptick in interactions with ICE near schools recently, with Vela saying she was aware of about 40 cases in the last week.

ICE's ability to conduct operations around schools is a change made in the last few months.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security memo sent out on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration rescinded a policy stopping ICE from detaining people and conducting immigration operations in ""sensitive"" areas such as churches and schools. The guidance was put in place during President Joe Biden's administration.

Phil Ortega, an Arizona immigration attorney, views the decision to drop the sensitive area policy as an attempt to intimidate immigrants into engaging in public life.

""My personal opinion was that the recission of that policy was just a way to strike fear into the community and cause individuals that would normally feel safe to, you know, send their kids to school or to go to churches,"" Ortega said. ""This would discourage them from doing those things.""

With classes back in session and an increased federal emphasis on boosting ICE detention numbers, both Ortega and People First Project expect to see more ICE activity near schools.

ABC15 reached out to DHS to find out more about what crime the people at Southwest School had been accused of. DHS said it couldn't share more information about the operation or the individuals involved unless ABC15 could identify the individuals.

Arizona Superintendent Tom Horne declined to comment on the operation, saying it was between the district and ICE.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c6b1c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/854x448+0+16/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2Fbd5%2F5c3d34b8b29a45469a86c02775b7a2cf%2Fbd5c9620b4e048db9d6e59a6acf7eff8%2Fposter_7c414f421a8b44d8a894f0d4470c56d7.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:57:09.930907

Kim Reynolds says 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers will be deployed to offer ""administrative and logistical support"" to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement beginning in September.

Reynolds announced the mission on Tuesday, Aug. 12. The mission is a response to a request by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and will begin Sept. 8.

""Just as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws — this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""By providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.""

Reynolds said Aug. 6 in Cedar Rapids that the Iowa National Guard was ready to ""step up and help"" ICE with logistics and other administrative tasks, but at that time no agreement had been finalized.

Now, Reynolds said the U.S. Secretary of Defense has authorized the use of the 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers under Title 32 of the federal code, which means the soldiers will be on active duty under state, rather than federal control, but the federal government will cover their pay and benefits.

The mission is approved through Nov. 15.

National Guard mission latest step Reynolds has taken on immigration

The National Guard mission is the latest step Reynolds has taken to direct state officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

This spring, the Iowa Department of Public Safety signed what's known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE to deputize a three-member DPS task force to carry out some federal immigration enforcement functions, including arresting and interrogating people who are in violation of federal immigration laws.

Reynolds also filed a complaint with the Iowa attorney general's office alleging that Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx violated Iowa law with a Facebook post discouraging law enforcement to cooperate with ""detainer"" requests from federal immigration officials if they weren't approved by a judge.

Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Marx, but later dropped the lawsuit. Winneshiek County does comply with ICE detainer requests, despite Marx's post.

In past years, Reynolds has deployed Iowa National Guard soldiers and Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist Texas with immigration enforcement efforts.

Immigrant rights groups criticize National Guard mission

Immigrant rights groups have criticized Reynolds' support for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts and now the Iowa National Guard's participation in immigration enforcement.

""Using Iowa troopers against Iowa communities will not stand,"" said Alejandra Escobar, an organizer with Escucha Mi Voz Iowa, said during an Aug. 5 rally in Cedar Rapids.

Joe Henry, Iowa state political director for the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa, said using National Guard troops for immigration enforcement will cause more problems than solutions and Reynolds should focus on more serious issues.

""Gov. Reynolds’ plan is a misuse of Iowa’s resources. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility not the job of Iowans in our state,"" Henry said in a statement Aug. 11. ""The governor should be putting her efforts toward the real problems we’re facing in Iowa like climbing cancer rates, the second-worst economy in the nation, poor access to health care and dangerous levels of water pollutants in our rivers.""

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.
“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.
As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.
At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups.","On the final day of the Second Pan-American Congress this month, more than 60 delegates from 12 countries made their way into the Secretary of Public Education headquarters in downtown Mexico City. As leaders from the Americas walked through the building’s passages and patios, many stopped to take pictures in front of the walls lined with murals from famous artists, including Diego Rivera.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site served as the location of the final plenary of the three-day gathering aimed at uniting progressive and democratic forces in the Western hemisphere to take on rising far right authoritarianism.

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro.

From this hall, the message from Mexico was unambiguous: The peoples and the elected representatives of this hemisphere are ready to act to confront the global threat of fascism.

“We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.”

When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. Trump has been able to follow this strategy to varying degrees of success, in part due to the lack of unity regarding the threat he represents to the entire world.

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.

From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump’s open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links.

One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response.

One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended.

Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia’s 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America.

“We don’t see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added.

The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas.

Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.

“These corporations don’t care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing,” said Tlaib.

But now she says she feels “less alone in this fight against corporate greed, against corporate polluters, against those that don’t care about our communities thriving.”

Tlaib cited her conversations with Canadian MPs about the need to collaborate in the fight against the environmental threat posed by the Line 5 pipeline that threatens water systems in both the U.S. and Canada.

“We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout.

Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman to serve in U.S. Congress and an important voice on the global stage speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, also expressed gratitude at the centering of the Palestinian people’s cause at the gathering. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity.

“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.

Coming on the heels of July’s Emergency Conference on Palestine, which likewise saw world leaders gather to take action in an attempt to halt the genocide, delegates at the congress said recognizing the state of Palestine was only a starting point.

“In our view, much deeper actions, much more forceful voices — and of course, the role being played by multilateral organizations, which have been stripped of their value and the ability to defend life in the face of the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian people — are essential,” said Pizarro.

Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel.

In addition to calling for an end to the genocide against the Palestinian people, participants in the conference discussed Trump’s human rights violations against migrants and refugees, and the need to confront climate change.

During his speech at the opening session, Mexican Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña said the two defining features of the rising fascist threat in the world were the suffering inflicted on Palestinians and the abuse of migrants by the U.S.

“It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña.

The mistreatment of migrants is the clearest case study on the necessity of confronting fascism in the Americas. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador’s far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release.

Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. More recently, the Mexican government has had to face down repeated tariff threats from Trump over the issue of migration.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.

The selection of Mexico City as the host of the Second Pan-American Congress (the first having been held last year in Bogotá, Colombia) offered delegates the opportunity to learn from the political project known locally as the “Fourth Transformation,” the leftist national political project to shift Mexico to a post-neoliberal model that began with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in 2018 and continued under President Sheinbaum.

With the election of Sheinbaum in 2024, Mexico proved to be one of the few countries that bucked a trend in which voters ousted incumbents and replaced them, in many cases, with right-wing populists, such as Javier Milei in Argentina.

Sheinbaum, who has been lauded for repeatedly standing up to Trump, welcomed delegates at the National Palace, allowing representatives from throughout the hemisphere to share their experiences resisting the U.S. president — and also to share firsthand how Mexico has been able to not only navigate an intemperate neighbor, but also continue to press forward with its anti-neoliberal political agenda.

Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada’s House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful.

“What’s happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we’re witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout.

“I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan.

The challenge facing elected representatives now is translating the positive experiences from the congress in Mexico into action in their home countries.

During a Pan-American Congress event at the Esperanza Iris Theatre in Mexico City, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar renewed her pledge to fight for marginalized communities throughout the hemisphere from her place inside the U.S. Congress, signaling to the peoples of the Global South that they have an ally in her.

“Since being in the elected office, I’ve made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout.

Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights.

The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way.’”

Trump’s aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump.

At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups. From efforts to advance an explicit recognition of systemic racism throughout the Americas, to calls for a new global order based on human dignity and solidarity among nations, there was widespread consensus on the need for stronger international cooperation to confront the global rise of fascism, denouncing its role in migrant persecution in the U.S., and the genocide in Gaza.

With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point.

“There is nothing like our sisters down south and what they deal with, but [they] continuously find joy in the work that they do on behalf of the communities they serve, and that is inspiring and I’ll take that with me,” concluded Omar.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/030825_Clausura_Congreso_Panamericano-27.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 16:56:38.343319

Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data.
Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.
It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents.
It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.","President Trump is booting out illegal immigrants faster than President Biden added them, according to the latest Census Bureau numbers, which show an unprecedented drop in the number of immigrants living in the U.S.

The total number of foreign-born people dropped by 2.2 million from January to July, and most of that — 1.6 million — was among the illegal immigrant population, said Steven A. Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies who crunched the numbers.

It’s an almost unfathomable turnaround from the Biden years, when illegal immigrants surged into the U.S. at record rates, netting about 120,000 new people each month.

Over the past six months, though, the illegal immigrant population has been dropping at nearly 270,000 a month, or more than twice the rate of increase under Mr. Biden.

“The best evidence we have is that the illegal population is now falling at a rate that even exceeds the massive growth that we had in Biden’s four years,” Mr. Camarota said.

The decline coincides with a massive effort by the Trump administration, which is increasing formal arrests and deportations and has invested heavily in machinery to try to encourage illegal immigrants to leave on their own.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that foreign leaders in the hemisphere tell her they are seeing a wave of people arriving in their countries after having left the U.S.

“Over and over again, I’m hearing that hundreds of thousands of their citizens are coming home, voluntarily,” she said.

The new data comes from the Current Population Survey, a monthly Census Bureau report that is used to produce data such as the monthly unemployment figures. One of its questions prods respondents to reveal where they were born, which produces the overall immigration number.

In January, it stood at 53.3 million, an all-time high in sheer number and as a percentage of the total population.

Last month, it dipped below 51.1 million.

Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data. He figures that rose from 10.2 million at the start of the Biden years to 15.8 million in January, before tumbling to 14.2 million now.

Not all the illegal immigrants went home. Some are part of the normal churn of migration, such as gaining legal status or dying. That was true for the Biden years as well.

Mr. Camarota said most of those who left were likely newcomers from the Biden years or were otherwise less rooted in the U.S., and thus it was easier to pick up and leave.

That could presage diminishing returns for Mr. Trump’s enforcement push.

The implications of the drop are massive.

Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.

The natural net increase from births is about 500,000. If the U.S. has already shed more than 2 million people, that would easily swamp the births.

Mr. Camarota said the decline gives communities breathing space after the increases of the Biden years.

“It’s likely that this represents a savings in money for the taxpayer,” he said. “It will take pressure off schools and hospitals and other services. It’s likely it will potentially create job opportunities for Americans.”

Immigrant rights groups say the downside to a drop is that businesses will lose part of their workforce.

Indeed, farmers and hospitality groups have been flooding the Trump administration with complaints that they can’t get workers to show up anymore amid the high-profile wave of immigration arrests.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated some form of leniency for illegal immigrants who work in those areas of the economy, though he has yet to deliver any concrete policy change.

Mr. Camarota said there may be good reason to wait.

He said there is no evidence from the numbers that the employment of the U.S.-born has fallen. Indeed, the data suggests it has surged in recent months, which could mean people who have struggled to hold jobs are now gaining them.

“That doesn’t mean bad economic news, necessarily,” he said. “It probably means per capita GDP has gone up.”

The CPS data does come with some caveats.

It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents. Mr. Camarota said that’s not likely.

It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/07/15/Immigration_Courts_Arrests_70071_c0-250-6000-3750_s1200x700.jpg?2cb823f519263a3e55a419724463fd44fb7f7c61,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:54.582866

“Arresting U.S. citizens,” Friedman continued, is “an extremely concerning overreach of civil immigration enforcement authority” and “completely unprecedented as far as I know.” Is it legal for ICE to arrest citizens?
So while ICE officers don’t have the legal power to arrest citizens for immigration violations (which they appear to violate every time they arrest U.S. citizens who they suspect are undocumented), ICE officers are legally allowed to arrest citizens for federal crimes, so long as they have reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed.
Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.
In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents.","While Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested at least 38 U.S. citizens protesters in Los Angeles this year, last week’s arrest of two protesters in downtown San Francisco appears to be the first time the agency has detained citizens here, according to immigration lawyers from the Bay Area.

“I haven’t seen ICE arresting [U.S. citizen] protestors in the Bay since entering the legal field nearly 20 years ago,” wrote Aliya Karmali, an Oakland immigration attorney and member of the Demonstrations Legal Support Collaborative.

On Friday, ICE agents tackled and detained two protesters, both U.S. citizens, outside the San Francisco ICE field office at 630 Sansome St.

ICE has “been known to racially profile and detain people who may not have documentation of their citizenship,” wrote Karmali, referring to the detention — and sometimes deportation — of U.S. citizens. But now, she continued, they seem to be expanding their authority over all citizens, to arrest for federal crimes in L.A. and here.

But even if ICE detains someone, that federal crime still must be proven through a trial. According to reporting by the Los Angeles Times, only seven of the 38 people charged by ICE in L.A. have been successfully indicted. The rest signed plea deals, had their charges reduced significantly, or even had their cases dismissed — in a number of instances because Department of Homeland Security officers made false statements about the arrests.

That seven out of 38 success record is dismal. For context, around 90 percent of general federal prosecutions result in the defendant pleading guilty, and most others are convicted during trial.

“Trump’s directive to ICE agents to arrest protesters — just like much of his administration’s immigration agenda — is unlawful,” wrote Jennifer Friedman, interim director of the Immigration Unit at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office. “Arresting U.S. citizens,” Friedman continued, is “an extremely concerning overreach of civil immigration enforcement authority” and “completely unprecedented as far as I know.”

Is it legal for ICE to arrest citizens? The answer is, sometimes, yes. But ICE is held accountable to two seemingly dueling provisions.

One policy defines clearly that “ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen.”

Another authorizes immigration officers to arrest any person, regardless of immigration status, “for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States,” if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed.

So while ICE officers don’t have the legal power to arrest citizens for immigration violations (which they appear to violate every time they arrest U.S. citizens who they suspect are undocumented), ICE officers are legally allowed to arrest citizens for federal crimes, so long as they have reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed.

But an ICE officer can only conduct these arrests if they’ve been certified for “successfully completing a training course encompassing such arrests.” That’s impossible to check as most of the ICE officers seen in public cover their faces and don’t wear identifying information, making it impossible to identify the ICE officer to check his or her training record.

One such arrest happened last Friday, when ICE officers took U.S. citizen Amanda Trebach into federal custody, outside Terminal Island, a military base off the coast of Los Angeles that ICE has been using to prepare for raids. Trebach was released the following day with no charges, after hundreds of protesters expressed support for her freedom.

Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.

In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents. One of the people detained, who asked for anonymity given their ongoing case, reported bruises on their ribs and wrists.

Other video footage shows that San Francisco police officers, who previously arrested over 200 anti-ICE protesters in June, and the Federal Protective Services (“Homeland Security’s Domestic Police Force”) were also at 630 Sansome St. earlier in the day. But agents wearing ICE uniforms were the ones to make the detentions.

The protesters were held for approximately two and half hours in separate holding cells inside the federal building, after being stripped of their personal belongings. When released, they were served a number of citations that the protesters deny — including interference with public duties, which ICE has leveraged against many of the people that agents detained in L.A.

It’s unclear whether the protesters in San Francisco were simply detained, or formally arrested and booked. They won’t know for sure until the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney decides whether to press charges, which could take weeks or not happen at all.

The story was updated the afternoon of Aug. 12.

The corrected story is below.

A 4-year-old boy’s ongoing care for stage 4 kidney cancer was interrupted when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers illegally deported him, his sister and mother “without even a semblance of due process,” attorneys for the family say.

Though they are U.S. citizens and were born in Louisiana, the boy and his 7-year-old sister were deported to Honduras along with their 25-year-old mother, who is a Honduran citizen, on April 25, according to a federal lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The filing uses pseudonyms for the family, referring to the brother and sister as Romeo and Ruby and their mother as Rosario.

Before their deportations, Romeo, now 5, was receiving “life-saving” treatment at a New Orleans children’s hospital for his “rare and aggressive form” of cancer, following his diagnosis at age 2, a complaint says.

“As a direct consequence of ICE’s unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States,” his family’s attorneys wrote in the complaint.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Romeo and his family, as well as a second family also wrongly deported by ICE under similar circumstances on April 25, according to the National Immigration Project, Gibson Dunn, Most & Associates, and Ware Immigration, groups representing the case.

The second family includes Julia, 30, a mother from Honduras. She has two daughters, Jade, 2, a U.S. citizen born in Baton Rouge, and Janelle, 11, also a Honduran citizen. Those names are also pseudonyms.

The same week of both families’ deportations, Rosario and Julia separately went to what they thought were supposed to be “regularly scheduled check-ins” with an ICE contractor.

However, officers with ICE apprehended both women and their children “in hotel rooms” in secret, the National Immigration Project said in a July 31 news release.

ICE “denied them the opportunity to speak to family and make decisions about or arrangements for their minor children, denied them access to counsel, and deported them within less than a day in one case and just over 2 days in the other,” the advocacy organization said.

According to the lawsuit, ICE did not let Rosario or Julia decide whether they wanted their children to come with them to Honduras or to make arrangements for them to stay in the U.S. with other loved ones.

“Given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States,” the complaint says.

DHS, however, maintains both women wanted their children with them.

In response to McClatchy News’ request for comment for DHS and ICE on Aug. 11, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “the media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported. This is false and irresponsible.”

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” McLaughlin added. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

The lawsuit has been brought against Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as well as New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Brian Acuna, the office’s Assistant Field Office Director Scott Ladwig and the office’s former director, Mellissa Harper.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre declined to comment.

‘Detained and deported U.S. citizens’

After being deported in April, Rosario said in a statement shared in National Immigration Project’s news release that life in Hondorus has been “incredibly hard.”

“I don’t have the resources to care for my children the way they need,” Rosario said.

The morning of April 25, ICE officers are accused of waking Rosario, Romeo and Ruby and forcing them into a van.

They drove them to an airport in the Alexandria area and had them flown to Honduras, the lawsuit says.

With her son still in need of specialized treatment for his cancer, which had spread to his lungs, she has to send Romeo “back and forth” from Honduras to the U.S. for care, without her, according to the complaint.

“Even though she has very limited financial resources, Rosario has already had to pay for flights and travel companions to enable her children to return to the United States for Romeo’s necessary medical appointments,” the complaint says.

Romeo, whose health has worsened, has been temporarily staying in the U.S. for cancer treatment, according to the filing.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare that ICE wrongly arrested, detained and deported Rosario, Romeo and Ruby, as well as Julia, Jade and Janelle, in violation of their constitutional rights.

“This whole situation has been incredibly stressful,” Julia said in a statement shared by the National Immigration Project.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she added.

In a statement to McClatchy News, National Immigration Project attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones said “ICE put these families through a series of incredibly traumatizing experiences, taking actions that are completely shocking from a human perspective and illegal even by ICE’s own standards.”

“ICE denied these families the fundamental opportunity to make meaningful choices about the care and custody of their children, and detained and deported U.S. citizens in flagrant violation of its own policy and the law,” Alvarez-Jones added.

The families are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and demand a jury trial.

Days later, his mother and sister made a decision that likely pleased the Trump administration: They followed Colindres out of the United States.

Colindres’ mother, Ada Bell Baquedano Amador, told Spectrum News 1 that she and her two kids had left Honduras to escape rampant violence in the country. In 2023, an immigration judge denied their asylum application and issued a final order of removal. Now, Baquedano Amador was wearing an ankle monitor, and the Trump administration had given her 30 days to leave the United States. With her son gone, she decided to return with her daughter to the country they’d once fled.

“Thank God, this is all going to be over,” Baquedano Amador said.

That sentiment, variations of which have reverberated across the country, is exactly what President Donald Trump wants. There are millions of undocumented people in the United States ― far more than Trump will likely be able to deport on his own. So the administration is working overtime to create a pervasive atmosphere of punishment, uncertainty and fear that it hopes will convince people in the immigration legal system to leave the United States on their own.

The Trump administration has claimed that those who “self-deport” now will get the chance to reenter the U.S. later. (“Self-deport” is not a legal term; two Mexican American satirists invented it over 30 years ago.)

But leaving the country without following specific legal procedures could make it far more difficult to return ― and the administration has consistently failed to inform people in immigration proceedings of crucial details that could affect their future cases.

Meanwhile, the administration has filled airwaves with advertisements urging people to leave the country, plastered jails and courtrooms with misleading information, cut funding for legal aid programs, announced steep penalties for not leaving the country after receiving a removal order, revived a World War II-era law threatening criminal prosecution unless people who aren’t citizens register with the government, and massively ramped up efforts to arrest and jail people during the course of their proceedings. Officials have also used the brutal conditions in immigration detention as self-deportation propaganda.

“DHS has made it abundantly clear that those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported,” a department spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement.

Some of the intimidation and pressure tactics are obvious, like painting immigrants as “foreign invaders,” or having masked agents jumping out of rental trucks and making arrests in immigration court. Others are just coming into view. The New York Times reported last week on a pattern in which immigration officials have arrested and detained parents, separating them from their children and threatening to send the children to shelters unless the parents agree to be deported as a family ― an echo of Trump’s first-term “family separation” policy. And a DHS spokesperson recently pressured DACA recipients to “self-deport,” even though the program offers a temporary protection from deportation.

Voluntary departures from the U.S. have spiked in recent weeks.

The fear tactics and hyperaggressive enforcement, critics say, have also turned the immigration system on its head.

Where the government was once at least marginally concerned with protecting the legal rights of migrants and asylum seekers, it is now actively seeking to subvert those protections, all with the goal of purging the United States of millions of unwanted neighbors as quickly as possible.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible,” said Imelda Maynard, director of legal services at Estrella del Paso, which provides free immigration legal services to migrants and refugees in West Texas and New Mexico.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible.”

“It’s all working hand-in-hand to try and get people to have no hope, and to just say, ‘This is too hard, I give up.’”

‘And Then Chaos’

The pressure campaign has included a sustained effort to limit legal resources available to people in immigration detention.

Unlike in criminal court, people in immigration proceedings are not guaranteed a lawyer if they can’t afford one, even though legal representation is a key factor in the success of immigration cases.

To help address this gap, the federal government has historically provided funding for efforts like the Legal Orientation Program, in which legal service providers give people in immigration detention information about the immigration system and their legal rights.

Not anymore. The Trump administration terminated these programs in April. Legal aid groups have sued in response, and while some terminations have been halted by judges, children and adults alike are being left without key legal information as their cases proceed.

For Estrella del Paso ― which is among those fighting in court to restore the legal aid programs ― the terminations have ended access to lists of who is being held in local immigration detention centers, as well as eliminated the free, private phone lines detainees once used to consult with the group’s staff in confidence.

With the legal aid programs gone, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, often misleading campaign to convince people to simply leave the country, even though this could end up negatively impacting future efforts to reenter the United States.

“You have a cutting off of information first, so that people don’t have access to correct information, followed by disinformation ― and then chaos,” Maynard said.

Case in point: The Trump administration has blanketed detention centers and immigration courtrooms around the country with posters pressuring people to abandon their legal cases and leave the country. Attorneys and other observers say the information on the posters is misleading or downright false.

Advertisement

One version of the poster, a red-and-blue “Warning To Self-Deport,” has been spotted across the country in hallways, detention center libraries, and attached to case files ― “even orders granting relief, like asylum,” according to Amelia Dagen, a staff attorney for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which provides free legal representation to people in the immigration system and participates in impact litigation.

“Individuals who have just won asylum are eventually going to be eligible to apply for green cards, and then for citizenship, and so this messaging about self-deportation doesn’t even apply to them, because they are no longer deportable,” Dagen added. (Like Estrella del Paso, the Amica Center has sued the administration over terminations of legal aid programs in which it participates.)

But the issues with these posters go far beyond who’s receiving them.

Among them: The posters make no mention of the expansive legal rights of undocumented people to remain in the United States. People who fear persecution in their home country are allowed to remain in the United States while they make an asylum case to an immigration judge, for example, or to pursue protections under the international Convention Against Torture.

Advertisement

But the poster doesn’t say any of this. Instead it uses charged language that has no legal significance ― “illegal alien,” “self-deport” ― and absolutist phrases that don’t represent how immigration law actually works. For example, it threatens “immediate deportation” for people who don’t immediately leave on their own, though so-called “expedited removal” only applies in specific circumstances. Similarly, it warns of being “barred from returning,” even though bars to reentering the United States are based on individual circumstances and are often temporary.

What’s more, the poster ignores the fact that simply leaving the United States could have catastrophic legal consequences. If someone leaves the country without resolving their immigration case ― and if they miss a scheduled immigration hearing as a result ― they could receive a deportation order in absentia, which in turn could make them ineligible for certain forms of legal relief in the future, or possibly lead to a bar on reentry. For those who have lived out-of-status in the United States and accrued “unlawful presence,” leaving the country this way could lead to a multiyear bar on coming back to the United States.

One U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “Self-Deportation” webpage does acknowledge this issue, but makes no firm commitment to addressing it.

“If you’re already in proceedings before a Department of Justice immigration judge, leaving may result in a bar to reentry, which means you may not be able to return to the U.S. for a specific period of time,” the page says. “ICE may agree to seek dismissal of removal proceedings if you prove you left the U.S. on your own — and that way, you may be able to avoid getting a final order of removal (and the negative consequences that come with it).”

There are specific ways people can leave the country while protecting their legal rights, including requesting voluntary departure from an immigration judge. But every immigration case is unique, and respondents should ideally work with an attorney to chart their path forward ― something else the poster doesn’t mention.

Instead, it vaguely promotes “future opportunity for legal immigration” if people heed its warning.

Trump’s attacks on legal aid programs, combined with his administration’s aggressive focus on pressuring people to surrender their rights, is a noxious mix, especially for the most vulnerable populations in detention.

When Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) visited Florida’s infamous Krome detention center in June, his staff observed that the center’s Behavioral Health Unit ― “a unit dedicated to assisting individuals with mental health needs” ― had “a flyer in a common room in the unit that asked, ‘Do you want to go home?’ and provided information about how to self-deport.”

Two months prior, the administration had ordered legal service providers to discontinue the National Qualified Representative Program, which for over a decade provided government-funded attorneys for people in immigration proceedings who’ve been found mentally incompetent to represent themselves.

Three weeks ago, a federal district judge ordered the administration to reinstate the policy, writing in a motion granting plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction that without the program, “People who have been adjudicated by immigration courts to be mentally incompetent under existing procedures will be left to do precisely what a court has just found they are not capable of doing—represent themselves in legal proceedings.”

Advertisement

“Although Defendants insist that there are sufficient safeguards in place without the NQRP to mitigate the harm to individuals deemed mentally incompetent, the record provides substantial reason to conclude otherwise,” Judge Amir Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote.

It’s not clear how many people who qualified for that program gave up their legal rights in the intervening months.

‘You May End Up Here’

The Trump administration, particularly Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has been explicit that it is leveraging the terror of languishing behind bars, for months or even years, in order to coerce people into leaving the country.

Advertisement

In March, after the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men, without charge, to El Salvador’s most infamous prison for indefinite detention where they faced brutal beatings and alleged sexual assault, Noem shot a video from inside the prison.

“I also want everybody to know: If you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face,” she said. She called the prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, “one of the tools in our toolkit.”

Then, in May, Noem said, “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest.”

Advertisement

And during a July press conference marking the opening of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center ― the tent city was erected on a Florida Everglades airfield in a matter of days, and is already renowned for its terrible conditions and ostentatious cruelty ― Noem, sitting next to Trump, held up a flier urging undocumented people to leave the country.

“If you don’t,” she warned, “you may end up here.”

Noem and others in the administration have worked hard to make that threat a reality.

The administration has abandoned the Biden-era policy of prioritizing the arrest of serious criminals and recent arrivals, and is instead detaining whoever it can get its hands on, including by arresting people at immigration court, carrying out large-scale raids and pressing people on the street to share information about their immigration status. The number of people in immigration detention hit a record high in June, and the share of those arrested by immigration agents who don’t have any criminal record at all has continued to increase, according to the government’s own data.

“On the ground, people are very concerned and fearful, because even people who know their rights are seeing that ICE is not abiding by the law,” said Jessie Hahn, a senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on low-income immigrants. Hahn recounted a know-your-rights training for farmworker advocates and attorneys in California, where federal law enforcement has carried out raids targeting agricultural workers.

“I was getting all these questions in the chat, like, ‘What about when they break the car windows?’ And it gets to a point where I’m not sure what to say to people, other than ‘call the television station,’ because that’s a violation,” Hahn said. “And our ability to hold them accountable for that violation is really important, and yet there are widespread violations happening on the part of ICE right now, in the way that arrests are being conducted.”

At the same time, conditions in detention centers have grown dire, veteran legal observers say.

“The conditions are the worst that we’ve ever seen,” said Denise Noonan Slavin, who spent decades as an immigration judge, including 15 years at the Krome detention center in Miami.

“People are basically being treated like animals, in unsanitary conditions, with no access to medical care, legal counsel or family,” said Slavin, who is now a senior adviser at Americans for Immigrant Justice, a nonprofit law firm involved in several lawsuits against the administration. (The DHS spokesperson told HuffPost the same thing it has told dozens of other outlets since July: “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”)

Slavin said people seem to be “disappearing” for days at a time in ICE’s network of detention centers, and noted that 2025 has been a particularly deadly year for immigration detention, in part because immigration agents are arresting people who in the past likely would have been allowed to live freely.

Isidro Perez, a 75-year-old man who arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1966, was one of those who recently died in ICE custody. Perez served an 18-month prison sentence in 1984 ― 40 years ago ― on cannabis charges, but had lived the intervening decades without incident, The Miami Herald reported, working as a mechanic, and rescuing cats and dogs.

He was arrested by immigration agents at a Key Largo community center in June, and died three weeks later. Perez’s friend and former partner told the Herald he’d called her from detention, describing sleeping on the floor in an overcrowded facility. Yet another man died in ICE custody last week.

In the past, immigration detention was reserved for the tiny fraction of undocumented people seen as a danger to the community, or as flight risks. But over time, through Democratic and Republican presidents, the number of people in detention has grown dramatically. Now, the Trump administration has moved to prohibit bond hearings for people who crossed the border without authorization, a description that applies to millions of people, and one that means people arrested could remain behind bars for months or years as their cases proceed. And billions of dollars in new funding from Congress could explode the number of available detention beds.

Immigration detention is not like federal or state prison; people aren’t sent there after receiving a conviction and a sentence, and it’s not supposed to be a punishment.

Advertisement

But that’s how the administration is treating it. A “Self-Deportation Fact Sheet” warns that if undocumented people don’t leave the country, “ICE will put you in a detention facility. Some people remain in detention for months.”

“People in detention are there indefinitely,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network. “They don’t have a sentence, they don’t actually know when or if they’ll be released, whether they’ll be released back into the United States, or if they’ll be deported. So there’s just so much deep uncertainty.”

That uncertainty “does a lot to psychologically compel somebody, and they might be like, ‘These conditions are terrible, this is awful, maybe deportation is an answer,’” Shah said.

CBP Home

Because “self-deported” isn’t a legal category, we don’t have precise numbers regarding how many people have voluntarily left the United States. We also don’t know what the Trump administration considers a “self-deportation,” or if they are counting these figures in their overall deportation numbers.

More immigration cases concluded with voluntary departures in June than in any other month for at least 27 years, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, an independent organization that collects and analyzes federal records. Still, this is partially a result of the Trump administration’s fixation on immigration enforcement. Recent months have seen highs for immigration court outcomes overall, and voluntary departures made up a very small portion of the sum of people leaving the country as a result of immigration proceedings.

“Case records from [the Executive Office for Immigration Review] confirm what many have witnessed in courtrooms across the country,” said Adam Sawyer, a data analyst at Relevant Research. “About 3,700 people chose to voluntarily depart in June 2025. That’s more voluntary departures than we have seen in any single month since at least 1998.”

Advertisement

CBP Home, the Trump administration’s app for immigrants to “report their intent to depart,” provides some more insight. The app is a mutation of the Biden-era “CBP One” app, which allowed people to schedule asylum appointments with immigration officials. Now, on the contrary, the “self-deport” posters decorating detention centers and courthouses ― as well as Noem’s television advertisements ― direct people to the app as a first step toward exiting the United States. In exchange, the administration has promised to cover travel costs, waive fines related to immigration offenses, and even give out $1,000 “exit bonuses.”

DHS did not answer questions about how much money has actually been distributed, but a spokesperson pointed to a press conference Noem held Friday, in which she said that “thousands and thousands” of people had used CBP Home. Noem also said “hundreds of thousands of people” ― and later, “over a million people” ― had left the United States on their own accord without necessarily using the CBP Home app. She did not cite any evidence for the claim, other than what she said she’d heard from foreign officials.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in April that “5,000 people have used the app to self-deport as of the start of April,” in the outlet’s words. On June 25, The Atlantic cited an unnamed senior administration official who said “that more than 7,000 people have signed up so far, and of those, more than 3,000 have confirmed departures using the app.” On July 23, CBS News referred to internal government data to report “the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term.”

“If you go on the CBP Home app and go home now, you will get the chance to come back to the United States legally,” Noem claimed during the “Alligator Alcatraz” press conference. Otherwise, you may end up deported “and never get the chance to come back,” she said. But being deported doesn’t necessarily equate to a lifelong ban on reentry, and there’s nothing to indicate using CBP Home has any affect on someone’s ability to come back to the United States at a later date.

The CBP Home app seemingly does not include any acknowledgement of the rights immigrants could be abandoning if they leave the country the wrong way. A DHS privacy impact assessment makes no mention of sharing any data on voluntary departures with the immigration court system.

And despite Noem’s statement about “the chance to come back” to the U.S. ― and similar, even-less-legible noise from Trump ― the administration has not gone to Congress with any proposal for making legal reentry easier for people who voluntarily leave the country.

The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration, summarized the issue in June: “Noem and other administration officials have also said that self-deportees ‘may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,’ which may seem to offer a new immigration pathway or access to a visa. How the administration could accomplish this is unclear, given most unauthorized immigrants are barred from re-entry for multiple years and it is the absence of sufficient legal pathways in the first place that has prompted many to enter illegally or overstay a visa.”

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective,” said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies trends in immigration enforcement.

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective.”

“Your ability to either come back or not come back has nothing to do with CBP Home,” he added. “There are people who are leaving, and they’re going to have a bar [to reentry] and they’re going to technically, legally, ‘abandon’ their applications for relief and get an in-absentia removal order... At the same time, [the administration has] said, ‘Use this app or we’re going to find you and deport you. And you’re never going to be allowed to come back.’ Well, that’s not true, either. That is not an honest, factual statement. Deportation does not automatically result in a permanent bar.”

Several people have also run into trouble after attempting to leave the country without identification documents ― which they either didn’t have to begin with, or were taken by immigration agents in the United States, Noticias Telemundo reported last month.

And though the administration promised to “deprioritize” the detention of people who sign up to leave the country through CBP Home, that’s not guaranteed. Last month, a man who pursued voluntary departure through CBP Home was arrested by immigration agents who falsely accused him of skipping appointments, 285 South, a metro Atlanta immigration-focused publication, reported.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

The new reports “reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro's speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”",https://7b1de02a7bcf9c1df487-6849f9022b05f72b83236695aa4e9a0a.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploads/ap/2025/1297380/image-0.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:02.031669

Several sources involved in the consultation process, some of whom have requested anonymity as the bill’s wording is not finalised, have said that roundtable discussions in April prompted concessions from the Allan government.

This included dropping plans for a full ban on “face coverings” at protests, which was planned to carry a fine of up to $2,000. Instead, it is understood the government will propose penalties only when a person wearing a face covering is refusing to cooperate with police or believed to be committing a criminal act.

A senior Victorian government source said such a measure, combined with anti-vilification laws set to take effect in September, would allow authorities to “unmask” neo-Nazis, who marched through Melbourne’s CBD in face coverings at the weekend.

Anastasia Radievska, protest rights campaigner at the Australian Democracy Network said the shift was the result of “broad opposition” to the plan, including by human rights, legal, faith, First Nations and disability rights groups.

“The prohibition on masks has serious impacts on community health, the participation of people with disabilities, the participation of victim-survivors of domestic and sexual violence in protest. It’s not an appropriate way to address the problems of racist violence, which is what the laws were advertised as tackling,” Radievska said.

“These groups have worked to ensure that any restrictions that are introduced – although we’ve argued that Victoria doesn’t need new protest restrictions – are appropriately targeted and don’t impact on the participation of these vulnerable groups in protests – and actually target radicalised violence and hate.”

An outright ban on attachment devices such as chains, glue or locks, which are commonly used in climate protests, is also expected to be narrowed and will apply only when there is a community safety risk.

This would mean non-violent acts such as those committed by Zelda D’Aprano – who is immortalised in bronze outside Trades Hall after she chained herself to a government building to protest against the lack of equal pay for women – would not be affected.

The proposal for “safe access” areas around places of worship, which was also floated by the government in December, has been described by several stakeholders as “dead in the water”. But this was disputed by the government source who said it was still being considered, though was proving “incredibly complex”.

However, a ban on the display of terrorist symbols at protests is likely to proceed, despite reservations about how “terrorist organisation” could be defined.

Stakeholders were initially told the changes would be introduced when parliament resumed after the midwinter break but the timeline has now shifted to the end of the year.

The premier, Jacinta Allan, told reporters on Tuesday the laws would not be aimed at protests but at extremist behaviour.

“People who are taking the opportunity to engage in extreme and dangerous behaviour under the guise of participating in a protest – that’s what the new laws will be cracking down on., she said.

It comes after Victoria’s new police chief, Mike Bush, ruled out a permit system for protests in a series of interviews last month, noting they had not been effective in other states.

Labor’s rank-and-file has also pushed back, with state conference carrying a motion earlier this month calling on the government to abandon its proposed changes.

“Inconvenience is not a form of violence,” it said, noting several wins of the labour movement were only possible as a result.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d372fec67c9d687ef6a2f72683295cd62599723c/337_685_3121_2498/master/3121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb053f1738b22f05d3867b20f3e5e693",N,,2025-08-12 16:56:42.430204

Cotrin said “there’s no way” Epstein would have killed himself, which is what prison officials say happened in his jail cell at a Manhattan prison in 2019. Cotrin worked for Epstein for 18 years, and said in all that time he never witnessed any abuse.

Cotrin, along with Epstein’s brother, also said there are forensic inconsistencies in the report claiming Epstein took his own life. A review by the FBI and the Department of Justice ruled out murder.

Media Miss by the right: Investigation reveals hundreds of human rights abuses in US immigrant detention centers

An investigation out of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office uncovered more than 500 credible reports of human rights abuses at immigrant detention centers across the U.S.

Investigators reportedly found evidence of both physical and sexual abuse, and that children and pregnant women were among the victims.

Reports show some detainees claimed they were denied medical care and that they were held in overcrowded rooms with only one bathroom. Detention officials also reportedly used flash-bang grenades when a toilet was flooded in protest.

The investigation also found some children, who were U.S. citizens and had serious medical conditions like cancer, were held in these detention centers alongside their parents.

The October session will feature 10 arguments over five days, while the November session will feature nine over five days.

Both sessions include important cases. On Oct. 15, the court will hear oral arguments in a Louisiana case that could limit the federal Voting Rights Act, and on Oct. 7 it will hear a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy.” In November, there will be oral argument in a case involving the methods used to assess a defendant’s claim that he is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed.

When the court hears argument in Louisiana v. Callais, it will be the second round of arguments in the case, which comes to the court as a challenge to the congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature adopted in 2024. That map, which contained a second majority-Black district, followed a federal court’s ruling that a 2022 map, which contained only one majority-Black district, violated Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.” A group of voters describing themselves as “non-African American” went to federal court, where they argued that the 2024 map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander – that is, it relied too heavily on race.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March, but it did not issue an opinion in the case. Instead, on the last day before the court’s summer recess began, it announced that the case would be reargued in the fall. On Aug. 1, the justices instructed the litigants in the case to file briefs discussing whether the creation of a second majority-Black district in the 2024 map violates the Constitution – a question that at least one voting-rights expert suggested could call into question the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA.

On Oct. 7, the justices will hear argument in Chiles v. Salazar, a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy” – therapy to “convert” an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity. A federal appeals court in Denver upheld the law, reasoning that it regulated the health-care profession rather than therapists’ speech.

And in Hamm v. Smith, on Nov. 4, the justices will consider how and whether courts should assess a defendant’s claim that he cannot be executed because he is intellectually disabled when he has taken multiple IQ tests.

Both the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday told federal union representatives that the agencies would be canceling all collective bargaining agreements, effective immediately.

USCIS and FEMA are ending the use of office space and resources for union activities, revoking official time, and halting grievance and arbitration processes, according to emails viewed by Federal News Network. The two agencies said federal union representatives are expected to return to other work duties full-time.

Neither USCIS nor FEMA responded to Federal News Network’s requests for comment on their decisions to terminate the union contracts.

The cancellations at USCIS impact union contracts with both the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council.

AFGE Local 4060, which represents FEMA employees, said it would continue to fight the Trump administration in court.

“This is an unprecedented attack on the rights of federal workers,” AFGE Local 4060 officials wrote in an email to bargaining unit members, obtained by Federal News Network. “AFGE will continue to litigate the case in district court, confident in our legal position. We remain committed to opposing the government’s appeal and will fight for both preliminary and permanent relief for all AFGE members.”

A few other agencies have also moved forward with ending their collective bargaining agreements. USCIS and FEMA’s announcements come after the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency similarly terminated their union contracts and canceled all use of official time for union representatives.

The agencies’ actions follow an appeals court decision that allowed the Trump administration to move forward with implementing President Donald Trump’s March 27 executive order to terminate union activities at most agencies, while the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump’s order cited a narrow legal provision that allows the president to suspend collective bargaining for national security reasons. Following the order, multiple federal unions sued the administration, arguing that it targeted federal unions that had spoken up against the administration, using speech that is protected under the First Amendment.

But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that based on the language of the executive order and a White House fact sheet, Trump would have taken the action to cancel union activities anyway — regardless of what the federal unions had said.

AFGE National President Everett Kelley has vowed to continue to fight in court over Trump’s anti-union actions, and believes AFGE “will ultimately prevail.” The Washington Post first reported the news of USCIS and FEMA ending their collective bargaining agreements.

Inside Higher Ed analyzed more than 40 lawsuits related to higher education that were filed against the Trump administration. More than a dozen cases contested grant cuts, making that the most-litigated issue before the courts. The second-most frequent theme of litigation was the reduction in force at the U.S. Department of Education. Lawsuits have also challenged federal crackdowns on international students and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

District courts have ruled against the Trump administration in nearly two-thirds of the lawsuits, Inside Higher Ed found. And at the appellate level, seven rulings went against the Trump administration, while only two reversed lower court injunctions blocking grant terminations related to anti-DEI executive action. White House officials have accused judges who block administration policy of overstepping their authority.

The Trump administration nonetheless has notched wins in a smaller number of cases to reach the Supreme Court to date. Justices have overturned three lower court rulings that cleared the way for mass layoffs at the Department of Education and cuts to teacher training grants, Inside Higher Ed reported.

Still, the publication’s analysis shows that much of the litigation is yet to be resolved. Almost a quarter of the 40 cases remain undecided, and where a district judge has issued a ruling, 18 cases have been appealed. Of those, nine cases await an appeals court decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has only ruled in three of the five higher education-related cases that have reached the court.

Litigation has become a major strategy of groups opposing the administration’s efforts to overhaul colleges and universities since President Donald Trump’s return to office. Professional associations, including the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, as well as Democratic state attorneys general, including those in California, have led many of the lawsuits opposing the Trump administration’s policy.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell wrote in an email to Inside Higher Ed that state attorneys general will “continue to hold the line because our children and the future of our democracy depend on it.”

There are obviously a variety of reasons why the right wing press’ targeting of judges and putting them in danger of violence is problematic. One of those issues is how poor the journalists’ understanding is of their subject matter. I have written a couple of times now about the Palestinian family who have been turned into a political football.

I have explained that the process they used to make their application was the one required by the Home Office. Yet why let the facts get in the way of a piece attacking an Upper Tribunal judge who made one of the decisions in that case, as the Mail on Sunday did yesterday (do not go find this and give them any clicks unless you are going to submit a complaint!).

The piece again focussed on the fact that the family had applied under the Ukrainian scheme, before then also wrongly attributing the recent High Court decision in the family’s case against the Foreign Office to the same Upper Tribunal judge (the judgment was bizarrely referred to in the paper as the judge having a “public spat” with the Foreign Secretary). I would be embarrassed to publish an article that rife with errors, but perhaps I am being generous by assuming that inaccurate coverage of migration issues is based on a misunderstanding rather than deliberate misinformation.

There are plenty of Upper Tribunal judges out there making decisions that would delight the right. I have seen cases where evidence has been ignored and people returned to danger, yet balance is clearly not what they are after here.

On Free Movement, we covered the new UK/France returns agreement with an explainer on the treaty, new appendix to the immigration rules and caseworker guidance. We have a lot more information about the part of the scheme that will bring people to the UK, including the expression of interest application form. The team at Refugee Legal Support also gave their perspective as an organisation working with people in northern France.

Also last week, the July roundup podcast is out and there were a couple of appeals against SIAC decisions, one on deprivation and one on costs. Today we published a really useful explainer on how to change employer if someone is on a skilled worker visa.

Last week Dallas residents asked the city council whether the city would opt into ICE's 287(g) Program, which allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Johnson — a Democrat whose district includes Dallas, Collin and Denton counties — sent a letter to Chief of Police Daniel Comeaux Friday asking for a detailed explanation of the Dallas Police Department's current policy regarding the program.

In the letter, Johnson said the program has resulted in the detention and deportation of individuals without criminal records.

""These instances raise critical civil rights concerns and can damage trust between immigrant communities and local police, particularly when reports surface of individuals being detained without clear identification or justification,"" she said.

KERA reached out to the Dallas Police Department for comment and will update this story with a response.

Johnson set a deadline of Aug. 21 to receive a written response from Comeaux answering six questions related to the police department's immigration policy.

The questions are:

Has your department entered into any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or informal agreements with ICE or other DHS agencies?

What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?

Does your department collect or share immigration status information during routine policing?

What is the department’s process for ensuring transparency and accountability in federal partnerships?

Are DPD officers ever stationed or detailed to work alongside ICE officers, and if so, in what capacity?

Has your department received funding, equipment, or other resources from ICE or DHS this year? If so, for what purposes?

Comeaux has faced criticism after saying his department would fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in a Fox News interview earlier this year.

""If there's a federal agency that's doing an operation and they need our assistance, we'll be there to help them,"" he said, ""as long as they're doing it by the law and doing it with respect.""

He later clarified the department's policy, saying his comments were specifically about those with felony warrants, but reiterated the department would continue to assist ""federal partners.""

A police spokesperson told KERA News last week the commissioner's position and the department's approach to immigration issues had not changed.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee.
Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.
Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed.
The final verdict came down to Trump Burger serving as a refuge for someone who “supports [the Trump] administration’s many compromising decisions.” Apparently, the restaurant can serve as a refuge for those people — just not the country.","The co-owner of restaurants dedicated to feverish support of President Donald Trump is facing the brunt of one of the MAGA movement’s most beloved policies — deportation.

Roland Mehrez Beainy, a Lebanese immigrant who began operating the Trump Burgers mini-chain in 2020, has been accused of overstaying his visitor’s visa, which expired in February 2024, according to the Guardian. As a result, the 28-year-old was arrested by immigration officials in May.

Beainy has also been accused of having an assault charge on his record and orchestrating a fake marriage in order to gain permanent residency — members of his own family called it a “sham designed to game the system,” according to the New Republic. The Department of Homeland Security says there’s no proof that Beainy and the woman he allegedly tried to secure legal status through ever lived under the same roof.

In a statement provided to Fox, ICE said that, under the Trump administration, it’s “committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.”

Beainy is calling the allegations against him “90 percent untrue” and has his immigration hearing scheduled for November 18, 2025.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee. Trump is known to help friends and supporters, even going as far as pardoning the rapper Kodak Black, who was granted release when he was serving time for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

Ever the busy man, Beainy is fighting immigration proceedings while still owning Trump Burgers in Flatonia, Kemah, and Houston, and is also embroiled in legal battles over the chainlet. There’s one involving the landlord at the Kemah location, where there’s an accusation of an unlawful takeover. Beainy is also battling with Iyad Abuelhawa (also known as Eddie Hawa) over who actually owns what stake in the restaurant. Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.

Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed. “The chargrilled burger patties are thick but bland, topped with a waxy cheese that lacks any memorable flavor,” says former regional editor Brittany Britto Garley. The atmosphere is painted as gauche and kind of creepy. Britto Garley spotted a little boy wearing a shirt that read “Daddy’s Home,” in reference to Trump’s re-election. The final verdict came down to Trump Burger serving as a refuge for someone who “supports [the Trump] administration’s many compromising decisions.” Apparently, the restaurant can serve as a refuge for those people — just not the country.

The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.
If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state.
The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.
According to state records, the Hudson facility was built in 2009 on 50 acres and has just over 300,000 square feet inside its buildings.","Federal immigration authorities intend to open a second Colorado detention center in Hudson — about 30 miles northeast of Denver — members of the state’s congressional delegation were told this week.

Through a spokeswoman, U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen confirmed to The Denver Post that she and other lawmakers were told of the plans for Hudson during a visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora on Monday morning.

In a proposal sent to ICE earlier this year, Highlands REIT, a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, offered the shuttered private prison it owns in Hudson as a potential new detention center, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.

When it was open, the prison had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state. The Aurora facility is contracted to hold up to 1,360 people.

Neither GEO nor Highlands REIT responded to messages seeking comment Monday. Spokespeople for ICE also did not return emails seeking more information.

But agency officials had previously signaled that Hudson was a likely option. Robert Guadian, the head of ICE’s Denver field office, told Fox31 in April that the agency was in talks with GEO to open a facility in the town of roughly 1,600 people.

That was before the competing submittals were made public in July by the ACLU. The former Hudson Correctional Facility was one of six potential sites offered to ICE earlier this year, according to records the ACLU obtained through a records request.

The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.

Immigration arrests have surged in Colorado so far this year, and congressional Republicans steered $45 billion to ICE last month to build new detention centers as part of President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

Bryce Lange, Hudson’s town manager, told The Post that he wasn’t aware of any confirmed plans as of late Monday afternoon. He said government officials had not provided any information to him or officials in other towns and counties that were home to potential detention centers.

A spokeswoman for Weld County said county leaders were also not aware if the site had been chosen. In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis spokesman Eric Maruyama said that ICE has “not shared any details of plans to expand with the governor’s office.” Maruyama said Polis called on ICE to be more transparent with its operations in the state.

According to state records, the Hudson facility was built in 2009 on 50 acres and has just over 300,000 square feet inside its buildings. As of 2012, it had at least four housing units, plus medical and administrative buildings.

Harrington,,,,,"https://riograndeguardian.com/stories/harrington-bishops-and-ice-agents-in-their-pews,29115","Nor can one dispute that ICE operations abuse, and are repugnant to, these norms, for which ICE makes no apologies.
Roving patrols of ICE agents with masked faces have seized thousands of people, young and old, across the country, at home, work, driving, and on sidewalks, and shoved them into unmarked SUVs.
ICE agents cannot justify their actions as “just following orders.” The Nuremberg trials of Nazis rejected that rationalization.
Some bishops have attended detention hearings in solidarity with immigrants; but, of the country’s 500 Catholic and Episcopal bishops, that number is infinitesimal.
They must pose the tough question of ICE agents who profess Christianity: how do you square this maltreatment of people’s human rights and their dignity with your conscience and the Gospel?","A defining moment in Archbishop Oscar Romero’s life was his call to El Salvador’s military to put down their arms and stop abusing their authority, to stop oppressing and killing the people. His powerful “call to conscience” underscored the moral and religious limits for police agents of the state, and that one’s conscience requires acting accordingly.

Romero’s courage moved millions of people, who proclaimed him a saint after his assassination. The time has come for America’s clergy to rise to that level of courage and issue a “call to conscience” to ICE agents in their congregations that they consider resigning their jobs because of ICE’s ongoing human rights abuses.

No one disputes the need for a fair immigration system that meets U.S. constitutional standards and international human rights principles and, for Christians, is consistent with the Gospel. Nor can one dispute that ICE operations abuse, and are repugnant to, these norms, for which ICE makes no apologies.

Roving patrols of ICE agents with masked faces have seized thousands of people, young and old, across the country, at home, work, driving, and on sidewalks, and shoved them into unmarked SUVs. They have upended nursing home and home care staff, disrupted crop harvesting, and arrest people near schools and churches. Parents are suddenly ripped from their children, and children yanked from foster homes. Asylum-seekers are imprisoned when they show up for hearings—no due process, just random deportation to countries foreign to them.

Countless videos attest to ICE’s inhumane conduct. The Guardian published a video of ICE using a stun gun on a worker and slamming him to the ground. When his companion, a citizen, says, “Don’t resist” to diffuse the situation, they arrest him for interfering with his friend’s arrest. The agents are laughing. One says, “They’re starting to resist more now,” to which another replies: “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” The callousness of that flippant remark, unrebuked by ICE, is telling and frightening; it reflects ICE’s culture.

Almost 57,000 people are incarcerated in ICE detention centers nationwide. Human rights reports and the media paint a brutal picture of cruelty. “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades, which officials inaugurated with disgusting mirth, is particularly inhumane. Neither it nor other centers meet the standards for U.S. jails and prisons: unsanitary conditions, denial of access to lawyers, family, and clergy; overcrowding; scarce medical attention. Deaths have occurred.

ICE agents cannot justify their actions as “just following orders.” The Nuremberg trials of Nazis rejected that rationalization. Under international law, “just following orders” never justifies being part of the machinery of human rights abuse; nor is it ever consistent with the Gospel of Jesus.

Some Catholic bishops are speaking out, Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville for one. The presiding U.S. Episcopal bishop, Sean Rowe, has declared, “Once the church of presidents, the Episcopal Church must now be an engine of resistance.” Texas Episcopal Bishop Andy Doyle as pointed in the direction of the Confessing Church, which formed in 1934 Germany to oppose the regime’s human rights violations when other church leaders were subservient to Hitler’s anti-Jewish nationalist agenda.

Verbal remonstrations by bishops are good but inadequate. Some bishops have attended detention hearings in solidarity with immigrants; but, of the country’s 500 Catholic and Episcopal bishops, that number is infinitesimal.

People like the Dorothea Project moms are imploring the bishops to do more. They need to take the Archbishop Romero step and issue a “call to conscience,” suggesting to ICE employees that the time has come for them to resign their positions and find other employment. The more resignations of conscience, the quicker humane immigration reform.

Bishops must bring the moral issue to the fore. Cautiousness in this situation is perilous and harmful. They must pose the tough question of ICE agents who profess Christianity: how do you square this maltreatment of people’s human rights and their dignity with your conscience and the Gospel? How can you work for a police agency that so badly and cruelly treats people who have lived good and honest lives after escaping persecution, terror, or sheer economic necessity? How can you again endanger them and return them to where they had to flee?

As Jesus put it, no person can serve two masters.

MSF calls on governments in the region to shift away from harsh deterrence tactics and towards humane migration and protection policy.

Mexico City, 12 August 2025 - In its first six months in office, the current US Administration has implemented the most restrictive and dehumanising migration policy seen in years, abandoning hundreds of thousands of people hoping to seek asylum in the US and leaving them stranded in danger in Mexico and Central America, says a new report by the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF).

The report highlights how the US government’s policies and rhetoric criminalising migration have echoed throughout Latin America. MSF calls on all governments across the Americas to renounce deterrence and abandonment tactics and instead implement humane policies that ensure access to asylum, medical care, and protection along the Latin American migration corridor.

“These policies, combined with the drastic reduction of aid and the humanitarian footprint along the migration route, have had a devastating impact on the wellbeing of people trying to seek safety,” says Franking Frías, Deputy Manager of Operations for MSF in Mexico and Central America. “This suffering is deliberately made invisible, hidden by the inaccurate narrative that migration has stopped. But every day, we see the consequences in patients who are living with untreated injuries, trauma from sexual violence, and severe mental health conditions that make their daily life impossible.”

Released today, the report, 'Unwelcome. The devastating human impact of migration policy changes in the United States, Mexico and Central America', showcases how recent policy changes have eroded the right to seek asylum and left many migrants and asylum seekers stranded with nowhere safe to go, trapping them in a cycle of physical, emotional, and institutional violence. The report is based on analysis of MSF medical data and in-depth interviews with patients of many nationalities in various stages of migration, and with MSF staff working along the migration route in Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.

Since late January, the US government has closed the main avenues to request asylum and protection—including shutting down the CBP One application and ending humanitarian parole— heightened security at the border with Mexico, and deported people in unconscionable conditions, including deporting people in shackles, sending deportees to third countries, and separating families.

“We feel abandoned and unprotected,” says a Honduran woman who is stuck in Reynosa, in northern Mexico. “We never wanted to enter the United States illegally. We ask for benevolence for cases like mine: mothers who have been waiting for a long time with children, who want to give them a better life. We have already gone through a process; we already had a right. We have been victims of scams, the cartels, we have been deceived, we are traumatized.” The woman had secured an appointment through CBP One for three days after the app was shut down and all appointments were cancelled.

On top of this, several countries across the Latin American migration corridor have also strengthened deterrence measures. Law enforcement agents and immigration authorities in the region have forcefully returned migrants, restricted people’s movements, and dismantled urban camps where people with nowhere else to go were sheltering. They have closed migration reception stations, dissolved gatherings in public spaces, carried out raids, arbitrarily detained people, increased patrolling, and complicated and reduced access to bureaucratic procedures—including asylum processes.

“We were held captive for 60 days,” says a Venezuelan man stranded in Ciudad Juárez, northern Mexico. “[Criminals] hit me on the head, pulled a tooth, and shoved a gun in my mouth to take pictures and call one of my sons in the United States. My son and son-in-law paid the ransom, and we were released. The plan was to go to the United States. The rest of my family is there waiting for us. But with this US government, we don't know what to do.”

Carmen López, MSF Manager for Mobile Health Activities, shares the story of a Venezuelan patient she assisted in Guatemala. The man and his son were deported earlier this year from the US, despite having entered through CBP One: “First, they were held in a detention centre in the United States separately for about 20 days. Later, they were deported to Mexico. During the transfer to the Mexican authorities, his backpack containing personal items and savings was stolen. They were left in Villahermosa [a town in southeastern Mexico]. They had to start their return [to Venezuela] without money. He was very frustrated because he had gone through the legal process, and it had all been a lie in the end.”

For many, returning to their country is not an option, either because of a lack of financial resources or fear of what they fled in the first place—such as, the political and economic crises in Venezuela or Cuba, rife violence in Haiti, conflict in peripheral regions of Colombia, or threats from criminal groups and a lack of opportunities in Ecuador and other Central American countries. “We were given a 24-hour ultimatum to pay an amount of money we didn’t have,” says a Salvadoran woman in Tapachula, southern Mexico. “Migrating was neither a political choice nor a search for better economic opportunities. It was an urgent decision to save our lives.”

With seeking asylum at the United States southern border now close to impossible, tens of thousands of people are seeing Mexico as the only alternative option. But MSF teams witness how asylum procedures in Mexico have become lengthier and more complex in several cities. In parallel, violence perpetrated by organised crime groups and other actors remains alarming, including kidnappings, extortion, robberies, sexual violence, and labour exploitation. “Violence is much more evident now,” says Ricardo Santiago, who coordinated MSF programmes in northern and southern Mexico. “Before—given the large number of people on the move—some would be spared, whereas today most of the people I've spoken with have been victims of violence. There is no escape.”

MSF teams in the region, particularly in Mexico, have seen an increase in psychological needs among patients and a high proportion of people with severe mental health issues despite a reduction of medical activities since the slowing of migration flows. In recent years, many patients have had an obvious need for mental health support because of the recurrent violence suffered and the precarious living conditions endured along the migration route. But on top of these experiences, people now face uncertainty provoked by the drastic and numerous policy changes, which trigger despair once people realize that all they endured to reach the US was in vain.

“The symptoms are increasingly intense,” says Lucía Samayoa, MSF Project Coordinator in Tapachula. “They're living under a lot of pressure and stress. Many people require pharmacological treatment, with a more structured, longer therapeutic process.”

Moreover, stranded migrants and asylum seekers have dispersed, becoming more invisible —due to fear of prosecution, detention, and deportation in the midst of a stigmatising environment, in which they are repeatedly labelled as criminals.

“Today, migrants are less accessible and the humanitarian system is unprepared to effectively address their vulnerabilities and complex needs,” says Frías. “Behind every policy is its impact on real people: survivors of torture, families escaping danger, and children navigating border crossings alone. Their health, safety, and dignity are legal and moral obligations. All governments in the region must act now to protect, not punish, people in search of safety, and create safe immigration pathways.”

“The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them.","The immigration court system was already strained when Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, he’s taken dramatic steps to undermine it even further.

Over the last seven months, Trump has fired immigration judges, weakened due process rights for those facing deportation and pressured judges to rule in the administration’s favor.

Some of those fired judges, immigration attorneys and other experts say the end result will be that these courts are either destroyed or left so dysfunctional that they can’t effectively guarantee basic rights.

Trump and his team have made clear that they value speed in immigration courts as agents try to meet an unrealistic goal of 1 million deportations in a year. After Republicans in Congress set aside a historic amount of money for deportations, border czar Tom Homan said he wanted to raise the 3,000 daily arrest quota to 7,000.

In theory, people facing deportation should have a chance to make their case before a judge, with proceedings taking months or years in some cases. But now, with a little more than 600 immigration judges, down from roughly 735, they are getting less time and ability to do that.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia, says that Trump is intentionally “overwhelming” immigration courts.

“It appears what they’re doing is moving forward with a plan to eliminate due process and immigration judges,” Kuck said. “The due process system created over the last 50 years is frustrating their goal of deporting a million people because it’s physically impossible to have a million cases go through immigration court in one year.”

Trump has cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

Trump himself has even cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” the president said in April, claiming it would require “hundreds of thousands” of hearing.

Lawyers such as Kuck and several former immigration judges told me the Trump administration is undermining immigration courts across the board, from firing immigration judges to detaining more immigrants, leading to a backlog in courts. The result is that a long troubled system is now near a breaking point.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson argued that new funding approved for the court system in Trump’s megabill will help with the backlog.

“There are currently efforts underway to hire additional immigration judges,” Jackson said. “Illegal aliens going through removal proceedings receive more than sufficient amounts of due process — anyone suggesting otherwise is lying. Any illegal alien who wishes to avoid deportations can self-deport.”

Some $3.3 billion in funding was approved for immigration courts in the megabill, but the law also placed a cap of 800 immigration judges — a number considered far too small to efficiently process the nearly 4 million pending immigration cases. Most experts say the system would need 2,000 to 3,000 judges to process the cases efficiently and fairly.

That same bill guaranteed some $45 billion for immigration detention, and nearly $30 billion for enforcement, including the hiring and training of some 10,000 new ICE agents

Immigration judges are technically employees of the executive branch under the Justice Department, but for the past roughly 50 years, judges have operated with independence and decided cases without interference.

But that norm is being destroyed, say many immigration attorneys and several former immigration judges.

Recently, ICE and the Justice Department declared millions of undocumented immigrants are not eligible for bond release from detention as their cases are processed — a change to nearly 40 years of precedent followed by immigration judges to guarantee due process. Historically, denial of bond was applied to people who recently crossed the border, not longtime residents regardless of documentation status. The Homeland Security Department did not respond to a request for comment about the change.

Victor Nieblas, a longtime immigration attorney in Los Angeles and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said denial of bond is a tactic to increase deportations.

“The longer you’re detained, the easier it’ll be for you to decide ‘I’d rather go home,’ and so you sign a voluntary return or a voluntary deportation,” he said.

Since January, roughly 106 immigration judges have either been fired by the Trump administration, resigned, or were transferred to another part of the Justice Department, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

One fired judge, who requested anonymity fearing retaliation from the administration, said the cuts showed the Trump administration wants immigration courts to “collapse.”

“It’s never been like this before,” said the former judge, who had served for years under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Jennifer Peyton, a recently fired assistant chief immigration judge in Chicago, said the administration is pressuring understaffed judges to speed up their decisions.

Judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

Instead of taking time to conduct research on the legal questions in a case, judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

“You’re creating an environment for the remaining judges where I’m sure everyone’s looking over their shoulder, worried they’ll be fired,” Peyton said. “They are definitely trying to make the system stop working.”

George Pappas, a Boston immigration judge fired last month, said the “drumbeat” started in February. He was told by his superiors to “be careful” with how he ruled and speed up dismissals of pending cases, which would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest an undocumented immigrant and put the person in an expedited removal without a hearing.

“That direct pressure undermined my ability to rule neutrally,” Pappas said. It all added “a layer of self policing,” he said, saying that would lead to a “total eradication” of the current system.

A Justice Department official did not answer questions about the accusations leveled by immigration judges who were fired by the Trump administration. Instead, the DOJ official accused the Biden administration of pressuring immigration judges to make certain decisions, and said the Trump administration is looking to hire judges who will expeditiously reduce the backlog of cases.

After the passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, the earlier version of immigration courts required that cases be decided by “special inquiry officers” who were not required to be lawyers, as they are now. In 1973, immigration judges were created by regulation.

Asked whether the administration wants to change the required qualifications for immigration judges, both the White House and the Justice Department declined to answer.

If the system reverts, hiring standards could be changed and loyal Trump officials could become judge and jury, Kuck said.

But to do so would likely set off legal challenges. And immigration policy experts warn a broken due process system for undocumented immigrants will impact Americans as well.

“Getting rid of due process is a threat to everyone in the United States who’s here legally or who is a citizen,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies for the CATO Institute. “The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them. In terms of your rights, it matters that we have a system for reviewing whether someone is entitled to be in the United States or not.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-vl-1210p-2b01c1.jpg",N,,2025-08-12 17:57:08.261033

When it comes to the United States’ immigration policy, we’re beginning to see how bad things can get.

A story this week by the Idaho Statesman’s Carolyn Komatsoulis showed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are upping their game in Idaho, smashing a Meridian man’s car window to detain him.

At the same time, Idaho State Police have signed an agreement with ICE to join a “Task Force Model,” which uses racial profiling to let local police question people on the street about their immigration status, according to another Idaho Statesman story. Even though Gov. Brad Little said his orders to the State Police were limited to specific duties, the agreement still gives Idaho officers the power to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant, to arrest immigrants under certain conditions and to transport immigrants to detention facilities, according to the Statesman story.

Civil rights organizations are sounding the alarm over ICE’s obvious violations of constitutional rights, including U.S. citizens getting caught up in mass arrests and deportations, inhumane conditions for immigrants in federal prisons and unconstitutional raids.

Not to mention deporting detainees — without proper adjudication as to whether they are in the country without legal authorization — to foreign countries, including a brutal torture prison in El Salvador and the dangerous and inhumane establishment of “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.

You may be completely fine with all that, unconcerned with inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of human beings, including children. You may be fine with stray innocent bystanders getting caught in the wide net that’s been cast (as long as it’s not you, of course).

But consider this: A rough estimate by the University of Idaho’s McClure Center put Idaho’s workforce count at about 27,000 undocumented immigrants, mostly working in agriculture, construction and service industries.

Idaho industry professionals report that in agriculture, dairy and hospitality industries, businesses employ unauthorized workers to meet their labor needs because authorized workers cannot be found.

So what happens if Trump fulfills his campaign promise — with the help of Idaho State Police — and rounds up nearly 27,000 undocumented immigrants in Idaho?

Employers in agriculture, construction and service industries are going to be in a world of hurt, to say the least. The people Republican leaders believe are out there lining up to take these jobs exist only in their minds.

Finding workers is already a key concern for Idaho businesses today, according to the U of I report, even with undocumented workers. These businesses report that they have to adapt to the lack of workers by forgoing business growth opportunities, cutting back production or even closing, according to the U of I report.

This doesn’t even include the contributions that undocumented immigrant workers make to Idaho’s economy through their spending and taxes.

Those contributions “are likely in the billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs,” according to the report.

Despite recent poor jobs reports, the United States still faces a labor shortage in the millions.

Rounding up and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could have a devastating effect on the economy, perhaps none more so than Idaho’s.

But maybe that’s what it’s going to take for Congress to do its job and adopt immigration reform.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson’s Farm Workforce Modernization Act would be a good place to start. It would create a pathway to legal status by creating a category called Certified Agricultural Worker for undocumented farmworkers who have done at least 180 days of agricultural work over the past two years.

It would reform the H-2A Guestworker Program by expanding eligibility to include dairy and other year-round agricultural work, and by adding flexibility for employers.

It would still require employers to attempt recruiting U.S. workers first before using the H-2A program, and establish a mandatory E-Verify system for agricultural employment to ensure future workers are authorized to work legally.

An earlier version of the bill passed the House with bipartisan support, but it got nowhere in the Senate.

Perhaps things weren’t bad enough.

The U.S. has been skating along like this for decades, with an untenable and unsustainable immigration policy, blindly looking the other way while undocumented immigrants do work that other Americans won’t do, spend money that bolsters the economy and pay taxes that help to provide government services.

If we let President Trump and ICE continue with this reckless, inhumane and unconstitutional deportation crusade, we’re going to see just how bad it can get.

Maybe that’s what it will take to get Congress to fix our broken immigration system.

In letters sent to the chief judges of five federal district courts last week, the Reporters Committee expressed concerns about Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(c), a little-known rule that blocks public access to immigration case filings via PACER, the electronic system for federal court records, forcing journalists to visit the courthouse to view them in person.

“This restriction prevents timely public access to fast-moving legal developments and impedes the ability of the press to report on critical, newsworthy matters,” the Reporters Committee argues in the letters, which were sent to federal courts in New York, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. “Timely public access to judicial records is not just good public policy — it is a matter of constitutional importance.”

The letters note that the Reporters Committee regularly hears from journalists who struggle to cover developments in immigration cases because of the rule’s restrictions. Additionally, the letters argue that the rule’s restriction on access is both too broad and too narrow to reasonably serve its purported goal of protecting sensitive information.

Federal courts have the authority to lift Rule 5.2(c) access restrictions. In June, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit removed restrictions in the case of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University scholar who is challenging whether his detention was legal.

Is it still possible to obtain Italian citizenship iure sanguinis?","The Constitutional Court has ruled on Citizenship by descent. Discover the impact of Judgment 142/2025 and what it means for applicants.

With Judgment no. 142, filed on 31 July 2025, the Italian Constitutional Court dismissed the questions of constitutionality raised by the Courts of Bologna, Rome, Milan and Florence, which had sought to place limits and additional requirements on the automatic recognition of citizenship for the children of Italians born abroad.

The question put to the Court

The referring Courts challenged Act 91/1992, arguing that it allows millions of people with no substantial ties to Italy, other than blood descent from an Italian ancestor, to obtain Citizenship.

The Act states that ""the child of an Italian father or mother is a citizen by birth"", imposing no limits beyond proof of lineage.

The Court was therefore asked whether it was legitimate to introduce further requirements.

What the Constitutional Court decided

The Court, considering the doubts unfounded, held that:

It is not its task to restrict citizenship by means of a ""manipulative"" judgment that would introduce conditions not set by Parliament;

The legislature enjoys wide discretion in determining the requirements for Citizenship;

The current provisions (subject to distinctions introduced by Act 74/2025) that accord citizenship to anyone who is the child of an Italian citizen do not breach the Constitution.

Accordingly, the Court declared:

complaints of unreasonableness and disproportionality inadmissible;

references to unproven international obligations inadmissible;

allegations of unequal treatment with other routes to citizenship unfounded.

Consequences of Judgment 142

The ruling:

does not affect Decree-Law 36/2025, which lay outside the issues decided;

clarifies that the new rules introduced in 2025 (Decree-Law 36/2025, converted into Act 74/2025) do not apply to cases pending before 28 March 2025.

Therefore:

Applications lodged before 28 March 2025 continue under the previous rules;

Applications submitted on or after that date are subject to stricter conditions (e.g. generational limits, proof that an ancestor resided in Italy).

For a closer look at the new criteria: Italian citizenship iure sanguinis—2025 new rules

Suspended proceedings must be resumed

Proceedings that had been stayed awaiting the Court's decision must now be resumed under the pre-2025 legislation.

Constitutional Court and Decree-Law 36/2025: the next step

A further question of constitutionality has been raised by the Turin Court against the 2025 reform.

A hearing is scheduled for the coming months, and the outcome could significantly change the current landscape.

When should you consult a lawyer?

The rules on Italian Citizenship, especially after the 2025 reforms, have become increasingly complex.

It is advisable to consult a law firm in order to:

confirm entitlement to Citizenship by descent or identify alternative routes;

prepare documentation correctly;

avoid errors in the application;

bring proceedings, if necessary, to secure recognition.

Doug LaMalfa faced a mostly hostile crowd Monday during his first North State town hall meeting in several years.

Residents at LaMalfa's town hall meeting in Red Bluff peppered him with a wide range of questions and comments on such topics as immigration, redistricting, the Epstein files, support for Israel, tariffs, wildfires, climate change, forest management and changes to Medicaid.

Many times he was shouted down by members of the audience, who held up green cards to show approval or red pieces of paper for disapproval.

""You just embarrass yourself when you act like that,"" LaMalfa said after several people yelled out ""You're a liar,"" and ""Tell the truth!""

It was the second rowdy crowd the Republican lawmaker faced Monday. He held a similar town hall earlier in the day in Chico, where members of the audience shouted obscenities at him.

Jill Smith, a lifelong Red Bluff resident, said the crowd of about 350 people was upset because it had been years since LaMalfa had held a public meeting in Tehama County.

""All these people are angry. They have concerns. I have concerns. I could vote Democrat or Republican as long as I think they're doing something good for our country. But right now I don't see that happening with this, and that's why everybody's angry,"" Smith said.

LaMalfa was criticized for many of his votes in Congress, including his support in 2021 not to certify the 2020 election that ushered in Joe Biden as president and this year for backing President Trump and his many executive orders, which some on Monday said usurped power from Congress.

""You made a choice to violate your oath to the Constitution,"" Max Walter of Redding said, referring to LaMalfa's vote not to certify the 2020 presidential election. ""And every day since then, you have violated your oath. But you have loyalty, you have loyalty to a felon (Trump), to somebody who mocks people in wheelchairs, to someone who mocks women.""

On questions about tariffs, LaMalfa said he supported them, claiming they would bring jobs back to the U.S. He also said he supported release of the Epstein files, but wanted to make sure the names of victims aren't released.

Roy Reddin asked if LaMalfa supported the type of congressional redistricting that is proposed in Texas.

""Currently the Texas legislature is very close to to an epic gerrymandering where they are going to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters by realigning their districts. So my question to you, is in two parts: Do you support what the Texas legislature is doing and why should California not do the same thing for five seats, one of which could be yours,"" Reddin said.

Although redistricting congressional districts happen at the state level, LaMalfa said he opposed attempts at redistricting such as what is happening in Texas, where the state legislature has proposed redrawing congressional district maps.

The redistricting plan in Texas could lead to the state picking up an additional five Republican seats in Congress, helping the GOP retain a majority in the House next year.

But other states, including California, have vowed to re-draw congressional district boundaries, if Texas goes through with its plan.

Not everyone was critical of LaMalfa. One woman said she was an immigrant and she supports LaMalfa because he backs the Trump administration's actions against undocumented immigrants.

""He's an honest Christian man and he's fighting for us,"" one woman said.

One woman who spoke out said many of the issues that came up Monday were moral issues that transcended a political climate that has become too divisive.

""I'm afraid to stand up for my rights because I might get shot,"" she told LaMalfa, citing the shootings of state legislators in Minnesota this summer.

The Council for Global Equality (CGE) has accused the administration of a ""cover-up of a cover-up"" to keep the reports buried.

Each year, the department is required to report on the practices of other countries concerning individual, civil, political, and worker rights protected under international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Governments and international groups have long cited these surveys as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative sources on the state of human rights, informing policy surrounding foreign aid and asylum.

The Foreign Assistance Act requires that these reports be sent to Congress by February 25 each year, and they are typically released in March or April. But nearly six months later, the Trump administration has sent nothing for the calendar year 2024.

Meanwhile, NPR reported in April on a State Department memo requiring employees to ""streamline"" the reports by omitting many of the most common human rights violations:

The reports... will no longer call governments out for such things as denying freedom of movement and peaceful assembly. They won't condemn retaining political prisoners without due process or restrictions on ""free and fair elections.""

Forcibly returning a refugee or asylum-seeker to a home country where they may face torture or persecution will no longer be highlighted, nor will serious harassment of human rights organizations...

...reports of violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people will be removed, along with all references to [diversity, equity, and inclusion] (DEI).

Among other topics ordered to be struck from the reports: involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices, arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, serious restrictions to internet freedom, extensive gender-based violence, and violence or threats of violence targeting people with disabilities.

Last week, The Washington Post obtained leaked copies of the department's reports on nations favored by the Trump administration—El Salvador, Russia, and Israel. It found that they were ""significantly shorter"" than the reports released by the Biden administration and that they struck references to widely documented human rights abuses in these countries.

In the case of El Salvador, where the administration earlier this year began shipping immigrants deported from the United States, the department's report stated that were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses"" there, even though such abuses—including torture, physical violence, and deprivation have been widely reported, including by Trump's own deportees.

Human rights violations against LGBTQ+ people were deleted from the State Department's report on Russia, while the report on Israel deleted references to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial and to his government's threats to the country's independent judiciary.

""Secretary Rubio's overtly political rewriting of the human rights reports is a dramatic departure from even his own past commitment to protecting the fundamental human rights of LGBTQI+ people,"" said Keifer Buckingham, the Council for Global Equality's managing director. ""Strategic omission of these abuses is also directly in contravention to Congress's requirement of a 'full and complete report' regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights.""

In June, the CGE sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the State Department calling for all communications related to these decisions to be made public. The department acknowledged the request but refused to turn over any documents.

Now CGE has turned to the courts. On Monday, the legal nonprofit Democracy Forward filed a complaint on CGE's behalf in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the department had violated its duties under FOIA to turn over relevant documents in a timely manner.

""The world is watching the United States. We cannot risk a cover-up on top of a cover-up,"" Perryman continued.

Andrea Velez was in downtown Los Angeles on June 24 when she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. She was charged with assaulting a federal officer while he was attempting to arrest a suspect.

The Department of Justice later dismissed her case without prejudice. The agency did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday.

Velez, who works as a production coordinator for a shoe company, recalled seeing federal agents when her mother and sister dropped her off at work.

“It was like a scene,” she told NBC Los Angeles. “They were just ready to attack and chase.”

Velez said she felt someone grab her and slam her to the ground. She said she tried to tell the agent, who was in plainclothes, that she was a citizen, but he told her that she “was interfering with what he was doing, so he was going to arrest me.”

“That’s when I asked him to show me his ID, his badge number,” she said. “I asked him if he had a warrant, and he said I didn’t need to know any of that.”

A federal criminal complaint alleged that an agent was chasing after a man, and Velez stepped into the agent’s path and extended her arm “in an apparent effort to prevent him from apprehending the male subject he was chasing.”

The complaint said that Velez’s arm hit the agent in the face.

Velez said she denied any wrongdoing and insisted she was a U.S. citizen. She was taken to a detention center in downtown Los Angeles where she gave officers her driver’s license and her health insurance card, but she was still booked into jail.

She said she spent two days in the detention center, where she had nothing to drink for 24 hours.

Velez said the ordeal traumatized her, and she has not been able to physically return to work.

“I’m taking things day by day,” she told the news station.

Her attorneys told NBC Los Angeles that they are exploring legal options against the federal government.

Her story echoes those of others who have said they were wrongfully detained by immigration agents under President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations.

Job Garcia, a Ph.D. student and photographer, said he was tackled and thrown to the ground by immigration agents for recording a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles.

DC Circuit vacates judge's order to hold US in contempt for ignoring TRO blocking immigrant removals

A federal appeals court has vacated an order by a Washington, D.C., federal judge that found probable cause to hold the federal government in criminal contempt for violating his order blocking the removal of a group of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated an April 16 order by Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg of the District of Columbia in a 2-1 per curiam decision Friday.

How Appealing links to the Aug. 8 decision and links to news coverage, including stories by the New York Times and the Washington Times.

The immigrants were taken to a prison in El Salvador in Central America but were later transferred to Venezuela, according to the New York Times.

D.C. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas and D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, appointees of President Donald Trump during his first term, wrote separate concurring opinions with differing reasons for their decision to vacate Boasberg’s probable cause order. D.C. Circuit Judge Corneila T.L. Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, dissented.

In a commentary at the Volokh Conspiracy, Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said his quick reading of the opinions leads him to think that Boasberg “on remand would have jurisdiction to proceed with some form of criminal contempt,” minus a “purge” option that drew objections from Rao.

Boasberg had said the federal government could purge itself of contempt by giving the immigrants a chance to challenge their removal in a habeas proceeding by asserting custody over them.

Boasberg issued the probable cause order, which included the purge option, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled April 7 that the immigrants’ case had been filed in the wrong venue. Boasberg said the Supreme Court decision, which lifted his temporary restraining order, “does not excuse the government’s violation.”

Rao, however, said Boasberg lost authority to coerce compliance with his order after the Supreme Court vacated it. She went on to say punishment through contempt “might still be available in these circumstances, but the district court cannot use the threat of such punishment as a backdoor to obtain compliance with a vacated and therefore unenforceable TRO.”

The dissent would not have vacated Boasberg’s probable cause order, while Katsas said he would vacate the order and terminate the criminal contempt proceeding.

Katsas said the case could be resolved based on ambiguities that resulted in different interpretations of Boasberg’s order.

The government had contended that the order banned removal of the immigrants from U.S. territory, but that had happened before he entered the TRO. Boasberg, however, said the order barred removal of the immigrants from U.S. custody, and his order was likely violated by their transfer to El Salvadoran custody.

The ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the party accused of contempt, Katsas said.

Although Katsas thought that the case could be resolved based on ambiguity, he also said Boasberg acted “to vindicate a TRO that the Supreme Court had vacated for lack of jurisdiction.”

He said Boasberg’s order “raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses. And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.”

The federal department publicly criticized U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D) in a press release after he visited Farmville Detention Center on Friday. It accused him of prioritizing detainees with criminal convictions over crime victims.

“He continues to do the bidding of dangerous criminal illegal aliens that endanger his own constituents,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “When will Congressman Beyer meet with the American victims of these illegal aliens’ violent crimes?”

Beyer fired back via a spokesperson on social media, criticizing conditions at the detention facility about an hour and 15 minutes southwest of Richmond.

“Federal regulations require minimum standards of care for all detainees, and unfortunately the medical resources at this facility were clearly woefully inadequate to meet those standards,” Aaron Fritschner, Beyer’s deputy chief of staff, said on X.

“Improving these conditions would be a far better use of time for the staff of the Department of Homeland Security than attacking Members of Congress for doing their jobs by engaging in oversight of the Executive Branch.”

Beyer, who had been talking about visiting Farmville for months, requested to meet “a number of detainees” at the detention center. They included people who had been kept in solitary confinement, who had recently experienced mental health crises and who had faced long delays in getting access to crucial medical treatment, Fritschner said.

DHS said that the detainees also included people convicted of assault and battery, burglary, distribution of drugs and driving under the influence. The agency claims that two of them are gang members, although only one detainee is listed as having a conviction for gang participation.

In an interview with the local news site WRIC, Beyer described “an enormous medical burden” at the detention center, which he said has only one physician and is struggling to get more nurses.

“Rep. Beyer also met with an older man who was detained by ICE when he went to his green card interview,” Fritschner told ARLnow. “DHS did not include this man in their list, but it’s the kind of case that has so many people in our community upset about what DHS and ICE are doing.”

Beyer told WRIC that “maybe as many as three quarters” of detainees at the center “only have a civil reason for being there.”

DHS disputes this, claiming that 66% of people detained at the center have been either charged or convicted of crimes in the United States.",https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20250501_193747234.MP_.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 12:58:37.738820

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first.
With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad.
This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement.
NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there.","On Jan. 29, President Trump issued an executive order directing the expansion of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay (NSGB) for “high-priority criminal aliens.” Since then, approximately 500 migrants—initially apprehended in the U.S.—have been detained at NSGB, and another 9,000 are being vetted for transfer. Detainees are under the supervision of the U.S. military and have been housed both in the MOC and at Camp Six—which at one point held alleged members of al-Qaeda. While the military is reportedly only acting in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the facts suggest their role is more “direct [and] active.” This raises the important possibility that the administration is violating the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). This article outlines how the use of the U.S. military to supervise the detention of migrants at NSGB would violate the PCA, analyzes whether such a violation is actionable, and presents possible remedies.

The PCA

The PCA prohibits using “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws[,]” but the law is unclear about what uses of military personnel are improper, and it leaves out entirely the issue of extraterritoriality. The first question has largely been fleshed out by the courts, leaving us with three tests for actions that “execute the laws”: first, any military act that is “regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature and causes the citizens to be presently or prospectively subject to regulations, proscriptions, or compulsions imposed by military authority”; second, “the direct active participation of federal military troops in law enforcement activities”; and third, “any [military] activities that pervade the activities of civilian law enforcement officials.” See also Bissonette v. Haig, United States v. Redfeather, and United States v. Jaramillo.

The use of “citizen” may seem problematic in the current context—which involves noncitizens—but the issue can be easily dispatched with because the term, as used in Bissonette, seems to be a colloquial distinction of petitioners from civilian law enforcement officers (LEOs) and the military. It is doubtful that this distinction has any real significance because the PCA is a criminal statute; as with all criminal statutes, the focus is on the acts and intent of the person accused of violating it—not on the victim.

Civilian LEOs assigned to correctional facilities exercise power that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory by any typical understanding of those words, and consistent with how they were applied in Bissonette. These LEOs restrict the detainees’ freedom of movement, often using armed guards along the perimeter of a facility. The presence of guards is direct, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves personnel rather than just equipment. The personnel’s role is also active, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves searches, seizures of contraband and other evidence, and the pursuit of escaped detainees, and it may involve criminal investigations and the interrogation of witnesses. If these tasks are performed by uniformed members of the military, or even civilian employees of the Defense Department, it could constitute a PCA violation.

Declarations by both detainees and members of the military—filed in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem and Espinoza Escalona v. Noem—show that the military is being used in violation of the PCA. Mirroring Bissonette’s use of military personnel and resources to create roadblocks and an armed perimeter for the purpose of confining the citizens of Wounded Knee, NSGB employs military personnel and Camp Six’s walls to similarly contain noncitizen detainees in a manner that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory.

Second, the military’s role here is both direct and active. Rather than merely engaging in a protective service of federal assets or providing assistance to civilian law enforcement, service members are engaging in strip searches, restraining detainees for out-of-cell movement, cell searches, direct supervision, serving food, and regulating and supervising phone use.

Finally, the military presence at Camp Six likely pervades that of civilian law enforcement. ICE “cannot be said to have been ‘lawfully engaged’ in the ‘lawful performance’ of their official duties” because those duties had been overtaken by the military. As of February, 900 service members were deployed to NSGB. The “Guard Force” at Camp Six consists of 28 soldiers, seven or eight Akima contractors, and only two ICE agents per shift. All three of the tests for what it means to “execute the law” are met, meaning that the PCA has been violated.

(Extra)territorial Application

No cases have addressed whether the PCA applies extraterritorially. As assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, William Barr opined that the PCA does not apply outside the territory of the U.S. However, that memo was written in 1989, and NSGB has undergone significant changes since then. The memo was written before NSGB was used as temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants interdicted at sea, 9/11, and the Bush administration’s expansion of NSGB to house enemy combatant detainees.

For these reasons, the memo’s rationale is less persuasive and is certainly non-dispositive. Below I address this issue in two parts: First, I argue that PCA violations at NSGB are actionable because NSGB is territorial; second, I argue that PCA violations committed at NSGB should be actionable even if it is considered extraterritorial.

The Case for Territoriality

NSGB is the United States’s oldest overseas military installation. It is located within the sovereign territory of Cuba but has been under the legal jurisdiction and control of the U.S. since 1903. The treaty contains no termination date and has no provision for unilateral termination, effectively making it an indefinite lease agreement. The treaty does not expressly limit the uses of the land, but it also does not contemplate the detention of migrants apprehended within the U.S. Rather, it expressly says that the lease is to be used for coaling and a naval station. This traditional use was precisely how NSGB was used until the 1990s. Until now, no non-U.S. territory—including NSGB—has ever been used to detain migrants who were first apprehended and detained within the U.S.

The clearest reason why the PCA should apply at NSGB is that it is a de facto territory of the U.S., a fact the government concedes. According to the government, “there is no Cuban government presence at NSGB and no way for Cuban authorities to exercise any control over the detainees.” Additionally, “while [the detainees] have physically departed the [U.S.] …[,] DHS has not completed the removal mission and has certainly not surrendered them to the control of the Cuban government.” The government went on to cite the finding in Boumediene v. Bush that NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. As a de facto territory, NSGB is legally indistinguishable—for the purposes of applying the U.S. Constitution and statutes—from Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

In Boumediene, the Supreme Court held that noncitizen detainees at NSGB can challenge their detention with a writ of habeas. Although the issue of habeas is not entirely analogous with the question posed here, Boumediene remains relevant because it addresses the extent to which the laws of the U.S. apply to noncitizen detainees housed at NSGB. It is especially on point because the Court’s reasoning relied on the degree of objective control that the U.S. asserted over an otherwise foreign territory.

The Court observed that “questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.” Speaking to these factors, the Court noted that, since the U.S. has had complete and uninterrupted control of NSGB for more than 100 years, under an indefinite lease it would be impossible for the political branches to govern it without legal constraints. NSGB is “no transient possession. In every practical sense [NSGB] is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the [U.S.]” The Court also held that “the detainees … are held in a territory that, while technically not part of the [U.S.], is under the complete and total control of our government.” As this concept relates to the general circumstances of the U.S.’s control over NSGB, and not solely habeas, this characterization of the territory ought to apply equally to questions of PCA violations occurring at NSGB.

Notably, this expansion of what is considered U.S. territory would not extend to all foreign facilities operated by the U.S. military. In Al Maqaleh v. Gates, the court remarked that “while it is certainly realistic to assert that the [U.S.] has de facto sovereignty over [NSGB], the same simply is not true with respect to Bagram[, Afghanistan].” Bagram was an active war zone at the time of the case, and the U.S. does not hold the same type of indefinite lease agreement with Afghanistan as it does with Cuba.

The Case for Extraterritoriality

Even if NSGB is not territorial, the PCA should still apply. Congress is silent on the matter, and no court has spoken on the issue. This creates a presumption against extraterritoriality, but presumptions are not insurmountable. Other U.S. laws without explicit extraterritoriality provisions are applied there. Aside from Boumediene extending the right of habeas to detainees at NSGB—and the subsequent filings of statutory habeas petitions by and for both enemy combatant and migrant detainees—there is also case law illustrating that criminal statutes can be applied to conduct committed at NSGB. Also relevant is the hope that the government is using some lawful basis to detain individuals at NSGB in the first place.

Criminal Statutes

Capt. John Nettleton—a former Guantanamo commander—was charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2), for making false statements at NSGB. Congressional intent for extraterritoriality had previously been read into § 1001 and, for the same reasons, the same should be done for the PCA. In United States v. Walczak, the court based its reasoning on the nationality principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the text, and the rationale in United States v. Bowman.

First, the nationality principle holds that a state has jurisdiction over its citizens for crimes committed outside of its territory. Under this principle, even if NSGB is outside of U.S. territory, those violating the PCA at NSGB would still be under U.S. jurisdiction for criminal offenses because they are U.S. citizens.

Second, the PCA reads in its entirety:

Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

While perhaps less clear, there are similarities between the PCA and § 1001. Walczak focused on the phrase “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department of agency of the [U.S.]” and held that § 1001 applied to the false statements made on Customs forms without regard to the place where the offense occurred because the Department of the Treasury is a “department of the [U.S.]” Similarly the PCA focuses on “departments”—or rather branches of the U.S. military. While the text is not dispositive, it suggests that the location is irrelevant because the criminal conduct is the improper use of military branches and the branches—or “departments”—are necessarily deployed all over the world.

Third, in Bowman, the Court noted that to limit the

locus [of certain offenses] to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute, and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home. In such cases, Congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries, but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense.

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first. In fact, in 1867, Congress was planning on using Midway Island in much the same way that NSGB was traditionally used—as a naval station and coaling depot. The Senate also consented to a treaty in 1878 that would have permitted a naval station to be built in Samoa. The PCA was enacted that same year—showing that Congress was contemplating overseas military installations and the PCA at the same time.

In 2021, Congress added the Space Force to the enumerated branches of the PCA. In doing so, they necessarily contemplated not just extraterritorial—but extraterrestrial—use of military power. Also relevant is that at this time, the U.S. operated around 750 foreign-based military installations, and the function of NSGB had been expanded to include temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants and long-term detention of enemy combatant detainees. With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad. Knowing that, Congress did not create new exceptions or repeal the PCA. It chose to expand it.

Just like in Bowman, Congress’s intent can be inferred because the scope and usefulness of the PCA would be greatly curtailed if the U.S. could choose to move a class of persons to a foreign based military installation in order to avoid sanction for actions which—if committed within the territorial U.S.—would constitute a violation of the PCA. Otherwise, the large number of foreign-based military installations would enable immunity for violations committed in foreign countries. And, as the military is deployed worldwide and the statute criminalizes an improper use of the enumerated branches, congressional intent for extraterritoriality can be inferred from the nature of the offense. Put together, the nationality principle, the text, and the Bowman rationale weigh toward the PCA overcoming the presumption against extraterritoriality.

Basis for Detention

It is unclear what authority is being used to justify migrant detention at NSGB—it does not come from a specific act of Congress, and it was not within the contemplated uses found within the treaties with Cuba. Statements made by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, indicating that detention would be temporary pending deportation unless other countries would not accept the migrants, suggest that this authority comes from 8 U.S.C. §1537(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(2)(A), or 8 U.S.C. §1231(g)(1). Critically, no provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) has an extraterritorial provision.

Military Purpose Doctrine

The Military Purpose Doctrine is important to consider as a possible exception to the PCA. It authorizes the military to actively participate in direct law enforcement activities when done for the primary purpose of furthering a Defense Department or foreign affairs function of the U.S. This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement. But using the U.S. military to supervise detention of migrant detainees at NSGB is not just an incidental benefit.

This is clear from the recent use of the military in Los Angeles. By carefully limiting the permissible role of federalized troops in California to “protect[ing] the safety and security of federal functions, personnel, and property,” the government has shown us that illegal immigration is primarily a civilian law enforcement activity. Though they accompany ICE agents on immigration raids, military service members are present only to protect federal law enforcement and assist by establishing a security perimeter. They cannot conduct law enforcement activities. This point has been made time and time again—in social media posts, news reports, official statements, and court filings.

The government has also demonstrated that detention on a military installation is a civilian law enforcement activity. Large swaths of land along the U.S.-Mexico border have been designated as military installations and, while soldiers can temporarily detain trespassers there, they must turn them over when an appropriate law enforcement entity can assume custody.

Remedies

The available facts show that the PCA is likely being violated. Ubi jus, ibi remedium—for every wrong there is a remedy. Here, violators face the criminal sanctions enumerated in the statute and/or a variety of civil actions including ultra vires claims and habeas relief. A civil rights action may also be appropriate, but the probability of success is minimal. Because the guilty actors are federal instead of state agents, the suit would have to be brought as a Bivens action rather than a § 1983 suit. Bivens, however, will not be discussed at length here, as the Supreme Court has drastically limited Bivens actions and the probability of success is miniscule.

Ultra Vires Claim

An ultra vires claim can be brought, despite sovereign immunity, when the plaintiff brings suit against an official in their official capacity, can show that the official acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act, and seeks a prospective relief other than monetary damages. This is illustrated by a parallel case. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has brought an ultra vires claim arguing that the way the National Guard is being used in Los Angeles either amounts to or creates the risk of an imminent PCA violation.

Turning to the case at NSGB, neither the plaintiffs in Espinoza Escalona v. Noem nor those in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem brought claims related to the PCA—but they could have, because in both cases, officials have likely exceeded their authority, in violation of the PCA, by housing noncitizen detainees under military supervision. While petitioners could not seek monetary damages through an ultra vires claim, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against future transfers would be appropriate, as both are proscriptive remedies.

Injunctive Relief

Emergency injunctive relief is proper to prevent additional transfers to NSGB. The question is to what extent it can be applied. Hundreds of cases have been filed against the Trump administration, and the scope of emergency injunctive relief has been a cornerstone issue. The Supreme Court recently kiboshed universal injunctions, which might suggest that each person has to file their own lawsuit to obtain relief—even if the wrong spawns from an executive order affecting millions of people. Fortunately the Court has left open several avenues for widespread relief: Plaintiffs may be able to certify nationwide classes; the Administrative Procedure Act might enable courts to set aside unlawful actions; and states could either file in state court and obtain nationwide injunctions upon showing of a “patchwork” of individual injunctions is insufficient to protect their interests or file a suit against the government directly in the Supreme Court.

Habeas

Habeas is the mechanism used to challenge legality or duration of confinement. Habeas jurisdiction is proper here for two reasons: Migrant detainees are “in custody under or by color of the authority of the [U.S],” and they are “in custody in violation of the … laws … of the [U.S.]”—namely the PCA. Additionally, the detainees here are in “the immediate physical custody of American forces who answer only to an American chain of command.” For these reasons, habeas relief should be granted and migrant detainees at NSGB should be released—whether that be into the U.S. or by removal to another country.

***

It would be patently unlawful to use the military in this way within U.S. borders; it is dangerous to suggest that by removing detainees to a black site in the Caribbean the government is allowed to act with impunity. NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there. But even supposing this is not true, there is reason to believe that the PCA should be interpreted to apply extraterritorially. In either case, there are remedies available for the migrants who have been, are, or will be detained under these conditions at NSGB.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-12 12:59:04.779627

Several other felony charges were tacked on due to Momand having underage friends in the backseat, but the charges were ultimately dropped by Henrico prosecutors. The case was resolved — Momand pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and reckless driving — with no jail time ordered by the judge.

But he wound up at Riverside Regional Jail that night anyway. Moments after his court hearing on Friday he was picked up by immigration officers. Over the weekend, the agency transferred Momand to a detention facility in Farmville, where he remained on Monday.

Momand arrived in the U.S. with his family in the aftermath of the military’s hectic exit from Afghanistan in 2021, according to his immigration attorney, Miriam Airington-Fisher. His defense lawyer, Casey Coleman, said his father “made significant contributions to the U.S. government in Afghanistan.”

It’s possible that he was targeted because of the felony charge, despite it being dropped by an agreement with prosecutors. A spokesperson for ICE did not return a request for comment Monday morning regarding Momand’s arrest.

In 2009, Congress authorized resettlement programs for Afghans and Iraqis affected by America’s long-running wars in those countries. Since then, around 50,000 visas have been granted to Afghans who were employed by the U.S. government, according to the State Department. Another group of refugees was welcomed in after the U.S. exit from Kabul in 2021.

The Biden administration said many of the more recent admissions “took significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan.”

The Department of Homeland Security at the time said all visa recipients were rigorously vetted — thousands of applicants to the program continue to be denied each year, according to statistics from the Department of State.

Airington-Fisher, an immigration attorney of 17 years, said Special Immigrant Visas are reserved for the “most meritorious cases.” She described her client’s arrest as a clumsy waste of government resources.”

His family was scheduled for a formal green card interview this week, she said.

“They can say a million times that they are arresting the worst of the worst, that they are MS-13, that they are gang members, but that’s just not who they’re arresting,” said Airington-Fisher. “They’re arresting people like Arman, whose family filed all the proper paperwork.”

On Monday, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin sent CBS 21 the following statement about the woman's detention:

ICE arrested Estrelita Soliman-Ramos, a criminal illegal alien from the Philippines, on August 4, 2025. Her criminal history includes two arrests for theft. “On July 28, 2025, she was pulled over by local police for driving without a license and improperly restraining a child. On August 4, she reported to York ERO, and she was taken into custody.

While McLaughlin stated that Soliman had initially been in the country legally, that status had not been the case for over two decades:

She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000. Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.

A GoFundMe created on behalf of the family, which had raised over $81,000 as of Monday morning, said Soliman began her green card process last year.

As she worked through the process, the woman received a notice from ICE asking her to appear and register for an ""Alternatives to Detention"" program on Aug. 4.

The annual field trip had a different tone this year, however, as immigration enforcement raids have swept their communities.
Against this backdrop, choosing an issue to tackle as they sat at the wooden City Council desk was easy.
“We see the pain in the kids.” The conversations the younger kids are having aren’t too different from those of the older ones, Gallegos said.
“You guys have power,” Gallegos reminded the group as the youthful city council prepared to cast their mock vote calling for community mental health services.","The scene at the dais in Riverside’s City Council chambers looked a bit different on a recent Monday morning: Instead of men and women in business attire, children wearing navy blue T-shirts emblazoned with vibrant orange and yellow butterfly wings occupied the swivel chairs.

The children were participating in a mock council meeting as part of a summer leadership program run by TODEC, a legal center serving immigrants and farmworkers in the Inland Empire and Coachella Valley. The organization brought kids from across Coachella Valley and nearby cities to the Riverside City Council to give them hands-on learning experience on civic engagement and culture.

The annual field trip had a different tone this year, however, as immigration enforcement raids have swept their communities. Since June, the children have witnessed friends self-deport with their families, learned a local youth soccer coach was detained and have seen their own undocumented family members change daily routines in fear.

Against this backdrop, choosing an issue to tackle as they sat at the wooden City Council desk was easy. For the group of 22 children, ages 4 to 17, curbing fear over the unfolding raids and ongoing family separations was front and center.

“When people are going through stuff like that they get emotional and they get sad,” explained incoming fifth-grader Montserrat Garcia, leaning into the microphone as she assumed the role of mayor.

After a bit of discussion and guidance from Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson and TODEC executive director Luz Gallegos, the mock city council unanimously voted to fund mental health workshops for their community.

“They are learning the building blocks. They are being the change that needs to be seen,” said chaperone Julio Roman, dad to a 6- and 9-year-old on the trip. “If you read about it, you hear about it in books, it’s nothing like being here and having the privilege of coming in and actually seeing how the process works.”

Using civic knowledge to push for change

That’s been the intention of Monarcas Luchadoras, which translates to monarchs in the struggle. The program aims to equip school-age children, many of whom are immigrants or come from immigrant families, with an understanding of how to enact change. They’ve learned how laws are passed as well as how to recognize problems in their community and push for solutions through organizing.

Though the mission hasn’t wavered over the program’s nearly four decades, it has felt especially important this summer, she said — especially as kids are confronted with very real fears over separation.

“It’s a very different program to other summers,” said Gallegos, who is an alumna of the program. “We see the pain in the kids.”

The conversations the younger kids are having aren’t too different from those of the older ones, Gallegos said. They have all wanted to know why events are unfolding and how they align with American values.

“We are seeing kids as young as 4 years old knowing what ICE is, knowing that they may be undocumented, knowing that their parents and family and friends are undocumented,” she said.

The students took advantage of a rare field trip and explored art installations at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture and learned about the historical figures whose statues make up the city’s Civil Rights Walk.

At the museum, a few kids lingered in front of a painting of a low rider, while others ran toward an installation with glass seashells typically used to call out to gods such as the Aztec goddess Cihuateotl, who was depicted at the installation.

“They’re teaching me how to keep up our culture, how to help other people, not just ourselves, how to be nice and kind, how to be respectful,” fifth-grader Garcia said.

Stepping up for Riverside’s immigrant community

The children have learned a lot just by being in the environment, said Linda Cruz, whose three children soaked in the new experiences, including her 3-year-old daughter Mia, who joins the group at events like Monday’s field trip.

Her children have also helped TODEC pack groceries and educational materials for families too scared to leave their homes.

“They’re seeing the anxiety, and they’re also seeing that, with that anxiety, they can do something,” Cruz said. “It’s giving them confidence that I think a lot of people in our community lack.”

Gallegos and other TODEC leaders have pushed kids to think about solutions even if they’re not old enough to vote. The center has also taken children to Sacramento, Moreno Valley and Riverside County to speak on how immigration enforcement has affected their friends and families.

And they’ve encouraged kids to share their own ideas as they learn to use their voices. Zoey Roman, 9, wants to find more ways to help families pay for groceries as parents stay home from work because of the raids.

The latest data shows that overall arrest numbers decreased between June and July, marking a notable month-to-month decline. However, these figures remain elevated when viewed against recent historical context, indicating that immigration enforcement continues at levels significantly higher than previous periods.

ICE's daily arrest numbers also tell an important story about enforcement capacity and policy. Despite previous reports of a 3,000-per-day arrest quota, daily figures have consistently fallen short of reaching this threshold, with no significant increase in recent daily totals.

This discrepancy becomes more convoluted when considering recent court filings from the Department of Justice that have challenged the existence of such a policy altogether, contradicting earlier public statements and media reports that supported the existence of these daily quotas.

I’ll leave it to the lawyers to decide whether the administration’s touting of a daily goal of 3,000 arrests does or does not constitute a quota. It seems that, once again, the administration likes to say one thing in public, then something different in official filings—reminiscent of Trump’s debunked allegations that the election was stolen. In any case, regardless of whether 3,000 daily arrests was a “goal” or a “quota”, the administration is not meeting it. The data makes that clear.

Perhaps the most significant finding from previous analysis continues to hold true in the July data: the demographic composition of ICE arrests remains skewed toward individuals with no criminal history. The surge in arrests that peaked at the end of May and continued through mid-June was primarily driven by enforcement actions against immigrants without criminal backgrounds.

While this number retreated from its previous high by the end of June and maintained lower levels throughout July, immigrants with no criminal history still represent the largest single category of ICE arrests through the end of July. Remarkably, this group continues to exceed the number of arrests involving immigrants with criminal convictions—a pattern that raises important questions about enforcement priorities and resource allocation.

These trends in ICE enforcement data reveal the ongoing tension between stated policy objectives and actual implementation on the ground. As the Deportation Data Project continues to extract information through litigation, these updates provide crucial transparency into immigration enforcement patterns that might otherwise remain hidden from public scrutiny.

The persistence of high arrest numbers, combined with the continued focus on individuals without criminal histories, suggests that current enforcement practices remain at odds with stated priorities of focusing resources on those who pose genuine public safety concerns. As new data becomes available, tracking these patterns will be essential for understanding the real-world impact of immigration enforcement policies.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits.
Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.
But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.
“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","Republican-led cuts to public assistance programs – carried out at the behest of Donald Trump’s administration – will lead to 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps, among them families with children, the non-partisan congressional budget office (CBO) has found.

The estimate, published Monday, forecast that the number of people receiving food stamp benefits in an average month would drop after Republican lawmakers expanded work requirements to some parents, older enrollees and others.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), formerly known as food stamps, in 2024 served an average of 41.7 million people monthly, or 12.3% of the US population. Federal spending on the program amounts to almost $100bn, and benefits average $187.20 a month.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits. The Snap program has long required certain able-bodied adults to work to receive benefits for longer than three months.

But the bill broadened the requirement to parents of dependent children – requiring that those with kids ages 14 and older work, volunteer or participate in job training at least 80 hours monthly.

The bill – which places more responsibility for food programs and other benefits onto states – requires that adults ages 55 to 64, veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster care youth meet the mandate, though it exempts Native Americans, according to CNN.

The CBO estimates that US households, on average, will see an increase in the resources available to them as a result of the bill – but “the changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households”.

Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.

The agency said it “estimates that, in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution”.

But the highest earners, with incomes of nearly $700,000, on average, will see a $13,600 jump in their incomes, or about 2.7%.

Overall, middle-income Americans, who earn about $86,000 on average, will get an $800 increase in federal assistance overall while those who earn less than $24,000 will see their projected incomes drop by about $1,200 a year.

The estimates come as the federal government is shifting costs of benefit programs onto states.

“Hunger is a public health crisis, and Snap is one of the most effective tools we have to address it – reducing food insecurity, improving health outcomes, and lowering long-term health care costs,” the Food Research & Action Center said recently, after the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to restrict certain junk foods, including sodas and candy, from products that can be purchased with Snap benefits.

“For years, Snap has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy – products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said in a statement.

But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.

“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f826e74a361b72e6ca893bb7fc51dfa8514b49/728_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8598e8381f8da165e8b00c33e687bfe2",N,,2025-08-12 12:58:29.179277

“That’s not how it works.” Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too.
That law suffered a setback last month when, after a lengthy court battle, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it cannot apply to private companies, paving the way for more federal detention centers to open.
“I think they have an insatiable appetite for this, and it’s not about violent criminals,” Menendez said.","Rep. LaMonica McIver said she will continue to fight for congressional oversight of immigration detention centers, despite facing federal charges accusing her of assaulting officers during a May visit to a migrant jail in Newark.

McIver (D-10) told the New Jersey Monitor at an event in Jersey City Monday that the case against her has been “definitely stressful.”

“When you talk about a person coming to charge you because you were there to do your job and they’re telling you you can get 17 years in prison, that’s nothing to joke with. I’m a mother, I’m a wife, I have a family,” she said.

McIver was joined by Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City for what they billed as a dialogue series to discuss their “shared experiences and work fighting for our communities in the time of Trump.”

The two recalled an immigration raid in Newark that occurred less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, along with their often confrontational visits to detention centers.

McIver, Menendez, and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) showed up at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed migrant detention center in Newark, on May 9 for an unannounced inspection of the facility. Their visit ended in chaos, with federal officers arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and charging him with trespassing, then later charging McIver and accusing her of shoving agents as they took Baraka into custody. She pleaded not guilty, and her trial is tentatively set to begin in November (the charges against Baraka were quickly dropped).

Menendez recalled from his visit to Delaney Hall that the building was dirty, the telephones were not working, and the three members of Congress got stuck in an elevator. Baraka and other Newark officials have accused Delaney Hall’s owners, private prison firm Geo Group, of opening the facility without proper city permits and inspections.

McIver noted on Monday that after the incident at Delaney Hall made national headlines, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to stop members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigrant detention centers by requiring them to alert the department seven days in advance. An appropriations law in effect since 2019 grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“It hasn’t changed — it’s just that the administration wants it to change, so they literally put out a guidance, but you can’t just change policy because you want to,” McIver said. “That’s not how it works.”

Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too. He was among the lawmakers who signed a letter sent to then-President Biden urging him to stop fighting a New Jersey law that bars companies from contracting with ICE to detain immigrants. That law suffered a setback last month when, after a lengthy court battle, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it cannot apply to private companies, paving the way for more federal detention centers to open.

“The writing was on the wall that if Trump were to win, you’re going to see the most expansive immigration enforcement policies and actions that we’ve ever seen, and that’s what’s happening today,” Menendez said.

Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE: There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers.
Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph.","Amna Nawaz:

More than a million immigrants work in health care in the U.S., and they make up an increasing share of caregivers for elderly and disabled Americans. That includes medical professionals, but also the housekeepers and the janitors that keep nursing homes running. These facilities already face labor shortages.

And now, as William Brangham reports, the Trump administration's immigration policies could make it even more difficult to find workers.

William Brangham:

She fled her native Haiti and settled in Florida. After the devastating 2010 earthquake, the Obama administration granted her and thousands of other Haitians temporary protected status, or TPS, which allowed them to remain in the United States and work legally, but didn't provide a path to permanent residency.

As TPS for Haitians was repeatedly extended, Edelyne got married, bought this house. She also had a daughter, who is 6 and is an American citizen. She enrolled in school, working first as a nursing assistant, and then as a registered nurse in nursing homes.

Edelyne Jean:

I love what I'm doing, and I do it with pride and the compassion. Like, I feel for these people. Like, some of them, they have no family members. We are the family. We are family.

Edelyne Jean:

I tried. Like, I do the right thing. I tried to be one of them, to be part of America. But I don't think we're welcome, I'm welcome, especially with this administration. No.

William Brangham:

In February, even as armed gangs expanded control over parts of Haiti, the Trump administration sought to end TPS for Haitians and send them back.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: They're pouring into our country, pouring in. If I weren't elected president, there'd be nobody in Haiti anymore.

William Brangham:

The move was just one of several efforts to rescind the status of thousands of noncitizens working legally across the United States.

Is this something you're worrying about every single day?

William Brangham:

Haitians on TPS were granted a reprieve last month when a federal district court judge ruled that the deadline for ending TPS must be extended to next February. But that's little comfort for Edelyne and her family.

Edelyne Jean:

If nothing happens, I'm screwed, because, if I can't work to take out the bills, I won't be able to take out my daughter. And I don't know. I can't even think about it.

William Brangham:

The looming end of TPS is not just a crisis for Edelyne and the hundreds of thousands of other Haitians here in the U.S.

It's also putting extraordinary strain on long-term health care facilities, like nursing homes, where a little over 7 percent of the work force are noncitizens.

Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE:

There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers. And if the immigrants who are now filling those jobs go away, they just won't be filled is almost certainly what's going to happen.

Dr. David Himmelstein:

Hospitals and emergency rooms to panned on nursing homes. They can't discharge patients who are not able to care for themselves unless there's a nursing home to take care of them or home care workers to take care of them. And that's going to mean backups.

William Brangham:

At the Sinai Residences in Boca Raton, Florida, these policy changes could mean dozens of workers might lose their jobs. This facility includes independent and assisted living, a nursing home and a memory care unit.

Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph. She came to the U.S. from Haiti two years ago with a younger sister and her teenage son. She's legally working under TPS.

Vanessa Joseph, TPS Recipient:

I cry every day. But I don't tell my son that because he can have more — more stress than me. So I tell him it's going to be OK. So I just stay positive.

Rachel Blumberg:

There were a lot of questions of, what have I done wrong? And my answer to them was that, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. It's unfortunately just where you were born, which doesn't seem fair at all. It was, I would have to say, the hardest day of my entire 30-year career in senior living.

William Brangham:

Blumberg says losing these workers would not only be hard on their own lives, but on the many residents at Sinai who've developed long and deep relationships with them; 92-year-old Isobel Loring has lived at Sinai for almost a decade, and she's grown very close to Vanessa.

Isobel Loring:

I love you too.

The people I care about are the people that are working with us, that are helping us, that are here for us when we need them under all circumstances. If these people are not being allowed to work, there won't be people to take care of us. These communities that have elderly people, there are no Americans that really want to do those jobs.

Vanessa Joseph:

I like work here. We are family here. But it's so hard, hard, hard to go back in Haiti. I can't. Sometimes, I would like to see my mom, hug her because she's sick, but I can't.

Rachel Blumberg:

We're already looking at, unfortunately, replacing them. It's not what I want to do, but we're a 24/7 operation. We have to have our caregivers and our essential workers there.

William Brangham:

The Trump administration is still determining next steps in the court case that delayed the end of TPS to early next year.

In a recent statement, the Department of Homeland Security said: ""President Trump and Secretary Noem are restoring common sense to our immigration system and returning TPS to its original status, temporary.""

William Brangham:

Back outside Orlando, nurse Edelyne Jean is bracing for the next shoe to drop.

If it comes down to the government saying you have to leave, will you go back to Haiti or will you try to go somewhere else?

Edelyne Jean:

I don't see myself going back to Haiti, because, if I go, they will kill you. Eventually, they will. So I'm not going. And I have my daughter too. She was born here. She belongs here.

William Brangham:

With federal immigration policy changing almost daily, Edelyne is left worried that the life she has built in America could soon come to an end.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

""We're getting them out at record numbers,"" Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. ""We have an obligation to, and we're doing it.""

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it's not just the big bill's fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

""Your agency is out of control,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would ""go broke"" by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an ""indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,"" often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump's long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

""We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,"" the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

""We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department's plan to disburse OBBBA funding,"" they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee ""to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated"" through the new law.

""ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,"" she said. ""This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.""

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it's what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a ""whole of government"" approach.

""They're orienting this huge shift,"" Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves ""inward.""

The flood of cash comes when Americans' views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a ""good thing"" for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump's approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new ""Speedway Slammer"" in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the ""worst of the worst,"" and he dismissed as ""garbage"" the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

""There's no safe haven here,"" Homan said recently outside the White House. ""We're going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he'd do.""

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were ""begging for money.""

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aea4727/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6516x3421+0+462/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F32%2F20959c57412784d0aa53fef3143f%2Fap25209664058034.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 17:57:17.550387

The proposal was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review three weeks ago.

Though details are confidential until publication in the Federal Register, the proposed rule could seek to supplement or replace the annual H-1B cap lottery by giving priority in the selection process to registrants who meet or exceed certain criteria, such as wage or education level.

During the final weeks of the first Trump Administration, an alteration to the cap selection process was finalized by DHS that would have largely replaced the computerized H-1B lottery with a system that allocated H-1B visa numbers according to the Department of Labor’s four-level prevailing wage system. That regulation would have first distributed H-1B cap numbers to registrants offered a wage that equaled or exceeded Level IV, the highest wage tier of the prevailing wage system, then would have selected registrations in descending order from Wage Levels III, II, and I; a computerized lottery would have been used only if the number of registrations for a specific wage level exceeded the number of H-1B cap slots available. The final rule was postponed in the first days of the Biden Administration and ultimately vacated by a federal court without having been implemented.

It is not yet known whether the proposal now under review is the same as the rule finalized in early 2021.

It is expected that the proposed regulation will be released for publication in the Federal Register in the coming days or weeks, with a public comment period of 30 or 60 days. After giving meaningful consideration to the comments, the agency would then publish a final version of the rule with an implementation period.

Executives at GEO Group and CoreCivic said they were open to operating on military sites.
“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said.","WASHINGTON — Government contracts fueled a financial boom this year for the two private prison companies that dominate the U.S. immigration detention industry.

The industry stands to gain further as the Trump administration expands the network of privately run detention sites nationally, targeting a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants this year.

From the detention facilities that private-prison firm GEO Group owns or leases, revenue for the second quarter this year jumped 12% from last year, driven largely by new contracts at facilities like Delaney Hall in Newark.

“Congrats again on the quarter and the fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” Joe Gomes, a financial analyst with Noble Capital Markets, told GEO Group executives on an earnings call last week.

Big rewards

Revenue for CoreCivic, the other major company in the nation’s corporate prison industry, rose about 10% over the same period, the company said. CoreCivic operates the Elizabeth Detention Center.

“Our business is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment,” said Damon Hininger, CEO of CoreCivic, who praised a recent federal court ruling that cleared a path for new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in New Jersey. “We strongly believe that this was the right decision,” he said.

Early in the second Trump administration, the private prison industry is riding a lucrative wave of government contracts and eyeing steps to grow further. Those plans include opening mothballed facilities, using GPS tracking devices to monitor undocumented immigrants and expanding air- and ground-based transportation of detainees.

The private operators are also looking to profit by expanding their reach by using military sites to hold detainees. Executives at GEO Group and CoreCivic said they were open to operating on military sites.

George Zoley, executive chairman of the GEO Group, said his company had reached agreements with a military contractor so that GEO could “pursue potential procurements that may be issued for operational support services at military sites.”

NJ military site

The U.S. government plans to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst for deportation flights and to hold between 1,000 and 3,000 undocumented immigrants there, according to plans NJ Spotlight News first reported.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also publicly approved Camp Atterbury in Indiana and the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold undocumented immigrants.

‘The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office’ — Molly Linhorst, attorney, ACLU of New Jersey

Lifting this financially lucrative wave for private prison firms is the roughly $170 billion in federal funding Congress allocated for the Trump administration, through a recently enacted law, to use on its hardline immigration agenda.

“I think it is an unprecedented opportunity for them,” Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney at the ACLU of New Jersey, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.

“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said. “The private prison companies are by no means strangers to the federal government.”

Billions to be spent

Both companies lobbied Congress on legislation that turned into the law that contained the approximately $170 billion portion of new funding, federal lobbying records show.

Zoley, of GEO Group, said the Delaney Hall site “remains in the process of ramping up,” describing its opening in February as an “important milestone.”

Delaney Hall, which can hold 1,000 detainees, is expected to make the company more than $60 million over its first year running, Zoley said.

The GEO Group has contracts to run 21 detention facilities nationwide, and the number of beds in its control — industry shorthand for how many people can be detained — grew from 15,000 to 20,000 from April through June this year. “This represents more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide,” Zoley said, adding that the company “stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices” used to track immigrants who are not detained but after “ICE detention capacity” runs out.

The Trump administration has a goal of reaching 100,000 beds for ICE by the end of the year, an objective that could be met with the use of outdoor tents and military sites, like the joint base in New Jersey.

Whatever immigration detention apparatus is erected during the second Trump term will linger beyond, Linhorst predicted, noting the 15-year contract the U.S. government reached with GEO Group to run Delaney Hall.

“The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office,” Linhorst said.

“Right now, it’s a huge moment,” Linhorst added. Yet what decisions the U.S. government reaches with the industry will carry on, she said. “There’s a lot of motive to continue to fill these beds.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/08/ICE-federal-agents-Delaney-Hall-ICE-protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 01:56:21.438391

Everett woman and son detained by ICE

Shaw is a New Zealand national who is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency. Shaw currently holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides work authorization and advance parole, allowing international travel and re-entry.

Shaw’s work authorization was approved, although the advance parole was not. She immigrated to the U.S. three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her former husband, and qualified to reapply independently as a survivor of domestic abuse.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” Besancon said. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

Shaw currently works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families at the Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie. Shaw is also a member of Union Local 341.

Shaw is currently being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center, which is one of two facilities in the nation that house detained families facing deportation.

Accompanied by faith: Local faith leaders began showing up to immigration court daily this month to accompany people in response to ICE’s decision to arrest many after their hearings, Alexandra Mendoza reported for The San Diego-Union Tribune.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains more and more people, courtrooms at Otay Mesa Detention Center have filled, leaving many family and friends hoping to see their loved ones’ hearings stuck instead in the facility lobby.

In June when I went to the detention center to watch a bond hearing for a man arrested at the downtown San Diego Immigration Court and detained at Otay Mesa, the line of members of the public trying to get into the court stretched almost to the lobby door. The guards working the front desk warned that we might not get in because of limited seating.

I watched as a family of nine had to choose which members to send up to the courtroom. Several community members were in line behind me to see the same case I was there to watch. I was the only one of us allowed up, and the processing took so long that even though we arrived at the facility well before the afternoon hearings began, I missed most of his hearing by the time I got upstairs to the court.

Guards escorted attorneys and members of the public to the courtrooms through a series of sliding metal doors controlled by badges.

It wasn’t the first time that I’d seen people denied entrance to the courtrooms due to space constraints. Each courtroom has rows of three benches on each side of the door. According to the guards, people in custody are not allowed to sit next to people not in custody, unless they are attorneys. That means if there is a detained person sitting on a bench, no member of the public can sit there.

The guards also don’t allow men in custody to sit on the same bench as women in custody, or men wearing blue, indicating ICE considers them low security level, to sit next to men wearing red, those ICE considers high security. Men in orange, people ICE has labeled medium level security, are usually grouped with those in red.

In July, I sat in the packed courtroom of Immigration Judge Guy Grande at Otay Mesa Detention Center, watching as person after person asked to be deported.

More than a dozen men squeezed into the three benches to the left of the door. The men in the first row wore orange, and those in the second two rows, which had five people crammed into each of them, wore blue. On the right, a row of women wearing either blue or orange filled the front bench. I sat with a couple of family members of one of the men in the second bench, and several more detained men sat in the bench behind us, including a man in red.

The man spoke with his son, a toddler in the row I was sitting in, and a guard moved him further away from the child so they wouldn’t speak.

Grande worked his way through the cases, including a few detained men that were held in San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona who appeared on a television screen along with the judge, who was using Webex from his courtroom in downtown San Diego to hear the cases.

As the afternoon stretched past 4 p.m., the time that immigration courts typically close, Grande called forward a man from Mexico who asked for voluntary departure.

The judge swore the man in and began reading through ICE’s allegations and charge. (Though immigration is considered a civil legal matter rather than a criminal one, people in immigration court do face charges that indicate why ICE thinks they are deportable.)

When the judge asked to confirm his nationality, the man said he was from Tijuana.

Grande told the man that ICE said he had overstayed his visa, that he had entered in October 2015 with a tourist visa.

The man corrected the judge. The last time he entered was in June 2025, less than two weeks before, he said.

“In 2025?” the judge said.

Yes, the man said.

He told the judge he’d been in the United States for about three days doing some shopping when ICE arrested him.

The judge turned to the ICE attorney in the courtroom and confirmed that normally someone can stay up to six months on that kind of tourist visa.

The judge looked at the date on the Notice to Appear, the document containing the allegations and charge that the Department of Homeland Security files with the court to start an immigration case. It was just a few days after the man said he’d entered the United States.

The ICE attorney asked for a continuance, saying she needed time to find the man’s arrest documents.

“I know you don’t want to be detained,” Grande told the man. “I wouldn’t want to be detained either.”

“The government doesn’t have the file, and it’s late in the day,” Grande added. “You could be in status. Maybe the government can’t sustain the charge.”

The man asked, with some disbelief in his voice, if the judge was suggesting he wait more time in custody to try to sort out the issue.

After more back and forth, Grande asked the man if he wanted the judge to terminate his case.

The man said he didn’t know what that meant.

The judge said he didn’t think based on the information in the Notice to Appear that he could order the man removed.

“I don’t want to be detained anymore,” the man said. “My family depends on me. I work in Tijuana to provide for my family.”

Over ICE’s objections, Grande terminated the case. When I checked for the man in ICE’s detainee database about a week later, he was no longer in custody.

Around 5:30 p.m., Grande still had several people in his courtroom waiting to ask to be deported.

“I am burned out,” Grande said. “This is beyond my pay grade.”

He told his clerk to set the remaining cases over for the following morning.

“We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly.
Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up.
After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.” To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.
ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded.","Despite their proclivity for wearing masks, the Department of Homeland Security denies that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refuse to identify themselves in the field. “I’ve been on a number of these operations,” Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said last month. “They are wearing vests that say ICE or ERO, which is the enforcement arm of ICE or Homeland Security Investigations. They clearly verbally identify themselves.”

But video from a confrontation in a New York state town that was reviewed by The Intercept contradicts her claims.

In the footage, Juan Fonseca Tapia, the co-founder and organizer of the Connecticut-based immigrant advocacy group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, questions a man dressed as a construction worker.

“What agency are you with?” asks Fonseca Tapia, filming through his car window.

“I’m not going to tell you,” responds the man, who is wearing a high-visibility construction vest, an orange helmet, and glasses, with a camouflage mask covering most of his face. “It’s none of your business.”

The construction worker getup was actually a disguise: ICE confirmed to The Intercept that the man in the hard hat is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. “ICE New York City officers were conducting surveillance in Brewster, New York, August 2, when anti-ICE agitators followed them and attempted to disrupt their operation,” an ICE spokesperson told The Intercept by email.

In the video — which was posted last weekend on social media by Greater Danbury Area Unites for Immigrants — the ICE agent said only that he is a member of “federal law enforcement.” Neither “ICE” nor “ERO” is visible on his vest in the footage.

That puts the lie to McLaughlin’s claims that ICE agents identify themselves.

Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept that he spotted a second man who was similarly disguised as a construction worker.

“I find it outrageous. It’s indefensible. This is where we are crossing a dangerous line on immigration enforcement into these paramilitary type tactics with a secret police force,” said New York state Sen. Patricia Fahy who last month introduced the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics, or MELT, Act, which would ban the use of face coverings and plainclothes by ICE and other federal enforcement agents during civilian immigration actions conducted in New York. “The first three words of the provision that we’re adding into law are ‘Masks and disguises prohibited,’ period. And this video is Exhibit A. This is exactly what we are alarmed about.”

On Tuesday, at a National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, Fahy joined colleagues from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in condemning the use of “paramilitary-type secret police” tactics by ICE agents. “We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly. Let’s collectively bring attention to this,’” Fahy told The Intercept. “We had a couple of dozen lawmakers all standing up to say ‘This is not who we are’ and calling out these authoritarian-type tactics.”

The interaction with the disguised construction worker began when Fonseca Tapia spotted a group of people he believed to be ICE agents in downtown Brewster. He began alerting day laborers who congregate in the area, while driving in his car. Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up. Eventually, he found himself surrounded by several vehicles with dark tinted windows.

Fonseca Tapia said that the man in the construction worker disguise confronted him and repeatedly tried to persuade him to roll down his window or get out of the car. He said he feared that he might be “kidnapped” by ICE.

After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.”

To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.

“It’s literally a threat,” said Fonseca Tapia. “You have three vehicles with very tinted windows, so it’s impossible to see inside. People are wearing masks and refuse to identify themselves, and one of them tells you he is going to call more of them to ‘take care of you’?” This is for sure an intimidation tactic to instill fear in people who are working to alert the community when there is an ICE presence.”

An ICE spokesperson cited “increased assaults toward ICE” as the reason that the ICE agent confronted individuals who followed and filmed them in Brewster. “The officer was concerned for the safety of himself and others,” the spokesperson wrote.

“I don’t know what the concern was — because he was following me,” said Fonseca Tapia. “If he thought I posed a threat, I don’t think he would put himself in danger by following me.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, masked ICE agents carrying out immigration raids have become increasingly common. Across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies working with ICE launch operations wearing disguises or plainclothes and sometimes arrive in unmarked vehicles and arrest people without warrants. Often ICE agents don masks, balaclavas, neck gaiters, or other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

Lawmakers, veteran law enforcement officials, activists, and citizens have criticized the donning of masks by law enforcement as anti-American — for sowing confusion, chaos, and fear, while reducing accountability and undermining public trust.

“The failure of ICE officers and agents to promptly and clearly identify who they are and the authority under which they are acting has led witnesses of immigration enforcement operations to justifiably question the law enforcement status, authority, and constitutionality of ICE officers and agents and their operations,” wrote U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a May letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; Tom Homan, the executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations; and top ICE officials. “We remain deeply concerned that ICE’s lack of transparency will lead the public to intercede in enforcement efforts, escalating an already tense interaction, and risking an entirely avoidable violent situation.”

Fahy emphasized that she had a family member who served in law enforcement and that she saw the use of masks and disguises as a threat to law and order. “It’s undermining all of law enforcement because they come across as impersonators. There’s no accountability and there’s no transparency, so it erodes public trust and undermines decades of work and millions of dollars spent,” she told The Intercept. “When they use disguises, these arrests — without presenting an arrest warrant, neither a judicial or even administrative warrant — come across as abductions or kidnapping. These are third-world tactics, and they should shock the collective conscience.”

The International Association of Chiefs of Police warns that “members of the general public may be intimidated or fearful of officers wearing a face covering, which may heighten their defensive reactions.”

An ICE spokesperson said the agency has no policy on masks, aside from pandemic safety requirements. The Department of Homeland Security has endorsed the agents’ right to wear masks, citing attacks on agents or the doxing of law enforcement or their families. In an email, DHS specifically mentioned one Texas man’s threat to shoot ICE agents as a reason to allow masks, although it was unclear how a mask would protect an agent from a bullet. Nonetheless, DHS insisted that because of such fears, ICE would not discourage its agents from wearing masks during anti-immigrant raids.

For almost two months, DHS has failed to respond to The Intercept’s questions about escalating statistics quoted by government officials about supposed assaults of federal agents. In June, DHS told The Intercept that “ICE law enforcement and their families are being targeted and are facing an over 400% increase in assaults.” ICE now claims that figure has jumped to 830 percent.

ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded. “At no time did the officer attempt to make an arrest or detain anyone without being plainly marked as an ICE officer,” the spokesperson said.

The New York City Bar Association has noted that secret police tactics are a gateway to further lawlessness. “Allowing masked ICE agents to conduct detentions also makes it increasingly likely that third-party actors will impersonate federal agents and use their anonymity to subject vulnerable populations to harassment and violence under the apparent color of law,” the group said in a June statement.

Bad actors have, indeed, masqueraded as ICE agents from coast to coast this year. Various people have reportedly impersonated ICE agents to commit or attempt robbery in Pennsylvania, kidnapping in Florida and South Carolina, scams in California, sexual assault in North Carolina, rape in New York, as well as acts of impersonation, intimidation and other offenses in California, Florida, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

In Congress, Democrats have introduced several bills, including the No Secret Police Act, which would bar federal agents from concealing their faces with “home-made, non-tactical masks” and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting people.

“If you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes — and deviates from the practices of local law enforcement, which contributes to confusion in communities.”

An ICE spokesperson claimed the persons filming the agent in Brewster presented “a safety concern for the officers, the community and even the agitators themselves” and that the “ICE officer contacted the local police.”

The Village of Brewster Police Department, however, told The Intercept that it did not take part in any such interaction. The Putnam County Sheriff’s Office refused to entertain The Intercept’s questions. “We don’t have somebody that would handle even communicating that to the press if it was even for the press’s knowledge,” said a person who replied to a request for her name with “No, thank you,” before hanging up. A message left for the department’s civil affairs division was not returned.

Fonseca Tapia said that personnel from both the Brewster Police Department and the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office were called to the scene and spoke with him.

“This is a call to action for people to understand that this is wrong and this is not normal. Nobody is coming to save us. We are all we got,” Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept. “Now is the time for action. People need to get involved because today it’s immigrants’ rights, but who knows what group it’s going to be tomorrow?”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-agent-disguise-e1754926711311.jpg?fit=1064%2C530&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-12 01:57:03.578276

Cornyn tours ICE facility at Fort Bliss, backs Trump-era immigration policies - El Paso Times",Kristian Jaime,,,,,https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/immigration/2025/08/11/sen-john-cornyn-visits-ice-detention-center-on-fort-bliss/85618284007/,"Ultimately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility.
ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility.
Oversight concerns and ICE facilities Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.
Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated.
For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.","When Texas Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, stopped in El Paso to visit the Camp East Montana migrant detention center on Fort Bliss, it was also to double down on national security rhetoric.

Cornyn's visit on Monday, Aug. 11, was only a ""windshield"" tour according to his office, but it also was an opportunity to echo much of the sentiment from the Trump administration on removing ""criminal aliens"" from the country.

""I call it the 'Lonestar Lockup' and it will hold up to 1,000 criminal aliens pending their repatriation to their countries of origin,"" Cornyn said. ""We're not talking about gardeners or housekeepers or people like that. We're talking about as many as 291,000 individuals that are illegal aliens with criminal charges pending or criminal convictions. They are also ones who have exhausted their legal remedies.""

The Trump administration plans to expand the facility by 250 beds each week until it reaches 1,000. Ultimately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility. That would make it the largest of its kind in the United States.

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility. El Paso's ICE spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa said in a news statement that it will provide detainees with access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation and medical treatment, among other services, which detainees receive in other facilities.

""There's no due process issue involved here since these are people who didn't show up to their immigration hearing,"" Cornyn said. ""The judge issued an order of deportation, so they simply defied that and remained in the United States. Many people want to come to the United States, and there is a legal way to do that, and we honor and respect people who play by the rules.""

Cornyn aimed at the previous Biden administration for what he called ""open border policies"" that he claims did little to no vetting.

The Republican senator praised Trump's efforts to ""bring rule of law back,"" saying the nation needed a new president. He cited the lower number of immigrants crossing in areas like El Paso, which he attributed to the $175 billion allocated to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for building facilities like Camp East Montana.

When will the facility be open?

""The facility is not yet open and will open in about a week with about 1,000 individuals detained there. ICE confirmed they will be given a medical exam and categorized by risk levels based on criminal records. They will be repatriated or sent to other facilities from this location,"" Cornyn said.

Cornyn also noted that it will not house families or children. Citing that it meets federal or state standards, he also said it will have adequate food and cooling from the Texas heat.

He also noted it will be a permanent facility, complete with hard walls ""for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

Oversight concerns and ICE facilities

Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.

""I think congressional oversight is important, but that requires members of Congress not to committ acts of violence or disobediance of the laws themselves,"" Cornyn said. ""We've seen some people try to crash these facilities that are secured. They must do their job and not have members of Congress or anyone else to interfere. Once this location is open, it'll be avaiable at scheduled times for oversight and to the media to show the American people what they actually are.""

Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated. For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.

The Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC company was awarded a $231,878,229 firm-fixed-price contract to establish and operate a detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The contract comes on the heels of Presidential Executive Order 14159, which outlines using ""national security assets for law and order.""

Among the criticisms of the contract by congressional Democrats was that the company had little experience building expansive projects such as Camp East Montana.

""That's the reason there needs to be appropriate congressional oversight and we'll have a chance to monitor the location once it opens,"" Cornyn said.

He concluded there will be other facilities of this type across the country, but not on the scale of one on Fort Bliss.

Sentencing is scheduled for October 16, 2025, before United States District Judge Angela M. Martinez.

In his plea, Espinoza admitted that for a period of time leading up to March 2024, he recruited human smuggling drivers and coordinated the transportation of illegal aliens from areas near the Mexico border to places further in the interior of the United States. Espinoza’s involvement in the conspiracy was for personal financial gain and led to at least 25 illegal aliens receiving transportation.

Espinoza also admitted that on March 6, 2024, he coordinated an event in which a driver and a front seat passenger picked up two illegal aliens near Lukeville, Arizona. At some point while they were being transported, the aliens were told to get out of the vehicle. The two aliens then jumped, fell, or were pushed from the vehicle while it was still moving. As a result, one of the aliens hit his head on the ground, suffered serious injury, and died at the hospital two days later.

A conviction for Conspiracy to Transport Illegal Aliens for Profit carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of $250,000,000.

The investigation of this case is the result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 405 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 350 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets

Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation in this case. The United States Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona, Tucson, is handling the prosecution.

After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.
“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules.
“Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation.
“ The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.","Boston, MA – The Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts and three individuals from Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti filed suit today against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by Democracy Forward and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, challenges the Trump-Vance administration’s sudden and unlawful termination of the plaintiff’s parole status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the United States.

Starting in 2023, non-citizens seeking asylum or other immigration relief in the United States were required to use the CBP One mobile application to schedule appointments at ports of entry. After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.

However, in April 2025, through a mass email that read, “It is time for you to leave the United States,” DHS notified hundreds of thousands of non-citizens that their parole status was terminated, and, as a result, their work authorizations and eligibility for certain benefits were also revoked. The email, sent to non-citizens with the right to remain legally present in the U.S., and in some cases, the U.S. citizens representing them, threatened penalties to encourage self-deportation.

The filing states that this unlawful policy violates federal law, which requires a case-by-case determination that the purpose of parole was served before it can be ended, ignores non-citizens’ legal rights and disrupts their lives, costing them jobs, homes, access to health care, and placing them at risk of deportation.

“As a community-based organization, we have seen firsthand the direct harm this sudden policy inflicts on people who arrived lawfully, complied with every DHS requirement, including the CBP One process, and worked hard to build stable lives for their families. Stripping them of parole and work authorization without any individualized review is not only unlawful, it destabilizes families, weakens our communities, and undermines the trust immigrants place in the legal system. Our commitment is to stand with them and fight to ensure their rights are protected. At VAM, we believe that protecting migrants is protecting the future of our community,” said Carlina Velázquez and Carlos Martín Medina, Board of Directors, Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts.

“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules. Let me be clear: none of this is about immigration, it’s about cruelty and the targeting of people in vulnerable circumstances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “Our clients used the CBP One app because DHS required it. To now strip them of their rights and threaten them with deportation is a gross violation of the law and public trust. We’re honored to represent these individuals and to fight for accountability and justice. We will continue to go to court and use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable.”

“When the government strips away a person’s status and work permit, it pushes entire families into poverty, destabilizes communities, and forces people to choose between basic survival and compliance with an unjust policy,” said Georgia Katsoulomitis, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation. “

The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.

The case is Sileiri Doe et al. v. Department of Homeland Security et al.

The three-day trial kicked off in San Francisco, with attorneys for the state arguing the deployment — which California Gov. Gavin Newsom strenuously objected to — violated a federal law against using military forces for domestic law enforcement.

The protests began June 6 as lawful demonstrations stemming from a series of raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that saw more than 100 illegal immigrants rounded up around the city.

Hundreds took to the streets, chanting in opposition and waving Mexican flags and anti-ICE signs while clashing with cops and federal immigration officers.

But the protests soon escalated into full-blown riots, with cars burned in the streets, public buildings vandalized and local businesses pillaged by looters.

As the violence dragged on, President Trump announced he was deploying some 4,000 Coast Guard members and around 700 active-duty Marines to the City of Angels to put an end to the anarchy.

Newsom condemned the deployments, saying it amounted to using soldiers as “props in the federal government’s propaganda machine.”

The Trump administration fired back, arguing the state’s sanctuary city laws preventing local law enforcement from upholding immigration laws made federal intervention necessary.

Newsom sued the administration, and federal Judge Charles R. Breyer — a former President Clinton appointee who is overseeing the California bench trial — ruled the deployment was illegal.

However, hours later an appeals court rejected Breyer’s ruling which cleared the way for the mobilization to continue.

By July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines called to Los Angeles had been released, with around 300 still in the city.

Those remaining on duty are “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agencies, William Harrington, former deputy chief of staff for the Army task force in charge of the Guard troops said in court Monday, according to the New York Times.

The trial could set a legal precedent for the extent of a commander-in-chief’s authority over the military on US soil.

Newsom’s lawyers are vehement that sending troops to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the president from using armed forces to engage in civil law enforcement.

Attorneys for the state also argue that by deploying troops over the objections of the governor and other California officials, Trump violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which delineates the balance of power between the federal government and US states.

Also being alleged is that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth violated the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing they “lack authority to federalize members of the California National Guard without issuing such orders through Governor Newsom,” the complaint reads.

Trump’s lawyers have staked their counter-argument on a little-known law — Section 12406(3) of the US Code — which permits the president to federalize the National Guard under certain circumstances.

Among them, if the US is in danger of being invaded or currently under invasion, if there is an ongoing rebellion or danger of one occurring, or if the president is unable “with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Newsom and California are seeking a formal declaration from the court that Trump and Hegseth’s orders were illegal, as well as injunctive relief, which would prohibit future deployments of the California National Guard without the governor’s express approval.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/trump-newsom-square-off-federal-109482302.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-11 22:57:32.494354

Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kain (D-Va.) proposed the similar Immigration Enforcement Identification Act.
States including California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have also introduced or plan to propose legislation banning masked agents and requiring clear identification.","Citing ""horrifying"" incidents in which masked men impersonating U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents kidnap and assault women, more than 30 Democratic congresswoman on Monday demanded that ICE officers clearly identify themselves while conducting enforcement activities.

""All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles. We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed,"" 33 members of the Democratic Women's Caucus (DWC) wrote in a letter led by Reps. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas), and Nydia Velásquez (D-N.Y.) to Trump administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and ""border czar"" Tom Homan.

""Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks [and] plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles—tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public,"" the letter continues. ""These tactics invited perpetrators of violence against women to take advantage of the chaos by impersonating masked ICE agents in order to target and sexually assault women.""

Reports of masked men—and in one case, a woman—impersonating federal officers began emerging shortly after President Donald Trump returned to the White House and ordered a mass deportation campaign that senior adviser Stephen Miller said aims to arrest at least 3,000 people per day. Since then, there have been reports of impostors abducting and subsequently sexually assaulting, robbing, or extorting women in states including Maryland, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

""This cannot continue and must be addressed immediately,"" the DWC letter insists. ""The Democratic Women's Caucus is committed to defending the rights of all women and girls to live in safety. We call on the department to recognize this pervasive issue and to take immediate action.""

""We demand that ICE agents visibly and clearly identify themselves when conducting immigration enforcement activities to stop enabling impersonators who leverage women's uncertainty and fear of immigration consequences to rape, harass, and abuse them,"" the congresswoman wrote.

""Your current practices leave women vulnerable to life-altering violence,"" the letter adds. ""It's past time to act. Just like local police officers, ICE agents must be required to wear visible and clear identification to ensure their safety, better protect women, and deter impersonators. Finally, impersonators must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law and this violence must be denounced by this administration.""

In a bid to unmask federal agents, Velázquez in June introduced the No Masks for ICE Act, which would ban agents from wearing facial coverings during enforcement actions and require them to wear clothing displaying their name and agency affiliation.

House lawmakers led by Reps. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) in June also introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement officers to show their faces and clearly display their badges and identification when detaining or arresting people.

Similar legislation—the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025—was introduced last month in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Also in July, upper chamber lawmakers led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kain (D-Va.) proposed the similar Immigration Enforcement Identification Act.

States including California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have also introduced or plan to propose legislation banning masked agents and requiring clear identification.

(AP) — Some law enforcement officers are continuing to charge people under a Florida law that bans people living in the U.S. illegally from entering the state, even though a federal judge has halted enforcement of the law while it’s challenged in court.

As punishment for flouting her order and being found in civil contempt, the judge required Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier to file bimonthly reports about whether any arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions have been made under the law.

In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report.

A spokesperson for Uthmeier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Watch the segment in the player above.

In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law.

“ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

We're not going anywhere.

The Department of Homeland Security has put its Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s recruitment efforts into overdrive. As ICE attempts to boost its numbers to carry out Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency is carrying out an ad blitz. According to 404 Media, DHS is looking to run ads on streaming services like HBO Max and Hulu.

The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.”

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

When it comes to hiring requirements, the immigration agency is lowering the bar. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks.

DHS is not only making it easier to become an ICE agent, but more financially attractive as well. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay.

The recruitment push is working. We know that it has brought in at least one new high-profile agent: 59-year-old actor and vocal Trump supporter Dean Cain, who once played Superman on TV. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.”

Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. You can’t make this stuff up.

Jokes aside, this drive to hire more personnel seems to be ideologically driven. ICE used to require employees to have an undergraduate degree, but not anymore. Apparently, you don’t even need a uniform. So many of the arrests we’re witnessing are being carried out by masked plainclothes officers.

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

It’s almost like the president is building an army of sycophants — and he has the money to do it. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Just to put this into perspective: ICE now receives more funds and resources than most national militaries. It’s rapidly becoming the nation’s largest domestic police force, its size and power doubling that of the FBI.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-ali-velshi-ice-split-vl-1242p-600d2f.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 20:56:54.969049

At least one Republican in the Colorado delegation, Rep. Gabe Evans of the 8th district, has also visited the GEO facility.
“We spoke with a detainee, we visited the pods, we visited the healthcare facility, and it led to many, many more questions,” Crow said.
Pettersen said when she walked through the facility, it felt “like a prison” even though it’s technically a civil detention facility.","The Democratic half of Colorado’s U.S. House delegation visited Colorado’s immigrant detention facility Monday and emerged with more questions than answers.

“After my 10th visit, this has been the most difficult visit in terms of getting information, getting answers out of the facility, out of the employees and being obstructed from conducting full oversight that I’ve had in over six years,” said Rep. Jason Crow, whose Congressional district includes the facility in Aurora. “It’s unacceptable.”

For starters, workers at the facility, managed by the private company GEO, declined to tell the representatives how many detainees were inside.

Crow, along with three of his Democratic colleagues representing the Denver metro area, Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen, okayed the tour of the GEO detention facility ahead of time with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

They were unhappy about that too, saying planned visits aren’t always the most honest.

“I've been in a lot of correctional facilities in my life, and if you have to give seven days notice, they clean up pretty good,” said DeGette, who represents Denver. “And we were told that the people in there were told to clean up and to spiff up and to make things look good. I'd like to see what happens normally in that facility.”

In addition to not being given a population count, the representatives said they also could not learn characteristics of the detainees, including how many had pending or prior criminal charges as opposed to those picked up as collateral detentions. All their questions were referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Crow said he knows the office in Denver has this information, they’re just not giving it up.

“Because during intake, they actually assign people a level … a red, orange, green and blue based on the criminal records, so I know the facility knows who has been picked up because they’ve committed a violent crime versus everyone else,” he said. “My guess is if the last eight months have been any indication, we're not going to be getting a lot of great answers out of Washington either.”

The members also said they weren’t given clear guidance about how consistently detainees were able to access legal advice and whether they were given honest information about how to self-deport.

DeGette noted she did see Jeanette Vizguerra, a high-profile detainee inside the facility and a constituent of hers. Vizguerra has been in Colorado since the 1990s and was an outspoken critic of ICE and the country’s immigration policies. She was arrested in March and is fighting her deportation, but remains in custody.

The planning and authorization required for the visit on Monday directly undermines the Congressional role of oversight of the federal government, the members said.

Both Crow and Neguse, in recent months, have been turned away when they’ve tried unannounced visits, they said. At least one Republican in the Colorado delegation, Rep. Gabe Evans of the 8th district, has also visited the GEO facility. In June he said there were about 1,300 detainees being held there, with 57 percent of them having some kind of criminal history or pending charge.

“It is clear that the administration is violating federal law with respect to its unlawful policies regarding unannounced visits to detention facilities, as well as their policies regarding visits to field offices, which is why we're suing the Trump administration,” Neguse said. “There were difficulties getting information. And there’s certainly a lot that we intend to follow up on in the days and weeks ahead.”

Crow’s office has been routinely visiting the ICE facility since 2019, when there was a Mumps outbreak there. Usually, the congressman sent staffers, and those visits were a blend of announced and unannounced, but Crow’s staff says the GEO facility had always been cooperative, allowing staffers to test food temperatures, talk to detainees, evaluate the health facilities and log how many were detained and how many were released on any given week or month.

Then came 2025 and the second Trump term. They say their visit on Monday left all four of them with more questions.

“We spoke with a detainee, we visited the pods, we visited the healthcare facility, and it led to many, many more questions,” Crow said.

Pettersen said when she walked through the facility, it felt “like a prison” even though it’s technically a civil detention facility.

“We care deeply about making sure that the people who are being held there are treated humanely, that they have access to the healthcare that they need, but also that they're able to reach for assistance outside of this facility,” she said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1600-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:56:34.243388

Generally, USCIS will no longer exempt classes or categories of foreign nationals from potential enforcement except in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. One update describes the circumstances under which USCIS issues Notices to Appear (NTAs). An NTA is a charging document that instructs foreign nationals to appear before an immigration judge and that commences removal (deportation) proceedings and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The update states that USCIS will now also issue NTAs in the following circumstances:

When required by statute or regulation, such as following termination of conditional permanent resident or refugee status.

In cases involving foreign nationals who have been arrested, charged with or convicted of a criminal offense once a benefit request has been denied or withdrawn, so long as they are not subject to mandatory detention.

In cases involving substantiated fraud or material misrepresentation upon adverse action of the benefit request or other unfavorable determination or action.

When a foreign national has no other lawful immigration status or authorization to remain in the United States upon denial or withdrawal of temporary protected status (TPS) after following procedures in the applicable regulations, where required, unless there is sufficient reason to delay issuance of or not issue the NTA.

When a foreign national has no other lawful immigration status or authorization to remain in the United States, upon issuance of an unfavorable decision of a benefit request.

In other special circumstances, such as following expiration or termination of parole if the foreign national is not lawfully present in the United States.

Upon issuance of an unfavorable decision when the beneficiary of an employment-based petition is not lawfully present or is otherwise removable and was the signatory on the I-129 petition.

The updated policy has led to an increased issuance of NTAs, including to H-1B workers within the 60-day grace period following termination of employment, undermining the regulations at 8 CFR 214.1(l)(2).

USCIS also clarified that beneficiaries of family-based petitions may be issued an NTA if they are otherwise removable, since a family-based immigrant petition accords no immigration status or relief from removal, notwithstanding that, in some cases, such beneficiaries may be eligible to adjust status. For example, a foreign national who has filed for adjustment of status (applied for a green card) based on marriage to a U.S. citizen and has overstayed their status or worked without authorization is deportable and inadmissible (not eligible to seek entry or stay in the United States) for such immigration violations. However, such violations are waived when an applicant seeks to adjust status to permanent resident based on the immediate relative relationship (such as marriage to a U.S. citizen). A similar waiver exists for adjustment of status applicants who are beneficiaries of employment-based petitions and have overstayed status, worked without authorization, or violated the terms and conditions of admission, so long as the aggregate period of violations is 180 days or fewer, among other requirements. As such, the updated USCIS policy undermines such waivers of inadmissibility.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/USCIS%20immigration%20websites%20bigstock%20245490841.jpg.webp?itok=E0LB1KV9,N,,2025-08-11 17:57:18.384863

Access to work permits for DACA recipients would be allowed nationwide for current and (new) initial DACA recipients, with the possible exception of Texas.
DACA recipients in Texas (current and new) could access the program’s protection from deportation, but potentially not work permits.
Congress must pass a bipartisan, legislative solution to protect Dreamers, including DACA recipients, and provide them with permanent legal status.","Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a deferred action policy created on June 15, 2012 that is aimed at protecting Dreamers. DACA does not provide permanent legal status – it is a lawful presence status that temporarily shields certain Dreamers from deportation and provides them work authorization with possible renewal every two years.

Current Status of DACA

Current DACA recipients nationwide can continue to renew their lawful presence status – including their protection from deportation and work permit – every two years. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is currently not processing new, initial DACA applications. There are 525,210 active DACA recipients in the U.S. as of March 31, 2025.

.

Processing Delays

The number of DACA recipients decreased by an estimated 8,000 individuals between December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025. The reason for the decrease is unclear. While the number of active DACA recipients fluctuates each reporting period, as delayed applications are eventually processed and approved, the most recent drop was steeper than in previous quarters. The decline is potentially tied to processing delays at USCIS. The agency completed 2.7 million cases in the second quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025 – an 18 percent drop compared to the same period last year. Processing delays risk pushing DACA recipients to fall out of status.

Legal Status of DACA

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mixed decision on January 17, 2025 regarding the legality of DACA in Texas v. United States. The Fifth Circuit found that DACA’s protection from deportation is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion and may be granted nationwide. The Fifth Circuit also determined that the work permit component of DACA is potentially unlawful but narrowed the injunction to apply only to the state of Texas. The narrow injunction came about because just one state – Texas – proved “an actual injury caused by the Final Rule” on DACA. The decision was stayed (paused) for multiple months to provide the parties in the case time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Fifth Circuit’s decision moved toward implementation after none of the parties in the case sought an appeal to the Supreme Court by the May 20, 2025 extended deadline. The Fifth Circuit’s decision, if fully implemented, would likely establish the following system:

Fifth Circuit’s Decision

Deferred Action. DACA’s protection from deportation would be allowed nationwide for current and (new) initial DACA recipients.

Employment Authorization Documents (EADs). Access to work permits for DACA recipients would be allowed nationwide for current and (new) initial DACA recipients, with the possible exception of Texas.

Initial DACA Applications. Dreamers who are eligible for DACA but do not currently have DACA could apply and be approved for the program. USCIS has not processed (new) initial DACA applications since October 2017 when litigation blocked new people from entering the program, permitting only renewals.

DACA in Texas. DACA recipients in Texas (current and new) could access the program’s protection from deportation, but potentially not work permits.

The case is now back before U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen of the Southern District of Texas, who must modify his original order to comply with the Fifth Circuit’s decision. Judge Hanen will determine how to implement the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Texas, in particular as it relates to work permits. DACA recipients in Texas could see a winding down of work authorization in the state.

Takeaway

The Fifth Circuit’s decision is in the process of going into effect. USCIS continues to accept, but is not processing, (new) initial DACA applications. Meanwhile, DACA recipients in Texas can continue to renew their status, including work permits, every two years. The next step is for Judge Hanen to issue a decision modifying his original order to comply with the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

Will USCIS process new DACA applications? What are the requirements?

Possibly. The Fifth Circuit decision allows USCIS to process new, initial DACA applications, but the agency may argue it is not required to process those new applications. The decision itself does not include explicit language requiring such an action.

To be eligible for DACA, young undocumented individuals would need to meet the program’s original requirements, which were first established in 2012 and are quite stringent:

Came to the U.S. before age 16;

Have resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007;

Were present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012;

Were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012;

Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a GED certificate, or that they have been honorably discharged from the military; and,

Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.

When USCIS was accepting new applicants for DACA, applicants were required to be at least 15 years of age. New applicants have been largely unable to obtain DACA since 2017, when the first Trump administration and subsequent litigation blocked the processing of new applications. Many Dreamers were too young to apply for DACA (due to the requirement to be at least 15 years of age) before USCIS stopped processing new DACA applications in 2017.

What will happen to DACA in Texas?

One possible scenario is that DACA recipients in Texas will be able to apply for protection from deportation, but potentially not work permits. Current DACA recipients in Texas who have work authorization will likely continue to maintain that authorization until it expires, but not be able to renew it.

Presumably, DACA recipients in Texas could renew their work permits if they move out of Texas to another state. There are 87,890 DACA recipients in Texas – the second highest number in the country. Texas could see a mass exodus of DACA recipients from the state.

Judge Hanen has so far not taken any steps to wind down DACA in Texas. MALDEF, an intervenor in the case on behalf of 22 DACA recipients, stated that with respect to employment authorization in Texas they will be, “advocating for an extended period of implementation that is respectful, to the maximum extent possible, of the important reliance interests identified by the Supreme Court in its 2020 decision rejecting the first Trump administration’s rescission of DACA.”

Where do DACA recipients live?

As of March 31, 2025, there are DACA recipients in every U.S. state, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

Most DACA recipients are female (54 percent) and both the average and median age of a DACA recipient is 31, though most (37 percent) are between ages 26 to 30. Most are single (66 percent), but 31 percent are married. A smaller percentage is divorced (3 percent), and 690 DACA recipients are widowed. They have all lived in the U.S. since at least June 15, 2007, more than 18 years ago.

What is the solution?

Congress must pass a bipartisan, legislative solution to protect Dreamers, including DACA recipients, and provide them with permanent legal status.

DACA lacks long-term permanence. DACA recipients in Texas, and perhaps in the future in other states, run the risk of no longer being able to access work permits. This loss would have a deep, significant impact on the personal and economic well-being of DACA recipients, as well as their families, communities, and employers. Without access to work permits, DACA recipients will not be able to work legally in the U.S. and the country will not benefit from their skills and contributions.

The Trump administration may also decide to make another attempt to end DACA. The Trump administration attempted to end DACA in 2017. At the time, the administration did not use proper procedures or provide a well-reasoned explanation for its actions, which led to litigation that ultimately blocked the attempted end of DACA on procedural grounds. The administration may once again try to end DACA, this time through a more proper process.

Congress is the only body that can provide DACA recipients and other Dreamers, including DACA-eligible individuals, with an opportunity to stay in the U.S. Such legislation would cement the contributions of Dreamers in America.

I’ve gone through public schools my entire life.
Fortune: I am in favor of really making sure all of our public schools are quality.
Public Schools first.
All of our public schools should be fully funded so that every child in public school gets a great education.","HARTFORD – Ruth Fortune told CT Examiner Monday that she’s challenging Rep. John Larson for his seat in Congress in an effort to make public her story as an undocumented immigrant for 17 years, saying it’s critical for Democrats to push back against the administration of President Donald Trump on almost every important issue.

“I think there is a real hunger right now and a craving among people to see their elected officials really fight for them and fight for ways to make their lives better and for our democracy and our civil liberties that are under attack,” said Fortune, a 37-year-old member of the Hartford Board of Education and an associate at the Connecticut law firm Wiggin & Dana, where she specializes in trusts and estates.

“I’m not seeing, particularly on our Democratic side, the fight as aggressively as it should be happening. So much is at stake right now that we just have to be more bold. We have to be more audacious with how we not only push back against the Trump administration and fascism, but also advocate for the values we hold dear.”

Fortune is one of three people to announce their intention to primary Larson, a 14-term incumbent Democrat. But she declined to criticize him directly.

Fortune said that – if elected — she’d fight for making “life more affordable for people, assisting families as they support each other, and making our communities safer instead of having masked ICE agents taking people off the streets.”

Fortune moved to the United States when she was 12 years old and spent her high school years in Long Island, New York. Fortune did not become a U.S. citizen until February 2017, 17 years after entering the country with her family from Haiti.

Fortune told CT Examiner that she’d been thinking of running the “past seven or nine months, give or take. I’ve wanted to be in public service through elected office for a really long time because of my [personal] background.”

In addition to Fortune, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Southington Councilman Jack Perry have filed papers to challenge Larson in a primary.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity

CTEx: Your family left Haiti when you were 12 years old and you and your family came to this country as undocumented immigrants. Please tell us how the Trump administration’s plans and policies to crack down on undocumented immigrants affected you personally and what would and could you do – if elected to the U.S. Congress – regarding ICEs efforts throughout the country and in this state related to detaining undocumented immigrants?

Ruth Fortune: The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration is not only morally wrong, it’s really bad as well for our economy, bad for our country. When I was undocumented with no path to legalization, it wasn’t until a really awful earthquake in Haiti in 2010 that the Obama administration’s response to it was a humanitarian one, a compassionate one. They chose to give Haitians who were living here without documentation, TPS, temporary protected status, that allowed us to work here lawfully and not have to fear deportation. This is the same status that I would have [today]. I would still have TPS. There would have been no path for me to citizenship, but for having fallen in love with a U.S. citizen [husband, former Wall Street Journal reporter David Reynolds] and gotten a Green Card through him and ultimately my citizenship. There are so many immigrants who are here who have some type of temporary status, whether it’s TPS, whether it’s DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals], or a number of other types of temporary status. The Trump administration is cutting those programs, essentially converting these lawful immigrants into undocumented people so that they could meet their quotas of deporting people and getting to name call people illegal aliens.

The way they are approaching immigration enforcement is destabilizing, and it puts all of our constitutional rights at risk. We have to push for a path to citizenship for the hard working immigrants who have been here, who have contributed to our economy, who’ve raised their families here, who’ve made this place their home, who love this country. I could have been one of these people now who would be detained, but for having married a U.S. citizen. There are people who’ve been here for decades, many years, who are such a key part of our fabric. Yes, the only way to protect these people and to not make them vulnerable and expose them to whoever happens to be at the White House is to fight for a path to citizenship

CTEx: What is your biggest qualm and or disagreement with Rep. John Larson –- and please be specific –- and what will you do differently on those policy disagreements?

Fortune: I’m running not because of who represents me in Congress right now, but because of what I know I can do for our district as a mother of young children, a formerly undocumented person who came to this country seeking economic opportunity, seeking the safety of our democracy and the safety that our institutions offer. I’ve had to play offense and defense my whole life, and I want to do that for my country now. I’ve been here [United States] since I was 12. This is the country that I call home. This is where I’m raising my family. I want to give back to this country that has afforded me so many opportunities that I really could not have fathomed back in Haiti. I want to use everything that I have, all that this country has offered me, to fight back, not just to protect our democracy and to protect our civil liberties and expand our constitutional rights, but also to fight to repair the broken systems that have held me down and I’ve that had to overcome because it’s holding other people down in many different ways. Whether it’s not having a living wage; families are struggling more to make ends meet. Housing is becoming less affordable. Health care is more of a privilege. There’s so much that we can do. We need to play defense and play offense to make lives better for so many Americans.

CTEx: By all accounts, your decision to challenge and then defeat a long-time incumbent congressman in a primary is a longshot. Why should people take your candidacy seriously and what is the number one reason the people of the First District should vote for Ruth Fortune over John Larson?

Fortune: I like to say that we don’t only need a new generation of leaders, but we need a new breed of leaders. We need leaders who understand how deeply broken our systems are, and someone like me, who’s been held down by the system and who’ve had to overcome and work my way through the system. I have a deep understanding of how deeply rooted that brokenness is, and what it takes to repair these systems – to allow hard working people to achieve their goals, versus just struggling to get by. And that’s what we need more of in [Washington] D.C. We have so many career politicians with years of experience [and the] same issues that have plagued us for generations – many of them have worsened. And in so, in allowing that to happen, we have someone like Trump who’s exploited these issues and is actually not improving life for anyone. He’s making life harder. He’s terrorizing people in our streets, people are disappearing [because of ICE]. He’s arming ICE as his domestic military force. He’s turning the government against the American people, and we should all be taking that very seriously.

CTEx: As a current Hartford Board of Education member and as someone who was only able to attend the $4,000 annual in-state tuition to Baruch College in New York by waitressing, what – specific – education policies would you like to see implemented in the U.S. Congress that would have a positive impact on children in the state. And, do you support charter schools – seen by some Connecticut Democrats and union leaders as taking away resources from a public school education?

Fortune: We have to start fully funding our public schools. Whether or not you have a quality public education should not be affected by what zip code a child has, whether you live in an urban area, a rural or suburban area. All of our schools are the path right to equalizing our society, to giving every child a fair chance. And the reality is, the children who have the least opportunity are the ones who really, really need this equal opportunity the most in our schools. I probably would not be here, but for having had a really great public education, from middle school through college through law school. I’ve gone through public schools my entire life. My children now are at Hartford Public Schools, and what I see on the [school] board is that because of the lack of funding, we’re faced with very difficult decisions.

CTEx: Do you support charter schools?

Fortune: I am in favor of really making sure all of our public schools are quality. Public Schools first. It should not be that some schools are great, some schools are not so great, and other schools are failing out. All of our public schools should be fully funded so that every child in public school gets a great education. And if other parents choose to do something else for their children, that is absolutely their decision. It is up to those parents, but when it comes to our public dollars, we’re paying federal taxes, paying state taxes, those funds should really be making sure that our public schools are well funded.

CTEx: What political leader – from statewide or national politics and alive or deceased – do you most admire and would like to emulate and please be specific

Fortune: The first person who came to mind is Shirley Chisholm. She was the first woman of color to run for Congress, just such a bold leader, but also someone who had such a strong moral compass. I sometimes would imagine what she would say right now, and how fearless she would be, how strong she has been to advocate for people who have struggled. She just embodies the American spirit. I absolutely admire Shirley Chisholm.

CTEx: President Trump and Russian President Putin are scheduled to meet Friday in Alaska in an effort to come up with a plan to resolve the conflict in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Do you think Ukraine needs to be a part of that conversation and what – specifically – would you want to see in the region that would accelerate peace for both sides?

Fortune: I absolutely think President [Volodymyr] Zelensky should be part of any conversation that includes Ukraine. He’s the leader of that country, and also because of President Putin’s misleading approaches, it’s detrimental to Ukraine to not have their own representative there. To really talk about a country, their leaders should be present. Absolutely.

CTEx: In the last seven months, has there been anything that the Trump administration has gotten right? And, what’s your single biggest concern about what they’ve gotten wrong?

Fortune: It is hard to think of what the Trump administration has gotten right in the last seven months, because what they’ve done is terrorize people on our streets. People are disappearing off of our streets. They have economic policies that are, it’s hard to even really call them policy, they’re just such discombobulated ideas. Tariffs that seem to be driven more by how he feels and who he happens to like at any given moment. It’s just the lack of long-term planning and a strategic approach to all of these policies that are really affecting Americans, affecting our economy and affecting where we stand in the world. We’re alienating our allies. We’re imposing tariffs arbitrarily, it seems, on our partners and it’s detrimental to our long term health as a country.

CTEx: Gov. Ned Lamont declared an emergency to fill a possible $284 million Medicaid shortfall in May. How would you tackle this issue if elected to Congress?

Fortune: We need to have health care as a right in this country, not as a privilege. We should have – instead of quotas that this administration has for how many deportations should happen every day or quotas on how many people need to be arrested and detained today – goals for how many Americans who are uninsured or underinsured will get access to health insurance in this country. Why don’t we have new goals about how many of our public schools that are struggling, because of lack of funding, we will fully fund so that we can educate our children. And Medicaid is a great program. We need to expand Medicaid, but we need federal dollars to do that. The state doesn’t have unlimited funds. It’s great what we’re doing in Connecticut that we have the ability to do that [fill Medicaid shortfall] and within Medicaid as well, we need to be supporting our older Americans who need long term care right now.

How the National Guard deployment in DC will work According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority.
That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation’s capital — though, at the moment, that doesn’t appear to be the plan.
“Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.
“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.","President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city’s streets at any given time, the Army said.

Trump’s directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.

How the National Guard deployment in DC will work

According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation’s capital — though, at the moment, that doesn’t appear to be the plan.

“Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.

Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.” He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units — other specialized units,” though he didn’t offer any further details.

The timeline for the troop deployment also is vaguely defined. According to Trump’s directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines “that conditions of law and order have been restored.”

Besides the 800 Guard members, Trump said “we will bring in the military if it’s needed” — seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard — but added that “I don’t think we’ll need it.”

Trump recently sent Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles

The deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June.

Trump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration’s immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.

Hegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation’s capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

However, California’s governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard’s primary mission had been to guard two buildings that “frankly didn’t need to be guarded.”

In addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.

“I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.”

Trump deployed the Guard to Washington in his first term

This is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.

In 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.

It became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley’s presence as the military’s endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/news/npr-stories/nx-s1-5495338/ap25021067739810-scaled-e1754672821815-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 20:56:50.438084

In March, Orrick blocked the administration from stripping those cities of any funding, blocking the enforcement of an executive order designed to punish self-proclaimed sanctuary cities.
“The cities and counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Orrick wrote.
Forcing Chicago and Illinois law enforcement officials to help federal agents conduct deportation operations is unconstitutional, Jenkins ruled.
Chicago expects to receive approximately $3.5 billion in new and existing federal grant dollars in 2025, officials said.","A federal judge allowed Chicago to join a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from yanking funding from cities and counties across the country because they have laws designed to protect undocumented immigrants by prohibiting state local law enforcement officials from helping federal agents.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick agreed Aug. 5 to allow Chicago and 33 other cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Denver, Boston and Baltimore, to join the lawsuit that claimed the Trump administration was unlawfully trying to force local officials to help federal immigration agents conduct deportation efforts.

Read Orrick’s full order.

“The city is pleased that the court has allowed Chicago and 33 other jurisdictions to join the lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration’s efforts to punish local governments that decline to enforce the administration’s civil immigration policy priorities,” according to a statement from a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law.

San Francisco officials filed the original lawsuit on behalf of nine California cities and counties, including Oakland and San Diego, as well as Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Santa Fe.

In March, Orrick blocked the administration from stripping those cities of any funding, blocking the enforcement of an executive order designed to punish self-proclaimed sanctuary cities.

“The cities and counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Orrick wrote. “The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the cities and counties and the communities they serve.”

That order does not apply to Chicago but is likely to bolster efforts by city officials to prevent President Donald Trump from blowing a $3 billion hole in Chicago’s budget.

Lawyers representing Chicago will ask Orrick to expand his preliminary injunction to include the 34 new plaintiffs at a hearing set for Wednesday, records show.

A federal judge tossed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that sought to invalidate Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance and the Illinois Trust Act because they are “an intentional effort to obstruct the federal government’s enforcement of federal immigration law and to impede consultation and communication between federal, state, and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for federal officials to carry out federal immigration law and keep Americans safe,” according to the lawsuit.

U.S. District Court Judge Lindsay Jenkins’ decision to grant Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s request to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice without holding a full trial is a major win for officials seeking to prevent federal officials from slashing billions of dollars in federal aid to Chicago and Illinois.

Forcing Chicago and Illinois law enforcement officials to help federal agents conduct deportation operations is unconstitutional, Jenkins ruled.

Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly said Chicago and Illinois will continue to prohibit local and state law enforcement agents from helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deport undocumented residents unless they have been convicted of a crime.

Chicago expects to receive approximately $3.5 billion in new and existing federal grant dollars in 2025, officials said. The city’s 2025 budget is $17.1 billion.

In addition, the CTA expects to receive $1.9 billion from the federal government to extend the Red Line south to 130th Street and CPS received $1.3 billion from the federal government during the 2024-25 fiscal year.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-11 17:57:22.586079

The order to restore the database takes effect Friday, though the administration could still attempt to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.
The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was unanimous in its ruling.
Trump has faced bipartisan pressure to restore the tracker, but the administration contends it contains sensitive information that could pose a national security threat.
Circuit came after U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled last month that the administration must restore the database.","A federal appeals court on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to restore a public database showing how federal funding is apportioned.

The administration disabled the database in March as it stared down several lawsuits challenging funding freezes, claiming Congress’s mandate to make the data public infringed on President Trump’s core executive authority.

“To hear the Government tell it, the separation of powers hangs in the balance and only this Court can set things right. But when it comes to appropriations, our Constitution has made plain that congressional power is at its zenith,” U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote.

The order to restore the database takes effect Friday, though the administration could still attempt to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was unanimous in its ruling.

An appointee of former President George H. W. Bush, Henderson was the panel’s sole judge appointed by a Republican president. She was joined by Robert Wilkins, an appointee of former President Obama, and Brad Garcia, an appointee of former President Biden.

Henderson decried the administration in her 25-page statement, which Wilkins joined. It began with a reference to the 17th-century English Civil War between the Stuart monarchs and Parliament.

“By the end of the upheaval, Parliament emerged supreme in matters of taxation and spending. Our Constitution followed suit, granting the Congress plenary control over the public fisc,” Henderson wrote.

“Recently, the Executive has once again locked horns in a struggle for control over the purse strings.”

Two private groups that regularly sue the Trump administration, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Protect Democracy, challenged the takedown in April. They cited two recent congressional spending deals that require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to make apportionment decisions publicly available within two business days.

“They will be deprived of information that the Founding generation—from Franklin to Jefferson to Madison to Mason—all thought vital to our Republic,” Henderson wrote in her ruling.

Trump has faced bipartisan pressure to restore the tracker, but the administration contends it contains sensitive information that could pose a national security threat. The Justice Department also argued the two groups have no right to sue, and the requirement to post the data is unconstitutional.

The administration’s appeal to the D.C. Circuit came after U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled last month that the administration must restore the database.

The D.C. Circuit halted the ruling as it considered the administration’s request for a longer pause. Saturday’s ruling lasts until the court resolves the appeal, which will now proceed in normal course.

More than 835,000 people have been approved as DACA recipients, also known as ""Dreamers,"" in the time the program has existed. The number of active recipients was as high as 702,000 in 2018, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Now it's about 525,210.

DACA was started by the Obama administration in 2012 to protect young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The protections prevent them from being deported and also provide eligibility for work authorization.

""But for the people who have been on DACA for years and are renewing their status, you know, I think the program has felt a little bit like it's on life support for a while,"" said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute, explaining that this is because of the ongoing litigation and court rulings.

Litigation about the legality of DACA has been ongoing since 2017, when the first Trump administration rescinded the program.

The Supreme Court upheld the DACA program in 2020, but under active litigation, the program is only processing renewals and not approving any new applicants. The most USCIS recent report from March shows no new applicants were approved in fiscal years 2025 or 2024, and just two applicants were approved in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

Eligibility for DACA includes arrival to the United States before turning 16 and before June 15, 2007. It also requires recipients to be under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012.

Because of the pause on new applicants and the requirement that applicants be 15 years old to apply, it has left many eligible candidates without options.

""So there are tens of thousands – at least – of young people who aged into DACA eligibility since 2017 and haven't had the opportunity to apply for DACA,"" Gelatt said.

As of March 31, 2025, the number of pending applications had grown to more than 101,000, according to USCIS.

The trend also comes as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services removed DACA recipients from being eligible for federal health care options under the Affordable Care Act.

Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has recently said DACA recipients are not protected from deportation and is promoting self-deportation through the CBP Home App.

The Hearst Television Data Team analyzed data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to see where the half a million active DACA recipients remaining live. Out of 525,210 active DACA recipients as of March 31, more than 28% resided in California.

California also had the highest number of recipients per 100,000 residents at about 374. Behind it were Nevada and Texas.

A 2024 survey conducted by the Center for American Progress on DACA recipients showed that out of those who responded, more than 92% currently had jobs. The majority of respondents also indicated they were able to get a job with higher pay, with 60% saying they could then pay for childcare and 85% saying they could pay for tuition.

Most active DACA recipients — 81% — were born in Mexico, but the remaining people were born across nearly 200 countries.

Data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is self-reported and is rounded. Because of this, there are around 70 people who listed the United States as their country of birth. Additionally, about 10 people listed the State of Palestine as their country of birth, and it is presented that way in the data. The United States government does not recognize Palestine as a state.

""DACA allowed a large cohort of young people to capitalize on their U.S.-based education and skills to get college degrees at higher rates, to find professional careers, to contribute to their fullest capacity to the country.""

About three-quarters of adults say they are in favor of granting permanent legal status to children who were brought to the U.S. illegally, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2020.

But even so, the uncertain fate of the program as it goes through courts and the government sends new messaging by encouraging self-deportation.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large?
In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection.
But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.
Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group.","In a recent decision denying asylum to a Salvadoran woman being stalked by gang members, the Board of Immigration Appeals — the highest administrative body for interpreting US immigration law — found that under US law, her claim that Salvadoran women constitute a group of people at risk of persecution was “overbroad and insufficiently particular to be cognizable.”

The foundation of refugee law — both internationally and in the US — is that asylum should be provided to a person with a well-founded fear of being persecuted on any of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or “membership in a particular social group.” This last category is intended to protect people similarly exposed to persecution as the other four groups because of immutable characteristics that cannot be changed or beliefs so fundamental they should not be required to change them.

There are precedents in both US and international law for treating women as a “particular social group.” In Perdomo v. Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.

But in denying this woman’s claim, the Board said, “If we held that groups defined solely by sex were cognizable, we would essentially create another protected ground under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] — that of sex — to add to the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” That, it said, would be a job for Congress.

Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large? In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection. All that should matter is the likelihood of the risk that person faces and the severity of the threat to them or of the abuse they have experienced.

Of course, being a woman per se is not grounds for asylum, any more than being a member of any race, nationality or religion. But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.

Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group. In the landmark Fauzia Kasinga case, a woman fleeing genital mutilation was granted asylum not based on her right not to be persecuted on the basis of her gender, but rather as a member of a particular social group, defined as “young women who are members of the Tchamba-Kasungu Tribe of northern Togo who have not been subjected to female genital mutilation, as practiced by that tribe, and who oppose the practice.” A more narrowly defined group is hardly conceivable.

Often, though, the compulsion to particularize can distort the reality of persecution. Consider women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. All Afghan girls are barred from education beyond the sixth grade. No woman is allowed to attend university and all face severe restrictions on employment. A woman is not allowed to walk outside her home unless accompanied by a male relative, limiting access to public spaces and services, including access to health care. Violations of the hijab dress code and other draconian rules are met with severe punishment.

In September 2024, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan said the “Taliban’s institutionalized system of…gender persecution…impacts almost the entire population.”

When Congress next looks at US immigration law, it should question why women should have to shoehorn their claims into a narrow understanding of membership of a particular social group and thereby have less consistent or predictable protection than racial, religious, nationality and political groups. In light of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ narrow reading of existing law, Congress should amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to add gender as an unequivocally protected ground of the refugee definition standing alongside race, religion, nationality and political opinion.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:09.448203

Since July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines.
It belongs to the people who live here, and Trump can’t have it.” Mr. Trump has frequently railed against crime in Washington.
That means that what Mr. Trump announced on Monday was essentially a show of force that will expire on Sept. 10.
She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard.","Mr. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days.

Mayor Muriel Bowser struck a diplomatic tone, acknowledging the president’s authority to temporarily take over the city police even as she disputed his rationale and his depictions of life in the city. Although his actions were “unsettling and unprecedented,” Ms. Bowser said Mr. Trump’s announcement did not come as much of a surprise, given his previous rhetoric.

Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, earlier offered a more forceful response, calling the federal takeover “unlawful” and saying he “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.”

Mr. Trump also threatened to expand his efforts to other cities, including Chicago, if they did not deal with crime rates he claimed were “out of control.” But Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department.

Here’s what else to know:

D.C. deployment: The Trump administration also plans to temporarily reassign 120 F.B.I. agents in Washington to nighttime patrol duties as part of the crackdown, according to people familiar with the matter. Residents expressed skepticism of the president’s actions, which also prompted protests.

Dystopian claims: Mr. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize.

Familiar targets: In portraying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Louis or New Orleans. He also ignored the most violent episode in Washington’s recent history: the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, where his supporters sought to stop the certification of the 2020 election he lost. Mr. Trump pardoned hundreds of rioters, many of whom had already been convicted of crimes and were serving sentences before being immediately released in January.

Earlier deployments: This summer, Mr. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. A suit brought by California officials challenging the deployment’s legality went to trial on Monday, although most of the troops have since been withdrawn. And in his first term, Mr. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Since July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines. A sprawling tent city that was erected in June to house thousands of soldiers at a military base south of Los Angeles in Los Alamitos is being dismantled. Only about 300 troops remain.

Testifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agents.

But officials at the California National Guard and the military’s Northern Command, which is overseeing the force, said earlier Monday that the remaining troops were mostly on standby or guarding federal buildings and not being used for immigration enforcement.

The Los Angeles protests lasted several days in early June and were largely confined to a section of downtown. Democratic leaders in the state said the administration had provoked them by sending masked and armed federal agents into workplaces to detain immigrants who otherwise had no criminal records, then used the subsequent public outrage as a pretext to intervene militarily.

Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles compared the mobilization to an “armed occupation.” Mr. Newsom called it political theater, and said the president was using service members as “props in the federal government’s propaganda machine.”

Trump administration officials said the troops were necessary to protect federal agents in a jurisdiction where state sanctuary laws prohibited local authorities from conducting immigration enforcement. They said the protests had overwhelmed local law enforcement agencies.

The state swiftly sued to end the mobilization, which a federal judge ruled to be illegal. But an appeals court blocked that ruling, allowing the deployment to continue. By mid-June, the protests had died down but the troops were accompanying federal agents conducting immigration enforcement.

California officials say those assignments amount to an illegal use of federal troops to conduct domestic law enforcement. The Trump administration has contended the troops were merely escorting federal agents.

In the interim, complaints have mounted from those who have been deployed.

On the base near Los Angeles where the troops have been stationed, soldiers have complained that only a small fraction of them were even given assignments beyond the base. Those who were sent out typically were ordered to guard federal facilities or provide backup to immigration agents delivering warrants or conducting arrests.

In July, for example, one National Guard contingent sat in trucks while immigration agents conducted a show of force in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Another contingent faced protesters in a field outside a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County.

State authorities have complained that the activation has damaged the California National Guard’s ability to handle other critical duties, including drug interdiction and wildfire management. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the California National Guard said the deployment had threatened retention and severely eroded the morale of the force.

The mission, which federal authorities had initially indicated would end on Aug. 6, has been extended for at least another 90 days. And last week, Mr. Trump said he would chair a task force designed to increase the federal government’s role in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that he would use the National Guard there again, if necessary, “to keep the Olympics safe.”

“They’re usurping the concept of home rule,” said Ken Greene, a longtime Washington resident, referring to the 1973 law that allowed the federal district to elect its own local government, though Congress maintained final say over its laws and budget. Mr. Trump cited a portion of that law on Monday that allows the federal government to temporarily take control of the city’s police department.

As the protesters rallied, Mr. Trump was framing his plans to beef up and militarize the district’s police force as a test for his vision for getting tough on crime, musing that if it worked in the nation’s capital, he could roll out similar efforts in other cities.

But to the protesters, Mr. Trump’s plans were just the latest blow to a city that has been among the hardest hit by his executive orders and policies.

Mr. Trump’s efforts to downsize the federal government, step up immigration raids in urban areas, and reduce funding for food stamps have had a negative effect on city residents, organizers of the protest argued.

“It’s all connected,” said Samuel Epps, the president of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, whose office the protesters gathered outside. “This is just another way to create that chaos in our communities.”

Alex Dodds, one of the co-founders of Free D.C., an advocacy group formed just after the start of Mr. Trump’s second term, said Mr. Trump was following an authoritarian playbook by trying to assert control over the capital city.

“It’s an easy way for them to silence dissent and accelerate their agenda, if they physically control the capital,” said Ms. Dodds, whose group organized the protests. She added: “D.C. is our home. It belongs to the people who live here, and Trump can’t have it.”

Mr. Trump has frequently railed against crime in Washington. He became fixated on the idea of a federal takeover of local law enforcement after Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old software engineer and a prominent early member of the Department of Government Efficiency, was the victim of an attempted carjacking earlier this month.

Though the protest was relatively small, criticism of Mr. Trump in Washington is not rare. The city is staunchly Democratic, and its residents have frequently rallied against the president’s actions. Monday’s protest took place on the same stretch of street that in 2020 became the centerpiece of Black Lives Matter protests — and had those words painted into the pavement until a couple of months ago.

Tierney L. Cross and Shawn McCreesh contributed reporting.

Mr. Jain said the vacancy crisis in the U.S. attorney’s office, which prosecutes all adult crimes, also posed a problem for the city. Mr. Trump recently installed an ally, the former Fox News host Jeannine Pirro, as the U.S. attorney for Washington after he was forced his pull his first choice for the job.

“Pirro’s predecessor fired attorneys who prosecuted violent insurrectionists from Jan. 6,” Mr. Jain said, referring to another Trump appointee, Ed Martin. “Now we’re facing a vacancy crisis in her office, too.”

Mr. Jain said Mr. Trump’s his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital did not appear to offer any long term solutions to crime. “And I’m incredibly concerned about what he is going to use the police force to do to the people of D.C.,” he added.

The takeover of the city police department was expected to last 30 days. That means that what Mr. Trump announced on Monday was essentially a show of force that will expire on Sept. 10.

Mr. Jain is one of two shadow senators from the District of Columbia who serve as its elected advocates before the body. They hold no voting power but lobby the Senate in favor of D.C. statehood, to prevent congressional interference in its affairs, and pass laws that protect D.C.’s interests.

Mr. Jain said there was only one real way for Washington to protect itself.

“We need D.C. statehood to stop this problem,” he said.

She said she liked that law enforcement officers don’t walk streets with military-style firearms as they do in some countries, and she said she did not support the president’s moves to take over Washington’s police and deploy the National Guard.

“I’m not a particularly pro-police, pro-law enforcement kind of person,” she said. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.”

Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic. She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard.

“It’s unfortunate that the new administration has to take this reactionary approach,” said Ms. Rigsby, “instead of local government really focusing on bringing down crime and making residents feel safe.”

Jerry Stenquist, 42, a federal employee who works in Navy Yard, said that some crime is inevitable with big events like baseball games for the Washington Nationals at the stadium in the neighborhood.

“It’s a nice area,” Mr. Stenquist said of the Navy Yard, “but I think anytime you have a broad range of the public that’s going to show up at the stadium, you’re going to have some crime.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/11/multimedia/11trump-400-qwlb/11trump-400-qwlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 15:56:50.247555

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn.) told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss” in Texas.

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often-masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan., and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed.

His husband pulled over by their home, and Hicks watched on FaceTime as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent smashed his husband’s window.

He rushed to his Meridian apartment, but by then his husband was gone. Hicks, a U.S. citizen, already had started the process to get his husband legal status, he said. He and his husband had talked about the possibility of immigration enforcement, but Hicks said it still didn’t make him ready.

The Statesman is not naming the husband because Hicks said his husband fears repercussions for his case.

“I was not really prepared to watch that or to hear that,” Hicks said by phone. ICE agents screamed and yelled at his husband in the car, he said. “The No. 1 feeling that I had was just a pit in my stomach.”

Being in the United States without authorization is enough grounds to start the deportation process, and some immigrants who are here legally can also be removed. But under President Donald Trump, ICE agents in Idaho have been changing their tactics and using some strategies more often, according to local immigration lawyers. That includes smashing car windows, like with Hicks’ husband.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment sent via its official media email.

ICE agents also have conducted more arrests at ICE check-ins, which are routine meetings for agents to keep tabs on people going through the immigration process. Agents have also focused more on workplace enforcement, lawyers said. ICE isn’t necessarily going out to farms, but agents have been going to businesses to look for people employing undocumented immigrants, according to Neal Dougherty, a Nampa lawyer and partner at Ramirez-Smith Law.

The Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office and the Idaho State Police also have signed cooperation agreements with ICE, known as 287(g) agreements.

Overall, immigration arrests have increased over 900% in Idaho since Trump took office, according to The New York Times.

There aren’t increases in ICE’s resources or agents, said J.J. Despain, managing attorney for Wilner & O’Reilly’s Boise office, but ICE has lowered the bar on who it wants to deport and changed their strategies.

“Some of those are happening by surprise,” Despain told the Statesman.

The criminal justice system

In early April, a man failed to show up for his pretrial conference in Canyon County, perplexing his lawyer.

The lawyer, with the Idaho Public Defender’s Office, had been working with his client, who was charged in December 2024 with driving with a suspended or revoked driver’s license.

“I don’t know why he isn’t here today,” the lawyer told the judge in court audio obtained via a records request.

The next day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted a picture of the man being detained in Nampa by federal officers.

When ICE picks up people mid-case, they can face default judgments and parole or probation violations for failing to appear in court. When or if individuals ever return to the United States, there can already be a warrant out for an immigrant’s arrest, said Dougherty.

ICE picked up people while their Idaho criminal cases were ongoing before the new administration took office. But it’s happening more often now, Dougherty and Despain said, with potential consequences for the immigrants and any victims.

These aren’t all minor cases like driving with a suspended license. In one instance, a 27-year-old man from Mexico was arrested in Pocatello for child sexual abuse, child enticement and kidnapping. ICE posted a picture of him the day before his preliminary hearing, at which he failed to appear. He has since been deported, ICE spokesperson Alethea Smock said in an email. The case is listed as inactive and pending after the state asked to keep the case open.

Wood River Valley lawyer Justin McCarthy said immigrants in Idaho’s criminal justice system should finish their sentences in the Gem State.

“They should be held accountable here. … You don’t get to skate on the sentence,” McCarthy said. “What about victims? What about the victims’ families? … That person could come back, and they often do.”

An immigrant from El Salvador

Hicks had been with his husband for about five years by the time he was detained by ICE in late June. The couple married in 2023, according to a petition filed by his husband’s lawyers.

Hicks’s husband is originally from San Salvador, the capital of the Central American country of El Salvador. He came to the United States in 2018 to support his family and has worked in construction, Hicks said. His husband sends money to his mother, sisters and nephews back home, Hicks said. He hasn’t been able to see his family in years.

In 2021, his husband pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and received a withheld judgment. He was required to undergo alcohol education and was placed on unsupervised probation, according to court records. On June 5 of this year, he was found guilty of driving while using a cellphone, according to online court records.

After his arrest, the husband was sent to Elmore County first. Now he is detained in the Nevada Southern Detention Center west of Las Vegas, according to an online ICE detainee locator tool.

Hicks can’t go visit his husband in detention. The couple can conduct phone and video calls through the jail, Hicks said.

Lawyers for Hicks’ husband filed a petition in federal court to get him out of detention, arguing among other things that ICE agents didn’t show a warrant when they broke into his car and that an immigration judge was unfairly keeping him detained.

Hicks filed a petition earlier in 2025 for his husband to get residency, he said. But it will take four to six years, Hicks said.

“You should enter (the U.S.) with permission,” Hicks said. “But also, the whole process is just broken. It shouldn’t take someone five or six years to possibly get residency when they’re married to a U.S. citizen.”

The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift a temporary restraining order that blocked “roving” immigration stops in Los Angeles and eight other California counties.

In an emergency appeal, the federal government argued the order poses a significant barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. The request for a stay is filed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, so oral arguments are not likely.

An attorney for the plaintiffs in the initial suit — a coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies — said they look forward to arguing the case before the high court.

“The federal government has now gone running to the Supreme Court asking it to undo a narrow court order—applicable in only one judicial district—that merely compels them to follow the Constitution.” said Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order last month in the Central District of California, citing “a mountain of evidence” that the government’s aggressive enforcement tactics likely violated people’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Trump’s Solicitor General, D. John Sauer argued in the filing with the high court that Frimpong’s order puts a “straitjacket” on agents and “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws … by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop of suspected illegal aliens.”

Frimpong ruled federal immigration authorities could not rely on four factors for reasonable suspicion: race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment; either solely or in combination.

‘A racial profiling case’

“This is basically a racial profiling case: Can Latinos be shaken down in their communities and where they live because they look Latino?” Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law, said Thursday in response to the administration filing.

Starting in early June, heavily armed agents, often in masks and plain clothes or military-style uniforms, aggressively detained immigrants and U.S. citizens using heavy wartime equipment at Home Depots, car washes, and Latino markets across Los Angeles. Agents often filmed the arrests and shared the videos on social media, set to hip hop music. The Trump administration vowed to bring similar actions to cities across the nation, especially in blue states.

The federal government’s appeal to the Supreme Court follows a denial from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week to lift the temporary restraining order.

Multiple legal cases involving Trump’s immigration policies have already reached the Supreme Court, including the government’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members. The Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s temporary restraining order that had blocked those deportations. Many of the high court’s rulings, especially on immigration issues, have sided with the administration in recent months.

“I think it’s not surprising that if you’re having some wins in the courts through appeals, you bring appeals,” said Johnson, who noted both Democrat and Republican administrations have used the appeal strategy.

Prior to the temporary restraining order, Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, the leader of the LA operations, carried out military-style raids across large swaths of Los Angeles. Calmatters and Bellingcat mapped out over 100 locations of raids including 15 separate Home Depots.

After the lower court’s order, he moved operations northward to the state’s capital.

‘No sanctuary anywhere’

“There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said after a July 17 raid at a Home Depot in Sacramento. “We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”

Frimpong’s restraining order did not entirely stop immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

On Wednesday, heavily armed Border Patrol and other federal agents hid inside a Penske truck before jumping out and ambushing people at a Home Depot in an operation dubbed “Trojan Horse.”

In a written statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents conducted a “targeted raid” at the Home Depot that “resulted in the arrests of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua.”

Johnson of UC Davis said at least the federal government is pursuing a legal avenue to continue its actions, but if the temporary restraining order is lifted, it could cause “real damage” in the LA community.

“These roving patrols are terrifying communities,” Johnson said. “It’s going to have an impact on whether people are going to take their kids to school and whether people can take their kids to the doctor.”",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/494c07e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F2e%2F87216cf24243bbae3f0ed1d00363%2F062025-cbp-ice-raid-la-getty-cm-01.png,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:05.842915

The case, filed by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers, is being argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, UC Berkeley law school dean and constitutional expert.
Mark Yudof, a former UC president who led the system from 2008 to 2013, believed negotiations were still likely.
He said the settlement UCLA came to with Jewish students in late July is “likely to be the initial framework for those discussions.","Two weeks ago, UCLA was optimistic.

For months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools.

The morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. University leaders hailed the action as “real progress” to combat antisemitism. Privately, they pointed the Trump administration to the agreement, eager to convince federal officials they had made good with Jewish communities.

The high lasted just a few hours — and touched off an extraordinary 14 days of rapid-fire accusations, investigative findings and a massive federal freeze of UCLA’s research funding. It culminated Friday afternoon when Gov. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity.

“He has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine, unless we do his bidding,” Newsom said, adding that California would sue. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom’s comments and legal threat.

The escalating events lead up to decisive moments this week, starting with an emergency meeting of the UC Board of Regents on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, a federal court hearing will unfold in a preexisting case that could result in some — but not all — UC grants being restored.

The developments bring the fight over America’s higher education institutions — which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months — to the nation’s most powerful and lauded public university system.

“We are in uncharted territory,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,700 colleges and universities. “We have seen the government come after Columbia, Brown, Harvard and others. But this, now, is a test. Will UCLA be the defender of public universities? Will it strike a deal? And what role will money — taxpayer money — play?”

California is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls “Marxist” universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars.

His administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide — Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses — of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. In response to pro-Palestinian protests, Trump has said colleges have enabled “jihadists,” saying demonstrators are “pro-Hamas” terrorists.

“UCLA is not a random selection,” Mitchell said. “The administration has had issues with California, with the governor, for some time. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.”

What’s at stake

Since July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions — totaling nearly half a billion dollars — UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. Deans and departments have been told to be prepared for layoffs if the cuts last.

Science and medical professors, whose research labs would not exist without federal funding, have solicited private donations. Doctoral and postdoctoral students, whose tuition and living expenses are often funded by grants in exchange for lab work, are rushing to speed up their graduation plans before stipends become depleted.

“The federal government claims antisemitism and bias as the reasons. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy.

UC as a system and UCLA in particular have been under multiple federal investigations for months:

Alleged employment discrimination against Jewish employees and job applicants.

Civil rights complaints from Israeli and Jewish students.

The alleged consideration of race in admissions practices.

UCLA is also on a shortlist of 10 campuses, including UC Berkeley and USC — that a federal task force on combating antisemitism singled out in February.

The ongoing investigations were launched by the Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services departments.

UCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said.

They hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations.

But the federal government’s stance is now clear: It believes UCLA is guilty of all allegations.

The NSF letter said that UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.”

What Trump wants

Federal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations.

The settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments.

In addition to the sticker-shock fine, some requests have puzzled UCLA leaders — as the UC system has already significantly overhauled many practices outlined by the federal government.

It has ended the use of “diversity statements” in hiring. Last fall, UCLA declared a “zero-tolerance” policy for encampments. The government wants transgender women off women’s sports teams. But as a member of the National Collegiate Athletics Assn., the university is already required to follow new association rules that bar transgender players from women’s teams.

“It feels like a cut-and-paste job,” said a senior UC official about Trump’s proposal. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about negotiations. “It’s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words ‘UCLA.’ ”

What comes next

The 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. It’s unclear whether Newsom, who is an ex-officio member of the board, will attend.

Another pivotal moment comes Tuesday in San Francisco’s federal district court. There, Judge Rita F. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC.

The case, filed by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers, is being argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, UC Berkeley law school dean and constitutional expert. If the judge rules in UC’s favor, it could apply to NSF cuts that account for about half of those in limbo at UCLA.

In an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were “clearly illegal” because “the president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.”

He outlined what would likely be California’s argument in a suit: The government’s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized.

“The cutoff of funds has been without the due process required by federal laws and the Constitution,” Chemerinsky said. “Agencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are ‘arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.’ Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.”

Negotiations still possible

But California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration’s orders.

When Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said time — and politics — is not on UCLA’s side.

“At some point you have to be ready for fall classes and international students coming in and the campus trying to deal with the uncertainty and losing all your grants,” said Tobias. Litigation can take months, if not years, he said. California “might do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don’t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.”

After Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table — but not on the current “unacceptable” terms.

“The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said.

Mark Yudof, a former UC president who led the system from 2008 to 2013, believed negotiations were still likely.

“While litigation is certainly a possibility, my sense is that both sides will first try negotiating a settlement,” Yudof said. He said the settlement UCLA came to with Jewish students in late July is “likely to be the initial framework for those discussions. Hard to say where it goes from there. The fact that UC is a public university system adds to the complexities.”

Mitchell, the American Council on Education president and former top administrator of Occidental College, said a quick resolution would benefit both sides. He said a months-long process — as it’s been between Harvard and Trump — would have the potential for “great harm.”

“These things, the longer they go on, the worse they get,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6371be2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2F1b%2F3b587bfc476cbe7f6ac13127d7f5%2F1517333-me-0807-ucla-campus-gem-007.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 19:56:50.439332

“We want kids in our school and to get them here, they have to feel safe,"" said superintendent Bret Schroeder.","President Donald Trump has cracked down on immigration enforcement. As part of his plan, the administration backed out of a 2011 policy and now allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to make arrests at schools, hospitals and churches.

In light of the arrest guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security, some of Nebraska's schools have instituted new policies, restated former policies and/or contacted legal representation. Nebraska Public Media reached out to some larger school districts and those in cities with large immigrant communities to over this digital resource into what certain districts are doing as far as immigration enforcement on or near school grounds.

Omaha Public Schools

The OPS Board of Education has restated the district's resolution from Trump's first administration regarding practices related to ICE.

This resolution states, unless specifically required by law, no district employee, contractor, volunteer or representative will assist in the detection or apprehension of an individual who may be undocumented.

The district will not ask any student or parent about immigration status nor require documentation. Further, nobody in the district, unless compelled by a valid court order or other legal form, will disclose student or family information to ICE officers. If ICE wants to enter school grounds, the officers must first notify the superintendent and the district's general counsel before entry.

OPS also states all students and their families, regardless of immigration status, have access to all learning and educational services available at the schools.

Lincoln Public Schools

While the district will adhere to legal documentation for ICE's presence, it will also ""endeavor to prevent undue interference in District operations and educational programs."" This includes making sure all students, regardless of immigration statues, are safe and allowed to learn.

Staff will not answer any questions from a visitor until their identity is verified by a building administrator.

If an ICE agent comes to a school, the person will be held at the Security Entrance Monitor location while their identity is verified, which includes their name, name of their agency and the reason for their visit. Any questions from law enforcement are directed to that building administrator.

Grand Island Public Schools

GIPS does not collect any information regarding immigration status for its students nor its families. The district would only release student information to ICE if it provides a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. That information would not include immigration status, rather the student's name, school email address, enrollment status, grade level, etc.

Any request for an interview with a student from law enforcement must first go through the principal's office, who will then determine if the request should be granted. If a student's parent or legal guardian is not present for the interview, then a building administrator or school designee will attend.

Students are not allowed to be taken from the school without the consent of the principal and without a proper warrant.

Scottsbluff Public Schools

The district and its staff will comply with ICE requests if they have a warrant or subpoena signed by a judge. If the agent does not have one of those, the staff will not comply or give any information. Although employees will not obstruct government operations, they will also ""attempt to prevent undue interference with district operations or educations programming.""

Immigration enforcement is not specifically listed as a non-warrant reason for why a law enforcement officer may remove a student for questioning or detention.

For interviews with students not related to district events, the students' parents or guardians must consent. A school employee does not need to be present. The school will not disclose any student records unless in direct response to a court order or subpoena.

Columbus Public Schools

Although the district does not have a specific policy regarding ICE, the superintendent or principal will only release minors to law enforcement upon presentation of a court order or warrant for that student's arrest. The principal or other school official would then immediately notify the parent or guardian of the child.

South Sioux City Community Schools

Although the district does not have a policy exclusively written on ICE, no schools collect or have information about a student's immigration status and therefore are unable to share that information. If ICE makes a request to speak with a student in the district, it must first go through the superintendent's office and the district's legal counsel before any action is taken.

The district will, however, comply with state and federal laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Fremont Public Schools

The district cannot prevent ICE agents from entering school property, but if an employee encounters ICE on school property, that staff member needs to immediately inform the principal, who will then inform the superintendent. Further, the ICE agent will be requested to work with and speak directly with the superintendent.

Although the district cannot legally prevent ICE from entering a school property, the superintendent would remind that agent of the 2011 ICE Memorandum that instruct ICE to avoid ""sensitive locations,"" which includes schools. This is the policy the Trump administration has urged agents to disregard.

Crete Public Schools

While the Board of Education does not have a formal policy specific to ICE, the district is committed to following the law. The district also maintains a ""comprehensive Threat Assessment and Crisis Response Plan that guides our actions in any situation.""

Madison Public Schools

Although the district does not have written policies regarding ICE, the procedure for all staff is to refer any ICE officials or documents, such as a subpoena, to the superintendent. The superintendent will then work with legal counsel to respond ""as appropriate and in a manner that is as protective of our students as possible.""

Schuyler Community Schools

The district does not have a policy specific to ICE, but it would follow law enforcement mandates as required by law. Its main focus is to keep students safe and stay focused on education. If ICE comes to the school grounds, the district would require a warrant signed by judge and only then would comply. That warrant would list specifically who they’re there for, and ICE would not be allowed free reign of the building. A building official would bring the individual listed on the judge-signed warrant to the office. ICE raids would not be tolerated unless there is a building warrant. The district does not gather information on immigration status and it follows the legal guidelines of FERPA. “We want kids in our school and to get them here, they have to feel safe,"" said superintendent Bret Schroeder.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/chris-robert-A4T1lh6p19k-unsplash.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 16:57:02.541016

Sonny Lasquite was detained after a vacation in the Bahamas by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on July 28 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to relatives who spoke with GMA News Online.

Why it Matters

Lasquite's arrest was due to a red flag in the federal system linked to a 2012 narcotics case. ICE records reviewed by Newsweek show Lesquite currently being held at the Stewart Detention Center in Stewart County, Georgia.

Lasquite's detention illustrated how lawful permanent residents could face immigration enforcement after arrests at ports of entry, raising questions about the consequences of past criminal convictions for long-term residents and the humanitarian impact on families that rely on detained relatives for financial and caregiving support.

What To Know

Lasquite reportedly lived in the U.S. for 23 years and worked as a banquet server in Las Vegas.

From roughly December 2010 to about August 2012, Lasquite ""intentionally and knowingly"" possessed with the intent to distribute Schedule IV narcotics, including diazepam, alprazolam, zolpidem and carisoprodol, according to court records in the Southern District of New York reviewed by Newsweek.

But records indicate that he promptly took responsibility for his actions and cooperated with the federal government in identifying charged and uncharged co-conspirators. A 2014 sentencing memorandum by former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said that Lasquite helped stop narcotics distribution practices and led to the prosecutions of others.

""You are, as the government points out, the only defendant who cooperated,"" Bharara said on September 9, 2014. ""You did that at some risk to yourself. I think there needs to be recognition of that and proportionate sentencing between you

and the other defendants.

""I feel pretty confident that you're not going to commit any crimes in the future, and I join the government in wishing you well and hopefully being able to put this behind you.""

The court ultimately sentenced Lasquite to time served and no additional prison time, ordering him to pay $200.

Lasquite did put that time of his life behind him, according to family and friends in a GoFundMe created Saturday to raise $30,000 to cover legal representation and filing fees, and ""essential expenses to fight for Sonny's right to remain in the U.S. and reunite with his family.""

As of Monday morning, nearly $11,600 had been raised from 56 donations. The fundraiser was started by Vivian Hirono, of Las Vegas, who writes that Lasquite ""has had no further legal troubles and has been a law-abiding, contributing member of his community"" since his 2012 criminal conviction.

Newsweek reached out to Hirono via the GoFundMe page for comment.

""Sonny Lasquite is more than a name—he is a beloved son, brother, uncle and friend whose kindness has touched countless lives,"" the GoFundMe says. ""For decades, Sonny has lived peacefully in the United States, working hard, caring for his elderly mother, and always putting others before himself. He is the kind of person who never hesitates to help, greet you with a warm smile, or offer comfort when you need it most.""

Aside from Lasquite's detention causing his mother's health to ""decline under the weight of this stress,"" his own health is reportedly taking a toll. Lasquite has purportedly faced medical neglect during detention, including delayed access to his blood pressure medication and proper care for his recent fever, according to Hirono.

What People Are Saying

Vivian Hirono on Sonny Lasquite's GoFundMe page: ""Sonny is the primary breadwinner of his family, providing both financial and emotional support to his loved ones. His income helps cover essential expenses, including his elderly mother's medical needs and daily living costs.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Friday in Illinois called allegations of ICE detaining immigrants without criminal convictions ""false,"" according to NewsNation: ""I'm here today because elected leaders in Illinois are ignoring the law. In fact, they're being obstructionists when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off of their streets. They're deciding that dangerous criminals that are murderers, rapists, money launderers, have committed assaults, and that are trafficking children are more important than the families who live in the communities here.""

What Happens Next

Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.","Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.

The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.

Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.

When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.

One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.

At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.

But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.

“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.

The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.

After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”

However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.

Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.

Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.

Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.

“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”

There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.

One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.

One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.

Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)

In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.

The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.

The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.

Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.

Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.

The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.

“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”

Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.

“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”

Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.

Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases.

Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests.

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings.

That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period.

Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.

At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.

As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers.

In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.”

While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.

In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.

Missing Persons

EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways.

“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did.

ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.

“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”

In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide.

But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances.

The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period.

Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data.

In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.

New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador.

Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount.

The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.

The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Black Box

The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.

Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification.

Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later.

A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside.

“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.”

Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.

On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July.

City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.

“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.

Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building.

“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different.

“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”

Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.”

She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.

“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.

The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.

“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said.

Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He has repeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.

‘Guiding Star’?

Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case.

But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.

Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.

That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.

“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.

Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests.

Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE.

“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”

Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.

A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented.

“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:14.138849

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://www.kark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2025/08/6899d2165dbcc2.39080798.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-11 12:58:26.593833

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a program to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of an ICE raid.
“Small businesses shouldn’t have to fear being shut down by government overreach when they have played by the rules,” Lawson-Remer said in a statement.
""Knowledge is key.” According to Lawson-Remer's office, small businesses account for nearly 380,000 businesses in San Diego County.
They said the Small Business Know Your Rights program is intended to protect people from being wrongly arrested at their place of employment.","SAN DIEGO — A new program is being developed in San Diego to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid.

When Katrina Oprisko started her zero-waste refill shop, Earthwell Refill, her mission was to help her community. When she watched U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid popular South Park restaurant Buona Forchetta in May, she felt powerless to help her neighbors.

“We said, ‘Wow, that’s really close.’ That’s not really far away that it doesn’t impact us, and so everyone said, ‘Oh, my goodness, we have to know what we’re going to do when this happens,'” Oprisko said.

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a program to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of an ICE raid.

Board Chair Terra Lawson-Remer said she crafted the proposal after the Buona Forchetta raid became a national story. The program aims to help employers ""know what to do, and what not to do"" if ICE or Department of Homeland Security officials show up, as well as workplace protocols to prevent legal mistakes and reduce business disruption.

“Small businesses shouldn’t have to fear being shut down by government overreach when they have played by the rules,” Lawson-Remer said in a statement. “We’re working to protect constitutional rights, uphold due process, and make sure federal fear-mongering doesn’t threaten lives and livelihoods, or destabilize San Diego’s economy.”

Buona Forchetta was closed for two days after the raid, with other locations closed for the rest of the week. Oprisko says that kind of disruption to a small business can have devastating consequences.

“To be closed for a week, that’s not possible,"" she said. ""You might as well shut down the whole entire restaurant or business.”

Bill Wells is the mayor of El Cajon and said that while he favors people knowing their rights, he does not support the county using its money to get involved.

“People didn’t sign up to have their tax dollars be spent to kind of circumvent the will of the people in this respect,"" Wells said. ""And the County of San Diego is saying, ‘no, we want to even do more to help illegal immigration,’ which I think is the wrong approach.”

He also said he believes California's status as a sanctuary state has not helped matters.

“I don’t think people are employing illegal immigrants because they don’t know the rules; I think they don’t care about the rules,"" Wells said. ""And I think California has really set up a precedent where California says, ‘Well, we’ll follow these laws but we won’t follow those laws.’”

Erica Castillo is the advocacy co-chair of Business For Good, as well as the owner of her own small business, Unita Solutions.

“Business For Good is proud to be a strong supporter of the KYR training program and is actively working with the county to help shape it,"" Castillo said. ""We’ve heard firsthand from business owners and workers about the impacts of ICE raids and other federal immigration enforcement — lost income, reduced staff, and a shaken sense of safety in the community. This training is a vital tool to help businesses and workers rebuild with confidence and resilience.”

Oprisko is excited to help her community in new ways and plans to take part in the program as soon as it’s available. While only she and her husband run their small business, she hopes to pass on what they learn.

“I would feel horrible if I didn’t try to do something; and so, knowing this knowledge, that I can share that with other business owners, I can share that with my neighbors,"" she said. ""Knowledge is key.”

According to Lawson-Remer's office, small businesses account for nearly 380,000 businesses in San Diego County. They said the Small Business Know Your Rights program is intended to protect people from being wrongly arrested at their place of employment.

Supervisor Jim Desmond, who voted no, said while he favors people knowing their rights, he couldn't support Lawson-Remer's measure.

""We wouldn't be in this situation if (Biden) hadn't let millions of people come over our border illegally and unvetted during the Biden administration,"" Desmond said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ICE-ca-0811,N,,2025-08-11 14:57:01.014842

A rarely-used method is the exception to this rule. Using a procedure called snap removal, defendants can avoid the forum defendant rule by removing before the forum defendant is served.

28 U.S.C. § 1441 allows a defendant to remove a case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction except where “any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.” A snap removal defendant argues that the forum defendant rule does not apply because a forum defendant is not “served” at the time of removal.

Because snap removal can allow defendants to circumvent the forum defendant rule, it is crucial for state court litigants on both sides of the “v” to keep the practice in mind at the initial stages of litigation, including the mechanics of the practice and courts’ views of it.

Legal Landscape

Though there is not a bona fide circuit split on the issue of snap removal, courts are divided. The Second, Third, and Fifth Circuits have interpreted section 1441(b) to allow snap removal. See Gibbons v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 919 F.3d 699 (2d Cir. 2019); Encompass Ins. Co. v. Stone Mansion Rest. Inc., 902 F.3d 147 (3d Cir. 2018); Texas Brine Co. LLC v. Am. Arbitration Ass’n. Inc., 955 F.3d 482 (5th Cir. 2020). The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have endorsed that interpretation of section 1441(b), albeit in a footnote and dicta. See McCall v. Scott, 239 F.3d 808, 813 n.2 (6th Cir. 2001); Goodwin v. Reynolds, 757 F.3d 1216, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2014). Meanwhile, just last year, the Ninth Circuit declined to express a view on snap removal while concluding “super snap removal” – removal before a complaint is even filed – is ineffectual. Casola v. Dexcom, Inc., 98 F.4th 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2024).

Many federal district courts have expressed doubts of the practice, finding that it promotes gamesmanship, is counter to the purpose of section 1441(b), and creates absurd results. See, e.g., Carazo Reyes v. Harbor Freight Tools USA, Inc., 2025 WL 1683163 (C.D. Cal. 2025); Rising Phoenix Holding Corp. v. Ross, 2023 WL 3032095 (S.D. Fla. 2023); Kirst v. Erck, 2022 WL 2869742 (D. Md. 2022); In re Abbott Lab’ys, 2022 WL 2257182 (N.D. Ill. 2022); In re Lipitor (Atorvstatin Calcium) Mktg., Sales Pratices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 2016 WL 7338594 (D.S.C. 2016). While others note that “policy appeals regarding the technological advantages of electronic dockets and resulting overuse of snap removal by defendants are unavailing [and that] it is for Congress, not this Court, to revise the statute.” Higgins v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 2025 WL 1397045, at *2 (D. Del. 2025).

Where the maneuver is accepted, leveraging snap removal to one’s benefit – by either utilizing it or avoiding it – can be a powerful tool.

Practice Tips

For Plaintiffs:

Understand applicable legal authority. When filing a state court action where diversity jurisdiction exists, plaintiffs should check whether snap removal is available in the jurisdiction.

Speed is your friend. Snap removal requires a defendant to remove to federal court before the citizen of the forum state is served. Plaintiffs should serve the complaint as soon as practicable, limiting the snap removal window, and if possible, avoid giving defendants a heads-up, even if courtesy might otherwise countenance it. A defendant cannot snap remove if it does not know a lawsuit is coming.

Defeat complete diversity. Including a party that defeats complete diversity prevents a plaintiff from utilizing diversity jurisdiction as grounds for removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 in the first place. Courts will disregard fraudulently joined parties for diversity jurisdiction analysis, but to the extent a plaintiff can identify another properly joined party that eliminates diversity jurisdiction, they can protect against snap removal.

“With President Trump increasingly talking about using troops for law enforcement purposes, this trial has great significance,” Chemerinsky said.","The Trump administration and California will face off in court Monday, over President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles.

Trump sent the troops to Los Angeles to address protests against immigration arrests in the city. Most of the troops have been recalled but a ruling in favor of California could hamstring the president’s ability to respond to domestic emergencies, the government argues.

California sued Trump in June, after clashing with the president over how best to respond to protests in downtown Los Angeles over the president’s immigration raids. Trump deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops, ordering them to the streets under federal control, over Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections. Trump also sent about 700 active-duty Marines to the city.

Over a three-day trial in San Francisco, US District Judge Charles Breyer will hear testimony and legal arguments to determine whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that sharply limits members of the military from enforcing civilian laws.

“It doesn’t seem like we’re on the threshold of mass violence and chaos,” said Jon Michaels, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles law school. “The city didn’t feel dangerous. But is that a decision for me to make? Is that a decision for Gavin Newsom to make? Is that a decision for Judge Breyer to make? Or is it up to federal officials? Whoever ultimately gets to make that decision dictates how this case comes out.”

Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, said troops weren’t needed and their presence inflamed tensions. Newsom said the troops were diverted from more important duties, including wildfire suppression and helping battle drug smuggling at the Mexican border.

The trial starts days after Trump told reporters he was considering deploying the National Guard to address crime in the city of Washington. That came in response to a late-night assault on a DOGE staffer during a carjacking attempt.

Earlier this year, Breyer ordered Trump to return the National Guard to Newsom’s control, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco put a hold on the order, ruling that Trump had likely acted within the law.

‘Great Significance’

This week’s proceedings are about whether federal troops were illegally used for traditional law enforcement activities, according to Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.

“With President Trump increasingly talking about using troops for law enforcement purposes, this trial has great significance,” Chemerinsky said.

A win for Trump could be seen as a green-light for presidents to unilaterally employ the military to police citizens inside the US.

The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad, unilateral power to federalize the National Guard when he determines there is a “rebellion” or “invasion” or when “regular forces” are unable to enforce the law. A lawyer for the state called the prospect that a president can order troops into US cities without court review “terrifying.”

The case may ultimately be decided by the US Supreme Court, long after the troops have left Los Angeles. Nearly all have now been recalled, with just a small contingent left to stand guard at some federal facilities.

The case is Newsom v. Trump, 25-cv-04870, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

Under an expansion of the Deport Now, Appeal Later policy, the number of countries whose nationals can be removed before their appeals are heard will rise from 8 to 23. Individuals from these countries who have had human rights claims refused will be deported before they can appeal and will be allowed to participate in appeal hearings remotely via video link.

In a Home Office press release, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was quoted as saying: ""For far too long, foreign criminals have been exploiting our immigration system, remaining in the UK for months or even years while their appeals drag on. That has to end. Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced.""

According to Sky News, the fifteen new countries added to the Deport Now, Appeal Later scheme will be Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia. They will join the existing eight countries of Albania, Belize, Estonia, Finland, Kosovo, Mauritius, Nigeria, and Tanzania, which were added when the policy was restarted in 2023.

The Home Office says the measure will avoid offenders from the 15 countries in question remaining in the UK for months or years while their cases are worked through the appeals system.

In last month's notable case of Kapikanya v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWCA Civ 987, the Court of Appeal dismissed a Zambian national's challenge to a deportation order that had been pursued, in various forms, for more than 25 years. Lord Justice Bean noted that the appellant had been the subject of five separate deportation decisions since 1998, but a combination of appeals and reconsiderations had allowed him to remain in the UK throughout that period.

Separately, the Ministry of Justice announced plans yesterday for legislation enabling the immediate deportation of certain foreign national offenders after sentencing. This would apply to prisoners serving determinate sentences, but it will exclude offenders serving life sentences and cases where national security concerns apply.

If follows changes expected to take effect next month under the draft Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Removal of Prisoners for Deportation) Order 2025 that will allow deportations after 30% of a sentence is served, down from the current 50%. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood spoke to The Sun on Sunday to announce the plan to reduce this further to 0%, with the article reporting that it is set to come into force in the New Year. The change will require primary legislation, which ministers say will be brought before Parliament in due course.

According to The Times, those deported will be permanently barred from returning to the UK, though the Government's press release did not mention this. The Times also noted that the measure would mean criminals returning to their home country will often serve no prison time. A government source told The Times that the Justice Secretary is ""firmly of the philosophy that exile is punishment"".

United States | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/fernandez-v-united-states/,"This disquiet contributed to his belief that there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce Fernandez’s sentence.
In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.
In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent.
In seeking compassionate release, prisoners do not argue that they are imprisoned without sufficient cause.
As congressional debates make clear, the lawmakers who enacted § 3582(C)(1)(A) understood that compassionate release and § 2255 performed completely different functions.","Drawing on a centuries-long tradition of granting wide discretion to judges when imposing sentences, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows federal judges to reduce a previously imposed sentence when they conclude that there are “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to do so.

In 2021, exercising that discretionary authority, the district court judge in this case reduced the mandatory life sentence that Joe Fernandez is currently serving for a crime that he maintains he did not commit. Though the sentencing judge who agreed to reduce the sentence had been the one to preside over Fernandez’s trial, he explained that he still harbored a “certain disquiet” about the verdict. This disquiet contributed to his belief that there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce Fernandez’s sentence.

The Second Circuit reversed the district court judge’s decision to grant the motion, holding that the sentencing judge could not consider his disquiet about the verdict in a motion for compassionate release because, in its view, concerns about the validity of a verdict can only be considered in response to a petition under 25 U.S.C. § 2255. In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.

The text of Section 3582(c)(1)(A) of the Sentencing Reform Act gives judges broad discretion to determine the existence of “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for a sentence reduction. The statute contains only one instruction about the scope of judges’ authority to assess the “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release: courts must abide by the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements. And in tasking the Sentencing Commission with providing guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling reasons,” it provides only one stipulation: “[r]ehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.” The clear inference is that other reasons are permissible within a judge’s discretion.

Congress’s use of the phrase “extraordinary and compelling” bears this out. In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent. The plain language of the statute indicates that the sentencing judge should make an individualized assessment of the case, considering all relevant factors, to decide whether there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce the individual’s sentence, and no factors other than rehabilitation alone should be categorically excluded. Legal dictionaries and case law at the time reinforce this definition.

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges. Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, courts imposed the sentence, but parole officers exercised absolute discretion over the actual duration of imprisonment. Congress felt that the system of indeterminate sentencing had unjustified consequences, like creating uncertainty as to the time an offender would actually spend in prison, producing serious disparities between sentences imposed for similar offenses, and letting parole boards usurp the function of the judiciary. In response to these concerns, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the federal sentencing scheme, creating a more structured system with a compassionate release provision acting as a “safety valve” in unusual cases. Lawmakers described this safety valve authority as a response to judges’ requests for the power to deal with what one congressman described as “the very exceptional situation where someone obviously slips through the cracks and gets a much longer sentence.” In granting judges this “safety valve” authority, Congress ensured that they would have the same broad discretion to consider a wide variety of different factors that parole officials had enjoyed under the previous regime.

The lower court incorrectly held that the sentencing judge could not consider Mr. Fernandez’s arguments about his “potential innocence” in a motion under § 3582(C)(1)(A) because, in its view, those claims were only “cognizable under section 2255,” which delineates how federal prisoners may file habeas petitions. But the statutes are completely different. Section 2255 provides federal prisoners with a means to “attack” or “test the legality” of their detention, and ultimately results in a sentence being completely vacated. In seeking compassionate release, prisoners do not argue that they are imprisoned without sufficient cause. Rather, they argue that they should be released from prison without invalidating the underlying conviction. As congressional debates make clear, the lawmakers who enacted § 3582(C)(1)(A) understood that compassionate release and § 2255 performed completely different functions.

The court below was wrong to prohibit the sentencing judge from considering his “disquiet” about the verdict when reducing Mr. Fernandez’s life sentence, and the Supreme Court should reverse.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-08-11 11:57:22.405540

They were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a media tent outside Al-Shifa Hospital. Al Jazeera decried the targeted killing as a “desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.” Funerals were held today for Anas al-Sharif, his fellow colleague Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal.

The attack came just weeks after Al Jazeera, the Committee to Protect Journalists and a top U.N. official all warned al-Sharif’s life was in danger after Israel accused him of being a member of Hamas. Israel took responsibility for Sunday’s strike. At the time, U.N. Special Rapporteur Irene Khan blasted Israel for spreading unfounded accusations about him; today she called for sanctions against Israel for murdering the Al Jazeera team.

Ibrahim Abu Moussa: “The occupation says that by killing the journalists, the truth will be stopped and that its crimes will not be exposed. But I tell the occupation that your bombardment on us increases our determination and resolve in conveying the voice and the suffering of our people in Gaza, and we show your crimes against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.”

Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced Australia will recognize a Palestinian state next month, following similar calls by Britain, France and Canada.

This comes as health officials in Gaza say at least five more Palestinians, including a child, have starved to death over the past day, bringing the total to at least 222, including over 100 children.

On Sunday, Russia and Ukraine traded drone attacks, with Ukraine hitting the southern Russian region of Saratov, killing one person and damaging several apartments and an industrial facility. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for more pressure on Russia to end the war.

President Volodymyr Zelensky: “We clearly understand the threats. All our partners understand the threats just as clearly. Everyone sees that there has been no real step from Russia toward peace, no action on the ground nor in the air that could save lives. That is why sanctions are needed, pressure is needed, strength is needed — the strength, first and foremost, of the United States, the strength of Europe, the strength of all nations in the world that want peace and stability in international relations. If Russia does not want to stop the war, then its economy must be stopped.”

On Friday, President Trump removed the head of the IRS shortly after a conflict over tax data used to help locate undocumented immigrants, according to a Washington Post report. IRS Commissioner Billy Long was a former Republican congressmember nominated by Trump to lead the agency and was only in the job for two months before he was removed.

Two weeks after our conversation Lelo agreed to “voluntary departure”—the term used by immigration authorities for self-deportation.
“Geo does this on purpose to make it hard for folks, while maximizing their profit by not having more employees,” Lelo said.
Bad conditions serve to coerce people detained at the Northwest Detention Center into self-deportation.
Within hours he was in the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, and in line for a flight back to Mexico.","When I spoke with Alfredo Juarez Zeferino, known as “Lelo,” while he was imprisoned in the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, he had to be very careful about what he said. Calls to detainees are monitored. “My freedom of speech here is very limited,” he warned me. Lelo had been held there since his detention in March, and I interviewed him in July.

Two weeks after our conversation Lelo agreed to “voluntary departure”—the term used by immigration authorities for self-deportation. In early August, by telephone from Santa Cruz Yucucani, his hometown in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero, he was able to describe the conditions in this enormous immigrant detention center, which today holds more than 1,500 people awaiting deportation.

“It’s a really terrible place,” Lelo told me. He said bad food was probably the worst problem: The Geo Group, a private corporation that runs the detention center, is supposed to provide three meals a day, but often the last meal would come at one or two in the morning. “The rice was hard, like it never touched hot water, and the beans were never cooked all the way,” Lelo said. “That was the main food they gave us. Chicken was so undercooked that sometimes it dripped blood, and people got sick during the night. One time everybody turned in their trays and we wouldn’t take the food.”

The second week he was there, Lelo started having vision problems because the lights were always on at night, making it hard to sleep. He signed up for the “sick call” list to get eye drops. “I waited a long time to see a doctor,” he recalled, “and finally an officer told us to go back to our unit. They only had one doctor, and we weren’t going to be seen. After that I didn’t sign up again, but other folks in my unit would wait hours and hours and still not get seen. I’d share an apple or something sweet for people who were diabetic. But day after day it was the same thing. Sign up and maybe tomorrow somebody will see you.”

The Tacoma immigrant detention center is run by the Geo Group, founded as a division of the Wackenhut Corporation, with ties to U.S. intelligence agencies going back to the Cold War. Since discovering in the 1980s the huge profits to be made in federal contracts, the company has become one of the two largest corporations running immigrant detention centers in the United States. Much of those profits are earned by keeping operating costs at a minimum; as a result Geo has been repeatedly charged with short staffing at the prisons it runs. “Geo does this on purpose to make it hard for folks, while maximizing their profit by not having more employees,” Lelo said. Bad conditions serve to coerce people detained at the Northwest Detention Center into self-deportation.

Self-deportation is an important arm of the Trump Administration’s immigration policy. According to Mark Krikorian, executive director of the anti-immigrant Center for Immigration Studies, “Any successful strategy to cut the illegal population significantly will have to combine two things: ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] arresting and removing illegal aliens, and other illegal aliens leaving on their own . . . . Preliminary data suggest nearly one million illegal aliens have departed the country since President Donald Trump’s Inauguration.”

That number is highly questionable, and the center provides no data to support it. It is undeniable, however, that the government is pressuring people to self-deport. Fear of deportation and family separation, as well as hopelessness about any prospect for legal status, has led many people to leave the United States.

In a highly-publicized immigration raid at Glass House Farms on California’s central coast, chaos and fear were deliberately used as weapons to terrorize workers and their families. One man, Jaime Alaniz Garcia, fell to his death desperately fleeing ICE agents. The terror produced by the raids is also a weapon to get people to leave on their own. Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official in charge of the Southern California region, responded to criticism of the Glass House raid. “Illegal aliens had the opportunity to self deport,” he said. “Now we’ll help things along a bit.”

“They are trying all they can to get folks out of the country,” Lelo said, “whether through deportation or asking folks to self deport.” Inside the Tacoma detention center, ICE agents took another tactic. “They went to my unit three times, saying that if people gave up their right to fight their case and self-deported, they’d send them $1,000 after sixty days. People got really mad because a lot have lived here for many years. We have families and we’re part of the community. What is $1,000 compared to twenty years of your life?”

Nevertheless, the constant pressure took its toll on his family, and eventually on Lelo himself. In early March his family decided to return to their hometown, Santa Cruz Yucucani. At that point, Lelo had not yet been detained. Later, as he languished inside, he described their reasons.

“It was a hard decision because my parents had lived in Washington for eighteen years,” he explained. “My siblings were born in the United States. They were going to school there. All their friends are there. But as we saw ICE begin to round up more and more folks, we did not want to put my family through the trauma of separation. So we decided they would leave, which they did on March 16 from Santa Maria, [California, a town from which many people leave to go back to Mexico] on the bus. It’s hard to describe the feeling. We always had this plan for my siblings to go to school and have a better life, more opportunity than my parents had. It was like we had to start all over again.”

Then, on March 25, as he was driving his compañera to work in the tulip fields of the Washington Bulb Company, in the Skagit Valley north of Seattle, he was stopped by immigration agents. When he asked for a warrant, they broke the car window and dragged him out. Within hours he was in the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, and in line for a flight back to Mexico. Only a wave of public outrage, including calls from U.S. Representative Rick Larson, Democrat of Washington, and Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, also a Democrat, kept him from being loaded onto a deportation plane.

Those protests acknowledged that Lelo’s arrest was not random. ICE later said he had been detained because of an earlier deportation order, but Lelo called the charge a pretext. “Before my detention, I had no idea that there was a removal order for me from 2017, under the first Trump Administration. If they’d really wanted to remove me, they could have, but they didn’t. They waited until Trump was President again to go after me. I was never given the opportunity to respond or fully defend myself. There was never any due process.”

Lelo was targeted because of his history as a farmworker organizer. He was a cofounder of Washington’s new union, Familias Unidas por la Justicia, and helped organize many of the campaigns by Community to Community, the state’s advocate for agricultural workers. One of these was for a cap on rents, and another for the Keep Washington Working Act to protect the rights of farmworkers.

But it was his public criticism of the H-2A contract labor program that earned Lelo the greatest hostility among growers. That program allows growers to recruit workers in Mexico for a season’s work, after which they must return. Workers are very vulnerable, and can be fired and blacklisted for organizing, or simply for failing to meet production quotas. Almost one-third of farmworkers in Washington state have now been replaced by contractors using the H-2A program.

“Growers like WAFLA [the Washington Farm Labor Association—a large labor contractor] know me very well,” he recalled, “and were very upset at our opposition to the H-2A program. I would talk to local workers about losing jobs because of it, and to the H-2A workers themselves when they called to report abuses. That made me a big target. But I don’t regret anything I’ve done. It was all supporting workers.”

In the end, however, months in detention took their toll. In mid-July Lelo decided to leave the country voluntarily. He and many others faced the same situation, worn down by the impact of dehumanizing conditions and hopelessness for any solution to their cases. “It’s very hard to bring legal cases from within this place,” he explained during our conversation while he was still in Tacoma. “There are many people here and they’re all losing [their cases] and getting deported. Two people even won their cases, and they’re going to be deported anyway. A lot of people here have legal status. They have good jobs. They’ve been paying taxes for many years. But at the end of their last hearing, they get removed from the country anyway.”

In that sense, Lelo’s case was no different. “Winning from within just doesn’t seem possible,” he said. “Even if I went through all the legal steps and had a decision in my favor, there is no guarantee I will be released after that. Signing the voluntary departure is the only option I have.”

At the end of the ordeal, however, Lelo found himself in Santa Cruz Yucucani, an Indigenous Mixtec community that he only remembered as a child, but which still remembered him. “I went to town a couple of days ago and people recognized me and invited me to eat,” he told me. “I’ve had a lot of really good food here. There are other families in Santa Cruz that have come back as well, and folks are excited that we’re back.”

Lelo’s family are farmers, and on his return he began going out to the fields with his father and grandfather, where they plant corn, green beans, pumpkins, and bananas. “My grandpa sells a little bit of it, but it’s mostly just for the family. We clean the fields and take care of the crops.”

As a union organizer of farmworkers in the United States who labor for wages in industrial agriculture, it has been a revelatory experience. “The big difference is that here we don’t work for anybody, because the fields belong to the family,” he says. “We can take a break whenever we want, and when it gets hot we just go find shade. It’s a huge change from being a farmworker working for a boss.”

But he doesn’t forget the union and the community from which he was taken by force. “I haven’t stopped feeling part of an immigrant community that’s trying to defend itself. As a farmworker it’s heartbreaking to see pictures of the military chasing us in the fields. We’ve never been able to legalize, and now we have to leave. It’s not right. People have to pay attention to what's happening and speak up. Don’t look the other way.”

In the meantime, though, Lelo simply has to live. “Tomorrow I’m going to the banana field. It’s going to be the first time in eighteen years,” he says.",https://progressive.org/downloads/22046/download/dnblelo01.jpg?cb=76b716b358ab76bf209f7b46abdb5b64&w=1200,N,,2025-08-11 10:56:47.386434

Kraft Heinz countered that Finley was terminated for dishonesty during an investigation into the botched firing of another employee, Yolanda Gaines.
The events of Kraft Heinz’s investigation should have been “considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with Finley’s evidence of contributing-factor causation,” the judge said.
“The district court believed that sorting through this dispute would require it to ‘speculate’ about what really happened,” the judge said.
Concluding that the District Court erred in awarding summary judgment to Kraft Heinz, the panel vacated that ruling and remanded the case.","A district court erroneously analyzed a whistleblower’s wrongful termination complaint using a but-for causation framework, rather than the more generous contributing factor standard under the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held.

Rather than consider all the evidence to determine whether a reasonable jury could side with the claimant, the district court granted summary judgment to the employer based on its explanation that the claimant was fired for dishonesty, not his protected activity.

Judge Pamela A. Harris said the District Court erred because the claimant’s conduct during the investigation “should be considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with [the claimant’s] evidence of contributing factor causation.”

“We hold only that a reasonable jury could infer from the record, considered as a whole, that something more than Finley’s alleged ‘dishonesty’ on March 24 contributed to his firing by Kraft Heinz, and that Finley’s increasingly urgent food safety complaints — culminating immediately before his termination — ‘affect[ed] his termination in at least some way,’” Harris wrote.

Judge Stephanie D. Thacker, as well as Judge Thomas T. Cullen, sitting by designation from the Western District of Virginia, joined Harris in vacating and remanding Finley v. Kraft Heinz Inc. (VLW 025-2-284).

Rare case

Stephani L. Ayers of T.M. Guyer and Ayers & Friends in Miami said this was “one of those rare cases” where co-workers were not afraid to support a whistleblower. “We had three co-workers who offered testimony about our client’s complaints, including a food safety manager,” she said.

When her client was fired, Ayers said the employer was in the process of installing X-rays to detect bone fragments. “But if you’re not using the machines correctly, then it’s just a signoff without proper validation,” she noted. “These issues occurred about every six months.”

In her practice representing whistleblowers, Ayers said that “from time-to-time, federal judges have tried to invoke the Title VII framework, maybe because they are more familiar with it. We have even seen it in litigation with the Department of Labor.”

“Whistleblower statutes are first administered by the Department of Labor, where you can have a hearing or remove the case to federal court, as we did here,” Ayers said. “This issue seemed appropriate for a federal court and compelling for a jury.”

“The district court adopted and muddled the magistrate judge’s causation language,” Ayers said, adding that “they don’t specialize in this type of law, so sometimes they get the standards a little fuzzy, and here the court said it was ‘a distinction with almost no difference.’”

The district court must now determine whether protected activity occurred. “I can’t imagine that the judge will say that our client did not raise a food safety issue,” Ayers said. “I think it’s a foregone conclusion that he’ll find protected activity and we’ll move to trial.”

Attorneys for Kraft Heinz did not respond to a request for comment.

The termination

As a production manager at a Kraft Heinz plant in South Carolina, Wilbert Finley was responsible for product quality and food safety of bacon and deli meat products. Finley began complaining about improperly sealed packages and the presence of large bone fragments.

Finley’s complaints increased in early 2020 and he stopped production to show managers the issues. According to Finley, Kraft Heinz disregarded his complaints and managers criticized him. Kraft Heinz suspended Finley 12 days after his last complaint and fired him two days later.

Finley sued Kraft Heinz for violating the FSMA by firing him after he raised food safety concerns. Kraft Heinz countered that Finley was terminated for dishonesty during an investigation into the botched firing of another employee, Yolanda Gaines.

Kraft Heinz argued that one of Finley’s subordinates, Bobby Clark, had been instructed to terminate Gaines. Although both Finley and Clark signed the termination form, nobody fired Gaines, who continued working until March 24, 2020. A human resources investigation ensued.

The events of that investigation were disputed. Kraft Heinz maintained that Finley’s inconsistent explanations led to his termination for dishonesty and lack of integrity, regardless of any prior protected activity.

Despite the “undoubtedly close temporal proximity” between Finley’s complaints and firing, a magistrate judge said the causal inference that his protected activity was a contributing factor to his termination was severed by the legitimate intervening event of his firing for dishonesty.

The district court agreed that Finley could not show that his complaints were a contributing factor to his termination. Further, the court disregarded Finley’s comparator and retaliation evidence because Kraft Heinz would have fired him for other reasons.

Finley appealed the court’s grant of summary judgment to Kraft Heinz.

‘Broad and forgiving’

The FSMA instructs courts “to review retaliation claims under a ‘contributing factor’ standard commonly used in whistleblower statutes,” Harris clarified, adding that the district court erroneously used the but-for causation framework from statutes like Title VII and the ADEA.

“This is a meaningful difference; as the Supreme Court has explained [in Murray v. UBS Sec., LLC], the contributing factor standard is more generous to employees and ‘not as protective of employers’ than causations standards under other statutes,” Harris pointed out.

Congress designed the contributing-factor for “‘contexts where the health, safety, or well-being of the public may well depend on whistleblowers feeling empowered to come forward,’” she explained.

Here, Finley needed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case that his protected activities tended to have any effect on Kraft Heinz’s decision to terminate him.

“‘This element is broad and forgiving,’ Harris wrote, looking to Feldman v. Law Enf’t Assocs. Corp. Finley “‘need not show that the activities were a primary or even a significant cause of his termination,’” she added.

“So long as his complaints ‘affect[ed] his termination in at least some way,’ he has made the necessary showing,” the judge said.

“At that point, the burden shifts to Kraft Heinz, which may nevertheless prevail if it can establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action and fired Finley even ‘in the absence of [his] protected activity,’” Harris noted.

Intervening event

Like any intervening event, Kraft Heinz’s investigation of the Gaines incident must be considered in the district court’s causation analysis.

“But an ‘intervening event’ is not a talisman that makes all other evidence of causation disappear, establishing conclusively that there can be no connection between protected activity and an adverse action,” Harris wrote.

The events of Kraft Heinz’s investigation should have been “considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with Finley’s evidence of contributing-factor causation,” the judge said.

Harris compared this case to Feldman, which held that “a ‘legitimate intervening event, coupled with the passage of a significant amount of time after [the] alleged protected activities, sever[ed] the causal connection.’”

“An intervening event may ‘undermin[e]’ the strength of an inference that otherwise would arise from temporal proximity,” the judge said. “But the question at summary judgment remains the same: In light of all the evidence, including the intervening event, could a reasonable jury conclude that Finley’s protected activity tended to affect his termination?”

Because Finley correctly objected that evidence supporting Kraft Heinz’s position did not negate his own evidence, the district court erred by not considering all the evidence to determine whether a reasonable jury could side with Finley.

Subtle distinction

Whether Clark was a valid comparator to Finley was genuinely disputed. Finley argued that he was disciplined more severely than others involved in the Gaines incident, leading to an inference that Kraft Heinz singled him out because of his prior safety complaints.

“The district court believed that sorting through this dispute would require it to ‘speculate’ about what really happened,” the judge said. “That is correct — and precisely why whether Clark is a valid comparator cannot be determined, on this record, as a matter of law.”

Harris also found genuine questions regarding the reason for Finley’s termination, as well as Finley’s role — if any — in the Gaines incident because evidence was in conflict about whether he intentionally lied or was merely inconsistent during the investigation.

The judge opined that the issue was not a matter of semantics, but rather a “subtle distinction.”

“[F]or a jury charged with determining the credibility of Kraft Heinz’s position that it would have fired Finley for his March 24 conduct — the difference between an intentional lie and an alleged inconsistency over the course of a day of meetings — could very well make a difference,” she pointed out.

A reasonable jury could infer that something more than Finley’s alleged dishonesty contributed to his firing, and that his increasingly urgent food safety complaints before his termination affected his termination in at least some way, the panel held.

“And for much the same reason, a jury could also doubt Kraft Heinz’s position that it would have taken the ‘same action’ – firing Finley, while leaving Clark undisciplined — even if Finley had never voiced a concern about food safety,” Harris wrote.

The large police presence had made many of them nervous, even if the authorities were not in town to pick up undocumented residents, she said.
In December of 1984, Ms. Salas and her daughter, Gloria Peña, 53, were living in the Hill Country, without legal authorization, when another flash flood hit.
Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña became legal residents under an immigration amnesty program by President Ronald Reagan.
“I understand their fear, because I was in their shoes,” Ms. Salas said.","Leo, a 14-year-old undocumented immigrant, had joined volunteers searching the banks of the Guadalupe River four days after the deadly Central Texas floods of July 4 when he slipped and fell into treacherous waters contaminated with corpses and debris. He emerged with flesh and finger bones exposed on a left hand that had been nearly severed.

For an excruciating hour, his parents were gripped by fear. What if the hospital staff asked for immigration documents? Finally, they broke down and brought him for care, the family said.

“They are going to take him away,” Gabriela, Leo’s 42-year-old mother, recalled thinking, as doctors wheeled her son away. Both asked to be identified only by their first names because of their immigration statuses.

Local, state and federal officials have said repeatedly that aid and medical assistance are flowing into Texas Hill Country in the wake of floods that killed at least 135 people and injured scores more.

But immigrant rights groups and religious volunteers in the region worry that undocumented residents in Central Texas, such as Leo and his family, are not getting what they need amid immigration crackdowns that have pressed a large migrant community underground. “A lot of people are afraid,” said Sonya De La Garza-Walker, a member of the League of United Latin American Citizens in San Antonio, a Latino civil rights organization that has assisted in the devastated areas. “They think that asking for help may call attention to themselves.”

Officials in Kerr County did not respond to requests for comment about the area’s undocumented community. The county, at the heart of the Texas Hill Country, suffered 108 known deaths, including at least 27 counselors and campers from Camp Mystic.

During a recent Texas legislative committee hearing that took place in Kerrville, the county seat, Auburne Gallagher, a witness, pleaded with legislators, “Did you account for the illegal population in our area?”

When the legislators failed to answer, she did. “No,” she said, “you did not.”

Ms. Gallagher, who lives in Leander, Texas, said in an interview on Thursday that, despite the criticism she received on social media about her views on illegal immigration, she believed that everyone deserved aid after a natural disaster.

“We’re all human beings. We’re all God’s children, whether we’re here legally or illegally,” Ms. Gallagher said. “Everybody should be treated humanely. If you need something, ask.”

It is difficult to measure the size of the undocumented population, much less the number of people who may be injured and unaided. The region, known for its rugged and wide-open spaces, is home to summer camps for children, vacation homes for the wealthy, and inns, camp sites and R.V. parks for the working class. It has grown more diverse in the last decade as the service economy has expanded.

Latinos, totaling 13,598 in the 2020 census, make up about 30 percent of the population of Kerr County, where they work in the camps, construction and agriculture.

“A lot of people would rather not leave their homes unless they have to,” he said.

In the aftermath of the Fourth of July floods, Teresa Salas, 70, said she rushed to a church for Spanish-speaking faithful in Comfort, Texas, to offer help to migrants, many of them undocumented, who were seeking a safe space. The large police presence had made many of them nervous, even if the authorities were not in town to pick up undocumented residents, she said.

In December of 1984, Ms. Salas and her daughter, Gloria Peña, 53, were living in the Hill Country, without legal authorization, when another flash flood hit. Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña escaped with their lives, but Juan Manuel Barraza, Ms. Salas’s husband and Ms. Peña’s father, was found dead, along with two of Ms. Salas’s daughters and Ms. Peña’s sisters, Beatriz and Erica, then just 3 and 2 years old.

Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña became legal residents under an immigration amnesty program by President Ronald Reagan. But they remember the trauma that others are reliving now.

“I understand their fear, because I was in their shoes,” Ms. Salas said. “All we can do is offer a lending hand. They don’t have a lot of places where they feel safe, and just like everybody else here they need help.”

The morning of July 8, she said her son was moved by the tragedy at Camp Mystic, where most of the deaths were concentrated in two cabins that housed the youngest campers, and joined a group of search-and-rescue volunteers along the Guadalupe River.

The once placid river where he and his two brothers liked to go swimming had been ravaged. Torn trees, appliances, debris and even corpses littered the banks. Then the boy tripped. Blood was dripping down his leg. He could see finger bones protruding through the skin of his mangled left hand.

“Maybe I was in shock, but at the time I did not feel pain,” he said.

At first, his parents thought they could treat him at home. Family members were aware that Gov. Greg Abbott signed an executive order last year requiring some hospitals to collect data on undocumented patients, part of a broader effort to curtail tax money going to residents living in the state illegally.

Patients are not required to answer the citizenship question, and hospital officials have said they cannot turn away patients if they can’t present legal documents.

“Yes, I was afraid,” Gabriela said. “But I was more afraid that he may get sicker here at home and even something worse, a bad infection and even death.”

At a local clinic, medical staff told them that they could not do much for him other than to clean his hand and wrap it with bandages. They loaded into the family truck and drove an hour east to an emergency room in San Antonio where they were told that the teenager needed emergency surgery.

Leo, seeing his parent’s worried expressions, pulled on his mother’s sleeve and told her they could go home. “No,” she said. “We are saving your hand.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/07/multimedia/00NAT-TEXASFLOODS-UNDOCUMENTED-2-tlbv/00NAT-TEXASFLOODS-UNDOCUMENTED-2-tlbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 10:56:50.172297

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.
The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.","WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House's border security and mass deportation agenda.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,"" they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated"" through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves ""inward.""

The flood of cash comes when Americans' views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump's approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul's proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fd79992-6f9a-4731-91bb-c590d104b962/wirestory_a2c6a2f726629e62bd0199aee68294f6_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-11 11:56:47.163081

Annual Meeting

ABA House will tackle issues, including law firm intimidation, immigration at Toronto session

The American Bar Association’s policy making body, the House of Delegates, will consider almost 60 policy matters, including one on law firm intimidation, several on immigration enforcement and detention and resolutions on academic freedom and open, civil debate at universities when it meets today and Tuesday during the 2025 ABA Annual Meeting in Toronto.

Resolutions are not ABA policy until they are voted on and passed by the House of Delegates.

Resolution 509 opposes government action punishing or threatening lawyers, law firms or other organizations for representation of clients or causes disfavored by the government.

Other proposals addressing democracy in America include Resolution 512 which reaffirms the ABA’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting civil rights and urges all levels of government to ensure that laws are enacted and enforced consistently with constitutional principles; preserve judicial independence; safeguard the rights of vulnerable communities; and promote civic education. Another resolution, 511, opposes the dismantling or defunding, in whole or in part, of any federal agency or independent agency created by legislation or halting any of such an agency’s statutory functions, in the absence of legislation expressly authorizing such measures.

Follow along with the ABA Journal’s coverage of the 2025 ABA Annual Meeting here.

Immigration enforcement and detention policies also will be debated. Resolution 510 urges the executive branch and Congress to adopt policies and enact legislation that ensures due process protections, including meaningful notice, opportunity to be heard and access to legal counsel, in all proceedings involving denial of entry, visa revocation, rescission of lawful permanent residency or removal from the United States, including those based upon alleged security or criminal concerns.

Resolution 602 urges Congress and the Department of Homeland Security to prohibit immigration enforcement operations in or around sensitive locations (e.g., such as hospitals, schools, houses of worship, demonstrations and public safety agencies) except for where exigent circumstances exist. Another resolution, 603, urges the executive branch to adopt policies and Congress to enact laws that prohibit detention of immigrants in Department of Defense facilities, such as the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, and implement procedures for immigrant detention that give full consideration to the protection of immigrant detainee rights pursuant to the U.S. Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Resolutions related to education also will be considered. Resolution 504 urges law schools to actively promote environments where civil discourse can thrive, particularly through student debate unions and forums that serve as essential spaces for free expression, reasoned discussion and the exchange of diverse perspectives on contentious issues.

Resolution 513 supports the academic freedom of American universities, colleges and law schools and opposes governmental efforts to impose the government’s viewpoint with respect to the academic qualifications of students or faculty or the content of curricula or specific courses. Another resolution, 505, urges law schools to adopt clear, specific and transparent policies governing the use of generative artificial intelligence tools by students.

Other resolutions of note to be debated at the meeting include:

• Resolution 518: Opposing the adoption of civil or criminal laws that impose criminal and civil penalties or rights deprivations based on an individual’s conduct during pregnancy or its outcome.

• Resolution 522: Urging Congress to pass H.R. 154, or similar legislation, to establish a federal Election Day in every even-numbered year as a federal public holiday.

• Resolution 605: Urging states and courts to study community justice worker programs successfully implemented in several U.S. jurisdictions and to adopt such programs appropriate for their jurisdiction to expand the accessibility, affordability and quality of civil legal services provided to those who cannot afford an attorney, while continuing to protect clients and the public.

• Resolution 607: Opposing the enactment and enforcement of, and supporting the repeal of, laws, policies and practices by authorities that punish persons experiencing homelessness and/or poverty.

ABA President Bill Bay, ABA President-elect Michelle Behnke and ABA Executive Director Alpha Brady are scheduled to deliver remarks. Behnke will become ABA president at the close of the HOD meeting on Tuesday. Jonathan Cole, chair of the House of Delegates, will preside over the two-day meeting.

The presentation of colors at the meeting Monday will feature members of the Fort York Guard as a testament to the bonds between the United States and Canada. Fort York, founded in 1793, played an important role in the development of Toronto into the world-class city it is today.

The yearly meeting opened in Toronto on Wednesday. The policymaking House encompasses nearly 600 delegates from ABA entities and state, local and specialty bar associations.

HOD proposals do not become ABA policy until approved by the House, which meets twice annually. The next HOD meeting will be held during the ABA Midyear Meeting, Feb. 3-9, 2026, in San Antonio, Texas.

Editor: Immigration reform. Two words that have been a long time coming and something I believe our country needs. However, this administration hides behind — as they do every policy — lies and deceit.

What this administration is doing is not immigration reform nor are they rounding up criminal and violent offenders. Just exactly what did the 4-year-old and her grandmother do that ICE had to pick them up?

Reports coming out of the prison camp in Florida describe unthinkable human rights violations such as lack of food, maggots in meals, prisoners made to kneel on the floor and eat like dogs. And even worse conditions in the prison in El Salvador.

This Is not what our country is about. I am all for immigration reform but instead of locking up someone who is here illegally maybe we should show them a path to citizenship. Many of the people picked up by ICE are hardworking, taxpaying immigrants who just want a better life. Isn’t that how we all got here? (exception for Native Americans and American Indians who were here first). So really aren’t we all immigrants or descended from immigrants?

Our ancestors wanted better for their families than they had. And so do the many people coming here. Why not put policies in place that will do just that instead of rounding up people who don’t look like they belong.

It’s a shame what this country has become.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streetsand from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House’s border security and mass deportation agenda.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta say yes. Trump’s Department of Justice says no. The three-day trial to answer this question is scheduled to commence today at 10 a.m. in a California federal district court, with implications for the country as Trump continues to signal a desire to deploy troops to patrol domestic city streets.

The president has appointed himself chair of a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that “we’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?”

Relatedly, the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5, California lawyers told the court in a filing. That came two weeks after the Marines deployed to Los Angeles left and a week after the Trump administration demobilized most of the National Guard.

California’s lawyers assert evidence in their briefs, often redacted because of a court order, that the military took part in law enforcement in violation of 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. They want a judge to order the Trump administration to permanently halt those actions. The Trump Department of Justice counters that those engagements don’t count as law enforcement, but rather fall under the category of supporting immigration law enforcement agents or protecting federal buildings.

Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would allow the military to engage in law enforcement activity.

How did we get here?

This trial is an extension of the June lawsuit that Newsom filed against Trump after the president took over California’s National Guard. Trump did that in response to protests that broke out in the Los Angeles area after immigration law enforcement agents began workforce raids to apprehend individuals allegedly in the U.S. without proper authorization.

Ultimately, about 4,000 troops from the California National Guard and 700 U.S. Marines were deployed to Los Angeles.

That month marked a new nadir in the relations between Newsom and Trump. The governor likened the president to failed dictators. Trump endorsed the idea of arresting Newsom.

Charles Breyer, the judge in Monday’s case and oversaw the June hearings, initially sided with Newsom, ordering that Trump return the National Guard to the governor. A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that move. They found that the Trump administration legitimately called up troops to protect federal buildings and federal employees from some protesters who tossed chunks of concrete and used trash dumpsters as battering rams. California lawyers said the troops’ presence inflamed the protests.

The June protests lasted about a week and were largely isolated to a handful of city blocks in the downtown area; Los Angeles is roughly 500 square miles.

Breyer then allowed California’s lawyers to depose Trump officials and gather documents to argue California’s case that the Trump administration was violating the law barring the military from acting as a police force. Trump’s Department of Justice lawyers tried to cancel the trial but failed.

What is California’s latest allegation?

That Los Angeles residents were “subjected to a form of military occupation” as federal troops worked alongside federal immigration agents, “often indistinguishable from each other.”

The lawyers say that “never before, in the history of the Nation, has the federal government utilized the military for domestic law enforcement in this manner.”

The Trump administration’s “insistence that perimeters, blockades, and other security functions are permissible makes clear they will continue to engage in these activities,” California lawyers with the state attorney general’s office wrote to Breyer.

The lawyers argued that if military forces can accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their raids and arrests, as had been unfolding in Los Angeles, “there would be no logical basis to preclude members of the Armed Forces from accompanying other law enforcement agents when performing their duties,” the California lawyers wrote. Military personnel could accompany federal food safety inspectors, medical fraud investigators or accompany federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places, they wrote.

What are California’s examples of the military acting as police?

Attorneys representing the state pointed to several instances in which they allege troops went too far and violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian settings:

California attorneys deposed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director who said National Guard soldiers accompanied immigration officers on as many as 75% of their missions.

Troops accompanied a federal agency during a “law enforcement operation” at a cannabis facility in Riverside County and formed a security perimeter that prevented people from leaving the site.

Troops allegedly formed security perimeters on July 7 during a demonstration at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles during raids at cannabis farms in Ventura County.

In two incidents, military service members detained civilians, the California lawyers wrote. One took place in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, where National Guard troops allegedly “apprehended” a protester. In the other, a Marine on June 13 allegedly detained someone at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.

California attorneys collected testimony from the deputy chief of staff of the military unit in Los Angeles who said the National Guard is subject to Posse Comitatus and cannot engage in civilian law enforcement.

The attorneys point to military-issued guidance that “directly providing ‘security functions’ for civilian law enforcement agents is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” per their summary. But, the lawyers note, the military unit in L.A. was ordered to “actively provide security during civil law enforcement operations on a near-continuous basis since the deployment began,” the California lawyers wrote.

How does the federal government respond?

The federal government says California is wrong for four reasons. Some are disputes over technical court procedure and some disputing the facts California’s legal team is presenting.

Federal lawyers wrote that Posse Comitatus is a criminal statute, which cannot be used in a civil case, and the lawsuit is civil, not criminal.

They dispute that the president or the Department of Defense exceeded its authority in ordering the troops to assist federal immigration law enforcement in apprehensions. “As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the (Posse Comitatus Act) does not prohibit the President from using troops to protect federal personnel and property,” the Trump administration lawyers wrote.

The federal lawyers also say California has no standing to sue. (California’s attorneys dispute this.)

Fourth, the lawyers say that the National Guard can act as a police force because the law Trump cited to federalize them permits the National Guard to “execute the laws of the United States” if the president is unable to do that with “regular forces,” which at minimum means enforcing “federal immigration laws as well as laws forbidding interference with federal functions or assaults on federal officers and property,” the federal lawyers wrote.

The lawyers also dispute that the military’s role counts as law enforcement. California’s lawyers say the Marines “briefly detained” a protester. But the federal lawyers wrote that action “was in protection of federal property (the individual had attempted to enter a restricted area on federal property multiple times) and the Marines turned that individual over to the LAPD minutes later.”

And providing a perimeter for federal immigration law enforcement also doesn’t violate Posse Comitatus, because, as a previous federal court found, “Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to federal troops playing ‘a passive role in civilian enforcement activities,’” the federal lawyers wrote.

What is likely to happen after this trial?

How Breyer will rule is impossible to forecast. He sided with California already only to have a three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals block his orders.

Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law. The Department of Homeland Security has that role through its various agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

Those agencies were temporarily blocked by a lower district court judge from making apprehensions in Southern California based on race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment.

San Quentin hosts first-ever Fiesta de San Salvador.

Event celebrates Centro-American and Salvadoran heritage.

San Quentin’s rehabilitation efforts face challenges from harsh immigration policies.

SAN QUENTIN, Calif. — On Friday, the San Quentin Rehabilitation Center hosted its first-ever Fiesta de San Salvador, a celebration of Centro-American and Salvadoran heritage that blended music, indigenous dance and traditional food with a sobering dialogue about rehabilitation, immigration policy and the threat of deportation for many in the prison’s immigrant population.

The event, organized by the San Quentin News, honored El Rey del Mundo, or the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ — a date of deep cultural and religious significance in El Salvador. For the incarcerated Salvadoran community, it was an important opportunity to publicly share their traditions with the broader San Quentin population and visiting guests.

Warden Chance Andes opened the day with a message about inclusion. “I’m honored to share your holiday with you today,” he said.

“We share a day of culture in rehabilitation for all, and that’s really what it’s about. I don’t think anybody does it better than San Quentin. I look in the room and I see the diversity in the room. I see the support from other cultures and it’s truly amazing.”

Andes contrasted San Quentin with other prisons where cultural programming is scarce.

“We believe equal opportunity for all cultures to have the experience of rehabilitation. Our goal is when you go back to your society, regardless of what country you go to, you can truly be rehabilitated and be a contributing member of society.”

Julio Escobar, who works for the Archdiocese of San Francisco, told the audience that restorative justice is something you have to live, not just read about. His ministry began in 1995 with direct outreach to gang members on the streets of San Francisco. By 1999, his team was meeting Norteño members at parks in the Mission District, bringing backpacks of burritos and sodas to build connections.

The work was about “transformational of the heart,” he said, because while they could not offer housing or jobs, they could offer relationships, compassion and consistency. That meant meeting the same people later in juvenile hall, accompanying their families in court, and standing with them at vigils and funerals.

“That’s what it took to do restorative justice practices, not from a book,” Escobar said.

He introduced Esperanza Navas, whose only son was shot and killed in 1999. Through a translator, Navas recounted how her son had joined a gang for protection after arriving in the United States, but later sought help to leave that life.

She said he began advising friends to choose a better path, and his humility and sincerity inspired others — including her — to change. After his death, she committed herself to preventing other young men from going down the same road.

She told the crowd she had replaced hatred with love, “not because of my grace, but the grace of God.” Escobar praised her as a “true example of restorative justice” for returning to work inside jails to encourage transformation, despite the personal pain she carried.

The day’s panel discussion, moderated by journalist and San Quentin resident Juan Moreno Haines, moved quickly to a central concern: what happens to rehabilitated residents who, upon being found suitable for parole, are turned over to federal immigration authorities and deported to countries where they face indefinite detention or worse.

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whose father is Salvadoran, has spent the last two years visiting San Quentin for regular symposiums with residents. She described how those visits have reshaped her thinking.

“During the prosecution process, what we see is a case file. We don’t get to know the individual behind the case,” she said. “This gives us the ability to come in and try to understand the failures in the system that led to your incarceration… What can we do to be more proactive to prevent crime rather than be reactive once somebody has committed the crime?”

On the immigration issue, Jenkins was unequivocal about her discomfort with adding punitive measures after a sentence is complete.

“When somebody has done their time, they have paid for the crime that they committed, the fact that tacking on then another collateral consequence and what that means for their lives… we have to be able to have those conversations with our elected officials and demand that government look at the fairness in the equation,” she said.

“It is unfair that somebody has to make a choice between saying, I will skip my parole hearing so that I stay here versus be judged in a system that right now has removed due process and be re-incarcerated for something I’ve already been determined to have served my time for.”

Edwin Chavez, a San Quentin resident, who organized the event, provided one of the day’s most personal and harrowing accounts. Chavez explained that his brother, Gabriel V. Chavez, came to the United States from El Salvador at age 9, lived as an undocumented immigrant and was incarcerated at 16 for a gang-related murder.

He served 32 years in a California prison before being transferred to an ICE detention facility for two more years. Upon deportation to El Salvador — a country he had not seen in more than four decades — Gabriel was immediately arrested and imprisoned solely for having tattoos.

“My brother was able to rehabilitate himself in an environment that is not conducive to change — a Level 4 prison,” Chavez said. “To hear your own mother say, ‘They just killed my son’ was one of the hardest things to process. I didn’t have the right words to console her. She can’t hear his voice over the phone, see him or even correspond with him, so she doesn’t know if he’s alive.”

Chavez, who has also committed himself to personal reform at San Quentin, said the situation makes him question his own future. “Yes, we committed crimes, but in the course of that comes the journey of rehabilitation and reform,” he said. “I believe in change. My crime does not define who I am. But I think it is wrong that, just because of the way I look, I should be sent into a black hole. If I take my shirt off right now, maybe some guys might be scared because of my tattoos. But you don’t know what I’ve done as far as rehabilitation and transformation.”

He added that Salvadoran policy under President Nayib Bukele makes deportation a near-certain path to imprisonment for those with any past gang affiliation or visible tattoos, regardless of current conduct.

“Foreign countries should be looking into what we do at San Quentin,” Chavez said. “San Quentin is a unique place. Here, we have the opportunity to transform and give back. Why send us to a place where none of that matters?”

Arturo Menendez, who works in San Quentin’s Catholic Chapel, told the panel that even after years of personal transformation, his future could still end in a Salvadoran prison. “Here, not only was change possible for me, they allow me to do things within the community to help others change. But if the board finds me suitable, I have to worry about being deported to El Salvador and locked up again for old affiliations. That’s my concern.”

Jenkins said the choice faced by people like Menendez and Chavez — between remaining incarcerated in a rehabilitative environment or facing near-certain re-imprisonment abroad — is one California must address.

“We as a state have to figure out what is our answer to this particular problem, particularly for people from El Salvador who are facing what they’re facing right now,” she said. “That might require some extreme level of work on our parts or decisions on our parts that we wouldn’t ordinarily make, but it’s something that needs to be discussed. What are all the mechanisms that we have to protect against this particular issue?”

The conversation drew in community voices.

Alex Sanchez, executive director of Homies Unidos, said he had been deported to El Salvador and later returned after winning political asylum.

“There are ways in which people are fighting those cases of immigration through what’s called a convention against torture,” Sanchez said. “But we have an administration right now that’s coming after all of us. I have a green card. I’m not a U.S. citizen, and I’m afraid to apply now for citizenship.”

Chief Deputy Warden Rosa Rosalez, the first Latina to hold the role at San Quentin, said she would welcome proposals aimed at preventing deportations that undo the work of rehabilitation.

“As an individual, I can wholeheartedly say that I would support it,” she said. “As an employee of the department, you can present me any proposal and I will do my very best to make sure that the highest levels of this department review it for consideration.”

By the end of the day, the Fiesta de San Salvador had accomplished more than cultural celebration.

It had created a forum where a prison warden, a big-city district attorney, community advocates and incarcerated residents spoke openly about the human cost of current immigration policy.

Other highlights included a performance by El Unico Elemento as well as the SQRC Aztec Dancers.

For Jenkins, the message was clear: completing a sentence should mean just that. “If somebody has done their time, it has paid their penance for what they have done, we respect that and allow them to continue on to live their lives accordingly,” she said. “We cannot support a system that piles on consequences that strip away any chance at rebuilding a life.”

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning a meeting this Friday in Alaska to discuss the future of the war in Ukraine. The news follows U.S. Vice President Vance meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Saturday in England, at the request of the United States, with the pair joined by Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers. Later Saturday, several European leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming support for Ukraine and insisting Kyiv must be involved in any peace negotiations. Jonathan Beale, Cachella Smith, and Amy Walker report for BBC News.

Ukraine and Europe have countered Russia’s ceasefire plan by offering their own blueprint for ending the war. Moscow’s proposal was put forward in a meeting with senior U.S. officials in England on Saturday, and included the trade of Ukrainian-held parts of the Donetsk region for a ceasefire. A European participant in the talks said Washington reacted positively to the European plan, which includes demands that a ceasefire take place before any other steps are taken and that any territorial concessions must be reciprocal. Bojan Pancevski and Yaroslav Trofimov report for the Wall Street Journal.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday defended his government’s plan to take control of Gaza City, despite widespread opposition and criticism from both longtime allies and domestic opponents. At a news conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu announced that the Israeli military would expand its campaign to include central Gaza in addition to Gaza City. Netanyahu told reporters, “Dismantling the two remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza City and the central camps — this is the best way to end the war.” Isabel Kershner and Aaron Boxerman report for the New York Times.

Five Al Jazeera journalists were killed in a targeted Israeli strike near Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital yesterday. The IDF confirmed the strike had targeted prominent reporter Anas al-Sharif, who they said had “served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas.” The IDF also said he had “advanced rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops” and claimed to have Hamas documents that showed he had been a member of one of the group’s units in 2019. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Israel has not provided evidence to support its allegations and called the attack “a targeted assassination.” Amy Walker and Tiffany Wertheimer report for BBC News; CNN reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, U.N. ambassadors criticized Israel’s plan to “take control” of Gaza City, with the UK, France, and others warning the plan risked “violating international humanitarian law.” China called it “collective punishment” of people in Gaza, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities.” In response, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused fellow Security Council members of “actively prolonging the war by spreading lies about Israel” and “handing propaganda victories to terrorists.” Amy Walker reports for BBC News; Tal Shalev, Dana Karni, Abeer Salman, Catherine Nicholls, Mohammed Tawfeeq, and Helen Regan report for CNN.

Australia will recognize a Palestinian state at next month’s U.N. General Assembly, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said today. Separately, New Zealand is considering recognizing a Palestinian state, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today, adding that the cabinet would make a formal decision by next month. Kirsty Needham, Lucy Craymer and Christine Chen report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Trump spoke with Netanyahu yesterday, where both leaders discussed Israel’s plans for taking control of Gaza and efforts to secure a hostage release. Tyler Pager reports for the New York Times.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday. The meeting focused on a plan to end the war in Gaza and release all remaining hostages held by Hamas, sources told Axios. The meeting followed Israel’s minister for strategic affairs informing an Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Thursday that Washington will present an “End Game” proposal for the war in Gaza in the coming weeks, according to a cabinet minister. Barak Ravid reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

A senior official from the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will travel to Iran for talks today, although no visits to the nuclear site are planned, Iran’s foreign minister announced yesterday. Inspectors from the IAEA have been unable to access Iran’s nuclear facilities since Israel launched its first military strikes on the sites during a 12-day war in June. Iran has accused the agency of effectively facilitating the bombings by releasing a critical report in May, which led to the IAEA’s 35-nation board of governors declaring Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations. Reuters reports.

British police arrested 466 people in Central London on Saturday for protesting against the government’s decision to ban the pro-Palestinian activist group, Palestine Action. The UK-based group was proscribed under anti-terrorism laws last month, making it illegal to be a member or support it. Caitlin Danaher reports for CNN.

The Taliban are investigating explicit death threats against dozens of Afghan women working for the U.N., according to a report released yesterday. The report, by the U.N. mission to the country, said the threats came from unidentified individuals and related to their work with the U.N. The Taliban told the U.N. mission that its personnel were not responsible for the threats, the report added. AP News reports.

North Korea has removed some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, South Korea’s military said Saturday, days after Seoul dismantled its own front-line speakers used for propaganda broadcasts in a bid to diffuse tensions with Pyongyang. Kim Yong-Hyung reports for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

President Trump has signed a secret directive instructing the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels that his administration has designated as terrorist organizations, sources say. In response to the report, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said, “The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military … We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out.” Helen Cooper, Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times; Nadine Yousif reports.

Jordan will host a meeting with U.S. and Syrian officials tomorrow to discuss support for rebuilding Damascus, following more than a decade of conflict and December’s removal of former leader Bashar al-Assad by an Islamist-led rebellion. Reuters reports.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The battle over Texas’s congressional map “could literally last years,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said yesterday, while defending his call to arrest the Texas Democrats who left the state in a bid to stall the Republican redistricting efforts. His comments follow the Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton (R) asking the state’s high court Friday to expel 13 of the over 50 Democrats from office who left the state, arguing that they had made “incriminating public statements regarding their refusal to return” to the Texas Capitol. Meanwhile, Rep. Gene Wu, the leader of the Texas Democratic caucus, argued in court papers filed on Friday that Abbott’s proposal to oust the legislators would violate the Texas constitution. Mariana Alfaro and Hannah Knowles report for the Washington Post; Patrick Marley; Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, and Molly Hennessy-Fiske report for the Washington Post; Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The $1 billion settlement offer by the Trump administration for UCLA is “political extortion,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said yesterday. The university says it is reviewing the offer after the government froze $584 million in funding over alleged antisemitism during campus pro-Palestinian protests. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters.

Far-right political activist Laura Loomer has launched a striking new criticism of the Pentagon, targeting Army Secretary Dan Discroll for permitting the Army to honor Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg. Groberg, who suffered severe injuries while saving fellow soldiers from a suicide bomber in Afghanistan, was undeserving of such recognition because he delivered private remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and was not “US born,” Loomer implied in her remarks on social media. Dan Lamothe and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

CEO Lip-Bu Tan is slated to visit the White House today, days after Trump called for his removal over alleged ties to Chinese businesses, sources say. Tan is reportedly planning a wide-ranging discussion with Trump to outline his personal and professional background, including emphasizing his commitment to the United States, framing Intel’s manufacturing capabilities as a national security matter, and possibly proposing ways to collaborate with the U.S. government. Lauren Thomas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from selling AI chips to China as part of an unusual financial agreement with the Trump administration. Tripp Mickle reports for the New York Times.

IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Federal immigration authorities detained a woman seeking treatment at the National Institutes of Health’s main research hospital, according to an internal document and an NIH official briefed on the incident. The patient, who previously received care at an NIH center in Maryland, was stopped at a security checkpoint when her state-issued driver’s license failed to comply with new federal security ID requirements. A subsequent warrant check revealed an active order for her removal, prompting NIH officials to notify ICE. Carolyn Y. Johnson, David Ovalle, and Sabrina Malhi report for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The FBI has started sending agents on overnight shifts to assist local law enforcement in preventing carjackings and violent crime in Washington, as Trump continues his threats of a federal takeover of the city and weighs deploying the National Guard. A decision on the Guard deployment could come as soon as today, when Trump is scheduled to hold a White House news conference on D.C. crime, according to a U.S. official. Yesterday, Trump compared his planned crackdown on crime in D.C. to his aggressive immigration enforcement at the southern border, promising to “immediately clear out the city’s homeless population and take swift action against crime.” Perry Stein, Olivia George, Ellen Nakashima, and Dan Lamothe report for the Washington Post.

FBI Director Kash Patel removed another group of agents who had been involved in investigations against the president and his allies. Patel and his deputy have also recently required agents to undergo polygraph tests to determine whether they had leaked negative information about FBI leadership, sources say. Patel has also recently fired, demoted, or reassigned dozens of employees tied to work criticized by Republicans. Sadie Gurman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Hours before IRS Commissioner Billy Long was forced out by Trump administration officials on Friday, the Internal Revenue Service clashed with the White House over using tax data to track and locate suspected undocumented migrants, sources say. Following Long’s departure, Treasury Security Scott Bessent will step in as the agency’s acting head. Jacob Bogage and Kadia Goba report for the Washington Post; Avery Lotz reports for Axios.

Less than two weeks after being removed at the White House’s direction, a senior Food and Drug Administration official is being reinstated, a health agency spokesperson said Saturday. Vinay Prasad will return as head of the senior regulator overseeing vaccines and complex treatments for disease, a role he lost following a right-wing pressure campaign. Lauren Weber and Rachel Rouebein report for the Washington Post.

Trump is preparing to tap David Rosner to be chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a decision that would put a Democrat at the head of an agency central to Trump’s agenda on pushing U.S. oil, gas, and coal, according to a White House official. Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Nuareen S. Malik report for Bloomberg Law.

Trump on Saturday said he was nominating Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for the State Department and longtime political commentator at Fox News, as the next deputy representative of the United States to the U.N. Ashley Ahn reports for the New York Times.

The Trump administration on Friday threatened to seize hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of patents from Harvard University, accusing the college of failing to comply with the law on federal research grants. Liam Knox and Hadriana Lowenkron report for Bloomberg Law.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

In a 2-1 decision Friday, a federal appeals court quashed Judge Boasberg’s effort to pursue criminal contempt proceedings for administration officials who he says defied his orders in March by deporting 130 Venezuelan men to an El Salvador prison. Referencing Trump-appointed Judges Gregory G. Katsas and Neomi Rao, Obama-appointed Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard wrote in dissent, “The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his efforts to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.” Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO; Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A federal appeals court on Saturday unanimously rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to conceal a public database of federal spending, a resource that researchers say is key to holding the administration accountable to Congress’s control over the budget. Two of the three appeals judges said the effort was an affront to Congress’s authority over spending, with the court granting a Friday deadline for the administration to put the data back online. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

The trial will begin today on whether the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated federal law. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to restore control of the remaining Guard troops to the state and to stop the federal government’s deployment of military forces in California. Janie Har and Olga R. Rodriguez report for AP News.

The Democracy Forward Foundation filed a lawsuit on Friday, asking a federal judge to expedite its Freedom of Information Act requests, which seek records the Justice Department and FBI have produced on Epstein in recent months. The group is also requesting documents prepared for Attorney General Pam Bondi, including briefing materials she used ahead of a May meeting with Trump, during which Bondi reportedly told the president his name appeared in the Epstein files. Zach Schonfeld reports for The Hill.

Adding AI tools that can quickly generate legal research or draft portions of decisions could dramatically accelerate and automate key parts of the adjudication process.
The challenge ahead is ensuring that any integration of AI tools serves the cause of equality and justice rather than simply the goal of efficiency.","The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency that runs the immigration courts, quietly released a policy memo last week that should have everyone who is concerned about the role of AI in the immigration system paying attention.

Although the memo does not contain any revelations on its surface, when taken together with recent research on the use of AI in immigration systems and the White House’s recent announcement encouraging AI adoption across the government, the memo does serve as a starting point for what is sure to be a long and controversial debate over how AI might be weaponized against immigrants facing deportation—especially those seeking asylum.

In this post, I discuss the contents of the memo and connect it to recent research on the use of AI in immigration enforcement systems around the world. Special thanks to Dan Kowalski for bringing this memo to my attention.

I Believe in This Work

The Memo: “Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in EOIR Proceedings”

Acting EOIR Director Sirce Owen takes a surprisingly procedural and balanced approach in the memo titled ""Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in EOIR Proceedings""—at least compared to her more sensationalistic memos. The memo echoes Chief Justice John Roberts' observation that ""AI has great potential to dramatically increase access to key information for lawyers and non-lawyers alike.”

This development is consistent with my previous research on artificial intelligence versus authentic insight, which found considerable uncertainty and anxiety in the legal field about the role AI might play. The rush toward technological solutions often conflicts with the careful, nuanced thinking that complex legal problems require—especially in immigration cases where lives hang in the balance.

Owen establishes that the EOIR has ""neither a blanket prohibition on the use of generative AI in its proceedings nor a mandatory disclosure requirement regarding its use""—meaning there's no formal rule stopping anyone from using AI tools in immigration court filings or decisions. Instead, the memo points to existing guidance on professional ethics, thereby subsuming questions of generative AI under existing frameworks. This follows a fairly predictable teleology of how law and policy typically address new technologies: ignore (which they’ve done for a few years), subsume (use existing law to cover novel technology), then, hopefully, adapt (create new laws to handle new technology).

Mirroring concerns from most professors returning to the classroom for the fall, the EOIR memo spends considerable time warning about the risks of hallucinated legal citations and false information generated by AI tools—an entirely reasonable concern, in my view. It makes clear that attorneys who submit AI-generated content with fake case citations or erroneous information will face professional discipline, potentially including sanctions for ""knowingly or with reckless disregard offering false evidence."" The memo also admonishes that “EOIR adjudicators should also be vigilant to ensure that decisions are not based on hallucinated or inaccurate case citations and information and that attorneys are not submitting pleadings with false information or non-existent legal citations.”

All well and good. But we should not allow the otherwise perfunctory memo to lull us into complacency about how AI is already being leveraged in immigration systems around the world and will likely be increasingly incorporated into institutions here in the United States.

The memo cites the White House’s announcement in April that calls on all parts of government to accelerate the adoption of AI. That memo states: “Agencies are encouraged to harness solutions that bring the best value to taxpayers, increase quality of public services, and enhance government efficiency.” While I am not principally opposed to the government adopting AI or other technologies, we know what this language means when applied to immigration: use AI to reject, deny, and deport faster.

Thus, while the memo does appropriately encourage cautious adoption, we should be clear-eyed about the real implications of AI adoption on due process and substantive outcomes for immigrants facing deportation in court.

Foreshadowing Bigger Changes

As I said, while this memo appears procedural on its surface, it foreshadows significant policy changes down the line and possibly new systems of automated exclusion that we have seen elsewhere in the world.

I have written a lot about the use of smartphone apps like CBP One (and now CBP Home) and SmartLINK, which represent forms of digital capture of migrants’ smartphones. Others, like David Hausman, have written about ICE’s use of risk assessment algorithms to shape decisions about whether immigrants should be detained or released.

These developments reflect a broader trend documented by researchers and policy analysts. A recent report by the American Immigration Council revealed that DHS already operates 105 active AI use cases across major immigration agencies, with 27 classified as ""rights-impacting."" Legal analysis shows how AI is transforming immigration enforcement and creating new compliance challenges for immigration law practice.

The EOIR memo comes at a time when AI and automated systems are already being integrated into immigration systems across multiple countries. The United States is behind other countries in the adoption of AI. International research paints an even broader picture:

A landmark 2020 study by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto found extensive use of automated decision-making tools in Canada's refugee system, raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

A recent report from the Council of Europe calls for prohibiting AI tools like automated credibility assessments in asylum cases, while policy research warns that asylum seekers' interactions with AI will serve as a ""test case"" for emerging AI governance.

Studies of asylum systems have raised particular concerns about AI systems perpetuating bias and creating ""black-box"" decision-making processes that lack transparency and accountability.

A recent study by Iazzolino (2025) explores how AI-driven migrant screening systems create fundamental trade-offs between efficiency and human rights protections.

Taken together, these studies consistently highlight the tension between efficiency gains and fundamental rights protections that the EOIR memo signals could be coming to US immigration courts.

The Power Dynamics Problem

What we learn from this research—and what concerns me most—is what the memo doesn't say about how power relations within the legal field might shape AI adoption. While the memo doesn't suggest this explicitly, it's not hard to imagine scenarios where immigration judges and asylum adjudicators use AI tools to speed up case rejections—potentially avoiding consequences for irresponsible AI use—while immigration attorneys who use AI face harsher professional consequences or future prohibitions.

Immigration judges are already under enormous pressure to move cases quickly through a system with 3.5 million pending cases. The average judge handles hundreds of cases, often with minimal support staff. As I discussed recently, asylum cases are being denied at record rates and likely at record speeds, too. Adding AI tools that can quickly generate legal research or draft portions of decisions could dramatically accelerate and automate key parts of the adjudication process.

An Early Warning

AI in immigration courts isn't a question of if—it's a question of how and when. This memo represents an early attempt to establish professional norms before the technology becomes ubiquitous, but it also serves as an early warning that the immigration system we know today may look very different in the near future.

The challenge ahead is ensuring that any integration of AI tools serves the cause of equality and justice rather than simply the goal of efficiency. Given the life-or-death stakes of many immigration cases, getting this balance right isn't just a matter of professional best practices—it's also a matter of fundamental fairness. Immigration attorneys, advocates, and anyone who cares about due process should be paying close attention to how this unfolds.

,Agencies,2025-08-11 12:06:50+00:00,The Denver Post,Colorado prisons limit ICE cooperation after two men's arrests in July - The Denver Post,Seth Klamann,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/11/colorado-prisons-immigration-detainers-ice-arrests/,"An immigration lawyer told The Post that the department’s prior policy didn’t appear to violate state law.
Weiser’s office is now investigating other agencies that were participants in a shared group chat with the sheriff’s deputy and federal immigration agents.
Polis’ office, which is still contesting the lawsuit, had not responded to the letter as of Friday afternoon.
But Denver Judge A. Bruce Jones said the subpoena wasn’t part of a criminal matter and that Polis’ office had done little to confirm that such an investigation existed.
They sought assurances about how those agencies would interact with federal immigration authorities, said Rep. Lorena Garcia and Sen. Julie Gonzales, Democrats who’ve sponsored legislation limiting immigration cooperation.","When federal immigration officers arrested Rigoberto Carranza-Mendez in Colorado last month, they trumpeted his detention and subsequent deportation to Mexico on social media — and used the opportunity to take a shot at the state’s capital city.

The convicted murderer had found nearly “perfect sanctuary” in Denver, Immigration and Customs Enforcement claimed, “until ICE officers found him.”

But Carranza-Mendez wasn’t arrested on the streets of Denver, and ICE officers didn’t exactly find him. On July 16, Carranza-Mendez was due to be released from a state prison. The week before that, state corrections officials had emailed ICE, informing the agency of his release date and setting up a custody transfer at a facility in Cañon City.

Carranza-Mendez was one of two men arrested by ICE last month directly from a state prison during a large-scale roundup in Colorado of immigrants without proper legal status. They are among 77 arrested that way this year, according to the state Department of Corrections, under a prior policy of notifying the agency of a certain offender’s imminent release.

But earlier this month, Colorado’s top prison official directed DOC staff members to stop proactively responding to detainer requests from immigration authorities. Under the department’s new policy, ICE must file public records requests to obtain information about inmates. The new directive was signed Aug. 1, shortly after The Denver Post asked about the two men’s arrests.

Carranza-Mendez and Nicolas Diaz-Hernandez were each arrested on their release dates more than three weeks ago. They were part of a broader ICE operation that, the agency said, was conducted in the Denver area and resulted in at least 243 arrests.

ICE had previously sent detainer forms — effectively a request to hold someone until ICE can arrest them — for both men.

The agency’s Denver-based spokesman, Steve Kotecki, did not return an email seeking comment.

The Department of Corrections’ new limitations on ICE cooperation come amid heightened scrutiny of state and local officials’ relationships with federal immigration authorities as President Donald Trump pushes for mass deportations.

A state employee sued Gov. Jared Polis in June over the state’s intent to comply with an ICE subpoena in violation of a state law limiting such collaboration. More recently, Attorney General Phil Weiser filed suit against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy for tipping off ICE about a University of Utah student from Brazil who was driving through the state.

Among other limitations, Colorado law generally prohibits state and local officials from delaying a person’s release from jail or prison to comply with an ICE detainer.

State Corrections spokeswoman Alondra Gonzalez-Garcia said the men recently arrested by ICE did not have their release dates changed to accommodate the agency. An immigration lawyer told The Post that the department’s prior policy didn’t appear to violate state law.

New limit on information sharing

When The Post first asked about the department’s interactions with ICE last month, following ICE’s announcement of the large arrest operation, Gonzalez-Garcia said that the agency hadn’t shared any information with immigration authorities, who acted “independently.”

On Aug. 1, a week later, the department reversed course and said it had informed ICE about the men’s release dates and coordinated their transfers to ICE custody, under an agency policy.

That same day, Andre Stancil, the Department of Corrections’ executive director, issued a directive to all department staff, blocking employees from proactively sharing information with ICE unless its agents submit a public records request.

Gonzalez-Garcia declined The Post’s request to interview DOC leaders.

“The executive directive from Executive Director Stancil clarifies and standardizes how DOC responds to ICE requests,” she said in an email. “This directive ensures that ICE may obtain information regarding releases by submitting open records requests, to which appropriate responses are promptly provided.”

The department’s earlier policy of notifying ICE in response to a detainer doesn’t appear to have violated state law, said Violeta Chapin, an immigration lawyer and University of Colorado Law School professor.

But immigration activists accused the agency of sidestepping those restrictions. The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition accused the department of “creating an active deportation pipeline.”

“These are not isolated incidents but part of a troubling pattern of state and local officials bypassing Colorado’s laws,” Karen Orona, a spokeswoman for the coalition, said in a statement.

In response to the state employee’s June lawsuit against the governor, a Denver judge told Polis that complying with one ICE subpoena would violate state law. Polis’ administration also acknowledged last month that it had complied with four other ICE subpoenas this year — including one that a spokeswoman said it shouldn’t have, prompting changes to state processes.

The incidents have had ripple effects. After Weiser went after the deputy for his actions before the Utah student’s arrest, Mesa County’s commissioners last week signaled their intent to counter-sue Weiser.

Weiser’s office is now investigating other agencies that were participants in a shared group chat with the sheriff’s deputy and federal immigration agents. His office declined to identify the other agencies, other than to point The Post to legal filings that list the Colorado State Patrol, the Vail Police Department and the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office as other participants in the chat.

Sgt. Ivan Alvarado, a State Patrol spokesman, said in a statement that the agency reevaluated its presence in the group chat after the student’s arrest and stopped sharing information in the thread on June 18. He said the patrol respects Weiser’s “ongoing administrative review.”

Vail Police Chief Ryan Kenney wrote in an email to The Post that he couldn’t comment on the AG’s investigation. But he said he was confident that, at the investigation’s conclusion, “no wrongdoing will be found on the part of any Vail police officers.” Ashley LaFleur, an Eagle County spokeswoman, said Weiser’s review was a “matter of administrative due diligence” and that, like Kenney, the county’s officials were confident that its personnel would be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Pressure to protect ‘from federal overreach’

As for Polis, 19 of the state Senate’s 23 Democrats — including Senate President James Coleman and the caucus’ leadership — sent the governor a letter last month about ICE cooperation.

The lawmakers asked Polis to “provide clarity to our state and our constituents about how you will protect them from federal overreach,” like the “fishing expedition” subpoena that Polis had sought to comply with until directed otherwise by a judge.

Polis’ office, which is still contesting the lawsuit, had not responded to the letter as of Friday afternoon. In a statement to The Post, Polis spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said the governor “agrees that Coloradans’ personal information should be protected from unwarranted violations by the federal government,” but he supports “apprehending criminals regardless of immigration status.”

“He is open to further dialogue with the General Assembly on what he views as the shared objectives of keeping communities safe and not supporting the targeting of innocent law-abiding individuals, separating families, or diverting local and state law enforcement from fighting crime to instead pursue federal priorities,” Wieman wrote.

The subpoena at the center of the lawsuit was sent to the state in April as part of what Polis’ office claimed was a criminal investigation, which would’ve qualified for information-sharing with ICE under state law. But Denver Judge A. Bruce Jones said the subpoena wasn’t part of a criminal matter and that Polis’ office had done little to confirm that such an investigation existed.

As part of the fallout from that suit, legislators sent letters to Weiser, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Treasurer Dave Young and the State Board of Education. They sought assurances about how those agencies would interact with federal immigration authorities, said Rep. Lorena Garcia and Sen. Julie Gonzales, Democrats who’ve sponsored legislation limiting immigration cooperation.

In its response, Weiser’s office wrote that it would take steps to ensure that any subpoena purporting to be part of a criminal investigation was actually part of such an inquiry — “as opposed to a veiled or mis-labeled enforcement action for which the true purpose is immigration enforcement.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tdp-z-opcolumn-01_b7a2e1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-11 10:57:09.755068

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.

JBS said in a statement it was replacing the workers and hadn’t lost production capacity.

Iowa union leaders said some of the immigrants losing their jobs had been designated essential workers during Trump’s first term.

Meatpacking giant JBS' July firing of 200 workers in Ottumwa because the Trump administration was revoking their work visas could be just the start of a wave of job losses, with thousands more workers across the state and nation also caught in the crackdown on immigrants, experts say.

Dramatic roundups of undocumented immigrants at meat plants, like one that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement staged in Omaha in June, have been isolated so far.

But the Meat Institute, the industry’s lobbying group, estimates that 20% of the nation’s meat processing workforce — about 102,000 of 510,000 workers — have lost or will lose their jobs as President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security moves to shut down programs like the humanitarian parole under which the Ottumwa workers were employed. The parole program for immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela began in early 2023 during the Biden administration and allowed them to receive the work visas.

In Iowa, one of the largest U.S. meat suppliers, the program's end could mean the dismissal of as many as 7,000 of the state’s estimated 35,000 workers who each year slaughter and process millions of pigs, cattle, turkeys and other livestock.

Dermot Hayes, an Iowa State University agricultural economist, said the loss of foreign workers could push meat prices higher for consumers and revenues lower for livestock producers.

“It’s hard to lose 200 people on a production line and not have it impact productivity. These people are well trained,"" Hayes said, adding that packing plants ""can’t go to McDonalds to get more"" workers.

Meatpackers so far are downpedaling the effects. JBS said in a statement it was replacing the workers and hadn’t lost production capacity. The Meat Institute, asked if the lost labor was impacting production, said ""that portion of the workforce has been phased out of the system.""

Smithfield Foods, another large meatpacker with facilities in Denison, Mason City and Carroll, acknowledged it’s also cutting immigrant workers who’ve lost their legal work status, calling it ""a relatively small number.” The company expects “no impact to our operations,” Ray Atkinson, a Smithfield spokesman, said in an email.

Tyson Foods and Cargill Inc., all with large Iowa processing operations, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Seaboard Triumph Foods, another large meatpacker, declined to comment.

The federal government began canceling immigration programs in March, but, amid legal challenges, it was June before it started notifying many workers. The Meat Institute said many employers began notifying and replacing workers earlier, not waiting for resolution of the legal challenges.

Trump's administration has blamed former President Joe Biden for the ""disastrous"" parole program that allowed the immigrants into the country, saying they were ""poorly vetted"" and created chaos and committed crimes.

Union and advocacy groups say the immigrants are hard workers, who support their families and contribute to their communities and local economies.

In addition to the humanitarian parole, legal experts say, immigrants in meatpacking, construction and other industries are working in the U.S. through a number of other programs including temporary protected status, which U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to end. Some have lived and worked in the U.S. for decades.

""Immigrants who had legal status in the country are now being pushed into an undocumented status and potentially targeted by ICE and deportation,"" said Elena Castillas-Hoffman, an Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice spokesperson.

Iowa union leaders said some of the immigrants losing their jobs had been designated essential workers during Trump’s first term, when he invoked the emergency powers of the Defense Production Act to force meatpacking plants to remain open during the early days of COVID-19 pandemic.

Most workers ""proudly and voluntarily went in there to keep the food supply going. They were on the front line during an uncertain time,” said Brian Ulin, vice president of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 230, which represents JBS workers in Ottumwa.

“They were considered heroes,” said Mike Sunken, a UFCW collective bargaining representative in Fort Dodge.

Now, he said, Trump “wants to get rid of them. That’s the part that doesn’t make sense to me.”

'It’s not just a production issue. It’s a community issue'

Ottumwa is struggling with the impact of the worker losses and potential deportation, said Paulina Ocegueda, a member of the city’s chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Many of the workers and their families are trying to decide their next step.

“We have to remember these people came to the United States the right way,” Ocegueda said. “They’re working and providing for themselves and their families. And they’re paying taxes and contributing to society.”

Homeland Security is urging immigrants to self-deport, offering them $1,000 apiece to be paid when they arrive in their home countries. But Ocegueda said many will again face the problems that they sought to escape when fleeing to the U.S., including violence, poverty and political turmoil.

Sonia Parras, a Des Moines immigration attorney, said some people find themselves stripped of jobs overnight, with little money to pay rent or purchase groceries and gas, let alone buy tickets for flights to their home countries.

Many are at risk of imminent removal, she said, adding that they may be forced to leave spouses and children who are U.S. citizens. ""That's inhumane,"" she said.

Trump has trumpeted the immigration crackdown, saying his administration is going after the “worst of the worst” — gang members, rapists, human traffickers and other criminals. ""Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is taking the worst of the worst off the streets and making America safe again,"" a Homeland Security spokeswoman said in a statement Aug. 1, announcing the agency's most recent arrests.

But 71% of those, though facing charges, haven't been convicted of crimes, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data through July.

Farm groups have been concerned about how the immigration crackdown would impact ag operations. Of the 2.6 million people working on U.S. farms, about 42% lack legal status, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture and other estimates.

The administration has sent conflicting messages. In a July 3 trip to Iowa, Trump said he and Noem were going to ""put the farmers in charge"" when it comes to agricultural workers who are in the country illegally. ""If a farmer’s willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?"" he said.

""You know, we’re going to be good with it. Because we don’t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. We want the farms to do great like they’re doing right now,"" Trump said.

But at a July 8 news conference, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said ""no amnesty"" would be given to migrants working in agriculture. ""The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way,"" Rollins said when asked about farm labor.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement July 30 that the rescinded programs were meant to be temporary.

""I understand the impact the department's decision can have on the local community and farm economy,"" Grassley said, adding that Trump ""wants farmers to succeed and Congress is working with the administration to provide farmers with as much certainty as possible.""

Union leaders: Meatpackers may have to increase wages to find new workers

UFCW’s Ulin and Sunken said JBS workers are stressed as they train new employees while trying to maintain production. “There’s massive hiring going on now,” Ulin said.

“But it’s not just a production issue. It’s a community issue,” said Sunken, noting that one company he represents in northwest Iowa has lost nearly 10% of its workforce due to the administration's immigration actions.

Ulin said workers came to Ottumwa and other Iowa communities with spouses, children, parents and other extended family. The impact is multiplied as families decide to leave.

“It’s going to put a strain on businesses that are losing customers,” Ulin said, adding that schools will lose students, and churches and other community groups will lose members.

“It’s sad,” he said. “We’re all trying to make a better life and support our families. And none of us expect to have the rug pulled out from under us.”

While he doesn’t anticipate the disruption will be as severe, Hayes, the ISU economics professor, points to the price shock U.S. consumers experienced when meatpacking plant workers became ill — and dozens died — during the global COVID-19 pandemic, forcing temporary plant closures.

The U.S. lost about 30% of its slaughter capacity during the pandemic, leaving producers in Iowa and elsewhere to destroy hogs and other livestock as processing lines backed up.

Azzeddine Azzam, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln agricultural economist, said a tighter labor market may force meatpackers to pay higher wages to attract U.S.-born workers.

""Plants may need to make it more attractive for people who have not traditionally been willing to work for you,"" he said.

But Azzam pointed out that increased processing costs also could lower prices for producers and push consumer costs higher. The threat of higher consumer prices comes as Americans have struggled with inflation. Food prices climbed about 24% from 2020 to 2024, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.

Price spikes continue, with consumers paying record-high prices for beef in June, given supply constraints and strong demand.

Experts say JBS, Smithfield and other meatpackers are following the law in firing immigrant workers and could face fines if they retained them. The Meat Institute in June urged the Trump administration to include meatpackers in a discussion of changes that will create a ""stable and legal agriculture workforce.""

Casillas-Hoffman said Iowa's economy depends on finding a solution.

""The reality is that Iowa needs immigrant workers,"" she said, adding, ""We know our communities depend on the vitality of immigrants and refugees.""","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/04/PDEM/84467069007-trump-in-iowa-cs-028.jpg?crop=2910,1637,x0,y0&width=2910&height=1637&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-11 08:57:26.967040

In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.
Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.","On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, immigration Judge John Siemietkowski spoke to three people in his courtroom while masked federal officers waited just outside.

“I’m sure you can see with your own eyes what’s going on in our courthouse,” Siemietkowski said.

“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”

Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.

Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases.

Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests.

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings.

That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period.

Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.

At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.

As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers.

In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.”

While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.

In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.

Missing Persons

EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways.

“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did.

ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.

“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”

In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide.

But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances.

The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period.

Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data.

In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.

New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador.

Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount.

The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.

The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Black Box

The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.

Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification.

Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later.

A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside.

“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.”

Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.

On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July.

City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.

“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.

Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building.

“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different.

“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”

Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.”

She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.

“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.

The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.

“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said.

Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He’srepeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.

‘Guiding Star’?

Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case.

But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.

Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.

That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.

“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.

Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests.

Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE.

“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”

Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.

A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented.

“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 07:56:29.780228

Excluding immigrants in the U.S. illegally could also be tricky.
Projections of how a census that doesn’t count immigrants in the U.S. illegally would affect the political landscape have produced varying results.","In a week when highly partisan redistricting dominated the news, President Donald Trump took a step further Aug. 7 when he said he had ordered the Commerce Department to start working on a new census.

“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” he wrote Aug. 7 on Truth Social. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

It wasn’t clear from Trump’s social media post when he wants the next census to be held. Under current law, the next census is set for 2030.

A new census would be a sharp break with decades of precedent. Excluding immigrants in the country illegally will need to be tested in the courts, and other issues, including the timing of the census, would require consent from Congress, experts said.

A census with the changes Trump seeks likely would have a far-reaching impact on politics, especially amid Trump’s push to have Republican-led states undertake unusual mid-decade redistricting efforts to maximize congressional GOP seats. It would also affect the distribution of federal dollars to states, communities and residents.

The White House referred PolitiFact to the Commerce Department, which provided a statement: “The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the census to better understand our robust census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.”

Can Trump change the timing of the census?

Trump’s words could be read to mean he’s seeking a census more quickly than 2030. Determining whether this would be legal would come down to Article 1 of the Constitution.

Article 1, which establishes the legislative branch, says that to determine the number of seats per state in the U.S. House of Representatives, a census “shall be made … within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they (Congress) shall by Law direct.”

Under current federal law, Congress has used this power to direct the commerce secretary to undertake and publish a census every decade, in years ending in zero.

Undertaking a census more frequently than every 10 years might pass constitutional muster, because Article 1 uses the word “within” in relation to the 10-year period, said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri emeritus law professor. However, doing so would run afoul of the existing law that sets the once-a-decade timetable.

To conduct a census sooner than 2030, Congress would have to pass a law allowing an accelerated schedule.

Can Trump order that immigrants in the U.S. illegally be excluded from the census count?

During his first term, Trump sought to add a citizenship question to the Census. This question hadn’t been included since 1950.

At that time, the Trump administration argued that the president has “virtually unfettered discretion” on what data is included in the census. It said immigrants in the U.S. illegally would not have been considered inhabitants by the framers.

In lawsuits challenging this effort, a different part of the Constitution played a key role. The 14th Amendment says, “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”

This amendment’s language — “the whole number of persons in each state” — is the linchpin of legal efforts to fight efforts like Trump’s. This wording means “it would be unconstitutional to exclude undocumented migrants,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Opponents of Trump’s efforts say many people are counted in the census who cannot vote, including children, lawful noncitizens, incarcerated people and people convicted of felonies.

Lower courts rejected Trump’s first-term arguments, and the Supreme Court in 2020 decided on procedural grounds not to weigh in on the case’s merits, letting the lower court ruling stand.

With the current Supreme Court’s conservative majority often siding with Trump, the lack of a ruling on the substance gives the justices some room to rule that Trump’s vision of a citizen-only census conforms to the Constitution.

“The current Supreme Court has a record of ignoring or reversing precedent, staying lower court decisions, and setting aside lower court decisions,” said Steven Smith, an Arizona State University political scientist. “All bets are off.”

Beyond the law, what are some of the practical challenges Trump would face?

Conducting a census isn’t something that can be planned or done quickly. It involves collecting data on more than 340 million people and hiring and training thousands of new workers.

The Census Bureau has started preparing for the 2030 count, including the recruitment of workers for an upcoming, large-scale field test in 2026.

Current law also requires that Congress be notified of the census questions two years before it’s undertaken. But Trump could urge the Republican majorities in Congress to change that law.

Any action to make census changes would almost certainly be challenged in court, adding further delays.

Experts said the likelihood of a new, national census being completed from a standing start today in time for the next elections in 2026 is all but impossible, experts said. In addition to having to conduct an entire census in record time, states would need time to approve new district lines, establish candidate filing dates and hold primaries by the November 2026 midterms.

Another potential obstacle for Trump would emerge if he demands that states draw new congressional lines using a mid-decade census. “The president has no authority to order a state to redistrict mid-decade,” Smith said. Congress could, however, change that.

Excluding immigrants in the U.S. illegally could also be tricky. On a technical level, it would require writing and testing a citizenship question. And some critics worry what such a question would mean for the census data’s overall reliability. Critics say response rates will decrease, especially amid fears that answering the census amid the administration’s mass deportation efforts could get someone mistakenly deported.

How could changing who’s counted affect the partisan balance of power?

Projections of how a census that doesn’t count immigrants in the U.S. illegally would affect the political landscape have produced varying results. But what Trump proposes might not necessarily bolster the Republican Party, analyses show.

A 2020 Pew Research Center study found that blue California and red Texas and Florida would have had one seat less, while red Alabama and Ohio and blue Minnesota would each have had one seat more.

A 2024 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, found that California and New York gained eight and three seats, respectively, from including immigrants — legal and illegal — in the 2020 census. Florida gained two additional seats. Texas and Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island gained one each.

A 2024 report by the libertarian Cato Institute concluded that 95% of noncitizen population growth has gone to red states since 2019.

A January study by University of Minnesota researcher Rob Warren and Robert E. Warren, a former demographer for the U.S. Census who’s now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, found that including immigrants in the U.S. illegally in census data has had “minimal” impact on party representation in the House. Excluding illegal immigrants from the 2020 Census would have meant that California and Texas would have each lost one seat and Ohio and New York would have gained a seat each, they found.

“The evidence is that both red and blue places would be harmed,” said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau, a think tank.",https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25219423967640.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:57:32.557938

And he has claimed that the vaccine court punishes and intimidates expert witnesses and petitioners’ attorneys.

Mr. Kennedy has said, falsely, that the vaccine court is the “exclusive remedy” for families seeking compensation.
“These are incredibly difficult cases.” She believes her clients are better off in the vaccine court.","For nearly 40 years, a special federal court system has compensated Americans who prove they were harmed by vaccines while also protecting the manufacturers from litigation.

Even the staunchest defenders of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program agree it needs reform. It is slow, understaffed and can feel adversarial to families legitimately in need.

Now Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the program, saying he will make it more efficient and speedier for Americans seeking payment.

He said in a social media post last month that the vaccine court had “devolved into a morass of inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Parents who believe their children were injured by vaccines are “facing the monumental power and bottomless pockets of the U.S. government,” he said.

Mr. Kennedy has also claimed, falsely, that the compensation program prevents families from suing vaccine makers in traditional courts. And he has claimed that the vaccine court punishes and intimidates expert witnesses and petitioners’ attorneys.

Experts fear that some of the changes Mr. Kennedy has hinted at could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits, jeopardizing the manufacture of vaccines and undermining their use.

“Kennedy can fix this system without burning it down,” said Tony Yang, a health policy expert at George Washington University. But Mr. Kennedy sounds “more like a frustrated lawyer who lost cases than an eager secretary trying to fix things.”

Indeed, allies of the secretary have fared poorly in the vaccine court. Their litigation in traditional courts — including a 2022 lawsuit in which Mr. Kennedy delivered closing arguments — also has fallen short.

The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Public health officials in the United States have been tracking vaccine safety for decades and have long said that shots routinely given to children are safe. But all vaccines have at least occasional side effects, and there are rare instances of serious injury.

The program covers most routine immunizations given to children and pregnant women, and is funded by a small tax on each shot. The vaccine court has paid $5.4 billion in claims since its inception, awarding compensation in about 42 percent of the roughly 28,000 claims filed.

But in accordance with a great body of scientific evidence, the court’s special masters have denied thousands of claims that childhood vaccines are linked to autism. Mr. Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, believes that there is such a link and has long accused government officials of hiding the risks.

Some reforms widely seen as necessary would require Congress to intervene. Among them: more of the special masters who preside as judges over cases.

The legislation establishing the program allowed for three; five more were added later. But at least double that number are needed to adjudicate the roughly 1,200 applications each year, according to some experts.

The program also needs more staff to review medical records, and an online system for families to track the status of their claims. The compensation fund has a $4 billion surplus, some of which could be applied to remedy these problems.

Mr. Kennedy said in an interview last month that he wanted to ensure families seeking compensation “get it very quickly, and they get it without the kind of adversarial impediments that have now been erected over the past 40 years.”

A new fast-track system for rare injuries that studies have definitively linked to certain vaccines could speed up the process. In the current system, government lawyers sometimes fight families over settled links, said Altom Maglio, an attorney who has represented people in the vaccine court for 25 years.

“Fighting tooth and nail is just not appropriate, and doesn’t meet the goals,” he said.

At the same time, special masters sometimes make awards even when the connection between a side effect and vaccine is tenuous, said Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“There are a lot of things that are being compensated where there’s inadequate evidence,” Dr. Salmon said. “We need more science.”

Mr. Kennedy has also suggested that injury claims regarding Covid-19 shots should be moved to the vaccine court. At present, those claims are piling up in a parallel federal system called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program.

Of more than 14,000 injury claims filed regarding Covid vaccines, only 69 have been paid out. More than 9,400 are pending, and about 4,800 have been dismissed.

Congress would need to act to move those claims to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. But adding the large Covid backlog to the vaccine court’s own poses huge challenges, Dr. Yang said: “You’re complaining about your kitchen sink, it’s clogged, and then you try to wash your bike in it.”

There are some aspects of the program that Mr. Kennedy can change without Congress. That includes altering the official table detailing the injuries presumed to be linked to certain vaccines.

Changing the table to say that certain vaccines cause autism or asthma, months or years after shots, for example, could hobble the system, opening the doors to tens of thousands of new claims that would previously have been dismissed.

“He’s talking about opening a can of worms that could result in Americans losing access to some vaccines and huge expenditures in court fees,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mr. Kennedy has said, falsely, that the vaccine court is the “exclusive remedy” for families seeking compensation. In fact, claimants can sue vaccine makers in traditional courts if the government does not respond to them within 240 days, or if they are dissatisfied with its offer of compensation.

But the traditional courts have not been any more generous to Americans who believe they were injured, said Renee Gentry, director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at George Washington University.

“The idea that going to straight to civil litigation means you’re going to win is absurd,” Ms. Gentry said. “These are incredibly difficult cases.” She believes her clients are better off in the vaccine court.

Mr. Kennedy has been deeply involved in litigation over vaccines for years. For example, he worked on lawsuits against Merck over claims related to the Gardasil vaccine, which protects against the human papilloma virus.

As health secretary, Mr. Kennedy initially planned to keep his financial stake in the litigation. But he relinquished those earnings to an adult son following controversy at his confirmation hearing.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, also pressed him to pledge to refrain from suing pharmaceutical companies after he leaves government. “I’m not going to agree to that,” Mr. Kennedy said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/06/multimedia/06hs-vaccine-court-zmqc/06hs-vaccine-court-zmqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 07:56:34.035445

Community organizations in the Philadelphia suburbs and New Jersey are fundraising to support family members of people detained by immigration enforcement officials.

“Están sufriendo las familias en diferentes aspectos”, dijo Mari, una residente del condado de Montgomery quien no quería compartir su apellido por miedo a represalias. “Emocional, económico, son familias rotas”.

“Families are suffering in different ways,” said Mari, a Montgomery County resident who did not wish to share her last name for fear of retaliation. “Emotionally, economically, they’re broken families.”

Mari, a volunteer, worked with Norristown nonprofit organization Centro de Cultura Arte Trabajo y Educación, or CCATE, to fundraise for several families of the 14 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a supermarket on July 18.

Obed Arango, executive director of CCATE, said he and fellow organizers have seen “the necessity for humanitarian relief.”

“When we see children or people left behind with tremendous needs, it’s important to understand it from the humanitarian perspective and at the same time to understand those that are in need of representation, to have the legal aid,” he said.

To date, the fundraiser has collected more than $5,000 of its $26,000 goal. Mari said the resources have been distributed to the families to support with legal aid and other daily needs.

Similar efforts are ongoing in Princeton, New Jersey, where 16 people were detained in two separate ICE raids in Princeton, New Jersey on July 23 and 24, according to Paulo Almirón, media coordinator of Resistencia en Acción NJ, a migrant justice grassroots organization focused on Mercer County.

The organization has launched a fundraiser to support its rapid response network to ICE sightings in the area, and benefit families of detainees. So far, the fund has collected nearly $3,000 of its goal of $30,000.

Almirón said the organization is currently working with the families of 13 of the 16 people detained in the July Princeton raids. Resistencia en Acción is helping families with deposits for phone calls with loved ones in detention, supporting people in finding where their loved ones are being held and referring them to trustworthy legal services.

Almirón said his organization also sees family members struggling to cope financially after a family member is detained.

“In most cases, the person … detained is the breadwinner of the family,” he said. “Because it is so hard for immigrants to find jobs, it is often the father in a family that has to put hours, and people work six, seven days a week, and they cannot stop doing that because the cost of living, and it forces them to do all this. So when that person is gone, the family is left financially unstable, and it’s even worse when the person is transferred to an out of state detention center, because that adds to the expenses of whether people can visit.”

ICE raids have left communities ‘fractured,’ families ‘inconsolable’

Organizers say the increasing raids in the last few months are taking a psychological toll on families and entire communities.

“In terms of emotional distress, these families are inconsolable,” Almirón said. “They’re really devastated to see basically their relatives or loved ones being abducted.”

In one of the Princeton raids, he said, the little brother of one of the people being detained watched it happen.

“That’s a traumatizing experience that a lot of our community has to deal with, and even for families that are not directly affected, that spreads fear among the community people at this moment,” Almirón said. “They are afraid of even going to work or getting groceries. It’s a really terrible situation, emotionally and psychologically for the families in the community.”

Mari said in Norristown, the community is “fractured.”

“Han sido personas conocidas por nuestra comunidad”, dijo ella de las personas detenidas en las redadas. “Personas conocidas y queridas por nuestra comunidad que prestaban un servicio a nuestra comunidad. Y son apreciados y valorados por nosotros. Entonces eso nos motiva a apoyarlos aún más”.

“They’ve been people known by our community,” she said of the people detained in the raids. “People who are known and loved by our community, that provided a service to our community. They’re appreciated and valued, and so that motivates us to support them even more.”

To help with people’s mental health and legal needs, Arango said that CATE is inviting therapists and attorneys to provide pro bono services to impacted community members. Those willing to lend their aid can contact the organization at contact@ccate.org.

Rapid response network, podcast share accurate information on ICE sightings, elected officials’ responses

Arango, referencing a phrase used by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said he and other organizers are working to “create a beloved community.”

To that end, Arango, who is also a journalist and a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, worked with community members at CCATE to start a podcast, “Diálogos de la Villa Inmigrante,” or “Dialogues of the Immigrant Village,” in November 2024.

“We think that good dialogue, positive dialogue with the authorities, to hear the community, to know the community firsthand, can provide a better understanding of who we are as a community,” he said. “That deep conversation, no, at every level of government is key … because that can help to actually build changes in the coming future.”

The podcast garners thousands of listeners for each episode. Recent guests included U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean and U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon.

Arango said the podcast also serves as a way to communicate verified, accurate information to community members.

“We are very always careful that the information that we present is proven, that it has a source, no, that it has a direct understanding of things,” he said. “We are very careful on that.”

For Resistencia en Acción NJ, the priority of providing accurate information to the community is also paramount, and carried out by volunteers in its rapid response network.

“We’ve been recruiting more people, fundraising for our rapid response team,” he said. “We have increased our patrols. We have people patrolling every morning, operators on the phone to attend to the rapid response line, people who confirm ICE presence in the area that’s reported. So that requires a lot of coordination and resources that we are covering through this fund.”

… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America.","In late July, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided access to three detention centers they operate in Louisiana to a group of about 20 civil rights advocates.

Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.

The other ICE facilities on the tour were the South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, which holds only women, and the Pine Prairie Processing Center in Evangeline Parish.

The Illuminator conducted two separate interviews with attorneys who went on the tour, and excerpts from these transcripts are shared below. They have been edited for length and clarity.

One interview featured Kerry Kennedy and Anthony Enriquez with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, who are in Episode 17 of “The Light Switch,” our weekly podcast.

The other interview is with Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and Nora Ahmed, the organization’s legal director.

RFK Human Rights and the ACLU of Louisiana have collaborated in the past, most notably as of late on a 2024 report – “Inside the Black Hole” – that detailed “abused and disappeared” immigrants in the state. It was compiled based on interviews with more than 6,000 interviews and seven tours with officials from the New Orleans ICE office.

Last month’s tour was just the latest trip to the state’s ICE facilities for Ahmed and Enriquez, both of whom have clients in custody.

The interviews included claims of unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care and abuse. Questions about these allegations were sent to the ICE media relations office, and its representatives have yet to respond.

Q: You’ve visited these facilities before. Did you get the sense that preparations were made in advance to have each facility put its best foot forward, or was it much as you’ve seen on past visits?

Odoms: This was actually my first time inside immigrant detention. … I was really surprised that it did not seem like much preparation went into making things appear, at least visually, better than what they normally are. I think where the real dog and pony show took place was in their presentation to us about their operations and their standards and their protocols. That was like night and day, hearing from ICE about how they care for people and what their standards are, versus hearing directly from the residents.

Q: The first stop on the tour was the ICE Processing Center in Alexandria. Take us through your first impressions.

Odoms: First of all, every single one of these places has many layers of barbed wire around it, so they depict prison immediately. Then you’re brought through metal detectors and security. You’re you have to surrender everything, even a smart watch. You’re not allowed to have any recording devices, anything like that. Then you’re brought through these metal sally port doors, which are these huge metal doors that slam shut behind you, and you are very, very aware that you are in a prison.

Then you walk in and you see there are two main areas in the staging facility where people are either held in prison, like cells, like a cell block, very traditional prison … and it opens up into what they call airport-style seating area, where people are actually sitting, chained at their hands, chained at their feet, and chained at their bellies, waiting for their planes to take off.

That is what you see as soon as you walk in, and they did not try to hide the people who were waiting. There were about maybe a handful, if not maybe 10 to 12 people who were waiting for a flight, who were sitting clearly chained … at every single appendage of their body.

The second room is more of a gymnasium style room where there are between 70 to 90 people being housed in bunk beds. … This aging facility is where the male population is held inside these either cell blocks or bunk-style barracks.

In the open room, there’s a large Plexiglas or glass partition where you can very clearly see who’s inside, and they can very clearly see you. As soon as folks saw us, they immediately came to that window. And honestly, the looks on all of their faces were like, “Help.”

Q: Kerry, your organization has a global focus on human rights concerns. What’s happening in Louisiana’s ICE facilities that has made this situation one of your priorities?

Kennedy: When we were in Louisiana, in the detention centers, we met with a woman who is also one of our clients, who her doctor told her that she might have colon cancer, and she was picked up [to see a doctor] a couple of days later. She’s been asking for four and a half months to see a doctor to see whether or not she has colon cancer, and her ability to see that doctor has been denied for four and a half months.

We met another woman, an elderly woman, who begged and pleaded to see a doctor because she came into the facility walking perfectly, and now she’s forced to use a wheelchair, and she doesn’t know why. She’s begged and pleaded to see a doctor. They finally said, ”We’ll send you to health care,” and she was sexually assaulted when she did that.

I met another young woman who’s 26 years old. She is gay. She’s from Russia. She fled Russia because of the oppression against gay people, because her life was in danger. She’s got a master’s in chemical engineering, and she was working for a pharmaceutical company, making medicines for us, for our country, and now instead, she’s in this detention center.

This makes no sense. These are people who are in our communities, who are creating change, who are paying taxes, who are making our country stronger and better. And instead, now you and I … [are] paying through our tax dollars for their breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day, and for them to be in a prison situation instead about the world creating change. So that’s why we’re attacking this.

Q: How do you mount a legal strategy for your clients against an administration that is willing to subvert due process when it comes to immigration law?

Enriquez: This is a question that actually has two answers. One is we work hand in hand with people who are living and working in the communities where detention centers exist. So for those of you who are in Louisiana, one thing that’s been interesting is when we have discussions with the workers who are guards in some of these private prisons, these detention centers. They tell us, “I really didn’t have another choice. It was either work here or in a casino, and this was the only thing around for me. This was a way that I could feed my own family.”

So a core element of what we’re doing is to try and extend the notion of human rights, not just to the people who are suffering the types of physical sexual abuse that that you just heard Kerry speak of the detained immigrants, but actually the workers who are being exploited in these detention centers as well by private prison.

CEOs … are pocketing these taxpayer dollars for their own bonuses. People might not be aware that the head of the corporate leadership of the GEO Group, which is one of the owners of many of the detention centers in Louisiana, they just gave themselves big fat raises after the passage of this last domestic policy bill. That’s money that they’re actually taking out of the hands of pockets of Louisiana workers as well. So that’s one of the ways that we really try and broaden the conception of what human rights is, and we let people know this is a big fight that’s affecting all of us.

Q: Statistics show that roughly half of the people being detained in Louisiana ICE facilities do not have a prior criminal background, and many have not been formally charged with a crime.

Odoms: The only designation that they have that separates people who they believe have criminal histories is this high- [or] low-designation, and whether you get put in a cell block or whether you get put in the barrack style living conditions.

When we asked about classification for how people were classified as either high or low, we didn’t get a very clear answer on that at all. Sometimes they were saying, “Well, they come to us that way from other facilities, so someone else is making the classification, and we’re just kind of rubber stamping that and either putting somebody in a cell block or putting someone in a barracks.” Or, “We have a point system,” and they said, “Oh, you’re going to have to request that in writing.”

So anytime we kind of brushed up against a question that would really illuminate what was happening in terms of constitutional violations and real problems, all of those questions were met with: “That would have to be something that you submit in writing.”

Q: What explanations have you been given as to why your clients are being warehoused indefinitely in ICE detention without any opportunity for bond, and what level of proof is the federal government providing to justify this?

Ahmed: We have two clients [and] we’ll be filing habeas petitions* in short order that illustrate this.

One of our clients, they’ve attempted to remove her to six different countries. All have said no, but she’s still there because apparently they’re just going to run through the list, which is … wildly preposterous.

In terms of bond, we’re going to bring another habeas challenge. Because right now you’ve probably heard the administration is [taking into custody] people who appear at their immigration proceedings. We have a client who appeared for her asylum proceeding, and then she was whisked away. The reason she was whisked away is because of a newfound interpretation of the United States Code, Section 1225, which no longer is interpreting mandatory detention as applicable to people appearing at the border, and is now just applying to anybody who entered the country without inspection.

So you’re now starting to see people like our client, who’ve been in the United States for two decades, showing up as they’re supposed to to an immigration court hearing. Are you really a flight risk if you’re showing up to your court hearing? Probably not. And in her particular case, there’s no criminal record. So you’re also talking about somebody who there is no conceivable way that you could possibly say that she’s a danger.

I still want to say that people who do have criminal records are also not dangerous, let’s be clear, because in this country, a criminal record could include not paying a fine or having to pick up your child and not making a court date. So I don’t like to pitch people with criminal records as people who are dangerous because the vast majority are not.

Q: Recently in Louisiana, two powerful members of our congressional delegation intervened to secure the release of two detainees. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stepped in to have an Iranian woman who’s lived in New Orleans for nearly 50 years released, and Sen. John Kennedy was instrumental in the release of a Mexican woman who’s married to a U.S. Marine. Does this give you any glimmer of hope that other powerful Republicans will call for the Trump administration to pause its sweeping immigration enforcement efforts?

Kennedy: I think it’s important that people at the highest levels are beginning to understand the impact of these terrible laws. You know, one of the problems with GEO Group is that it runs prisons. So this is a detention facility that is run as a prison.

But before this, we were not always putting people in detention, and a lot of these people have been in the communities, have been in the Marines, have served our country. They are our teachers. They are giving us the food that we eat every day. They’re making our medicines.

They can be in the community, and they’re great programs – proven again and again and again – where 100% of the people who are released into the community return for their detention here, for their immigration hearings and also to be deported, if that’s ultimately what’s supposed to happen to them.

So why in the world are we taking people? Why are we kidnapping people off the street and treating them with such inhumanity and harming our country at the same time? This makes no sense, unless you think about it as a way to enrich a cruel corporation, which is what’s happened.

Q: The sheer number of people being detained makes it close to impossible that everyone is represented by an attorney. Is there any solution within sight that, at the very least, would ensure every detainee receives legal representation?

Kennedy: Yeah, well, there’s a clear solution – open up the doors and let people be in the community, which was the solution under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, many of the other administrations. That’s what would happen to people, and there are proven programs where 100% of them come back to their [immigration court] hearing. So that’s the least expensive, most effective and best way to assure that people’s rights are not being compromised by the United States government.

Q: We’re seeing increasing incidents of people showing up for immigration court hearings at the appointed time and date, following official instructions only to be taken into ICE custody and placed into detention. How are you advising clients who might want to adhere to the rules but face a good chance they will be apprehended and then fast-tracked toward deportation or imprisoned indefinitely?

Odoms: We have very direct guidance for people who are able to obtain counsel. They absolutely need to do so, and they need to presume that they are going to be apprehended. Like, it’s not if they’re going to be taken. It’s when they’re going to be taken.

But here’s the thing, I really want this to come across: Everyone is still having faith in this system, that if they actually present themselves and continue to do what’s right, being compliant, being adherent, that they will actually be given some kind of consideration. And that is not true

Ahmed: … What preparations people need to do? They need to prepare in two to three very distinct ways, I think, and we can tell them, talk to an immigration attorney about a motion to reopen your immigration proceedings very quickly. Also try to ensure that you have access to a federal practitioner who will be able to file a habeas petition for you when you’re incarcerated.

… We’ve seen a lot of congressional folks start stepping up, have a privacy waiver signed and make sure that everyone important in your life, including your congressional representatives, is able to communicate on your behalf with ICE. You can download the document off of the [ICE] website. … You get to fill in the information of whoever is allowed to have access, and then they can start advocating for you with ICE. You should know your congressional representatives, who can do that, your local friends and family.

Q: Alana, your organization has always had as its bedrock the belief that our Constitution, our laws and judicial system ultimately would not let us down. Do you feel that certainty still exists?

Odoms: Yeah, it does feel like the safety net of our Constitution has started to fray in some really fundamental ways.

… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America. We’re not trained to actually respond to an authoritarian regime – that is the true issue that we’re all facing. What do you do when the Constitution doesn’t apply anymore? What do we do when we actually have laws and those laws are being completely thrown out, how do we respond?

There’s a lot for us to learn from organizers and folks who have been doing work outside of the power structure, because I don’t think we’re going to find our answers in the traditional way that we have in the past.

… That’s the outside strategy that we have to work on. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with filing a lawsuit, but it does have to do with strategizing around people power. How do we do that? Because these systems are only going to buckle under the the pressure of people saying, “Oh, hell no, that looks like an authoritarian regime. That’s not what we want. We want a process. We want due process. We want people to have access to lawyers. We want people to have access to all the things that our constitution says.”

That’s a people power movement.

Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes.","Carefully assess the actions of Missouri’s governor, Republican members of the state legislature and our Congressional delegation. Then ask yourself: Whose priorities, interests and concerns have they supported, fought for and voted for?

Certainly not those of most Missourians.

Missourians voted for candidates in various elective offices to represent and fight for their interests in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.

Instead, many of the Republican elected officials seem to have forgotten and folded to the pressure of supporting and carrying out the agenda of the Trump administration, whether it is in the best interest and well-being of Missouri citizens or not.

Look at the behavior of Missouri senators and representatives in Congress. While some bothered to proclaim that Medicaid should not be cut, at the end of the posturing they all went along with approving the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Essentially voting for the cuts in Medicaid funding that will deny tens of thousands of Missourians life-saving services. How many rural hospitals will be affected or forced to close in the coming months and years because of these cuts?

Their actions, or failures to act, are disturbing and disconcerting.

How is it that members of the Missouri congressional delegation can get away with the abdication of carrying out their governance and oversight responsibilities?

When it comes to allowing the Trump administration to usurp Congress’s power and arbitrarily disrupt, disband and defund departments that will negatively impact Missourians. First it was the department of education that was the target, cutting needed funding for school districts.

The most recent is the proposal to decentralize the department of agriculture. Will these changes hurt Missouri farmers, causing them to lose necessary funding and programmatic support? What are the positions of members of the Missouri Congressional delegation?

Our representatives in Congress have been silent and given tacit support to other actions of the Trump administration.

When it comes to the impact of increased tariffs on farmers being able to export their soybeans and other produce, and the higher cost of consumer goods across the board for families already struggling to make ends meet.

When it comes to immigration tactics that disrupt business operations, the workforce in agricultural industries and the lives of innocent family members.

When it comes to the short and long-term effects of taxation policies and the national debt, the burden of which Missourians like all Americans must bear.

When there is no oversight, no checks and balanced guardrails, how can we be confident that the policies and decisions being made will be in our best interest?

The actions of our Republican governor, Republican-controlled state legislature and other government offices are in lock-step with the Trump administration as well.

An executive order adopted and ensured the implementation of dismantling DEI programs throughout governmental departments and agencies, colleges and universities, and wherever the state had authority to issue a mandate. Businesses have been sued by the state attorney general for apparent noncompliance.

What measures are being implemented to ensure that all Missourians are treated equal and have equal access and equal opportunity? A state with a diverse population base, who is helped or hurt?

Republican state legislators in the Senate and House wrote letters urging the Missouri U.S. Senators to pass the “Big Beautiful Bill” irrespective of the negative impacts on their constituents.

The latest influence of President Trump on what goes on in Missouri is his request for the legislature to draw a new mapto eliminate one of the two Democratic congressional districts to help ensure that the Republicans maintain the majority in the House after the 2026 midterm elections.

Such a move, if successful, would eliminate the congressional district that represents Kansas City and some adjacent counties, thereby diminishing or negating the impact the representation and vote of a large number of constituents, including large minority groups.

The Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are seriously considering calling a special legislative session to make President Trump’s wishes happen.

Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes. Redrawing districts mid-cycle or in an off year is solely to provide a political advantage for one party or the other.

Missouri has six Republican and two Democratic Congressional districts.

Every Missourians should think about the meaning of the political move to change that to 7 to 1.

Fundamentally, elected officials, irrespective of their party affiliations, should represent all constituents living within their electoral boundaries despite the racial and ethnic make-up or how they may have voted.

Likewise, representative government means just that. It should represent, as best as possible, all the people it governs.

As there is growing disapproval of President Trump and many of his policies by most recent polls, why are Republican state leaders continuing to bow to the pressure of jumping on an increasingly unpopular Trump agenda?

It behooves each of us to ask a critical question.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/donaldtrumpfeb112025-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:58:11.158176

It worked on Matthew Morrison. In mid-July, the 69-year-old former psychiatric nurse supervisor quietly fled the United States.

Morrison had been threatened by an aggressive government before. When he was a teenager, he fought against what he and others in the Irish Republican Army saw as an occupying British government that discriminated against marginalized Catholics in Northern Ireland.

For his efforts then, Morrison said he was beaten by interrogators and wound up in prison, where some of his comrades died in a hunger strike protesting the revocation of their political status.

Upon his release in 1985, he feared for his safety. He came to St. Louis, married his American pen pal and had two children. Eventually, he overstayed his tourist visa, divorced his pen pal and remarried. He's had the spectre of deportation hanging over him for decades. His family has endured the highs and lows of his battle along the way.

Now, Morrison leans on a cane. He's had several strokes. He said that the fear and uncertainty that he might be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was more than he could bear.

""I would bite the dust in an ICE holding cell,"" Morrison told The Marshall Project - St. Louis before he left the U.S. ""There is nothing to stop them from deporting me to Ecuador, South Sudan or whatever. It's really gotten insane here. It's crazy what they are doing now, the Trump administration. You know what I mean?""

Many noncitizens have faced similar unknowns in hiding. Morrison has been in the public eye for a long time. He's been in and out of the news since the 1990s. He was even the grand marshal of a parade. But the U.S. government denied his petition for an adjustment in immigration status because of crimes he was convicted of during ""The Troubles"" conflict in Northern Ireland. Morrison had omitted those from his original tourist visa application.

In 2000, the Clinton administration terminated the deportation process against Morrison and five other named ""deportees,"" as the group of former Irish Republican Army prisoners was called, after the American spouses of the Irish men testified before Congress. The president himself weighed in on the issue.

""While in no way approving or condoning their past criminal acts,"" Bill Clinton said then, according to a Washington Post story at the time, ""I believe that removing the threat of deportation for these individuals will contribute to the peace process in Northern Ireland.""

The deportees were momentarily relieved. But because they weren't on a path to citizenship, the six men still had to live with restrictions and regularly check in with the government.

In May, Noel Gaynor, who had a heart condition, died at home in Olean, New York. Waiting months without annual work authorization approval, his Medicare and Social Security benefits were cut off, according to a video of statements made at his wake. In June, Gabriel Megahey received a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that The Marshall Project - St. Louis reviewed. It began: ""It's time for you to leave the United States.""

Morrison expected a similar letter. Though his work authorization expires in October, he didn't want to sit around waiting and worrying.

On July 21, he limped onto a one-way flight from Cleveland to Dublin, Ireland, with his wife, leaving behind a life that he'd built in the St. Louis area, including grown children, grandchildren and many friends.

""I've come full circle,"" Morrison said while still in the United States. ""I came here as an immigrant and I am leaving as an immigrant, despite everything in between. The whole thing is a crazy, stressful situation.""

There's a city in Northern Ireland with two names. Protestants call it Londonderry. Catholics, like Morrison, call it Derry.

Catholics felt discriminated against there. Without better options, Morrison said his childhood home didn't have an indoor bathroom or hot water. He said the cramped home was raided by British soldiers stationed there to keep the peace between Protestants and Catholics and to ensure Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.

To resist, he helped build barricades around his neighborhood. On Jan. 30, 1972, 16-year-old Morrison and his father joined thousands of others in the streets of their city. The march for Catholic civil rights became known as Bloody Sunday after British troops fatally shot 14 unarmed people and injured others.

To fight back, Morrison said he joined the Irish Republican Army.

""There was no way to be indifferent,"" he said.

Three years later, while in college, he said he was arrested with two others for trying to gun down a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer. Again, there were two ways to look at it. To Morrison, it was an act of war. Others saw it as terrorism.

Later, he'd claim he was choked and beaten during police interrogations, which left him deaf in one ear. Convicted of attempted murder, he was sent to a prison outside Belfast that became widely known for a hunger strike where 10 people died.

Released in 1985, Morrison fled to St. Louis, where he soon married Francie Broderick, an American pen pal who'd protested in Northern Ireland. They had a son, Matt, then a daughter, Katie. For years, the family and their supporters rallied to bring awareness to their own troubles with immigration authorities.

In 1998, CBS featured the Morrison family in a documentary titled ""Before Your Eyes: Don't Take My Daddy.""

""I always felt that our campaign was an extension of the hunger strike,"" said Broderick, now 77.

They had a major breakthrough in 2000 when then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in a prepared statement that she had been advised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to drop deportation proceedings against the deportees to ""support and promote the process of reconciliation that has begun in Northern Ireland.""

The men could stay, but they still couldn't apply for a green card, let alone U.S. citizenship, because of their deferred immigration status.

""People don't realize how much of a minefield U.S. immigration law is,"" Morrison said.

Over the years, delayed work authorizations sidelined him from his job for months at a time, he said. He worked about 20 years as a nurse in Missouri, including stints at a children’s hospital and several state mental health facilities. He said he presented at the St. Louis County Police Academy on topics including mental health and deescalation tactics.

""It doesn’t matter what I did, Immigration gave me no credit for it,"" Morrison said.

Homeland Security and ICE officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

—

In June, before Morrison self-deported, a scheduled check-in with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in St. Louis put him and his family on edge. Their fears were heightened by stories about immigrants being detained at routine appointments, regardless of legal status. At the appointment, authorities took a photo of Morrison and he was free to go.

""We were terrified that they were just going to take him right there,"" said his son, Matt, 37.

He said the uncertainty weighed on his father more than he'd ever seen.

""He has to live under that fear of somebody knocking on the door and dragging him out of the house, just like they did in Derry when he was young,"" Matt said. ""I hate it. I am just worried about him. Until recently, I hadn't heard him cry about it.""

He has mixed feelings about his father's departure.

""He's got brothers and sisters over there, but we are all here — and his grandkids,"" Matt said. ""He spends a lot of time with his grandkids.""

Morrison's daughter, Katie Bradley, 34, said a recent farewell gathering, held in a backyard, felt like a funeral. She panicked because her U.S. passport had expired.

""Even though he's still alive, I feel like I am grieving,"" she said. ""It’s a huge loss for me and my children.""

Morrison's wife, Sandra Riley Swift, has a house in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as her mother and many grandchildren. After helping Morrison transition into an apartment in the town where he grew up, she said in a social media post that she's going to straddle both countries for a while.

The square is lined with buildings that house institutions linked to government or municipal services: several courts, the statistics bureau, the Department of Homeland Security and the city's Department of Health.

At 26 Federal Plaza stands a towering 41-story gray skyscraper, called the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. It houses the New York immigration service, including an administrative court, and the offices that handle the hundreds of routine check-ins that are required of New Yorkers with immigrant status. This represents about 18.5% of the city's population, 37.5% of which is comprised of foreign-born residents, just over half of whom have been naturalized.

Ever since the Trump administration implemented its anti-immigration measures, people coming to routine appointments to update their administrative files have risked being arrested by federal immigration police (ICE) agents, who are stationed inside the building. Most ICE agents wear masks and sport no visible identifying signs. They wait in the corridors, with lists of names in hand.

The criteria by which individuals are included on the lists are unknown and unrelated to the decisions made by the administration in the building, as migrants reporting to this office are, by definition, not illegally living in the country. Once apprehended, they are directly taken to the building's 10th floor, which has been turned into a provisional detention center.

That fact drew several Butler County residents to the July 15 Butler County Commission meeting to voice their displeasure at the contract.","Ibou Tine says he's scared to be deported to his native Senegal, which he fled years ago to escape political violence. But now he's asking to be sent back soon so he can leave the Butler County Jail, where he's been for more than two months.

He's speaking to a WVXU reporter through a teleconference at the Jail during a visit on a recent Sunday. He describes the searing stomach pain he says he's been suffering lately. He claims he hasn't gotten medical treatment and is having trouble eating.

""If you have health problems, this isn't a place you should be,"" Tine said. ""If they need to send me back to Senegal, that's a big risk — but I'd rather risk it than stay in here.""

WVXU reached out to the Butler County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, about Tine's condition and any medical treatment he's received. The office declined to provide records specific to Tine's treatment, citing medical privacy laws. The office did provide details about its 24-hour infirmary and some data about how people held on ICE detainers are given medical treatment in the jail.

Tine's attorney, as well as a friend who talks to him most days, say they're worried about his condition, noting he's seemed to have lost weight.

They aren't the only ones worried about how ICE detainees are being treated.

A letter from faith leaders

Groups raising concerns about the jail's treatment of those federal prisoners include immigration attorneys and a coalition of 19 Butler County faith leaders and 16 other clergy from outside the region who signed a July 28 letter expressing deep reservations about the county's contract with U.S. Marshals to hold people detained by ICE.

Some Butler County residents and two Republican Butler County commissioners also have expressed a level of discomfort about the jail's status as an ICE detention site.

Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones has said his deputies treat all inmates in the jail properly and that the contract is about supporting the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants without authorization in the United States.

But that hasn't been enough to prevent growing questions about the jail.

""Having the ICE facility in our county links us to what we’ve come to see as an unfair and unduly harsh administration of new immigration laws,"" the faith leaders' letter reads. ""We are also concerned about reports of abuse suffered by some detainees in ICE facilities. And as those who are ministering to the local immigrant population, and often the Latino community as well, we can testify that law-abiding residents are now afraid to report crimes for fear of being arrested instead of aided.""

The sheriff's office said in a statement it offered a tour of jail facilities to the faith leaders who wrote the July 28 letter. Members of that group WVXU talked to confirmed that tour will take place Aug. 13.

'Doing the right thing' with 'an open mind'

Rev. John Wagner of the Seven Mile United Methodist Church helped write the letter. He says he has deep respect for law enforcement. And he applauded the sheriff's offer of a tour and the transparency it implied. But he also said he felt a responsibility to ask ""hard questions"" about what is going on inside the jail.

""I'll be going in with an open mind, but I also want to do the right thing and see that people are being treated fairly and humanely,"" he said.

The Butler County Sheriff's Office entered into its contract with the federal government Feb. 1. That contract pays the county $68 a day per person to house ICE detainees. The sheriff's office also gets $36 an hour to help guard and transport detainees. According to the contract, the office bills ICE's Enforcement and Operations Field Office in Detroit for these expenses.

Since signing the contract, the jail has held between 300 and more than 400 ICE detainees at a given time, according to BCSO.

The sheriff's office had entered into a previous contract to house federal detainees in 2003. It ended that contract in 2021. At the time, Jones said it was no longer financially feasible to uphold the agreement. BCSO signed the new contract shortly after President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

Allegations of mistreatment

Tine, the Senegalese immigrant with a stomach ailment, was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and detained in the Butler County Jail May 22 after missing a routine immigration appointment in Cleveland regarding his asylum claim. His attorney says he missed that appointment because the person who was driving him had car troubles.

Like most people held in ICE detention, Tine has no serious criminal record in local courts — the only charge in local court systems is a 2023 dismissed misdemeanor for driving without a license in Hamilton County.

Tine says he has gastrointestinal issues that he has struggled with for a few years. He's gone to the hospital on multiple occasions, where he says he was told he has a tear in his stomach and needs a specialist.

That condition has worsened during his time in the jail, Tine and his advocates say.

""Every time I try to eat, I throw up,"" he said during a recent phone call. ""I'm not getting medical attention. They give me a medication I used to get a long time ago. It's not helping me at all.""

WVXU is working to secure a signed release form to access Tine's jail medical records. A reporter also submitted questions to the county about how medical care works for ICE detainees in the jail more generally.

According to a detailed response from BCSO's Jonathan Davidson, the jail bills ICE for prescription medication and necessary medical procedures for detainees.

They get care at the jail's infirmary, which is open 24 hours a day. If an emergency the certified doctors and nurses on staff at the infirmary can't handle arises, detainees can be transported to nearby hospitals.

That's happened 11 times over the duration of the current contract with ICE, records show. Davidson said records of current expenditures on medical care for ICE detainees were not available at this time.

Other concerns

Several high-profile cases, including the detention and eventual deportation of Cincinnati Public high school grad and Honduran immigrant Emerson Colindres, have drawn attention to the jail's ICE contract. The July 28 letter from faith leaders mentions the case of another Honduran asylum seeker, Armando Reyes, who was arrested by ICE this summer and is detained in Butler County Jail.

Another case centering on the jail is that of former Children's Hospital Chaplain Imam Ayman Soliman.

Soliman was detained by ICE July 9 after his asylum status was revoked. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has made claims in court filings that Soliman has ties to terrorist groups and was wanted for murder in Iraq, though it has yet to provide evidence of this. His legal team has denied these claims.

Soliman's attorneys filed a motion in early August seeking his release from the Butler County Jail on the grounds he's being mistreated there. They allege Soliman was put in solitary confinement earlier this month without a compelling reason and was cut off from his attorneys and spiritual advisors.

Attorney Nazly Mamedova says Soliman has been serving as a Muslim chaplain at the jail. She acknowledges that many of the guards at the jail have been willing to let Soliman do this. But she says when he asked one guard for clarification about a prayer session, he was declared to be insubordinate and put in segregated custody. Mamedova says the extended time he spent in solitary confinement was very difficult for him.

""He was heavily depressed,"" she said. ""Part of him is talking to people as chaplain. So putting him in isolation without the ability to talk to anyone, that definitely brought his spirits down.""

Controversy over previous ICE contract

The treatment of ICE detainees under the BCSO's previous contract with the federal government is the subject of at least one federal lawsuit. In it, attorneys for Bayong Brown Bayong and Ahmed Adem allege the two immigrants detained by ICE in Butler County experienced physical abuse at the hands of guards there in 2020, including beatings and being pushed down a set of stairs.

Filings by attorneys for the county dispute this, saying no one was pushed down stairs and that force used against the two was proper because they were being disobedient.

Details from the filing shed light on how discipline in the jail works.

""In a correctional facility, a detainee who questions the lawful orders of a corrections officer or who demands to speak with a higher-ranking officer is effectively disobeying, which is a form of resistance,"" the county's answer to allegations reads, noting that such detainees are considered ""a real threat to institutional security"" subject to use-of-force, detainment in solitary confinement, or other discipline.

Later in the filing, the county describes one metric used to determine if use-of-force is appropriate.

""If a corrections officer’s assessment of a situation reasonably leads them to believe that they may be assaulted by an inmate who is in close proximity to them, the corrections officer does not have to wait to actually be assaulted before reacting with reasonable force,"" it reads.

The lawsuit is still working its way through federal court.

Growing concern

Data revealing most ICE detainees in the jail who don't have other criminal charges against them has led to some pushback around the BCSO contract with the federal government.

Records show that only about 30% of people held on ICE detainers in the Butler County Jail have other, non-immigration related offenses.

That fact drew several Butler County residents to the July 15 Butler County Commission meeting to voice their displeasure at the contract.

Hamilton resident John K. Roberts said he's uneasy about what is happening with ICE detentions of otherwise-law abiding people just because they're undocumented.

""These people are being rounded up by individuals in military uniforms with face masks. No ID, no warrants,"" he said. ""I just wonder what the hell happened. Why have people come to the conclusion that this is a good thing?""

County Commissioners Don Dixon and TC Rogers promised they would ask Sheriff Jones questions about the treatment of detainees in the jail.

""When I hear that our sheriff is just going after what I deem normal people who have come here illegally but are working, that is different than what I'm told was the plan that started after January 20,"" Rogers said. ""That was to get rid of the criminals... there are a lot of those criminals to go first before you start thinking about the people who just came here and have not had a criminal infraction. I will discuss that with the sheriff, but what you're saying is contrary to what I've been told.""

The Center Square

In the first six months of the Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Houston arrested 356 illegal foreign nationals who are confirmed gang members.

Combined, they illegally entered the U.S. 1,434 times and were convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses, ICE said.

“Despite attempts by some to undermine the courageous work being done by our officers, the brave men and women of ICE continue to put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and dangerous criminal aliens,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations-Houston acting Field Office Director Gabriel Martinez said. “In just the past couple of years in Houston, transnational gang members were responsible for brutally raping and murdering an innocent 12-year-old girl on her way to the store. Our officers know their efforts can help prevent atrocities like that from ever occurring again and they won’t rest until they’re all gone.”

Overall, ICE ERO-Houston officers arrested confirmed members of more than 40 gangs. The greatest number of gang arrests was 159 from the Paisas gang. The next greatest number was 39 confirmed MS-13 members and 25 Tren de Aragua members, which the Trump administration designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Other arrests were of confirmed Tango Blast, 15th Street Gang, Latin Kings and Surenos-13 gang members.

Of their combined 1,685 criminal convictions, offenses include abduction, homicide, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, promotion of child pornography, aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglary, alien smuggling, sex trafficking, organized crime, drug trafficking, drug possession, arson, trespassing, unlawful possession of a firearm, illegal entry, illegal reentry, fraud, escape and evading arrest, ICE said.

Of the worst offenders arrested that ICE highlighted, all are men and citizens of El Salvador and Mexico.

One Mexican national and confirmed Surenos-13 gang member, Jonathan Morales-Abundis, 30, was arrested after illegally entering the U.S. 29 times, ICE said. His illegal entries total nearly his age. Despite that, he was only convicted three times for illegal reentry and once for alien smuggling and illegal entry.

Another arrested Surenos-13 gang member was Juan Manuel Cayetano-Vasquez, 48, who illegally entered the U.S. 13 times, ICE said. His convictions include six for drug possession and three for resisting arrest; twice each for domestic violence, assault and identity theft; and once each for false imprisonment, illegal entry, illegal reentry, battery and destroying evidence, ICE said.

An arrested Latin Kings member and Mexican national, Luis Alberto Hernandez, 46, illegally entered the U.S. three times. His rap sheet, according to ICE, includes four convictions for domestic violence, three for illegal reentry, twice for aggravated assault, and once each for drug trafficking, unlawful possession of a firearm, obstructing police, disorderly conduct, drug possession, interfering with a 911 emergency call and child abuse.

Salvadoran nationals arrested include Milton Alexander Magana Fuentes, 31, a child predator and Paisas gang member who illegally entered the U.S. four times, ICE said. His convictions include sexual indecency with a child, failure to register as a sex offender, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Salvadoran MS-13 gang member arrests include Ronald Alberto Rivas-Aguilar, 28, who illegally entered twice and was convicted of homicide, and Jonathan Josue Valle-Moralez, 31, who was previously deported, ICE said. He was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and in March was transferred into U.S. Marshals’ custody to be prosecuted for homicide.

ICE highlighted arrests of Mexican nationals and confirmed Paisas gang members including Luis Fernando Nava-Garcia, 20, who ICE said illegally entered the U.S. 40 times, more than twice the number of years he’s been alive. Yet, he was only convicted twice for illegal reentry.

Other confirmed Paisas gang members arrested include Javier Ivan Montoya-Avila, 34, who illegally entered 26 times. His convictions include burglary, tampering with government records, criminal trespass, illegal reentry and illegal entry, ICE said; Humberto Romero Avila, 45, who illegally entered 10 times. He was deported to Mexico where he was wanted for homicide, ICE said. His convictions include four DWIs, larceny, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Others Paisas gang member arrests include Jose Angel Martinez, 39, who illegally entered five times. His convictions include sexual indecency with a minor, aggravated assault of a family member, resisting arrest, burglary, drug possession and obstructing police, ICE said; Samuel Valenzuela Martinez, 55, who illegally entered the U.S. five times. His convictions include six DWIs, three convictions each for assault and illegal entry, and once each for hit-and-run, larceny, cruelty toward a child, evading arrest, fraud and illegal reentry, ICE said; Juan Pablo Hernandez Ramos, 35, a child predator who was deported three times. His convictions include possession with intent to promote child pornography, sexual assault, aggravated assault, illegal entry and illegal reentry, ICE said.

The visit comes less than a week after Crow announced he is suing the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully blocked him from entering the center in violation of a federal law allowing members of Congress to make unannounced inspections.

After Crow’s July 20 inspection attempt, spokespersons for Homeland Security’s ICE division said that the congressperson did not give a required seven-days notice before his visit, and so he was not admitted as a matter of department policy.

“In this case, the congressman’s request did not comply with the mandatory seven-day advance notice requirement,’ ICE officials said in a statement to the Sentinel. “DHS policy clearly requires requests to tour ICE detention facilities be submitted at least seven calendar days in advance for scheduling. This longstanding policy allows for the appropriate coordination necessary to protect facility operations.”

Crow, who represents Aurora and the 6th Congressional District, which includes the Aurora ICE jail, said in his July 30 lawsuit, that the ICE policy violates federal law.

“The Trump Administration attempting to require advance notice for Members of Congress to do their jobs is against the law,” Crow told the Sentinel. “Congress has the authority to make laws — and the law is clear: Members of Congress have the right to immediately access federal facilities to conduct oversight. Try as they might, the Administration cannot ignore the law.”

Crow said the obstanance shown by the Trump administration in Aurora and across the country is especially worrisome giving the troubling past at many of these immigrant holding facilities, especially the GEO facility in Aurora.

Crow’s congressional staff said he will be joined by Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen. The time of the inspection was not made public.

“It’s pretty clear this administration is erecting barriers to obstruct congressional oversight, which raises the very obvious question of, why and what are they hiding? What don’t they want people to know? What questions don’t want people to ask?” Crow said Wednesday. “It should worry everybody pretty deeply. It worries me, and it actually makes it even more important that we double down on our job and we get answers.”

Crow is joined in the lawsuit, filed in a DC federal court, by other congressional representatives who said they, too, were denied access to federal detention facilities. Others joining the lawsuit include representatives Joe Neguse, D-CO, Jamie Raskin, D-MD, Bennie Thompson D-MS, Veronica Escobar D-TX, Dan Goldman, D-NY, Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, Jimmy Gomez, D-CA, Norma Torres D-CA, Raul Ruiz, D-CA, Robert Garcia , D-CA, and Lou Correa, D-CA.

Since taking office in 2019, Crow has made oversight of immigration detention centers a signature issue, introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure members of Congress can make unannounced, in-person visits to such facilities.

He has inspected the Aurora center nine times, while his staff has conducted more than 70 additional inspections. Crow also publishes public reports on facility conditions, including health and treatment concerns.

The Aurora facility, operated by the private prison company GEO Group, has faced years of scrutiny from immigrant advocates who have been critical of alleged overcrowding, poor medical care and improper detainee treatment.

“Since President Trump was elected, this administration has denied Members of Congress access to immigration detention facilities and tried to intimidate us from doing our jobs,” Crow said previously “I will not be deterred from conducting lawful oversight, and I’ll continue fighting to hold the administration accountable, including in Congress and the courts.”",https://i0.wp.com/sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/AP17172779779224.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 02:56:49.127931

Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho have risen steeply in 2025, the Idaho Capital Sun reported this week, increasing from 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho between January and June 2024 to 368 reported arrests during the same period this year.

In the Kootenai County jail, the number of border patrol holds has soared this year, though public records indicate that many individuals who have been booked into the county jail have not been convicted of any crime.

In years past, as few as two or three people a month were jailed in Kootenai County due to their immigration status. Local arrest numbers have increased as ICE has expanded its enforcement priorities in response to the Trump administration’s orders.

A total of 135 people were booked into the Kootenai County jail on a border patrol or immigration hold between Jan. 1 and May 20, according to public records, with more arrests occurring each week.

While 44 of those 135 people were contacted by law enforcement and arrested in North Idaho, mostly in Kootenai and Shoshone counties, the remaining two-thirds were arrested in Washington or Montana and transported to Kootenai County for holding.

(KGO) -- In the North Bay, immigration activists have staged a hunger strike. They're camping outside the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors offices, demanding leaders pass a sanctuary ordinance protecting the immigrant community from ICE raids.

Ten hunger strikers wearing red wristbands were being entertained Sunday by supporters to keep their spirits up. There was no food here, but lots of hydration.

""We started Tuesday morning. Today, we're on day six,"" said immigration advocate Renee Saucedo.

Saucedo is taking part in the hunger strike, camping outside the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors offices. The group is urging supervisors to pass a sanctuary ordinance to protect local immigrant communities from federal ICE raids, which are happening in the North Bay and across the state.

""We're asking for an ordinance that requires county employees not to share information or collaborate with ICE. It's very straight forward,"" Saucedo said.

""I'm so terrified. I carry my passport, because we've had people who are U.S. citizens being detained,"" said Naomi Lossy.

Lossy says conditions for the hunger strike haven't been ideal.

""Coconut water has been a lifesaver. We've been trying to stay cool in the shade as much as possible,"" Lossy said.

Several cities in North Bay have sanctuary policies, along with San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose.

Some Sonoma County supervisors support the hunger strikers right to free speech but say a sanctuary ordinance would have little legal effect against federal immigration policies and could bring unwanted scrutiny to the county.

Supervisor Lynda Hopkins tells ABC7 News, ""Adopting a sanctuary ordinance could cause harm, it risks creating a false sense of security and contributes to misinformation. Worse, it may put a target on the backs of local immigrants and refugees -- particularly under a federal administration that has demonstrated a willingness to pursue retribution.""

""Sadly, it has to do with fear of lawsuits and losing funding,"" Saucedo said.

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive.
When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.
Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.
Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.","SEATTLE — Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand national and mother of three, believed she had done everything right.

She had checked her documents, confirmed her visa status, and felt confident she could make a quick trip across the Canadian border to drop off her two older children at Vancouver International Airport for a flight to New Zealand, where they would visit their grandparents.

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive. The crossing into Canada went smoothly. The return to Everett did not.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” said Victoria Besancon, a close friend of Shaw. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

That assumption proved wrong.

When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.

“This was a simple administrative error,” said Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward. “Anyone could have made it.”

Shaw is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency and holds what is known as a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides both work authorization and advance parole, which allows international travel and re-entry.

While her work authorization had been approved, her advance parole had not.

“Border Patrol had the discretion to parole her into the U.S.,” Thorward said. “I told her, yes, you don’t have a travel document, but you’ve only been gone about a day. Just explain what happened to the immigration officials.”

Shaw immigrated to the United States three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her then-husband. While divorce often jeopardizes a green card application, she qualified to reapply independently under provisions for survivors of domestic abuse.

She is now being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, one of only two facilities in the country that detain families facing deportation.

“Being treated like a criminal has been very embarrassing,” Besancon said. “One of the hardest parts for her has been her job finding out what was going on.”

Shaw works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and is a member of union Local 341. She serves at Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie.

“She’s a civil servant who works with some of the most at-risk youth in our community,” Besancon said. “She handles some of the hardest cases you can imagine.”

Thorward said Shaw remains eligible for a green card and believes that, in previous years, she likely would have been released quickly. But under the current presidential administration, she added, “anything’s possible.”

“With everything this administration has done, they’ve chosen cruelty intentionally — over and over,” she said.

Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.

“There was absolutely no reason for him to be detained. It’s unconscionable,” she said.

Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.

“You never think it’s going to happen to you,” Besancon said. “The main thing Sarah has expressed throughout this ordeal is just absolute shock and devastation. She truly believed she had done everything that was required of her.”

Besancon created a GoFundMe to raise funds to pay her rent and legal representation in both Washington and Texas. According to the campaign, Shaw has depleted her savings while in detainment.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9/20250811T014633/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:57:04.793565

Joe Neguse joined a dozen House Democrats on Wednesday in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new policy that limits congressional lawmakers’ access to federal immigration detention centers.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security recently implemented a rule requiring members of Congress to give seven days’ notice before visiting detention centers while limiting access to certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices.

The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates a federal law that allows for unannounced inspections of detention centers by Congress. While the Department of Homeland Security can issue guidance on how much notice lawmakers should give, federal law allows for immediate entry.

“Such blatant disregard for both the law and the constitutional order by the Trump administration warrants a serious and decisive response, which is why I’m proud to lead the lawsuit we proceeded with earlier today,” Neguse said in a statement.

Neguse’s office raised concerns about reports of “mistreatment, overcrowding,” and “unsanitary conditions” in detention centers.

Detentions of immigrants have risen sharply since the beginning of Trump’s second term, particularly over the past few months. Data released by ICE in late July shows the agency currently holding nearly 57,000 people, a record.

Data shows that nearly half of detainees — 26,474 people — do not have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges, but are instead listed as an “other immigration violator.” Nearly 30% of detainees were listed as having a criminal conviction, while the remainder, less than 25%, had a pending criminal charge.

ICE’s most recent report, as of June 26, also shows that 13 people have died in immigration detention this year.

Lawmakers’ lawsuit comes after several Democrats in Congress reported being denied entry to detention facilities.

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, whose 6th Congressional District includes a detention center in Aurora, said he was denied entry to the facility in July, despite bringing a printout of the law that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced. Crow is among the dozen House Democrats who joined Wednesday’s lawsuit.

And you did vote for the one ‘big, beautiful bill,'” CBS News’s Margaret Brennan said on “Face the Nation.”

“And it includes a provision that allows families with children to be held indefinitely, which contradicts that long-standing precedent of putting a 20-day limit on detaining children. Do you think that needs to be changed in future legislation? Should there be limits on detaining kids?” Brennan asked.

“Possibly. I mean, the legislative piece is a much more long road,” Gonzalez replied. “What I’ve seen under both the Biden administration and the Trump administration is that it’s … a delicate balance, right? How do you keep families together? How do you make sure that there — there is coordination to what — to what country they’re going to?”

In the first few months of his second term, President Trump’s administration has intensely cracked down on immigration.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration resumed family detention of immigrants, according to a legal nonprofit, rekindling a controversial practice mostly reduced under the Biden administration.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) also recently eliminated the age cap for new hires, letting those older than 40 become a part of its deportation force.

Ms Mahmood is also set to remove a requirement that means foreign criminals are only automatically considered for removal if they receive a 12-month prison sentence.
Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has also looked to outflank Sir Keir Starmer on border controls, saying the Tories would “deport all foreign criminals.
Under the Conservatives, foreign criminals served half of their sentence in our jails before being deported.
Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.","Foreign criminals who “abuse our hospitality” will be deported as soon as they are convicted, the Justice Secretary has said.

Shabana Mahmood will introduce new laws that mean migrants who are handed a prison sentence will automatically be removed from the UK immediately.

Writing for The Telegraph, she said she was “horrified” by the crimes of overseas nationals who must “lose their right to call our country home”.

However, critics said the measures were unlikely to work because foreigners would still be able to use human rights laws to thwart their deportation.

Ms Mahmood’s intervention comes amid controversy over crimes committed by some asylum seekers put up in taxpayer-funded hotels.

Last week, The Telegraph revealed that at least 200 people living in the hotels had been charged with a combined 425 offences this year.

That requirement is already scheduled to be cut to 30 per cent from September, and will be removed entirely from next year.

Ms Mahmood is also set to remove a requirement that means foreign criminals are only automatically considered for removal if they receive a 12-month prison sentence.

The Justice Secretary, who is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, said she was “horrified by those who come to our country and commit crimes here”.

“When foreign nationals commit a serious crime, the appropriate punishment is clear to me: they must be sent packing,” she wrote.

“For too long, victims have watched on as those who harmed them not only completed their sentences here, but in many cases were then allowed to remain indefinitely, with many going on to re-offend.

“From now on, that will change. Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.”

There are currently more than 10,000 migrants in Britain’s prisons, their incarceration costing the taxpayer half a billion pounds every year.

This is despite a shortage of prison spaces, which has forced Ms Mahmood to release some dangerous criminals early to avert overcrowding.

She has sent teams into prisons to identify inmates for deportation, and has increased the rate of removals by 14 per cent compared with the last Tory government.

Labour is under growing pressure from Reform UK over immigration, particularly in its Red Wall seats.

Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, said the first thing he would do as Prime Minister would be to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has also looked to outflank Sir Keir Starmer on border controls, saying the Tories would “deport all foreign criminals. No ifs, no buts.”

The Home Office separately said it had abandoned plans to house asylum seekers in a town centre flat after protests led by Suella Braverman.

Officials told the former Tory home secretary that Clearsprings, a Home Office contractor, would no longer be seeking to “procure” a converted high-street clothes shop, which would have housed 35 asylum seekers.

The plan in Waterlooville, part of Mrs Braverman’s constituency in Hampshire, prompted more than 2,000 people to turn out at a high-street protest in July. More than 10,000 residents signed a petition opposing the scheme.

Barred for life

Ms Mahmood’s changes would mean all deported criminals would be barred from re-entering the UK for life.

People serving life sentences for murder would not be deported, nor would individuals who could pose a danger from abroad if they were released.

This would include terror suspects and could also cover criminals such as people-smugglers and drug kingpins who would look to ply their trade in the UK.

Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is leading a review of how Article 8 of the convention, which guarantees the right to family life, is being interpreted by UK courts.

She is also looking at a number of cases where Article 3, against torture or inhumane and degrading treatment, has been enforced in deportation cases.

The Telegraph has revealed a string of cases where overseas criminals have used human rights laws to successfully fight against deportation.

In one case, a Nigerian conman who duped women out of almost £200,000 avoided removal because his wife and children were being treated by the NHS.

Foreign criminals forfeit their right to stay in Britain

By Shabana Mahmood

Like many who are born to immigrant parents, I am horrified by those who come to our country and commit crimes here. My parents came to Britain, from rural Kashmir, because they knew this was a nation where the law rules, above all else, and where crime will be punished. To be welcomed into this country, as my parents were, is to assume responsibilities as well as rights.

For that reason, when foreign nationals commit a serious crime, the appropriate punishment is clear to me: they must be sent packing. By failing to live up to their responsibilities, they must lose their right to call our country their home. They must be deported.

Unfortunately, this was not the situation I inherited in our prisons. On taking office, one in every eight prisoners was a foreign national, each housed in our prisons at considerable expense to the taxpayer.

Since the general election in July 2024, this Government has been deporting foreign national offenders in great numbers and at pace. In our first 12 months, we have deported almost 5,200 foreign criminals – a figure that is 14 per cent higher than the last Conservative government achieved in the previous year.

But I am clear that this is not enough. Under the Conservatives, foreign criminals served half of their sentence in our jails before being deported. I have already taken steps to lower that to 30 per cent and now I am going further still. As a result of the change that the Government is announcing on Sunday, foreign prisoners will soon face being deported from the very first day of their sentence. They will not only be made to leave; they will also be barred from returning to the UK.

The financial case is clear

These new powers will apply to those convicted in the future, so anyone who comes to Britain knows that complying with our laws is not optional, and failing to do so has consequences. These changes will also apply to those already serving sentences in our prisons, who will be removed from this country as quickly as possible. In fact, I have already deployed new, specialist removal teams to prisons across England and Wales. They are identifying foreign offenders right now, and working with the Home Office to remove them from our country.

The financial case for making this change is clear. The cost of keeping foreign national offenders in our jails is a staggering £500m every year. Taxpayers’ money can and must be better spent.

But this is not just about economics. It is about justice too. For too long, victims have watched on as those who harmed them not only completed their sentences here, but – in many cases – were then allowed to remain indefinitely, with many going on to reoffend. From now on, that will change. Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.

Our country has always welcomed those who come here legally, contribute to our society and make this country their home – just as my parents did when they arrived in the 1970s. But public confidence in our immigration system, and our justice system, demands that there are consequences whenever laws are broken. With the right to call this country home comes a responsibility to live by its rules. Now, thanks to this Government and our Plan for Change, those who come here and commit crimes know, without question, that they are no longer welcome here.

Emmy-winning actor John Leguizamo called Cain a “moron” and a “has/been,” criticizing his decision to support ICE given his Japanese American heritage.
Cain is half-Japanese on his father’s side, his birth name being Dean Tanaka.
Cain himself has a background in law enforcement, having served as a reserve police officer in Idaho and Virginia.
His decision to join ICE reflects a personal commitment to the former president’s agenda on immigration enforcement.","Actor Dean Cain, best known for his role as Superman in the 1990s TV series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, announced his decision to join U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Cain, 59, revealed his plans on his personal X account and during several appearances on FOX News this week, stating he would soon be sworn in as an ICE agent to support former President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement initiatives.

Cain’s announcement immediately sparked backlash from Hollywood figures. Emmy-winning actor John Leguizamo called Cain a “moron” and a “has/been,” criticizing his decision to support ICE given his Japanese American heritage. Comedian Margaret Cho and “Glee” star Kevin McHale also expressed disapproval, with McHale dismissing the move as a desperate publicity stunt.

Cho also specifically pointed out Cain’s own immigrant heritage. Cain is half-Japanese on his father’s side, his birth name being Dean Tanaka. In a previous interview with Variety, Cain explained that he’s proud of his Japanese lineage and family, even showing off a tattoo on his ankle that he says honors them.

Other celebrities commented or lauded these more public response in their comments, like Academy Award winning actor Tatum O’Neal responding with six clapping emojis and director Lee Daniels with a simple laughing comment. Actor Frank Grillo, who played Rick Flag Sr. in the 2025 Superman movie, responded to Leguizamo calling Cain a “has been” and instead calling Cain a “never was.”

ICE’s recruitment policies now add context to Cain’s move. The agency recently removed upper age limits, allowing applicants as young as 18 and without an age cap, aiming to fill staffing shortages. To attract recruits, ICE is offering up to $50,000 in signing bonuses, student loan forgiveness, and enhanced retirement benefits. Social media for the Department of Homeland Security, the department that oversees ICE, is packed with recruitment posts, evoking old “Uncle Sam” and World War II style artwork.

Yet despite these incentives, critics highlight a glaring gender gap. Female agents remain severely underrepresented, raising concerns about inclusivity in the agency’s ranks. None of the recent marketing for the job have included any female personnel. Instead, every official government poster and ad for recruitment are (as of today) all white men or caricatures of white historic American propaganda.

Cain himself has a background in law enforcement, having served as a reserve police officer in Idaho and Virginia. He has been an outspoken supporter of Trump’s immigration policies and has openly criticized the “woke” reinterpretations of Superman in recent media. His decision to join ICE reflects a personal commitment to the former president’s agenda on immigration enforcement.

This development highlights how often celebrities influence political debates, often provoking polarized reactions and magnifying contentious issues like immigration. ICE’s new recruitment strategies reflect significant policy shifts intended to bolster the agency amid increasing demands, even as they expose challenges around workforce diversity.",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2201518068.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 15:56:24.672681

You made a commitment and put your own political career over the livelihoods of immigrants in Orange County.”","Orlando, FL – On August 2, around 30 community members held an emergency rally at the Orange County Commission chambers to demand the county vote against ratifying an updated agreement to its contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. The updated agreement represents another attack on immigrants in the county.

The mobilization was called for by Orlando Against Police Crimes, after Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings caved in to threats from Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.

Protesters gathered near the busy downtown street and chanted “No camps, no hate, no ICE in our state!” while holding signs in support of immigrant rights before moving in front of the commission building for speeches.

Several organizations mobilized alongside Orlando Against Police Crimes, including Orlando 50501, Orlando for Peace, and Orlando 50501 Latinos. State Representative Anna Eskamani delivered a speech in solidarity.

“We aren't going to let Ron DeSantis and his cronies bully our town into doing Donald Trump's bidding. We aren't going to allow our resources to be used to ship our brothers and sisters to the concentration camp in the Everglades. And we'll keep fighting until all of these inhumane black sites are shut down for good,” said Cassia Laham, an organizer with Orlando Against Police Crimes and the event’s emcee.

Just a few weeks before, the Orange County commission voted unanimously to not sign an addendum to the county’s 287(g) contract with ICE. This addendum would have county correctional officers responsible for transportation of immigration detainees to facilities such as the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp in the Everglades, which is known for its inhumane conditions and human rights abuses. The commission also decided on renegotiating its Intergovernmental Service Agreement, or IGSA contract with the U.S. Marshals Service which allowed the county jail to house detainees from other localities before their transfer to another facility. A local group called the Immigrants Are Welcome Here Coalition played a leading role in those victories for the immigrant community.

In response, DeSantis and Uthmeier launched a slew of attacks against Mayor Demings and the rest of the commission. In a letter to the county commission, Uthmeier stated, “Florida law forbids sanctuary policies and requires locals to use ‘best efforts’ to assist with immigration enforcement.” DeSantis then threatened to remove Demings and other commissioners if they did not sign the addendum to allow transportation of immigration detainees.

Shortly after stating that he would not be bullied into compliance by DeSantis and his cronies, Mayor Demings signed the addendum on Friday, August 1 and set for it to be voted on and ratified at Tuesday, August 5, county commission meeting.

At the meeting on Tuesday, the reactionary addendum was ratified with a 5 to 2 vote. Commissioners Kelly Semrad and Nicole WIlson were the only two that voted against it. Despite this setback, the local movement for immigrant rights will continue to fight back against any and all attacks on the immigrant community.

Frustrated with the mayor’s backtracking, Jacob Muldoon, a UPS Teamster and member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization said “Mayor Demings, shame on you for betraying our county. You made a commitment and put your own political career over the livelihoods of immigrants in Orange County.”",https://i.snap.as/oj6nREsP.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 14:56:34.334663

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said: This Government is taking radical action to deport foreign criminals, as part of our Plan for Change.
Foreign offenders make up around 12% percent of the total prison population with prison places costing £54,000 a year on average.
The measures will apply to all foreign national offenders already in custody as well as those newly sentenced, ensuring that taxpayers’ money will not be wasted on incarcerating foreign criminals in the future.
The changes to enable the immediate deportation of foreign prisoners require primary legislation and will be brought before Parliament in due course.","The new power announced today (10 August) will get foreign national offenders out of our prisons, saving money for British taxpayers and protecting the public from dangerous criminals.

The change follows legislation introduced by the Government in June, which will mean most foreign prisoners can now be deported after serving 30 percent of their prison time, rather than 50 percent.

Today, the Government has announced it will go even further—stripping back a decades-old law to introduce new powers for immediate deportation from prison. Offenders who are deported are barred from re-entering the UK, keeping their victims and the wider public safe. Terrorists, murderers and others serving life sentences will continue to have to serve their prison sentence before being considered for deportation.

Ramping up removals of foreign national offenders has been a priority for this Government with almost 5,200 deported since July 2024 – an increase of 14% compared to the same 12 months prior. We have also invested £5 million for the deployment of specialist staff to almost 80 jails with one clear mission – speeding up removals. These are all now in post.

This is part of our Plan for Change to fix the broken criminal justice system we inherited and make our streets safer. This includes building 14,000 more prison places, reforming sentencing and ensuring victims get the support they need.

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said:

This Government is taking radical action to deport foreign criminals, as part of our Plan for Change. Deportations are up under this Government, and with this new law they will happen earlier than ever before.

Our message is clear: if you abuse our hospitality and break our laws, we will send you packing.

These measures build on broader work during the Government’s first year in office to deliver on the British public’s priorities for border security and ramp up returns which has now seen 35,000 people with no right to be here returned since the election, including over 5,000 FNOs.

The changes will apply to prisoners serving fixed-term, or determinate, sentences and discretion to not use the measure on a case-by-case basis will be retained. For example, where there is clear evidence a prisoner is planning further crimes against UK interests such as posing a threat to national security they will not be released.

Foreign offenders make up around 12% percent of the total prison population with prison places costing £54,000 a year on average.

The measures will apply to all foreign national offenders already in custody as well as those newly sentenced, ensuring that taxpayers’ money will not be wasted on incarcerating foreign criminals in the future.

We are committed to further ramping up returns activity, including exploring returns hubs, introducing a ground-breaking new returns treaty with France which will see small boat arrivals detained and returned to France, and will set out major reforms to the asylum appeals system later this year, working with a range of countries to strengthen law enforcement, border security and returns.

Our Immigration White Paper will end the addiction to cheap overseas labour that saw net migration explode to nearly one million in recent years by replacing it with an immigration system that is controlled, selective and fair and boosting opportunities for homegrown talent. The White Paper also includes plans to introduce legislation that tightens the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and sets out reforms to make it easier to remove foreign criminals convicted of any offence before the threat they pose escalates.

The changes to enable the immediate deportation of foreign prisoners require primary legislation and will be brought before Parliament in due course.

Further information

In May, the Independent Sentencing Review recommended the law change so most foreign prisoners could be deported after serving 30 percent of their prison time, rather than 50 percent, and up to four years before their release, rather than the current 18 months.

The Government laid secondary legislation in June and this is expected to come into force in September, at which point prisoners with no right to be in the country will face deportation 30% into their prison part of their sentence rather than the current 50%.

This will be reduced to 0% once the primary legislation this power requires is in force.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a37db21ed915d5a62fdc762/s960_ministry-of-justice.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 15:56:20.031398

Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.
Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.
But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.
Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group.","In a recent decision denying asylum to a Salvadoran woman being stalked by gang members, the Board of Immigration Appeals — the highest administrative body for interpreting U.S. immigration law — found that under U.S. law, her claim that Salvadoran women constitute a group of people at risk of persecution was “overbroad and insufficiently particular to be cognizable.”

The foundation of refugee law — both internationally and in the U.S. — is that asylum should be provided to a person with a well-founded fear of being persecuted on any of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or “membership in a particular social group.” This last category is intended to protect people similarly exposed to persecution as the other four groups because of immutable characteristics that cannot be changed or beliefs so fundamental they should not be required to change them.

There are precedents in both U.S. and international law for treating women as a “particular social group.” In Perdomo v. Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.

But in denying this woman’s claim, the Board said, “If we held that groups defined solely by sex were cognizable, we would essentially create another protected ground under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] — that of sex — to add to the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” That, it said, would be a job for Congress.

Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large? In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection. All that should matter is the likelihood of the risk that person faces and the severity of the threat to them or of the abuse they have experienced.

Of course, being a woman per se is not grounds for asylum, any more than being a member of any race, nationality or religion. But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.

Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group. In the landmark Fauzia Kasinga case, a woman fleeing genital mutilation was granted asylum not based on her right not to be persecuted on the basis of her gender, but rather as a member of a particular social group, defined as “young women who are members of the Tchamba-Kasungu Tribe of northern Togo who have not been subjected to female genital mutilation, as practiced by that tribe, and who oppose the practice.” A more narrowly defined group is hardly conceivable.

Often, though, the compulsion to particularize can distort the reality of persecution. Consider women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. All Afghan girls are barred from education beyond the sixth grade. No woman is allowed to attend university and all face severe restrictions on employment. A woman is not allowed to walk outside her home unless accompanied by a male relative, limiting access to public spaces and services, including access to health care. Violations of the hijab dress code and other draconian rules are met with severe punishment.

In September 2024, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan said the “Taliban’s institutionalized system of…gender persecution…impacts almost the entire population.”

When Congress next looks at U.S. immigration law, it should question why women should have to shoehorn their claims into a narrow understanding of membership of a particular social group and thereby have less consistent or predictable protection than racial, religious, nationality and political groups. In light of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ narrow reading of existing law, Congress should amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to add gender as an unequivocally protected ground of the refugee definition standing alongside race, religion, nationality and political opinion.

If you choose not to work, you do not get free healthcare,” Flood later said, diving into the bill’s controversial imposition of work requirements for many enrollees of Medicaid, the healthcare program for poor and disabled Americans. The heckling only intensified.

Trump’s bill is looming large over senators and representative of both parties as they disperse across the country for Congress’s August recess. Signed by Trump on the Fourth of July holiday, the sprawling piece of legislation extends lower tax rates enacted during his first term, creates new exemptions aimed at working-class voters, and funds his plans for mass deportations of immigrants.

Republicans see it as the epitome of the president’s “promises made, promises kept” mantra, while for Democrats, it presents an opportunity to return from the political wilderness voters banished them to in last year’s elections.

Central to their pitch is the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, its enactment of tax provisions from which the wealthy are expected to see the most benefit, and its overall price tag, which is expected to rise to $3.4tn over the next 10 years.

Democrats also plan to campaign on what the bill does not do. The Republicans who wrote it declined to use the opportunity to extend subsidies for premiums paid by people who receive insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – meaning millions of Americans may find healthcare unaffordable when they expire at the end of the year.

“Between the Medicaid cuts and the ACA cuts, our hospitals are looking at a real phenomenon of people walking into their ERs with no insurance,” the Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin said this week during a town hall in Michigan – a state Trump won last year.

“When you get that letter, when it arrives in your post box, I want you to understand that that increase to your private insurance is because of the cuts that Donald Trump has decided to make just in the past month here, OK. There is a cause and effect.”

Republicans, only a handful of whom have held town halls since the recess began, argue that it is Democrats who will be facing tough questions back home for their unanimous rejection of the bill. Voters will be won over by the legislation’s tax relief for tips, overtime and interest on American cars, larger deductions for taxpayers aged 65 and up, and expansion of immigration enforcement, the party believes, while Medicaid and Snap will ultimately benefit because the measure, they claim, weeds out “waste, fraud and abuse” through stricter work requirements and eligibility checks.

“Republicans are putting working-class Americans first. The one big beautiful bill set that image in concrete for the 2026 midterms, putting Republicans on offense and giving voters a clear, commonsense contrast,” the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a memo. The group has named 26 House districts where it believes Republicans can win, while its adversary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), is targeting 35 seats.

The main battle next year will be for control of the House of Representatives, which the GOP controls by a margin that is expected to shrink to just three seats once recently created vacancies are filled.

Democrats see reasons to believe their strategy of campaigning against the bill is sound. Recent polls from KFF and Quinnipiac University show that the legislation is unpopular, while Trump is seeing his own approval ratings slump. The GOP is also grappling from the messy fallout caused by Trump supporters’ demands for the release of files related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Yet some in the party say making their case will be tricky because of how the measure is written. While it mandates the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), those mostly go into effect only after election day next year.

“Mission number one for us as Democrats is to be educating voters on the actual impacts of the bill and continuing to call out the Republicans that if it was so important to make these cuts to Medicaid and other programs that are happening basically in two years, why aren’t they doing it now? Why don’t they make it now?” said Jane Kleeb, a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the party’s leader in Nebraska, where the House seat around Omaha is expected to be the site of a fervid race to replace the retiring Republican Don Bacon.

“We all know the answer, right, because they want to win some of these races in ’26.”

Brian Jackson, the Democratic party chair in Ingham county, Michigan, said he was not concerned about the bill’s timing undermining their case against Tom Barrett, a first-term Republican congressman. In an interview, he described an atmosphere of uncertainty in the swing district created by the looming benefit cuts, Trump’s tariffs and his administration’s freeze of research funding, which has affected the local Michigan State University.

“The concern goes back to the overall culture of fear and unknown, and that just is horrible for the economy, it’s horrible for jobs, the auto industry. So, you know, Medicaid is just one of many symptoms of an out-of-touch Washington and how it impacts people’s day-to-day lives,” he said.

In California’s Kern county, Democrats are gearing up for a campaign against David Valadao, a Republican congressman and resilient opponent whose district has one of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollment in the nation. Though he voted for Trump’s bill after giving mixed messages about its cuts to Medicaid, the local Democratic party chair, Christian Romo, warned that their delayed impact could frustrate the party’s efforts.

“This is going to devastate this community,” Romo said. But with the provisions not taking effect until after the election, “will people actually feel the implications of that? No. So will they remember that Valadao voted yes on that bill? You know, it’s up in the air, and we’ll have to see.”

Top congressional Democrats argue that even if the cuts themselves are delayed, voters will feel their disruptions coming.

“Companies are making decisions because they know there’s going to be less revenue as a result of a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicaid, the largest Medicaid cut in history of this country,” said Pete Aguilar, the House Democratic caucus chair.

“So, healthcare premiums will rise, that will happen early, insurers will make these decisions as well, and hospitals are going to have to face difficult decisions on what their future looks like.”

Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican political consultant based in Pennsylvania, where the DCCC is looking to oust four Republicans, warned that Democrats can’t count on just the Medicaid cuts to get them back to the majority.

“As America continues to stratify, self-select into separate neighborhoods and communities, you’re going to have a lot of those represented by Republicans that don’t have as much exposure to the Medicaid program, and you’re going to have lots of them represented by Democrats in more urban areas that have more exposure to the Medicaid program,” he said.

“I think Democrats are way out of over their skis, thinking that that alone will get them to the promised land next year.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04c48955b0c3046bd9357f97a57667b70acdac8/572_0_5729_4584/master/5729.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=587075bf9fa1cab7af718ef2c09292ad",N,,2025-08-10 11:56:31.269247

They made 16 arrests. It’s an example of the fastest-growing method for the Department of Homeland Security to juice its mass deportation machine: illegal profiling.

In a new analysis of DHS immigration arrest data for the Cato Institute, I document the shocking number of Latin American immigrants being arrested on the streets with no criminal convictions, no criminal charges and no deportation orders. Nothing that would have put them on the radar of DHS for removal. No reason to seek them out specifically.

In June, one in five DHS immigration arrests targeted a Latino on the streets who had no criminal past nor a removal order against them.

The data was obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act request by the Deportation Data Project — a nonpartisan project headed by a law professor at Berkeley. It gives detailed information on each person arrested by DHS as of June 26. It shows DHS took down 15,000 people on the streets without any criminal history or removal orders since Inauguration Day.

But in June alone, the figure was 7,000 — 90% were Latin American immigrants. There was a jump in these arrests immediately in January, but the recent shift has taken the operation to a whole new level. In June, one in five DHS immigration arrests targeted a Latino on the streets who had no criminal past nor a removal order against them.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email, “This data is being cherry picked by the Deportation Data Project to peddle a false narrative,” adding: “Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target of ICE is that they are in our country illegally — not their skin color. DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence.”

However, we already know that agents are stopping people before they know they’re in the country illegally.

ICE officials told The Wall Street Journal that in mid-May the White House ordered them to stop “develop[ing] target lists of immigrants” and just “go out on the streets” and make arrests right away. The ICE officials told the Washington Examiner they were asked by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, “What do you mean you’re going after criminals? Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?”

Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week.

We can’t know whether there was probable cause for these arrests in every case, but we do know the administration uses sweepingly broad profiling categories because its representatives already told us it does. Deportation czar Tom Homan told Fox News that agents will detain people “based on the location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions like … they walk away.”

DHS describes these interactions as “consensual.” But they are anything but. As a California district court put it, “When individuals have tried to avoid an encounter with agents and officers, they have been followed and pushed to the ground, sometimes even beaten, and then taken away.”

Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week.

In one case, DHS agents pepper-sprayed, tackled and brutally beat a landscaper in Los Angeles after they profiled him outside an IHOP, and — according to DHS — he “refused to answer questions” and tried to leave. After they discovered he was a father of three U.S. Marines, they released him. In another case, agents jumped from a car to arrest a random Latino man on the street who asserted in English, “I have the right to remain silent.”

The one thing that the DHS data does not record: how many times DHS illegally profiles U.S. citizens and legal residents.

Fox News watched agents go “house to house” in a Florida housing development site demanding to see proof of immigration status from workers. The outlet reported agents interrogated 361 workers and arrested just 33. In other words, the number of legal residents being targeted vastly exceeded those who were not legal.

These aren’t simply harmless errors. Border Patrol agents shoved Jason Brian Gavidia against a fence when he told them he was a citizen, demanding to know the hospital where he was born. After agents smashed his car window, U.S. citizen and U.S. veteran George Retes was pepper-sprayed, dragged from his vehicle and detained by ICE for three days without charge, as the AP reported.

ICE agents tackled a 32-year-old U.S. citizen, Andrea Velez, on her way to work. After they learned she was a citizen, they charged her with impeding their efforts to chase down other people to determine “whether they were lawfully present.” In other words, their defense against charges of illegal profiling was: We were profiling someone else! The charges against Velez were dismissed, according to The Guardian.

These tactics are causing chaos in the streets. Bystanders think these arrests could be kidnappings when masked agents don’t identify themselves. A U.S. citizen was pepper-sprayed and arrested trying to stop Velez’s illegal arrest. Surgical center employees were arrested for demanding a warrant from an agent to enter their property to arrest a landscaper whose immigration status he admitted he didn’t know in his affidavit.

All this chaos is also illegal. In fact, it is even blocked by a district court order that was upheld on appeal just this week. The appeals court reaffirmed prior rulings that have found it is unconstitutional to stop or detain people based on broad characteristics that would “cast suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.” It said this included not just race, but also language ability, occupation and location, such as Home Depot.

Not only that, under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration agents don’t even have the authority to interrogate someone without a warrant or reason to believe that the person is a noncitizen. Demanding people prove their right to be in the United States isn’t legal. Whether you’re a citizen or not, you have every right to say: Go away.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250808-ICE-Home-Depot-aa-206-62de2e.jpg",N,,2025-08-10 12:59:44.529818

Newsweek reached out to the White House and U.S. Treasury outside of normal business hours on Saturday afternoon for comment.

Why It Matters

The IRS has suffered significant cutbacks in personnel through the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which experts warned could hamper core tax administration functions.

The push by Trump and Elon Musk, who led DOGE before leaving the White House in May, drew widespread condemnation over the administration's slash-and-burn approach to shrinking the bureaucracy.

Mass layoffs and removals at the IRS have also raised concerns about its ability to process tax returns and refunds.

Long's removal comes less than two months after he was confirmed to lead the IRS. According to the Associated Press, he will be the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862.

What To Know

The Post, citing two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, reported that Long's dismissal followed a disagreement between members of the IRS and the administration after the previously agreed method of data sharing yielded an unsatisfying number of confirmed targets for immigration enforcement.

The Trump administration has previously attempted to access sensitive, confidential data as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration. IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause stepped down for her position in April after refusing to allow immigration enforcement access to taxpayer data, and a federal judge shortly thereafter refused to stop the IRS from sharing immigrant tax information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The deal, agreed to in April, permitted ICE to submit names and addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants to the IRS, which then cross-checks the data against tax filings. Tax information is typically considered confidential and punishable by criminal penalties if improperly shared.

According to the newspaper, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently asked the IRS to locate roughly 40,000 immigrants using their addresses cross-referenced with taxpayer information, but the service only managed to verify about 3 percent of the names submitted.

The people verified had individual taxpayer identification numbers, and White House officials determined this was insufficient and requested information beyond the previously agreed parameters.

Specifically, the administration wanted to know if the people in question had claimed income tax credit, which can reduce the tax bill for low-income filers.

The IRS declined to provide this information, citing taxpayer privacy rights, according to the Post, which Long had previously stated he would not provide due to falling outside the previously agreed parameters.

Trump thereafter removed Long, a former six-term Republican congressman from Missouri, from his post on Friday, making him the ambassador to Iceland and temporarily replacing him with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, marking the fifth change in leadership at the IRS since Trump returned to office in January.

What People Are Saying

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Washington Post in a statement: ""The Trump administration is working in lockstep to eliminate information silos and to prevent illegal aliens from taking advantage of benefits meant for hardworking American taxpayers. Any absurd assertion other than everyone being aligned on the mission is simply false and totally fake news.""

Former IRS Commissioner Billy Long posted on X on Friday: ""It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!""

What Happens Next?

Bessent will serve as acting IRS commissioner while the administration considers a permanent successor, leaving the agency again under interim leadership as it addresses operational strains tied to layoffs and program changes.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699734/irs-commissioner-billy-long-dismissed.png,N,,2025-08-10 11:56:36.442376

Now some are told to start over - NPR,Ximena Bustillo,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/08/10/nx-s1-5487598/asylum-seekers,"Now it appears that the new Trump administration is dismissing applications, effectively making people start over on a process they began years ago.
Per USCIS' process, the credible fear interview is key to pulling someone out of expedited removal prior to filing for asylum.
""The credible fear [interview] is considered a screening tool.
In some letters, applicants are told to await a notice from ICE about when their credible fear interview will be scheduled.
""Once he was released, they did schedule a credible fear interview, but [it] was canceled.","The Trump administration is stripping protections of some asylum applicants who filed as far back as 2019.

NPR has learned that dozens of immigrants across the U.S. have received letters in the mail notifying them that their asylum cases have been dismissed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a branch of the Department of Homeland Security.

The reason, according to the letters: These asylum-seekers, many of whom entered between 2019 and 2022, did not receive a mandatory screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at the border.

The interview is conducted by an asylum officer once someone has been detained or has arrived in the United States. It is meant as an opportunity for a person to describe any fear of persecution they may face if they are returned to their home country.

The U.S. didn't have enough asylum officers to do credible fear interviews for every person crossing the border, given the huge influx of border-crossers starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of the first Trump administration and during the Biden administration, experts told NPR. Now it appears that the new Trump administration is dismissing applications, effectively making people start over on a process they began years ago.

This round of asylum case dismissals is the latest effort by the Trump administration to strip protections from those who have been in the U.S. for years. In the past few months, the administration has limited the ways in which people can seek asylum, has made the process more expensive and is now reviewing already filed claims and dismissing them if parts of the complex application are missing. But as officials expand the scope of whom they are arresting, detaining and deporting, lawyers fear their clients who have been waiting years for their asylum interviews may get caught up in the effort to conduct mass deportations.

Asylum is a form of protection granted to those who either have already entered the U.S. or are at a port of entry, having left their home country. After an application is filed, applicants receive work permits, pay taxes and can enroll in school.

""You're literally making documented people, again, undocumented, and they're already in here,"" said Michelle Marty Rivera, an immigration attorney who has dozens of clients who have received these letters. ""You are canceling employment authorization. You're virtually converting people that are following the normal traditional asylum rules and leaving them without a status and without protection and asking them to show their faces to ICE.""

Lawyers told NPR that in some cases, their clients may have been marked for ""expedited removal"" when they first entered the country. That is a form of deportation for people who have been in the U.S. for less than two years.

When asked about the asylum application dismissals, USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said that if upon reviewing an application, USCIS discovers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection designated a person as in ""expedited removal,"" USCIS administratively closes the application due to a lack of jurisdiction.

""This is a long-standing practice that is not new,"" Tragesser said. Per USCIS' process, the credible fear interview is key to pulling someone out of expedited removal prior to filing for asylum.

""The credible fear [interview] is considered a screening tool. And essentially there's a higher standard that when someone achieves that, then they can then go through the asylum process,"" said Morgan Bailey, a former USCIS official who served under both Trump and Biden, adding that for the last 15 years, the agency has not been able to keep up with the number of asylum-seekers who need credible fear interviews. ""There aren't enough asylum officers to cover the workload, but there has also been such an increase in the number of asylum applications.""

But now, immigration attorneys are warning that immigrants are facing the consequences of that shortage.

Asylum-seekers are bounced around the system

There are different versions of the letters that asylum applicants received, and NPR has reviewed some of them. Applicants began receiving them in July. The letters say that all processing of their asylum application is terminated. In some letters, applicants are told to await a notice from ICE about when their credible fear interview will be scheduled. In others, the letters tell them to report to ICE first and request the interview. Some are not clear on next steps.

Attorney Maria Florencia Garcia has one client who entered through the southern border and was originally put into expedited removal but was released into the U.S. before he received his interview.

""Once he was released, they did schedule a credible fear interview, but [it] was canceled. We tried to get a reschedule for a couple of years. It never happened,"" Florencia Garcia said, adding that they applied for asylum anyway because that must be filed within a year of being in the country. But in recent weeks, that client got the letter notifying them of the dismissal.

""He's unable to work. He's not going to be able to renew his employment authorization card,"" Florencia Garcia said. ""The only way that he's going to be able to proceed is by showing up to ICE, telling them that he has a fear of return, and that will likely get him detained.""

Arno Lemus, another immigration attorney, sees this effort from the second Trump administration as an attempt to reclassify a certain set of asylum applicants who primarily came in during the Biden years.

""They're just doing the process that was allotted to them that was legal and provided to them the moment that they presented themselves in the U.S.,"" Lemus said, noting that some of his clients have also received the letters. ""And now the government's wanting to retroactively go back.""

Lemus agrees with USCIS that the policy is not necessarily new — the credible fear interviews are the prerequisite to filing for asylum. But like other attorneys, Lemus said he has clients who have been waiting for upwards of six years for their asylum case to be reviewed.

""The issue is that people were already released into the U.S. They've already established years of processing. They've paid taxes. They've got jobs. Some of them have made investments in the U.S.,"" Lemus said.

Risk of detention is higher than in the past

The Trump administration this summer unveiled a new policy requiring immigrants who entered the country illegally to be put in detention without an opportunity for release while they fight their cases.

Immigration lawyers told NPR that they are concerned that their clients, who were awaiting their asylum interviews, will get detained if they report to ICE to schedule their credible fear interviews.

""There's a lack of trust. There's a lot of uncertainty that makes people afraid. It makes people not want to fight their cases, whether they're strong or not,"" said Florencia Garcia. ""They just don't want to risk it.""

ICE has increased the number of arrests at immigration courts, and high-profile worksite enforcement operations have left many afraid.

Mark Kelly said his recent meetings with two women detained at the Eloy immigration detention center underscore the flaws of the Trump administration’s campaign to arrest as many immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they pose any threat.

“By any reasonable measure, they should not be in a prison, and I think that’s true for probably most of the people in there,” Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in a telephone interview with the Arizona Daily Star on Thursday afternoon, following his visit to Eloy in Pinal County. “Under a normal functioning government, you wouldn’t be locking these folks up.”

Kelly met with a grandmother named Maria Pelaez, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and has no criminal record, he said. Pelaez, a New Jersey resident, was detained as she entered the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma to help her son and daughter-in-law — both U.S. Marines — care for their 2-year-old son, while the daughter-in-law recovered from surgery.

At the Eloy Detention Center, Pelaez broke into tears when Kelly asked about the pride she felt at her son’s boot-camp graduation, Kelly recalled. Although an immigration judge approved the woman’s release from detention on bond, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is fighting that decision with an appeal, Kelly said.

“They did not want to let her out,” Kelly said. As the mother of someone willing to fight for their country, “she is the exact type of person we should want in this country,” he said.

Kelly said he also met with Kelly Yu, a Peoria restaurant owner who fled Hong Kong in 2004 and whose months-long ICE detention has generated outrage. Yu, whose U.S. citizen child attends Arizona State University, employs 70 people at her three restaurant locations and has no criminal record, yet could be deported any day, Kelly said.

“She’s created a life here. She’s a job creator,” he said. “Present this case to any reasonable person and they would say, ‘What are we doing? Why would we throw this woman out of the country?’ She’s not a risk to anyone. She’s putting food on the table for 70 other families. It just doesn’t make any sense.”

In the Eloy Detention Center, 83% of detainees are classified by ICE as having “no ICE threat level,” meaning they have no criminal convictions, according to the most recent ICE data.

Oversight curtailed under Trump

Kelly is the latest of several Democratic U.S. legislators who have sought to conduct oversight visits at ICE detention centers, as the number of people in ICE detention reaches record levels and concerns about detention conditions are rising.

Democratic lawmakers have been turned away from ICE facilities when making unannounced visits, even though, by law, Congress members are not required to give prior notice of oversight visits.

A dozen Democratic legislators sued the Trump administration on July 30 over the prior-notice requirement it’s imposed on ICE oversight visits.

“Federal law makes it absolutely clear that members of Congress do not have to provide prior notice for those visits, for clear reasons,” said U.S. Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Arizona, on Friday. “That way we don’t get a curated visit. We get an impromptu visit, so we can see conditions as they actually are.”

Turned away after an unannounced visit to Eloy in July, Stanton scheduled an Eloy visit on Aug. 5 and met with 20 detainees who shared “eye-opening” stories, Stanton told the Star. The detainees included asylum seekers and people who said they’ve lived in the U.S. for decades and have no criminal record, he said.

“The president talked about enforcement of immigration laws by going after violent criminals,” Stanton said. “That’s not what’s actually happening.”

U.S. Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, conducted a surprise oversight visit at Eloy in May, in which she said she encountered “sickening” detention conditions. Last month, Ansari said she was denied the opportunity to speak with three detainees, including Yu, who had given permission to speak with Ansari during a scheduled July 19 visit.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to the Star’s repeated inquiries about why Ansari wasn’t permitted to speak with the detainees.

In a statement, an unnamed DHS spokesperson said Ansari still would have been allowed to tour the facility.

“After being told that Ansari would be unable to speak with detainees, her office did not even show up or have the courtesy to send a cancellation notice to ICE,” the DHS statement said. “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are FALSE. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens.”

An August report from Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia, identified more than 500 “credible reports of human rights abuse” in U.S. immigration detention centers since January.

Advocates say concerns about inhumane detention conditions will only worsen as ICE arrest numbers rise, and as DHS scrambles to construct more detention space.

Arizona ‘Alligator Alcatraz’?

This week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem named Arizona among possible states that could house a new state-run immigration facility like “Alligator Alcatraz,” which DHS hastily erected in the Florida Everglades.

DHS has not yet contacted Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office about the possibility, but “if they did ask, we would not participate,” Hobbs’ spokesman Christian Slater said in an email.

Kelly said he’s opposed to the idea, and to the allocation of so much taxpayer money to incarcerating immigrants who pose no public safety threat, at the expense of public spending in areas such as education and scientific research.

“We are now investing in the wrong thing. We’re going to invest in prisons for people who are no threat to anybody? That doesn’t make sense,” Kelly said.

In July, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement, including $45 billion for building new ICE detention facilities and $30 billion for ICE enforcement and deportation operations.

“The budget of ICE is going to be bigger than the U.S. Marine Corps in a heartbeat,” said Kelly, a Navy combat veteran.

‘Moment’ for immigration reform?

Public support for immigration has been rising in the U.S. A July Gallup poll found a record-high 79% of respondents say immigration is a good thing for the country.

The shift in public sentiment comes as the Trump administration has targeted not only undocumented immigrants with criminal records, but increasingly people without any criminal history, or with minor non-violent offenses, who have lived in the country for decades.

“Mass deportation involves deporting our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues, people our kids go to school with,” Stanton said. “And it turns out, deporting these individuals is very unpopular with the American people.”

Trump’s DHS is also arresting and deporting legal immigrants and asylum seekers who entered the U.S. with the government’s permission and proper documentation. ICE agents have been waiting at immigration courthouses to arrest people attending required hearings.

Kelly said it could be the right moment for Congress to finally enact comprehensive immigration reform, as well as protections for “Dreamers,” unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

“Maybe this is a moment we could do something that’s positive,” Kelly said. “I know a bunch of my Republican colleagues, they get it. They don’t think we should be deporting 10 million people, despite what the president of the United States says. They do not all agree with that. That’s not a reasonable system that helps us as a nation.”

Stanton agreed now could be the time to “build an immigration system that supports and grows the American economy,” including supporting the agriculture and health-care industries and talented international students. He also supports giving Dreamers a path to citizenship, a proposal with broad public support.

With the southern border secure, “Now is the time to have those conversations,” Stanton said. “We need immigration policies that support the aging of America, in terms of taking care of our seniors, parents and grandparents. We’re going to need a visa system that brings in a trained work force in that important area.”

Nearly 70% of likely voters support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and are married to a citizen, and 64% support a path to citizenship for those brought to the U.S. as children, a May poll from Data for Progress found.

Immigration experts say Congress has poured money into border and ICE enforcement, without tackling common-sense immigration reforms that would help fix the system, such as adding more immigration judges and asylum officers.

Republicans have blocked multiple attempts to modernize the immigration system, which hasn’t been updated in three decades.

Less than 1% of people who want to move to the U.S. have a legal pathway to do so, according to the Cato Institute, and long-time undocumented immigrants face a potential 10-year ban from the U.S., under a Clinton-era law, if they try to regularize their status.

Kelly said he had issues with the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border, amid a global increase in migration, until Biden imposed controversial restrictions on asylum access in mid-2024.

But under Trump, Kelly said, “We’re wildly swinging in the other direction, in a way that is not in the best interest of this country.”

Advocates say Biden violated U.S. law with his June 2024 asylum restrictions, which have been credited with reducing the number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum.

In May, a federal court ruled that most of Biden’s asylum restrictions violated U.S. immigration law that allows people to request asylum once on U.S. soil, regardless of how they entered the country.

Long-standing problem

Problems with immigration detention conditions are long-standing, but appear to be worsening under Trump, as the administration has dramatically curtailed oversight offices that receive and investigate complaints, including the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, said Liz Casey, social worker on the advocacy team at the nonprofit Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.

Casey has heard from ICE detainees about problems accessing medical care, unclean conditions, broken air conditioning, verbal abuse and discrimination by guards, as well as overcrowding and understaffing in ICE detention facilities.

“Not having any oversight seemingly is making conditions and abuses significantly worse,” she said, based on recent anecdotal accounts from detainees. “There needs to be truly independent oversight, with actual accountability and consequences when rights are violated.”

A spokesman for CoreCivic, the private company that runs the Eloy Detention Center and Florence Correctional Complex, said CoreCivic takes the health and safety of its detainees seriously.

“Our immigration facilities are monitored very closely by our government partners at ICE, and they are required to undergo regular review and audit processes to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for all detainees,” said public affairs manager Brian Todd in a Friday email.

Immigration detention is civil in nature, intended to hold people during removal proceedings, rather than as punishment for a crime, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Casey said immigration detention is “inherently inhumane,” and she’s concerned by the Trump administration’s resistance to unannounced congressional oversight visits.

“We are very grateful that people are using their congressional power to do any type of visits or oversight right now. It’s still extremely useful,” she said. “But unannounced inspections would be much more like true oversight.”

My session with Dr. Phil had reached an impasse.

About three hours in, seated inside the Dallas mega-mansion where he is steering his herky-jerk transition from daytime TV behemoth to MAGA-friendly newsman, the once-licensed psychologist was giving no ground on what seemed to me an obvious point.

“I don’t think I’m qualified to talk about politics,” he said, steepling his fingers in contemplation. And so, he insisted, he really hadn’t.

This was difficult to square with recent events.

In the last two years, Dr. Phil (surname: McGraw) had ended his flagship talk show and created his own news and entertainment network, trafficking daily in conservative-coded subjects — “Dr. Phil: The Hidden Gem in Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’” “Dr. Phil Investigates: Are Schools Secretly Transitioning Your Child?” — in an unswerving crusade against “the woke left.”

He had spoken glowingly of President Trump as an invited guest at Mr. Trump’s Madison Square Garden campaign rally, at a White House faith event and at a recent Texas flood briefing, where the president interrupted himself after spotting Dr. Phil — “There’s Dr. Phil. Look at Dr. Phil. You’re looking good, Phil. This is a hell of a situation, isn’t it?” — and later asked him to address the bereaved.

Most strikingly, Dr. Phil had secured intimate access to embed with a camera crew on Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, pledging to agents that his broadcasting aim was to “tell your story and have your back.”

Dr. Phil likes to say that his focus is social and cultural issues and always has been, since his Oprah-ordained rise as a tough-loving public mediator of family dramas. It is the politicians, he says, who have lurched into his lane, not the other way around.

He does not care about the Federal Reserve, he noted, with a merry profanity. He does not understand the mechanics of legislation.

That was more policy than politics, I suggested.

“I don’t know!” he said. “You’re making my point.”

And his macro point was this: “I’ve spent so much of my life focused on why people do what they do,” Dr. Phil said, by way of mission statement, “and don’t do what they don’t do.”

In recent months, friends, detractors and former associates have wondered often why Dr. Phil is doing what he is doing — barreling into partisan media after a lucrative career as a big-tent hitmaker — and why he is not doing what he is not doing: recognizing that he has barreled into partisan media.

What is beyond debate is that Dr. Phil, 74, has exposed his shrink-next-door reputation to the whims of a fractured, fractious media ecosystem quite unlike the one he conquered.

It has already been messy. Last month, his company, Merit Street Media, filed for bankruptcy in a hail of litigation involving its faith-based partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network. (Dr. Phil swiftly announced a new venture with similar ambitions, Envoy Media, and has begun producing content under its banner.)

Yet whatever his professional fortunes, Dr. Phil has emerged once more as an avatar of his times, a drawling testament to the commingling of entertainment and civic life.

The president, his acquaintance of two decades, is a fellow network television stalwart of the early 2000s. The Department of Homeland Security has mulled a reality show for immigrants to compete for citizenship.

Can it really be said that Dr. Phil looks out of place, lumbering on a balky knee beside federal authorities, making “Cops”-style television out of early-morning ICE arrests?

“With so much fake news circulating about the work ICE agents do, we’re grateful for those like Dr. Phil who are willing to share the truth,” Tom Homan, the president’s border czar, said in a statement sent by the White House. The two have regularly shared the screen.

Still an advocate, he says, for legal immigration and gay rights, Dr. Phil believes he has nonetheless lost friends from his bygone life in Beverly Hills, Calif., where he keeps a home.

He has faced death threats, he said — there was little of that in daytime. (He attributed this largely to his stands against antisemitism.) He has failed publicly as never before, after a long talk-show reign at No. 1, for the high privilege of clawing into the living algorithm of ubiquitous news chatter.

“I don’t have to be doing this at all,” he noted. “This is not a got-to job. This is a get-to job.”

But then, people are complicated — “Dr. Phil” proved this every weekday — and during our four-hour visit last month, Dr. Phil took care to project that he is, too.

He is a self-described “old country boy from Texas and Oklahoma” whose Dallas home includes glimmering door handles fashioned into a lower-case “d” and “p,” a boulder-size Lego wall installation depicting scenes and characters from his life, “seven or eight” fireplaces, a Banksy, a coffee-table book about maximalism and a decorative rooster of unknown provenance.

“There’s something special about it,” he said, sighing a bit, during a mostly affectless tour of the space. “I don’t know what it is.”

He is known to keep two essential items in the trunk of his Rolls-Royce: a shotgun and a tennis bag. “You never know,” he reasoned.

He considers himself a journalist (“You think I’m overqualified?”) and does not dwell on why ICE has furnished him with premium access. “We’ve asked for it,” he said bluntly.

He has a face so recognizable from his old career — the sheriff-grade mustache, the furrowed helipad of a forehead — that it can shadow his newer one.

“You’re Dr. Phil,” a Thai immigrant told Dr. Phil, mid-arrest, last January in Chicago. The host had been questioning the man, whom authorities accused of sexual misconduct, beside Mr. Homan.

“How do you know me?” Dr. Phil asked.

“I’ve seen Dr. Phil on TV.”

Dr. Phil looked almost resigned.

“Yeah.”

Becoming ‘Dr. Phil’

In many ways, Dr. Phil’s arc is the story of America’s last three decades of media, celebrity, politics and media-celebrity-politics.

If anything, he was the more prolific TV frontman than Mr. Trump, the truer bootstraps story, the host with his wagging finger on the pulse of the great American middle.

With a few tweaks to the wayback machine of modern politics, is it so impossible to imagine Dr. Phil as the high officeholder — certainly friends and strangers prodded him through the years — and Mr. Trump as the fading media giant whose new venture just went bust?

“He is and always has been inevitable,” Rachael Ray, a talk-show contemporary, said of Dr. Phil. “He understands the concept that you are here to serve your audience.”

Dr. Phil’s public journey began, inadvertently, before an audience of one: the most famous civil defendant in daytime.

Raised across Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas — his hard-drinking father was an oil-rig equipment supplier before he pursued a psychology career — Dr. Phil worked initially as a psychologist himself. He later co-founded a trial preparation consultancy, attracting high-profile clients, including Exxon, after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and eventually, fatefully, Oprah Winfrey.

She hired him after Texas cattlemen sued over a 1996 episode about mad cow disease. After the trial, Ms. Winfrey was so taken with Dr. Phil’s pitiless charm and boundless aphorisms (“It may not be fair but it is,” “Winners do things losers don’t want to do”) that she made him an on-air regular.

By 2002, he had his own show, entrenching himself firmly in the zeitgeist of the new millennium. He hosted quarreling couples, unruly teens, a sitting president and first lady (George W. and Laura Bush) and a go-to financial guru and future senator named Elizabeth Warren.

“I figured out really early on: You better listen to your audience and meet them where they are,” Dr. Phil said, “instead of asking them to meet you where you are.”

He enshrined himself — alongside Dr. Mehmet Oz, now Mr. Trump’s overseer of Medicare and Medicaid — as part of an Oprah-branded constellation whose emphasis on health and wellness seemed to partly presage the Make America Healthy Again movement. (A representative for Ms. Winfrey did not respond to messages.)

While Dr. Phil was sometimes criticized for unseemly voyeurism or reductive counsel, there was evidence that his show did some good. A 2016 study suggested that devoted “Dr. Phil” viewers were likelier to seek mental health treatment.

As with much of daytime television, including Ms. Winfrey’s show, the moment of peak cultural primacy passed. Ratings sagged. A 2022 BuzzFeed News article described a “toxic workplace” at “Dr. Phil.” A 2017 investigation by STAT and The Boston Globe reported that the program sometimes exploited and endangered people with addiction problems. (The show denied this.)

Beyond the Paramount lot where he filmed in Hollywood, Dr. Phil hinted at broader interests. In public appearances, he defended trans people and backed gun reform measures after mass shootings. He dissected white privilege on “The Breakfast Club” radio show.

He started a podcast (“Phil in the Blanks”) in 2019. He appraised Mr. Trump, sometimes critically, on late-night television.

“I can’t diagnose him because I haven’t done proper evaluations,” Dr. Phil told Jimmy Kimmel mischievously during the president’s first term. But “certain personality disorders” came to mind.

When Covid hit, Dr. Phil seemed to find more common cause with the political right, chastising authorities over school lockdowns. “I was labeled a nut,” he told Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Mr. Trump’s health secretary, during an affectionate televised forum last spring.

“Dr. Phil” ended in 2023 — of his volition, he has said. Friends encouraged his new explorations.

“We know you’re apolitical,” Bill Maher told him, with an exaggerated wink, on a podcast last year.

By then, Dr. Phil had produced a new book, “We’ve Got Issues,” pitched directly at the culture wars. He lamented a country that “can’t stand success” and cowered before “the tyranny of the fringe”: those who believe that “every white person is a racist,” that anyone concerned with youth gender identity “is a hateful transphobe,” that every gun owner “is an advocate of violence.”

He referred to “cancel culture,” or variations of it, nearly four dozen times.

Hoping to sharpen his book’s arguments, Dr. Phil enlisted Jeff Nussbaum, a longtime speechwriter for former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as a Democratic foil.

“I took pride in being a sparring partner,” Mr. Nussbaum said, “though recent events seem to show that either I lost or he moved to a different ring.”

The Doctor and the President

In June 2024, Merit Street Media secured a major get: the presumptive Republican nominee, hosting Dr. Phil at Mar-a-Lago.

“You’ve always been very special,” Mr. Trump told him.

The interview, one month before Mr. Trump was shot in Butler, Pa., is a remarkable rewatch — and a prime example of what can often impress Mr. Trump most: He prizes people who succeed on television. Staring at the face of TV psychology, he seemed compelled to take advantage.

And so, Mr. Trump, rarely prone to introspection or therapist-speak, observed that he had “a very good disposition for trauma.” He spoke openly about his tendency to suppress stress.

“You’re sort of being my psychiatrist,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe I could use a psychiatrist.”

Dr. Phil urged Mr. Trump against governing vengefully if elected. (Asked in our interview if the president listened, Dr. Phil said, “I mean, he hasn’t locked anybody up.” The same day, Mr. Trump baselessly accused former President Barack Obama of treason and said it was “time to go after people.”)

But with an online audience of millions, the sit-down fulfilled an early Merit aspiration: demonstrating Dr. Phil’s range.

“Phil has an intuitive ability to read the national culture,” said Ken Solomon, a longtime friend and tennis partner who became Merit TV’s chief executive. The daytime show, Mr. Solomon added, “was narrow compared to his overall expertise.”

TV veterans like Steve Harvey and Nancy Grace joined the roster. The Professional Bull Riders league signed on. Executives outlined plans to reach more than 100 million homes, even as some in Dr. Phil’s orbit clocked the overstuffed media landscape.

“Starting a start-up in this climate in entertainment is just next to impossible,” said Harvey Levin, the TMZ co-founder, who is friendly with Dr. Phil. “When I heard he was doing that — boy.”

Merit recruited a team of more than 100 to the Fort Worth area to work from its five-acre studio, where Dr. Phil often arrived by helicopter. His stated goal was to “own the debate lane.”

But quickly, employees said, the preferred contours of that debate became clear. Guest bookings tilted decidedly right. Dr. Phil warned viewers that “illegal immigrants are fueling crime across America.” He enthused over what he considered agreeable conditions for immigrant detainees. “You said there are even exercise classes for the women,” he nudged Mr. Homan amid raids in Los Angeles.

Activists scorned him as a tool of the state.

“When you are riding along with the government, they are putting you on a publicity tour,” Alida Garcia, an organizer and former immigration official under Mr. Biden, said in an interview. “He is participating as basically a propaganda machine for ICE.”

Producers whom Dr. Phil’s team made available for this article said he cared only about following the facts. “If it’s towards one side more than the other,” one producer, Justin Arluck, said, “that’s where the facts are.”

Asked if he had been aware of other employees’ concerns about political material, Dr. Phil paused for a beat. “They certainly should not be expected to be involved with it if it’s not something they can passionately commit to,” he said.

Dr. Phil’s appearance at Mr. Trump’s rally last fall seemed to signal his political intentions, though he suggests this was largely an accident.

He has said he would have also appeared with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming that her camp failed to follow up after some initial discussions. Several senior Harris campaign aides said they were unaware of any such dialogue.

Mr. Solomon, the close friend and a longtime Democratic fund-raiser, said he and Dr. Phil had “a difference of opinion” on the Trump event. “I said, ‘Well, if you just do the one, people are going to come to the conclusion that they have come to,’” Mr. Solomon recalled.

That conclusion still appears to bother Dr. Phil. He declined to say if he even voted for Mr. Trump despite his cameo at Madison Square Garden.

“When people ask me about that, I ask them if they’ve listened to what I said,” he said. “Did you?”

I said I could understand why those watching him at the Trump rally, where chants of “Dr. Phil!” echoed, concluded that he was probably voting for Mr. Trump.

“They have impeached him, indicted him, raided him, railroaded him, shot him and sued him,” Dr. Phil told the arena. “And where is he? He is still standing.”

Dr. Phil also plugged his network, celebrated the First Amendment and did not explicitly endorse the candidate. If other guests slung maximally red meat — labeling Ms. Harris “the Antichrist,” smearing Puerto Rico — his offering might fairly be classified as medium-rare.

“I was with Trump during his MSG speech and remember it was pretty lukewarm,” Tucker Carlson, another rally speaker, said of Dr. Phil in a text message.

He added that he had never watched Merit.

“Nothing against Dr. Phil,” Mr. Carlson said. “I just hate all television.”

Walking the MAGA Line

This wider reaction to Dr. Phil’s rally appearance — searing liberal disdain, mild conservative gratitude — was instructive.

He was MAGA-affiliated but not quite MAGA. He was in the room but not of it.

Merit’s ratings seemed to reflect its neither-fish-nor-fowl status, placing the network fathoms behind not only established competitors like Fox News but also relative upstarts like Newsmax and NewsNation. (Dr. Phil’s team insists Merit was gathering momentum, citing encouraging viewership figures on Inauguration Day.)

Some employees had hoped that Mr. Trump’s return, and his nominal closeness with Dr. Phil, might boost the business.

In March, Merit occupied the “new media” seat in the White House briefing room. In May, the president praised Dr. Phil and Merit from the Rose Garden. (Dr. Phil attended in his capacity as an appointee to a federal committee on religious liberty.)

But the company was wobbling. Last month, Merit filed for bankruptcy and accused its partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network, of reneging on commitments. (Trinity did not respond to messages seeking comment.)

Professional Bull Riders, moving to recoup roughly $180 million from its media rights deal, has also joined the legal morass. Merit has made counterclaims.

The dispute seems to have dented Dr. Phil’s standing in some corners of his former city.

“He stopped paying us and tried to tear up and walk away from his contractual commitment simply because he had a change of heart,” said Mark Shapiro, a top associate of the Hollywood super-executive Ari Emanuel and the president of TKO, which owns Professional Bull Riders. “I’ve really never seen anything like it.”

None of this has stopped Dr. Phil from announcing a breakaway venture, Envoy Media, for which loyalists are preparing a new studio space in Irving, Tex., that previously housed a Spanish-language TV company.

In our interview, Dr. Phil hailed Envoy’s “disruptive” potential, sprinkling in buzz-phrases like “citizen journalism platform” and “interactive app.”

Retirement does not appear to have occurred to him.

“This is not what I do. It’s who I am,” he said. “And I’m not sure that that’s always healthy.”

Certainly there are other ways to spend his time. Dr. Phil has been married to his wife, Robin McGraw, with whom he has two adult children, for nearly five decades.

His outdoor tennis court includes misters to counteract the Dallas heat. A whirring staff minds the grounds and hands him unsweetened iced teas. He is quick to attribute the home’s trimmings to Mrs. McGraw, describing their prodigious collection of art and light fixtures so dryly that it can be difficult to tell when he is joking:

“Everybody needs winged lightbulbs.”

“Every one of those pieces of glass was put up individually by these people from Czechoslovakia, if you can imagine.”

Such are the spoils of an uncommon American life — and a reminder, those who know him say, of why Dr. Phil might do the things he does.

“He really is a sort of Horatio Alger story and really believed strongly that anyone could take a similar path,” said Mr. Nussbaum, the former Biden aide who helped with his book. “That’s the genesis of his advice-giving.”

While some Democrats have accused Dr. Phil of pandering, many of his present views appear sincerely felt. He is, friends noted, an affluent septuagenarian Texan whose beliefs broadly reflect his peer group’s.

In one recent video, Dr. Phil covered what he saw as an outsize backlash against another Texan, Beyoncé, for wearing a shirt considered insensitive to Native Americans.

When, he wondered, did intentions stop mattering? What happened to critical thinking?

“Hell hath no fury,” he told viewers, “like the woke left finding a new celebrity to cancel.”

As we sat in his home office, with a large rendering of the “Hollywood” sign behind him and a backpack from the Bel-Air Country Club on the desk, I asked if he ever felt as though the line applied to him.

He almost smirked.

“Yeah.”

“I feel like I’m a hostage.” The theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland spent nearly two weeks at the Northwest detention center, after being detained July 17 on the grounds that his tourist visa had expired.
I’ve never been arrested in my life.” Inside the detention center The first night in the detention center, he was put in a room with all of the incoming detainees and it was very cold, Rocha said.
Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said, “any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE Northwest detention center in Tacoma are false.
He’s an extraordinary human full of heart, talent, and resilience.” Rocha didn’t cry in the detention center.","Fernando Rocha has been out of ICE’s detention center in Tacoma for almost as long as he was in, but he still doesn’t feel free.

A black monitor is strapped to his left ankle, he can’t travel outside of Washington state, and he has to check in with Department of Homeland Security authorities virtually each week and in person every two months until his asylum hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.

In his car, he wonders if he’ll get pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement again. At home, if they will come to his door.

“My life is now a nightmare,” said Rocha. “I feel like I’m a hostage.”

The theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland spent nearly two weeks at the Northwest detention center, after being detained July 17 on the grounds that his tourist visa had expired. It had, but Rocha had applied for asylum and had a valid pending asylum case and a valid work permit, said his attorney, Adolfo Ojeda.

ICE Seattle also claimed Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft. During Rocha’s bond hearing, Judge Tammy Fitting noted the allegations about the theft in Brazil but didn’t address them further and released Rocha on a $10,000 bond, with other conditions set by ICE.

Rocha provided a document from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Brazil that stated there is “no record of a final conviction in the name of Fernando Alves Rocha, country of nationality Brazil.” The Seattle Times reached out to the same ministry and didn’t receive an immediate response.

“I’m so grateful to not be in the center, grateful to my attorney and funds from the GoFundMe” started by his fellow members in the IATSE Local 15 theater workers union, Rocha said. The fund drive, now closed, raised more than $36,000 for Rocha’s bond and legal fees.

“But (the ankle monitor) is embarrassing, kind of barbaric,” Rocha said. “I have no criminal records. It’s a way to dehumanize immigrants and make us feel like we aren’t equal.”

Life in Brazil

In Brazil, Rocha was a drama teacher and ran a theater group for 23 years that traveled all around the world — including Seattle in 2010 — to perform. He earned a master’s degree in art from the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia in Brazil.

He said he was very happy with his life in Brazil and never thought he would leave, but in 2016 the school where he worked was taken over by a student protest group.

They invaded the theater where he worked, trashed puppets and costumes, and graffitied the walls. Rocha said he started to get death threats and worried about his safety.

He began to think about moving to Europe or somewhere else for a more stable life — at the very least, to get away from the unrest in Brazil. He came to the United States in 2018 on a tourist visa and thought he might return to Brazil if conditions improved. They didn’t, and then the pandemic hit and made it even less appealing to go back home. He decided to apply for asylum.

“I just saw my life (in Brazil) getting further and further away from me,” Rocha said. “I had less and less to return to.”

He applied for asylum, completing the three-month application process the day before his visa expired. After he got initial word his asylum application was received, he got a work permit, which allowed him to work while he was waiting for a ruling on asylum status, said Ojeda, his attorney.

At that point, Rocha had a “valid pending asylum claim,” Ojeda said, so his tourist visa was extended for one year.

“It’s a weird kind of extension that is between legal, not legal,” Ojeda said. Rocha wasn’t accruing unlawful trespassing time in the U.S. or doing anything wrong, Ojeda added.

“I thought I was protected. That’s what my lawyer said and the documents I had received from the government had said: that while I was waiting, I was protected,” Rocha said. “That’s why (getting arrested) was so surreal for me. It came from nowhere. I was in shock.”

Moment of arrest

Rocha was driving to work around 7:30 a.m. July 17 when a car with flashing lights stopped him.

“In the moment, I was so afraid I didn’t think straight to realize how a person would say that I’m being arrested if they didn’t know my name,” Rocha said. “I should’ve asked, ‘Do you know my name? Do you know who I am? Why are you arresting me?’”

He said the officers wore simple police vests that didn’t display the letters ICE or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, so he was unsure why he was being pulled over and told to get out of the car.

“I thought I was being kidnapped,” Rocha said. “The people who approached didn’t look official to me. … I had no idea why I would be arrested.”

The officers reached through his open window and unlocked the door and forced him out of his car, Rocha said. He fell onto the ground, scratching his knees and elbows, and an officer put a knee on top of his back, Rocha said. While he was face down on the asphalt, they cuffed his wrists and ankles, he said.

“It was a nightmare. It was crazy. I just freaked out,” Rocha said. “I didn’t know how to deal with the situation. I’ve never been arrested in my life.”

Inside the detention center

The first night in the detention center, he was put in a room with all of the incoming detainees and it was very cold, Rocha said. He wasn’t given any blankets, he said.

A lot of people were sick, and when they tried to get medical attention, they sometimes were told they had to come back another time or were only given Tylenol, Rocha said.

The food was “like a white soup,” Rocha said. He and his fellow detainees couldn’t identify what it was and most people didn’t eat it. One day they served eggs that were green and smelled bad, Rocha said. He noticed the officers never drank the water from the faucets and had their own water bottles.

There have been hundreds of complaints about the food and water quality at the detention center, and research conducted by the University of Washington documented unsatisfactory food, water and medical care.

Some of the detainees had money and could buy food and water at the commissary but delivery took three days, he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said, “any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE Northwest detention center in Tacoma are false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, quality water, blankets, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers.”

She added that it is a longstanding practice to provide “comprehensive medical care.” “Meals are certified by dietitians,” she said, and “ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

Christopher Ferreira, director of corporate relations for the GEO Group, which owns the detention center, said it provides “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

He also said that facilities are never overcrowded and that physicians, nurses, dentists, psychologists and psychiatrists are available, adding that “access to off-site medical specialists, imaging facilities, emergency medical services, and local community hospitals is also provided when needed.”

Rocha said that after the first night, everyone was sorted into different colors depending on their situation. He said he was in the blue group, for those without criminal records.

It was much quieter there, Rocha said. Groups of people gathered to read the Bible. Muslims laid out their prayer rugs five times a day to pray.

The first week, some detainees huddled around a 3,000-piece puzzle of marine creatures. During his second week, he said, they did a different puzzle with Charlie Brown characters on it.

Rocha tried to do the puzzle but wasn’t very good at it. He was better at listening to people’s stories.

“Everybody was trying to help each other,” Rocha said. “They kind of have this empathy for each other. Even not knowing each other but knowing that we are all in this together.”

Although a community was being built, it didn’t make Rocha feel better.

“Every story I heard made me more anxious,” Rocha said. “Oh my God, if this guy has (proper documents) or (a better situation) and he’s here, I have no chance.”

“A lot of people were just giving up, saying, ‘I just want to go home (to their country of origin) because it is exhausting staying in this facility,’” Rocha said.

He said it, too, to his attorney.

“Please take me out of here. Even if it’s just for me to pack my stuff and go home. I don’t deserve to be here. I’m getting sick and I don’t want to stay here. This is torture.”

Released

The morning of his bond hearing, Rocha sat and waited on the wooden benches that looked like church pews, watching the judge hear other detainees’ cases.

“I was tense,” Rocha said. “The judge seemed tough.”

As the morning passed, though, he said he felt that she was fair and attentive with each case.

“I was so confident that I was innocent of what they were accusing me of, so I tried to sit (in front of the judge) with dignity,” Rocha said. “I was really hopeful she would be fair.”

Judge Fitting noted that she was concerned Rocha resisted ICE at first but did not find him a flight risk. She noted his valid work permit and pending asylum claim. She set the bond at $10,000.

“Oh my God. A relief that I’ve never felt before,” Rocha said in an interview immediately after his release. “I’ve never been arrested in my life. I’ve never lost my liberty, my freedom, in my life. It was an almost indescribable kind of relief. It is hard to explain. All I can say is that it is the best relief I’ve ever had in my life.”

Back at home

When Rocha got home, he was sick and needed to rest, but he started to read the hundreds of messages he received from people and countless other social media posts.

“We are shocked and heartbroken to learn one of our former JCI students and community members, Fernando Rocha, has been detained by ICE,” wrote Jet City Improv on its Instagram page. “Fernando was part of one of the first post-pandemic classes at JCI. He’s an extraordinary human full of heart, talent, and resilience.”

Rocha didn’t cry in the detention center. He said he didn’t want to be a victim there. He did his best to stay strong and keep a mindset that he would get out soon.

But back at home, after seeing the messages, he finally let himself cry.

“I just keep crying and crying and crying,” Rocha said. “It is good tears. Tears of relief, tears of gratitude and of hope to see that this country still has good people. It is still the country that I and so many people dream to be living in. This beacon of democracy and liberty and freedom and all of that.

“There is still a little hope that something could change.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08012025_tzr_tzr_144030.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-10 11:57:26.353158

That shift in tactics meant that immigrants with criminal convictions no longer made up the bulk of California ICE arrests.
They faced off with ICE agents in Home Depot parking lots and at warehouses and farms.
But this week, federal agents carried out a series of raids at Home Depots from Westlake to Van Nuys.
Then, as a frenetic drum and bass mix kicked in, federal agents jump out of a van and chase people.","Ever since federal immigration raids ramped up across California, triggering fierce protests that prompted President Trump to deploy troops to Los Angeles, the state has emerged as the symbolic battleground of the administration’s deportation campaign.

But even as arrests soared, California was not the epicenter of Trump’s anti-immigrant project.

In the first five months of Trump’s second term, California lagged behind the staunchly red states of Texas and Florida in the total arrests. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from the Deportation Data Project, Texas reported 26,341 arrests — nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests nationally — followed by 12,982 in Florida and 8,460 in California.

Even in June, when masked federal immigration agents swept through L.A., jumping out of vehicles to snatch people from bus stops, car washes and parking lots, California saw 3,391 undocumented immigrants arrested — more than Florida, but still only about half as many as Texas.

When factoring in population, California drops to 27th in the nation, with 217 arrests per million residents — about a quarter of Texas’ 864 arrests per million and less than half of a whole slew of states including Florida, Arkansas, Utah, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and Nevada.

The data, released after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the government, excludes arrests made after June 26 and lacks identifying state details in 5% of cases. Nevertheless, it provides the most detailed look yet of national ICE operations.

Immigration experts say it is not surprising that California — home to the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the nation and the birthplace of the Chicano movement — lags behind Republican states in the total number of arrests or arrests as a percentage of the population.

“The numbers are secondary to the performative politics of the moment,” said Austin Kocher, a geographer and research assistant professor at Syracuse University who specializes in immigration enforcement.

Part of the reason Republican-dominated states have higher arrest numbers — particularly when measured against population — is they have a longer history of working directly with ICE, and a stronger interest in collaboration. In red states from Texas to Mississippi, local law enforcement officers routinely cooperate with federal agents, either by taking on ICE duties through so-called 287(g) agreements or by identifying undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated and letting ICE into their jails and prisons.

Indeed, data show that just 7% of ICE arrests made this year in California were made through the Criminal Alien Program, an initiative that requests that local law enforcement identify undocumented immigrants in federal, state and local prisons and jails.

That’s significantly lower than the 55% of arrests in Texas and 46% in Florida made through prisons or jails. And other conservative states with smaller populations relied on the program even more heavily: 75% of ICE arrests in Alabama and 71% in Indiana took place via prisons and jails.

“State cooperation has been an important buffer in ICE arrests and ICE operations in general for years,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Sacramento-based senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “We’ve seen that states are not only willing to cooperate with ICE, but are proactively now establishing 287(g) agreements with their local law enforcement, are naturally going to cast a wider net of enforcement in the boundaries of that state.”

While California considers only some criminal offenses, such as serious felonies, significant enough to share information with ICE; Texas and Florida are more likely to report offenses that may not be as severe, such as minor traffic infractions.

Still, even if fewer people were arrested in California than other states, it also witnessed one of the most dramatic increases in arrests in the country.

California ranked 30th in ICE arrests per million in February. By June, the state had climbed to 10th place.

ICE arrested around 8,460 immigrants across California between Jan. 20 and June 26, a 212% increase compared with the five months before Trump took office. That contrasts with a 159% increase nationally for the same period.

Much of ICE’s activity in California was hyper-focused on Greater Los Angeles: About 60% of ICE arrests in the state took place in the seven counties in and around L.A. during Trump’s first five months in office. The number of arrests in the Los Angeles area soared from 463 in January to 2,185 in June — a 372% spike, second only to New York’s 432% increase.

Even if California is not seeing the largest numbers of arrests, experts say, the dramatic increase in captures stands out from other places because of the lack of official cooperation and public hostility toward immigration agents.

“A smaller increase in a place that has very little cooperation is, in a way, more significant than seeing an increase in areas that have lots and lots of cooperation,” Kocher said.

ICE agents, Kocher said, have to work much harder to arrest immigrants in places like L.A. or California that define themselves as “sanctuary” jurisdictions and limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.

“They really had to go out of their way,” he said.

Trump administration officials have long argued that sanctuary jurisdictions give them no choice but to round up people on the streets.

Not long after Trump won the 2024 election and the L.A. City Council voted unanimously to block any city resources from being used for immigration enforcement, incoming border enforcement advisor Tom Homan threatened an onslaught.

“If I’ve got to send twice as many officers to L.A. because we’re not getting any assistance, then that’s what we’re going to do,” Homan told Newsmax.

With limited cooperation from California jails, ICE agents went out into communities, rounding up people they suspected of being undocumented on street corners and at factories and farms.

That shift in tactics meant that immigrants with criminal convictions no longer made up the bulk of California ICE arrests. While about 66% of immigrants arrested in the first four months of the year had criminal convictions, that percentage fell to 30% in June.

The sweeping nature of the arrests drew immediate criticism as racial profiling and spawned robust community condemnation.

Some immigration experts and community activists cite the organized resistance in L.A. as another reason the numbers of ICE arrests were lower in California than in Texas and even lower than dozens of states by percentage of population.

“The reason is the resistance, organized resistance: the people who literally went to war with them in Paramount, in Compton, in Bell and Huntington Park,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio Los Angeles, an independent political group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps.

“They’ve been chased out in the different neighborhoods where we organize,” he said. “We’ve been able to mobilize the community to surround the agents when they come to kidnap people.”

In L.A., activists patrolled the streets from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m., seven days a week, Gochez said. They faced off with ICE agents in Home Depot parking lots and at warehouses and farms.

“We were doing everything that we could to try to keep up with the intensity of the military assault,” Gochez said. “The resistance was strong. … We’ve been able, on numerous occasions, to successfully defend the communities and drive them out of our community.”

The protests prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines in June, with the stated purpose of protecting federal buildings and personnel. But the administration’s ability to ratchet up arrests hit a roadblock on July 11. That’s when a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking immigration agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

That decision was upheld last week by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But on Thursday, the Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the temporary ban on its patrols, arguing that it “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.”

The order led to a significant drop in arrests across Los Angeles last month. But this week, federal agents carried out a series of raids at Home Depots from Westlake to Van Nuys.

Trump administration officials have indicated that the July ruling and arrest slowdown do not signal a permanent change in tactics.

“Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the communities and more work site enforcement,” Homan told reporters two weeks after the court blocked roving patrols. “Why is that? Because they won’t let one agent arrest one bad guy in the jail.”

U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, who has been leading operations in California, posted a fast-moving video on X that spliced L.A. Mayor Karen Bass telling reporters that “this experiment that was practiced on the city of Los Angeles failed” with video showing him grinning. Then, as a frenetic drum and bass mix kicked in, federal agents jump out of a van and chase people.

“When you’re faced with opposition to law and order, what do you do?” Bovino wrote. “Improvise, adapt, and overcome!”

Clearly, the Trump administration is willing to expend significant resources to make California a political battleground and test case, Ruiz Soto said. The question is, at what economic and political cost?

“If they really wanted to scale up and ramp up their deportations,” Ruiz Soto said, “they could go to other places, do it more more safely, more quickly and more efficiently.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a8cb87/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Ff9%2F4ccaeac14f51afeafcd9c3f4f082%2F1511112-me-0620-ice-action-bell-gem-004.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 11:57:30.538959

Do far right racist people like it when people get angry or upset about immigration?","It’s odd watching your country from afar.

I’ve been doing that, a bit (I was on holiday) recently. I was with the descendants of the Vikings who turn out to be more of a behaviour than a race. Yes some of them saw our shores and raided them, but by no means all of them. In the true sense of the word being a Vikingyr meant being a pirate and not every person we call a Viking was, at all.

These past two weeks I have not looked enviously back at my country thinking ‘what riches lie there’ but observed it through the filter of Norwegians, who, it must be said have a general good will to Britain, to do with royal links and our assistance during WW2.

We might post sarcastic comments on social media about the quality, but 80 years later we are still annual recipients of a huge Christmas tree for Trafalgar Square. If you think of the logistics that’s quite the thank you.

While I was away, the UK seemed to tie itself in knots over men of fighting age crossing the sea to settle in Britain. And of course there exist, usually with police escort, those who angrily cry “racist” at anyone who dares question current immigration policy.

It’s funny but since since Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana set up their sixth form politics group as a party, you may have noticed the ‘be kind’ crowd have re-emerged being anything but if you disagree with them. I do disagreed with them, profoundly, but am grateful. Given questions about “14 years” of Conservative Government, Corbyn and his ilk did the Tories a huge favour, keeping he and his party far from power but re-enforcing ours.

The far left howl about how many more votes he got than Blair or Starmer, but electoral maths was never their strong suit.

It’s the numbers of people coming across the sea that still bothers us in Britain, and the truth is we have every right to be concerned, and to want it stopped. No, the last Conservative government did not do enough to tackle illegal migration, Labour have done far less whilst constantly bleating they’ve “secured our borders” and overseeing record numbers crossing the Channel in dinghies.

This trumpeted French deal, is highly unlikely to be the deterrent they hope for. I still maintain the best tactic Labour could have empoloyed was to review Rwanda, dress it up as a Labour revamp and used it. After all we now learn the US are now going to use it at our expense. Just like the Chagos Islands.

In Norway they had a refreshing view of our immigration issues. To be fair they have historical experience of coming to our shores in boats, primarily in search of riches. The main point, and yes of course they too have those who shout ‘racism’ at just about anything, is, in the main, they don’t see illegal migration as an issue of race.

Good, because it isn’t and we shouldn’t let it be. It is about resources and culture clash. Tim Montgomerie – or ‘Number One”, as I refer to him (since he calls me ‘Number Three’) wrote the same on social media, and he’s gone to Reform who draw the biggest flak around race and migration.

It was interesting to watch from afar how much those on the left want to make any criticism or protest about immigration ‘far right’ or ‘racist’. And like all of Labour’s tin eared communications they never realise it doesn’t work.

Using hotels and opening more of them, despite their promise to close them for asylum seekers, was always unpopular, for any party. I have personally been lobbied by MPs begging the Home Office to shut a hotel in their constituency to illegal migrants. My former boss James Cleverly had a site in his constituency. That he could not, and would not, as a Secretary of State simply move them elsewhere for his own benefit certainly cost him votes. I still think large sites like airfields and old army camps were better all round and I think Labour shut them because they thought they’d get a rousing cheer when they did.

But they didn’t. When you convince yourselves you’re the only good guys, you get a lot wrong.

The protests around hotels have been framed as racist, and far right, and look, I’m not going to suggest that no single person part of them was either racist or far right, that would be silly, but branding all of them that way, and having counter protests police-escorted in just seemed to me, and my Viking relatives, equally absurd.

There are, I won’t name names, civil servants in the Home Office who quite clearly take the view that action on migrants comes from an ideological dislike of non-white foreigners and that we’d all be better off giving them an amnesty and letting them all stay. One way of reducing the ‘backlog’. Funny because that’s exactly what the Government is quietly doing.

When they boast they are reducing the backlog of asylum applications they never say how many were successful. It’s a lot. One civil servant said rather revealingly in a meeting last year “the thing is Giles basically half the population loves refugees and half the population hates them”

This was false on so many levels it was hard to know where to start.

Nobody has an issue with genuine refugees, but plenty have quite a problem with the assumption that anyone who sets foot off a dingy on a shingle beach in Kent is automatically a refugee. I don’t think people hate them, they just want the influx controlled. And for good measure I don’t think people love them either, I think there is a political wedge that some find useful by pretending they do.

People who struggle to pay their bills don’t like seeing men between 16-40 with an obvious cultural dissonance get ‘better’ treatment than they think they do, from ‘the powers that be’.

The hospitable Vikings who took me into their homes and looked after me, were confused about how we allowed legitimate concerns about illegal migration, with numbers far far smaller than legal migration, to get tangled up with the tricky threads of race and ethnicity.

They get the cultural concerns, and the logistics of looking at an ongoing influx of large numbers when they look at their neighbour Sweden, with sadly shaking heads. They don’t see that as ‘racist’.

I see, indeed I have contributed to, warranted criticism of Starmer, Reeves, Lammy, Kendle, and others, and often wonder how Yvette Cooper escapes an equal tsunami of flak. Her immigration policies have been a complete dud, and no I don’t think this French deal is going to fix things, more than window dressing for a comms strategy that has strayed into, frankly, outright lying.

Do far right racist people like it when people get angry or upset about immigration? Of course. Is being angry or upset about immigration inherently far right and racist? No absolutely not.

To suggest otherwise is, like the Home Secretary, balls.",https://conservativehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Finn_Giles_3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 10:56:16.469969

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

In an Aug. 7 interview on EWTN News, the Trump administration is working on a “standalone process” for religious workers in the employment-based fourth preference (EB-4) category, separate from other applicants such as minors in the Special Immigrant Juvenile program.

The EB-4 backlog ballooned after Congress added juveniles to the category in 2023, extending green card wait times to more than five years. Religious workers typically come to the United States on temporary R-1 visas, which expire after five years. The delay means many must leave the country before their green card applications are processed, disrupting ministries and forcing congregations to seek replacements.

“We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here or some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here,” Rubio said. “We know it’s an issue and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Rubio did not outline specifics or a timeline for creating the “freeway” — a dedicated lane within the EB-4 category that would remove religious workers from competing with other applicants.

Meanwhile, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Tim Kaine, D-Va., have introduced the Religious Workforce Protection Act, which would keep clergy in the United States during the backlog but would not speed up green card processing.

The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow R-1 holders with pending EB-4 applications to remain beyond the current five-year cap, permit them to change employers without jeopardizing their applications, and waive the one-year foreign residency requirement for those who have already been forced to leave.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has urged Congress to pass the measure, calling it “desperately needed” to preserve the contributions of foreign-born religious leaders. Archbishop Timothy Broglio, USCCB president, said the bill would “ensure communities across our nation can continue to enjoy the essential contributions” of these workers.

If enacted, the Collins–Kaine bill would provide immediate relief to churches and faith-based organizations facing staffing gaps caused by the backlog. But unlike Rubio’s proposed “standalone process,” the measure does not change EB-4 quotas or the underlying competition for visas. Wait times would remain, and the number of green cards available to religious workers would still be limited by law.

The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and faces an uncertain path to passage. For now, Rubio’s promised structural fix exists only as an administration concept without legislative text. That leaves the religious community looking at two very different potential outcomes: one that tackles the backlog at its source, and another that manages — but does not eliminate — the wait.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rsc_!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F880e334e-a2c6-4293-b25d-342dbac7e229_1032x976.png",N,,2025-08-10 11:56:45.073463

Trump administration’s immigration actions are part of a broader political strategy, says UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura.

The administration’s approach is more intense and disciplined in its second term, with fewer restraints.

“The damage being done in the university setting is severe.” – Hiroshi Motomura

UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura, one of the nation’s leading scholars on immigration law, says the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration actions are part of a broader political strategy designed to reshape the country’s identity, instill fear in immigrant communities, and redefine who counts as an American — and that the second Trump administration is pursuing these goals with greater discipline, intensity and fewer restraints than in Trump’s first term.

“This is much more intense than what happened in the first Trump administration,” Motomura said. “I think that those restraints are not there.”

In an interview with Everyday Injustice, Motomura said the sheer scope of the administration’s executive orders — from enforcement crackdowns to attempts to narrow birthright citizenship — reflects a “comprehensiveness” and “intensity” aimed at far more than changing specific laws.

“I think there’s a broader agenda to give voice to a certain conception of America,” he said. “The point of an initiative is not necessarily to see that initiative get upheld in court and enacted into law.”

Motomura, who has taught at UCLA, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Colorado, has spent nearly four decades studying immigration, citizenship, refugee, and asylum law. Beyond his academic work, he has been active in advocacy, including helping lead the campaign that resulted in the creation of DACA in 2012. He is the faculty co-director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy.

From his perspective, the administration’s messaging is as important as the policies themselves. He pointed to Trump’s push to reinterpret the Constitution to limit citizenship for children of noncitizens — an initiative he sees as unlikely to survive in court but highly effective as a political signal to supporters.

Similarly, he described mass deportation campaigns as serving a dual purpose: removing people and creating “concern, anxiety, fear, even terrorize some immigrant communities.”

In Motomura’s view, Trump’s second term has been far more organized. The first time around, he said, the administration included “traditional Republican voices” who sometimes pushed back on immigration proposals over concerns about family separation or economic fallout. That internal resistance is gone.

“When Trump lost in 2020, there are people who stuck with him… and there are people, for example, Stephen Miller… who was very much the hardest of the hardliners as far as I can tell on immigration issues,” Motomura said. Miller, now deputy chief of staff, “is in a position of much greater power in the second Trump administration.”

Motomura said the administration’s promises to deport millions inevitably lead to targeting citizens and legal residents.

“People who might be deportable… don’t walk around with a sign around their neck,” he said. The only way to produce those numbers, he argued, is to take shortcuts — such as racial profiling, language-based targeting, and neighborhood sweeps — and to limit due process through measures like expanded “expedited removal,” which allows deportations without a full immigration court hearing.

Many of those caught in enforcement dragnets, he said, have deep roots in the U.S. — people who have lived in the country for decades, raised families, and built their lives here.

He also stressed that decades of labor policy have “tolerated and even invited” undocumented workers, creating an economic reality in which millions live and work without legal status. Fixing the system, he said, requires not just legalization but “rethinking the categories and the ways people are brought to this country.”

Motomura challenged the popular image of undocumented immigration as mostly unauthorized border crossings.

“A significant percentage… did not sneak across the border,” he said. “They came in lawfully and for one reason or another, they stayed longer than they’re supposed to.”

That reality complicates the administration’s narrative and underscores the racial stereotypes in immigration enforcement. Undocumented immigrants include people from Europe, Asia, and around the world, he noted, yet public rhetoric still centers on Latin American migrants.

The current crackdown also goes beyond the undocumented, he said. The administration has targeted people with lawful status, including holders of Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian designation Congress created for nationals of countries facing dire conditions.

Removing TPS from hundreds of thousands of people is a deliberate way to “get the numbers of deportable people up,” he said.

Universities have also been affected, with international students facing visa denials or restrictions that prevent them from completing degrees or taking jobs in the U.S.

The loss is not just educational but economic, Motomura said, as students contribute tuition revenue, fill teaching assistant positions, and spend money in local communities.

The approach reflects “a certain degree of extreme isolationism,” he said, signaling a disregard for higher education and global exchange. “The damage being done in the university setting is severe.”

Motomura linked disparate policies — from due process rollbacks to the use of the Alien Enemies Act — to a unifying narrative in which immigration is cast as a form of “invasion.”

“It’s no accident that the word invasion appears… in the executive orders,” he said. “That’s what justifies… that we can’t afford due process because we’re going to protect you from invaders.”

This framing also drives attempts to restrict birthright citizenship, which could strip citizenship from people born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents, including international students and businesspeople.

Motomura acknowledged that U.S. immigration law exists against a backdrop of conquest and displacement, from wars against Indigenous nations to the annexation of Mexican territory.

But he cautioned against assuming that recognizing those injustices means erasing national borders altogether.

He described himself as a “realistic utopian,” focused on incremental reforms that make the system fairer while keeping political change possible. That means recognizing history’s role — for example, in justifying asylum for Afghans who worked with U.S. forces or legalizing long-term residents whose labor was encouraged — but also navigating current political constraints.

“I’m focused on choices that are good choices and choices that are bad choices… that add up during a presidential administration or in a decade to make policy more fair than it is today,” he said.

Motomura sees economic dislocation as a driver of anti-immigrant sentiment, with political leaders channeling economic uncertainty into “racial anxiety or cultural anxiety.”

The immigrant rights movement, he said, has not always paid enough attention to economic injustice, leaving “fertile ground for people to swoop in and say, I’m for you and those other people are against you.”

Much of the economic pressure has little to do with immigration, he added, citing automation, weakened unions, and global trade shifts. But the U.S. has done “a poor job of really sharing wealth,” failing to invest in job retraining, education, and infrastructure that could ease displacement.

Motomura’s new book, Borders and Belonging: A Guide to Making Immigration Policy Ethical, is aimed at a general audience and distills decades of scholarship into a framework for understanding the legal, historical, and economic dimensions of immigration.

The 163-page book, he said, is intended to be “fair-minded,” taking opposing arguments seriously while offering principled responses. It covers topics from temporary versus permanent migration to the role of history in policy and the need for the immigrant rights movement to engage with economic inequality.

“It’s certainly the book I would give to someone from another planet if they landed in the United States and said, what is going on here,” he said.

For Motomura, the stakes in the immigration debate are not just about who gets to stay or go, but about the kind of country the U.S. chooses to be — and whether it uses law as a tool for inclusion or exclusion.

The UC Berkeley sophomore said international students should continue to consider their safety as well as their rights.","At UC Berkeley, a sophomore told CalMatters that she was involved in campus activism for about a year and a half until about March, when she saw international students losing their visas and heard rumors of immigration enforcement agents on campus. Her thoughts on protesting have changed drastically. “Everything I say can be used against me,” she said. She has been coming up with creative ways to be involved while trying to keep herself and other international students safe. For example, she participates in student club meetings, where she feels she can speak more privately.

“I came to the United States because those are things that I wasn’t comfortable doing in my country,” the sophomore said. “I wasn’t comfortable speaking out. It was like a dictatorship, and that’s why I came to America, which is, like, where the freedom is supposed to be. And then I got met with this. It’s really, really disappointing.”

Also at UC Berkeley, a junior from the UK said that last year she felt much freer. During the campus pro-Palestinian protests last year, she wanted to participate but was too busy. Her regret has now turned into relief because if anyone had taken a picture of her near a protest, she believes she would have suffered consequences.

“Under a Biden administration, I would have felt like I was free to criticize the administration. I was free to take part in protests,” she said. “Because of Trump’s recent decision — especially with the students at Columbia — I feel like I can’t be anywhere near a protest.”

An international graduate student at another UC — he does not want to name his campus in fear of not passing his dissertation — is working on a research project about the interplay of international politics and media. His research paper includes a section on human rights violations and genocide. Initially, he included coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Faculty advised him to remove the parts about Israel from his final project, he said.

“It does not have that big an impact on the entire project … but personally I’m just disappointed that I could not talk about it in my final events,” the graduate student said. “I will be presenting this to a set of faculty from my department, and they will be grading that, determining whether I can graduate or not based on the paper. It impacts a little bit on my department, and regarding freedom of speech.”

Balancing the support of Jewish students and due process

In his executive order, Trump promises to protect the civil rights of Jewish citizens, who have faced harassment, physical threats and assault on college campuses.

UC Irvine Jewish student Shir — who requested not to use her full name because she fears discrimination – believes if a student on a visa is “celebrating terror explicitly,” their student status should be evaluated. However, she notes the importance of drawing the line at terror and hate and not overstepping legal boundaries.

“Skipping [due] process doesn’t protect [against] antisemitism, it only creates more hate in the system,” Shir said in an email. “We are all humans first and should be treated as such.”

While she supports students’ right to protest, Shir wrote “there have been students repeating and glorifying slogans and ideas used by Hamas, a terrorist organization. This is where action is needed. I and many other Jewish students have been confronted at these protests and on campus, told I am a terrorist, that my family in Israel deserves to die, and had protesters outright justify Hamas’ actions to me.”

Raquel Aldana, a law professor at UC Davis, said the language being used by the Trump administration about antisemitism is extremely broad and could be read to include anything that is anti-Israel.

“One of the areas they’re going to be watching is how these institutions of higher learning respond to allegations of antisemitism, which could end up targeting foreign students,” Aldana said.

The Trump administration’s antisemitism task force is investigating allegations of antisemitic incidents at at least 10 college campuses across the country, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California.

Aldana said she didn’t understand what problems the investigations are meant to address — adding that it “feels like a political move and not a true concern.”

International students limited on travel options

Three UC campuses that responded to CalMatters said they’ve sent communications to international students to use caution if they plan to travel outside the country.

Right before spring break, international students said they received travel warning emails from their international student offices about the risks of leaving the country. At UC Berkeley, the sophomore student said an email from the Berkeley International Office said the office could not guarantee international students’ ability to return to the U.S. if they left the country, even though the U.S. State Department’s website states continuing students may enter the country at any time.

“We had to spend our spring break in the U.S., [when] people want to go home,” the UC Berkeley sophomore said. “Not having that option is really disappointing, the fact that no one at the university can advocate for the small percentage of [international] students they have, … is insane to me.”

For the summer break, UC Berkeley’s International Office sent another email in May that urged “caution” for continuing international students who planned to travel out of the country. On June 4, the White House released a Presidential Proclamation announcing restrictions from 19 designated countries to enter the U.S. As a result, UC Davis and UC Irvine recommended that international students from those 19 countries not leave the U.S. because the travel ban may prevent them from re-entering.

Student newspapers face ethical dilemmas

Öztürk, the Tufts university student arrested after criticizing her university’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release from a detention facility in Louisiana in May. Her arrest spurred college publications to take extra precautions.

Adalia Luo, editor-in-chief of UC San Diego’s student news organization The Guardian, and Chris Ponce, editor-in-chief of The California Aggie at UC Davis, said their opinion departments have been making changes. Luo said her organization has removed names from articles by international student writers upon request. Luo added that the priority is protecting the students even though removing a byline weakens a story’s credibility.

UC Davis’ student news staff has discussed a similar issue. Ponce said they’re not simply granting anonymity for anyone who asks. However, they are “now more than ever” open to removing whole articles if it means protecting the status of international students, which they are doing on a case-by-case basis.

One student newspaper is challenging the Trump administration’s policies regarding noncitizen students. The Stanford Daily, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, is suing Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over immigration laws that allow the revocation of student visas for protected speech.

According to a letter from the editors, far fewer international students are willing to speak to The Daily, and those who do request anonymity. “Several international members of our own staff even left their positions at The Daily. Many of those who stayed requested to stop writing news articles related to protests or political events on campus and asked that their previous articles be taken off our website,” the letter states.

The junior at UC Berkeley said she writes for a campus political magazine. Once the Trump administration started targeting international students, she asked for the articles to be taken down, and the magazine obliged.

“I didn’t want my name affiliated with criticisms of the administration, as that would either risk me getting deported or a future visa being rejected. I believe the articles are still inaccessible, and my goal is that they remain so for the rest of Trump’s term,” the junior said.

Despite fears about sharing their viewpoints publicly, international students say it’s important to be advocates for themselves and each other.

The UC Berkeley sophomore said international students should continue to consider their safety as well as their rights.

“You should be taking precautions to keep your status and to keep yourself safe, but to also know that if we back down, change will never happen,” the sophomore said.

The facility was annocunced in March and began to receive the first 100 immigrants on Aug. 1.

The Fort Bliss ICE detention center is set to become a major deportation hub.

El Paso's Fort Bliss is set to become the site of the largest immigration detention facility in the United States, as the administration of Donald Trump expands its nationwide crackdown on immigration.

The detention center on the U.S. Army post began receiving the first of 1,000 detainees on Aug. 1, with around 100 individuals arriving at the new detention facility. El Paso's ICE spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa said in a news statement that the goal is to have 1,000 people detained in the facility by Aug. 17.

The Trump administration plans to expand the facility by 250 beds each week until it reaches 1,000. Ultimately, ICE looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility.

""We will finish construction for up to 5,000 beds in the weeks and months ahead,"" Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Aug. 7. ""Upon completion, this will be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission.""

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility. Zamarripa said in the news statement that the facilities will provide detainees with access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation and medical treatment, among other services, which detainees receive in other facilities.

The Trump administration has stated that it will hold single adults who are scheduled for deportation. Immigrants held there are scheduled to be there for a short-term period before they are removed from the country.

The construction of the Fort Bliss detention facility expands ICE's capacity in the El Paso Sector, which stretches from New Mexico's border with Arizona through El Paso County. There are currently three other detention centers in the El Paso area, which includes an ICE detention facility and processing center on Montana Avenue, near the El Paso International Airport, as well as a facility north of the city on Highway 54 and another facility in Otero, New Mexico.

The three facilities can hold up to 3,000 people.

The El Paso Times has reached out to the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to tour the facility, but received no response to any media inquiries.

What do we know about the detention facility?

Former U.S. Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll announced that construction of the detention facility was imminent in March, following his visit to Fort Bliss and the El Paso area.

During the news conference, Fort Bliss Deputy Committee General Paul Krattiger said that the detention facility would be constructed at the location known as ""Site Monitor,"" which is just off of Montana Avenue and George Dieter Drive.

While the administration of President Donald Trump initially said the facility would hold up to 10,000 detainees, this number was reduced to 5,000.

The Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC company was awarded a $231,878,229 firm-fixed-price contract to establish and operate a detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The contract comes on the heels of Presidential Executive Order 14159, which outlines using ""national security assets for law and order.""

Military and commercial deportation flights

The Fort Bliss facility is meant to be a hub for the deportation of immigrants and to ease the capacity of centers across the country, ICE officials said.

""ICE is using Camp East Montana to help decompress ICE detention facilities in other regions,"" the statement said. ""It will also serve as a processing facility, and ICE Air Operations will effectuate removals for aliens staged at the facility.""

El Paso and Fort Bliss have continued to be the departure site of both military and ICE-chartered commercial deportation flights. Military deportation flights carry fewer deportees than commercial charters, but have a higher operating cost.

At least 68 military deportation flights have returned migrants to over a dozen countries since Jan. 24. Thirteen of the flights have departed Fort Bliss' Biggs Army Airfield, according to data compiled by Tom Cartwright with the immigration advocacy group Witness at the Border.

The majority of flights have transported immigrants to Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador.

Concerns with congressional oversight

The construction of the ICE facility on Fort Bliss raises concerns for congressional oversight to uphold humane conditions at the immigration detention site.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has regularly carried out congressional oversight visits to the facilities, where she has sought to guarantee humane treatment of immigrants held in the detention centers. She was blocked from visiting the Montana Avenue facility in June 2025, leading to her filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

She has raised concerns over carrying out oversight at the Fort Bliss detention center.

""It is going to be very challenging to continue to provide oversight if we don't challenge the Trump administration in court,"" Escobar said at a news conference on July 30. ""The lawsuit is pretty critical, especially given the massive expansion of immigration detention that is going to happen as the result of Republicans giving tens of billions of dollars to private corporations.""

ICE detention facilities across the United States have faced accusations of inhumane conditions.

The ICE facility on Montana Avenue has faced criticisms over the conditions that immigrants face while in custody. Amnesty International raised concerns about the facilities in a report in May 2025, and U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia, who reported immigrants being slammed to the ground by guards at the Montana Avenue center in a report on the abuse of pregnant women and children in ICE detention.

The Department of Homeland Security has refuted these claims.

Wisconsin Watch

A group of federal agencies announced in July that at least 15 federally funded health, education and social service programs would exclude undocumented immigrants and some who are living in the country legally.

Responding to President Donald Trump’s February executive order to “identify all federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to illegal aliens and take corrective action,” the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Labor listed programs that provide literacy classes, career education, medical and mental health care, substance abuse treatment, free preschool and more.

In Wisconsin alone, the state Department of Justice estimates the new federal restrictions “put at risk more than $43 million each year in substance abuse and community mental health block grants that fund services in all 72 counties, 11 Tribal nations, and approximately 50 nonprofit organizations.”

Wisconsin Watch contacted more than a dozen Wisconsin organizations, government agencies and national experts to learn about the new policy’s effects. But we found more questions than answers. Most are unsure who is subject to the new rules or how to comply.

While we were reporting this story, Wisconsin joined 20 other states in a lawsuit challenging the new restrictions. That suit is still pending, but the parties have agreed to a deal that would delay most of the restrictions in those states until September.

Confusion created by the guidance could have serious consequences, experts say. Some providers might delay or cancel programs unnecessarily out of an abundance of caution, while some immigrants may avoid services for which they remain eligible, such as health care and education.

While much remains unclear, here’s what we know so far.

Which immigrants would be barred?

A 1996 law already prohibited certain immigrants from receiving 31 “federal public benefits,” including Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and cash assistance. The Trump administration’s new guidance bars the same immigrants from additional programs, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Those ineligible include:

● People with Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

● People with nonimmigrant visas, such as student visas, work visas and U visas for survivors of serious crimes.

● People who have pending applications for asylum or a U visa.

● People granted Deferred Enforced Departure or deferred action. This includes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients — those who entered the country as children.

● Undocumented immigrants.

● Lawfully present immigrants who don’t fall into categories below.

People in the following groups would remain eligible:

● Lawful permanent residents (green card holders).

● Refugees.

● People who have been granted asylum or withholding of removal.

● Certain survivors of domestic violence.

● Certain survivors of trafficking.

● Certain Cuban and Haitian nationals.

● People residing under a Compact of Free Association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Why the confusion?

A range of institutions — including colleges, government agencies and nonprofits — manage the affected programs. Many did not previously check the immigration status of the people they serve; creating a process to do so may add costs and logistical challenges. It could prove especially daunting for organizations like soup kitchens and homeless shelters, which provide urgent services to people without easy access to documents.

Meanwhile, entities that administer these federal funds include nonprofits and federally funded community health centers, which operate under laws that conflict with the guidance.

Health and Human Services said its settlement with the suing states “will permit the agency to consider, as appropriate, whether to provide additional information” about the restrictions it announced.

How would the changes affect health care in Wisconsin?

Wisconsin has 16 federally qualified community health centers serving patients at 217 sites. They receive money from Congress to provide primary care to all, regardless of their ability to pay. Nationally, such clinics serve more than 32 million patients, making up 1 in 10 people in the United States and 1 in 5 people in rural America, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Aside from emergency rooms, they are often the only care options for undocumented immigrants or those with limited English proficiency, said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a national nonprofit providing information on health issues.

Federal law requiring those clinics to accept “all residents of the area served by the center” contradicts the Trump administration guidance.

The national association said in a July 10 statement that it’s working with experts and legislators to understand the impact of the new rules and ensure centers “have the information and resources needed” to continue serving their patients.

Access Community Health Centers, a nonprofit that provides medical, dental and mental health care at five south central Wisconsin clinics, will make “adjustments” if further federal guidance comes, CEO Ken Loving said.

“We don’t have the information we need to understand how this is going to impact us and how we can adapt to help our patients,” he said.

How would the changes affect education in Wisconsin?

The new restrictions target adult education services under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act and career and technical education services under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. Community and technical colleges would likely face the brunt of the impact, but just how much is unclear.

The Wisconsin Technical College System has followed 1997 guidance that said public benefit restrictions did not apply to such educational services, spokesperson Katy Petterson said. She’s not sure how the updated guidance might affect the system, which will “wait to learn the impact of the lawsuit.”

If community-college-operated programs begin checking immigration status, ineligible immigrants may remain able to take federally funded classes through nonprofits that are subject to different rules.

The nation’s 1,600 Head Start agencies, which provide free early childhood education and family support services for low-income families, fall under the restrictions announced in the Department of Health and Human Services notice. But the document doesn’t say whether Head Start staff must verify the immigration status of children, parents or both.

“It’s very ambiguous about who this impacts. … If you read the language, it’s 26-plus-ish pages of legal jargon, and it’s shifting,” said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, which supports the state’s roughly 300 Head Start service sites.

One thing Mauer wants families to know: Children already enrolled in Head Start won’t be forced out.

“We want to follow the rules, but Head Start is not required to redetermine eligibility,” Mauer said, noting it has never been required to do so in 60 years. She’s been telling the center directors to sit tight, even as worried parents ask questions.

One entity that won’t start checking immigration status: K-12 schools. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that denying education to undocumented students violated their constitutional rights.

Must nonprofit providers start checking immigration status?

Probably not. The 1996 law restricting public benefits says nonprofit charities are not required to “determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”

At Literacy Network, a nonprofit offering a variety of free ESL and basic education classes in Madison, staff aren’t planning changes based on the new rule.

“It could certainly impact many of our students in other areas of their lives and therefore their ability to participate in our programs, but not who we can serve,” spokesperson Margaret Franchino said.

Still, guidance from the Department of Education is vague. It states that the exemption for nonprofits is “narrowly crafted,” and “the Department does not interpret (it) to relieve states or other governmental entities … from the requirements to ensure that all relevant programs are in compliance.”

Ryan Graham is the homeless systems manager at Wisconsin Balance of State Continuum of Care, a nonprofit that supports agencies responding to homelessness across most of the state.

As his agency discusses updates with partner agencies, it is preparing for an “increased administrative burden on already stretched staff.”

“We don’t yet know whether there will be delays caused by having to check or validate someone’s citizenship status, especially in emergency situations where time is critical,” Graham said.

When do the new rules take effect?

The notices published in July took effect immediately, though some federal agencies said they would likely not enforce them for about a month. The Trump administration later agreed to pause enforcement until Sept. 3 in the 21 states that sued.

The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, has voluntarily stayed enforcement of its directive in all states until Sept. 10.

What is the basis of legal challenges?

The multistate lawsuit argues the Trump administration failed to follow proper procedures in implementation and that it can’t retroactively change the rules after states accept grants to administer programs. Requirements to check the immigration status of every person served would unreasonably burden program staff and possibly force programs to close, the states argue.

States “will suffer continued, irreparable harm if forced to dramatically restructure their social safety nets and render them inaccessible to countless of the States’ most vulnerable residents,” the plaintiffs wrote.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance. That suit argued staffing cuts, funding delays and bans on diversity efforts threatened to destabilize Head Start — a long-standing, congressionally mandated program. A hearing in that suit was held Aug. 5 on a request to temporarily block the Health and Human Services notice.

What does the Trump administration say?

The 1996 public benefits ban exempted federal programs that offered services available to all people on the grounds that they were “necessary for the protection of life and safety.”

Trump calls that exemption too broad.

“A surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly strained,” the White House said.

Citing studies from congressional committees and groups that seek to severely curtail immigration, the White House argues that allowing broad access to federal resources incentivizes illegal immigration and costs U.S. taxpayers. The recent federal spending package also eliminated access to Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps for some authorized immigrants, including refugees and asylees.

Trump ran for office on a promise to carry out mass deportations, and the bureaucratic moves appear to be a new frontier in that immigration crackdown. Since he took office, the administration has raided stores and workplaces, built new detention centers and attempted to shut down the asylum process at the southern border. It has also urged many immigrants without permanent legal status, including DACA recipients, to self-deport.

Why does this policy change matter?

Experts worry the confusion about the new rule could have a chilling effect, leading even eligible immigrants to stop using services.

Pillai of KFF noted that the restrictions on community health centers, alongside congressionally approved changes “that limit health coverage to a smaller group of lawfully present immigrants,” will likely make immigrant families even more reluctant to seek health care and social services.

The changes “may increase their reliance on emergency room care, which can be more costly in the long term,” she added.

Graham, the homeless systems manager, believes the Trump change will create “a direct barrier to safe and stable shelter for undocumented individuals and mixed-status families” and qualified immigrants or citizens who “may not have identification or the means to attain identification after fleeing a dangerous situation or crisis.”

It could also prompt administrators of some programs not covered by the rule to start screening participants as a precaution, or shut down programs to avoid screening challenges.

That has happened before. When Trump issued an executive order in January saying the administration would no longer “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender-affirming health care for people under 19, some providers stopped offering those services even though state law protected them.

Likewise, a 2023 KFF study found that in states that institute abortion bans, the majority of health care providers say they worry about accidentally running afoul of the law.

Braden Goetz, who worked for more than 20 years in the U.S. Department of Education and now works as a senior policy adviser at the New America Foundation’s Center on Education and Labor, said it’s unusual for federal guidance to be so sparse and ambiguous.

“​​Maybe that’s the intention: to confuse people and chill services to people who are not citizens or not legal permanent residents, and scare people,” Goetz said.

Good-government groups and small and mid-sized law firms have stepped into the breach, helping to file hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration.
But until they build up the capacity to fully replace Big Law, Bonds said, some of the administration’s legally dubious actions will go unchallenged.","Two weeks into President Donald Trump’s second presidency, and just days after he pardoned hundreds of Capitol rioters, officials Trump had placed in charge of the Justice Department made a sweeping demand. They wanted the names of the thousands of FBI employees who had played a role in investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Fearing mass firings, or worse, retaliation by the people they helped prosecute, a group of agents scrambled to enlist a legal team who could stop the administration in court. Norm Eisen, a prominent ethics lawyer now leading dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, agreed within hours to represent the agents pro bono, along with Mark Zaid, a veteran whistleblower attorney. For more firepower, the two approached the giant Chicago-based law firm Winston & Strawn, which has a history of providing free representation to people and organizations that squared off against Trump’s first administration.

But Winston declined to represent the FBI agents, three people with knowledge of the matter said. It was one of several cases Winston turned down in quick succession, they added, that would have pitted the firm against an openly retributive president.

Some of the country’s largest law firms have declined to represent clients challenging the Trump administration, more than a dozen attorneys and nonprofit leaders told ProPublica, while others have sought to avoid any clients that Trump might perceive as his enemies. That includes both clients willing to pay the firms’ steep rates, and those who receive free representation. Big Law firms are also refusing to take on legal work involving environmental protections, LGBTQ+ rights and police accountability or to represent elected Democrats and federal workers purged in Trump’s war on the “deep state.” Advocacy groups say this is beginning to hamper their efforts to challenge the Trump administration.

Their fears intensified after Trump signed a battery of executive orders aimed at punishing top firms over old associations with his adversaries. But as the Winston episode shows, Big Law began to back away from some clients almost the minute he returned to power. The country’s top firms remain deeply wary, even though the president has lost all four initial court challenges to those executive orders.

“The President’s Policy is working as designed,” said a lawsuit the American Bar Association filed against the administration in June. “Even as federal judges have ruled over and over that the Law Firm Orders are plainly unconstitutional, law firms that once proudly contributed thousands of hours of pro bono work to a host of causes — including causes championed by the ABA — have withdrawn from such work because it is disfavored by the Administration.”

The bar association itself has struggled to find representation, the lawsuit said. One unnamed firm, which has represented the association since the 1980s in lawsuits related to ABA’s accreditation of law schools, “is no longer willing to represent the ABA in any litigation against or potentially adverse to the Administration and its policies.” Sidley Austin, the sixth-ranked corporate firm by revenue in the world, has represented the ABA in at least five lawsuits over its accreditation practices since 1989.

The ABA and Susman Godfrey, which is representing the association in its lawsuit against the administration, declined to comment. Winston, Sidley and the White House did not respond to questions sent in writing.

Trump’s grievances with Big Law stem partly from its role in blocking his first-term agenda. In his executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a firm with close ties to the Democratic Party that fought Trump on transgender rights and immigration, he assailed the firm for allegedly “abus[ing] its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice.” Another firm, WilmerHale, was where former Special Counsel Robert Mueller worked before and after leading the Russian interference investigation.

The executive orders barred attorneys working for the firms from entering federal buildings where they represent clients, terminated the firms’ government contracts, revoked partners’ security clearances and required government contractors to disclose if they work with the targeted firms. Perkins Coie, one of Trump’s first targets, began to lose business “within hours,” its suit said. The judge who halted the executive order against WilmerHale wrote that the firm “faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.”

“I just think that the law firms have to behave themselves,” Trump said at a press conference in late March.

Nine corporate law firms behaved themselves in the form of reaching public settlements with Trump. The deals require them to provide $940 million in total of pro bono support for Trump-approved causes. There has been no public indication of the White House calling on them to perform specific work, and Trump has not released any new executive orders against firms since April.

Yet organizations that challenge the government are still feeling the chill.

“There’s been a real, noticeable shift,” said Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, a national nonprofit that brings lawsuits over alleged police abuse and was a frequent pro bono client of Big Law.

In November, as soon as Trump won reelection, a top firm that was helping NPAP develop a lawsuit against a city’s police force abruptly stopped attending all planning calls, Bonds said. Later, the firm became one of the nine that struck a deal with Trump, after which the firm half-heartedly told Bonds, she said, that it would reconsider the case in the future. Bonds declined to identify the firm.

Activist nonprofits have long relied on free representation because they typically lack the resources to mount major lawsuits on their own. Civil rights cases in particular are complex undertakings usually lasting years. Many call for hundreds of hours spent deposing witnesses and performing research, as well as upfront costs of tens of thousands of dollars. Big Law, with its deep ranks of attorneys and paying clients to subsidize their volunteer work, is in a unique position to help. In exchange, the work burnishes the firm’s reputation and serves as a draw for idealistic young associates.

“I know that [cases] have been shot down that in Trump Administration 1, firms would crawl over each other to get our name at the top of the case so that we could get the New York Times headline,” said a Big Law partner whose firm has not been one of Trump’s targets. “That’s the environment. What’s become radioactive has grown from a very small number of things to anything this administration and Trump might notice and get angry about.”

Jill Collen Jefferson, the president and founder of Julian, a small nonprofit that investigates civil rights violations, has felt the chill too.

Three years ago, Julian partnered with the elite law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the country’s No. 1 corporate firm most years by per-partner revenue, to bring lawsuits against the town of Lexington, Mississippi, and its police force for racial discrimination.

“It wasn’t hard at all to get help,” she recalled. George Floyd’s death had raised public support for police accountability, and the details Julian was exposing in Lexington were especially grim. The police chief was secretly recorded promising to cover for a fellow officer if he killed someone “in cold blood.” A DOJ investigation released in 2024 found Lexington police operated in “a system where officers can relentlessly violate the law.” (The town’s board fired the chief, Sam Dobbins, over the recording. In a court filing, Dobbins said he was not guilty of “any actionable conduct” and denied Julian’s characterization of the recording, asserting that “the recording speaks for itself.” Julian’s litigation is still ongoing.)

Since January, when Trump began gutting police accountability measures, Jefferson’s efforts to recruit pro bono help have yielded almost no commitments. The official explanation many firms offer is that they lack the capacity to help, she said, though lawyers at those firms have privately told her that was false. Wachtell did not respond to a request for comment.

Jefferson now doubts Julian’s ability to bring a police abuse lawsuit it had planned to file before the statute of limitations expires this month.

“It’s been a nightmare,” she said. “People don’t want to stand up, and because of that, people are suffering.”

NPAP ultimately joined forces with another civil rights organization to salvage the case after its co-counsel disappeared from planning calls last November. But the suit will be “less robust” without the firepower of a major law firm, Bonds said. And NPAP’s capacity to file future suits is in question. Civil rights attorneys in NPAP’s network have developed novel legal theories for challenging arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under state constitutions, but they lack enough outside partnerships.

“There are cases that aren’t being brought at a time when civil rights abuses are maybe at the highest they’ve been in modern times,” Bonds said.

Big Law was often in the vanguard of fighting Trump’s first administration. After he signed the 2017 travel ban affecting several predominantly Muslim countries, partners from Kirkland & Ellis and Davis Polk rushed alongside hundreds of other lawyers to international airports to help travelers stuck in limbo. Kirkland teamed up with the LGBTQ+ legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal to challenge Trump’s transgender military ban.

Now, Davis Polk is among the many firms that are avoiding pro bono immigration cases, The New York Times reported. Kirkland, by some measures the top moneymaker in Big Law, entered a deal with Trump to provide $125 million in pro bono work, and the firm is notably absent from Lambda’s nearly identical challenge to Trump’s reinstated ban on transgender military service members. Kirkland and Davis Polk did not respond to requests for comment.

Winston & Strawn’s annual pro bono reports show how its focus — or at least, its language — has changed. The firm’s 2023 impact report highlighted its advocacy on behalf of a transgender competitive marathoner. “I am also pleased to report that Winston dedicated 30% of our pro bono hours to racial justice and equity matters in 2023,” nearly double its share in 2020, wrote Angela Smedley, the pro bono committee chair. The 2024 report, published after Trump’s reelection, contained zero mentions of “equity” and spotlighted attorneys who helped small nonprofits navigate “complex mergers and business challenges.”

Eisen and Zaid, the lawyers representing the FBI agents, themselves became the target of a presidential memorandum in March that revoked their access to classified material. Both have aggravated Trump for years. Zaid represented a whistleblower who helped bring about Trump’s first impeachment.

Zaid sued to restore his security clearance in May, in a case that is ongoing. His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, is a high-profile defense attorney who left Winston this spring in order to form his own firm. Lowell said his goal is to represent those “unlawfully and inappropriately targeted.” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a fraud judgment against Trump and is now a target of his DOJ, was one of his first clients.

“The Administration’s attempt at retribution against Mark for doing his job — representing whistleblowers without regard to politics — is as illegal as its similar efforts against law firms that have been enjoined in every case,” Lowell wrote in an email to ProPublica.

Good-government groups and small and mid-sized law firms have stepped into the breach, helping to file hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration. And the four firms that sued Trump over his executive orders are devoting thousands of pro bono hours to others challenging the administration.

This means that ICE and other federal immigration officers are no longer allowed to identify themselves as local police or use deceptive tactics during home arrests in Southern California.","Border Patrol agents took at least seven people during multiple immigration raids at Home Depots in Van Nuys on Friday, federal authorities confirmed Saturday.

Videos posted to Instagram by @valleyviewssfv showed at least two raids taking place in Home Depot parking lots on Friday morning, where a large presence of masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear arrested workers and took them away in unmarked vehicles.

The Department of Homeland Security later told KTLA that the seven detainees were from Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras. The first raid was reported around 7:15 a.m. by local leaders, and the second around 11:30 a.m.

Later Friday morning, Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey P. Horvath took to X to express distaste for the federal government’s tactics in immigration arrests.

“This morning in Van Nuys, several of our neighbors were forcibly taken by ICE. ICE agents showed no warrants & car windows were smashed,” said Horvath. Federal officials did not confirm or comment on the supervisor’s claim about property damages.

Horvath’s post went on to add, “The Trump administration is defying a court order to stop terrorizing our immigrant communities. It is heartbreaking, it is lawless, and it must end.”

On Aug. 4, the settlement of a class action lawsuit challenging federal immigration home arrest practices in L.A. was approved by a U.S. District Court judge. This means that ICE and other federal immigration officers are no longer allowed to identify themselves as local police or use deceptive tactics during home arrests in Southern California. In addition, agents may not claim to be conducting criminal investigations, probation or parole checks, or other public safety inquiries unless those claims are accurate.

Disputing claims of targeting people based on their skin color, race or ethnicity during these raids, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.”

The federal government did not comment on the tactics used in the arrests on Friday, but videos show the agents wearing vests that say “POLICE” and “U.S. BORDER PATROL,” along with their common use of masks and unmarked vehicles.

Friday’s raids came just two days after federal agents conducted an operation dubbed “Trojan Horse” at a Los Angeles Home Depot parking lot, where they used a Penske rental truck to disguise their presence before popping out and arresting 16 individuals.

In response to the Aug. 6 raid, Home Depot provided KTLA with a statement that read, “We aren’t notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and we’re not involved in them. In many cases, we don’t know that arrests have taken place until after they’re over. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

DHS indicated the Wednesday raid was in response to MS-13 gang activity in the area.

“America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists—truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities,” said McLaughlin. She also noted that, on Friday, “Of the 7 detainees 4 had criminal records spanning from multiple DUIs, arrest for disorderly conduct (prostitution), failure to appear for removal (ICE fugitive), and a prior removal.”

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance.
That’s because Head Start programs aren’t required to redetermine eligibility, according to Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director Jennie Mauer.","The rules seek to bar certain immigrants from accessing Head Start, health clinics, career training, substance abuse treatment and more. Much is still unclear, but here’s what we know so far.

A group of federal agencies announced in July that at least 15 federally funded health, education and social service programs would exclude undocumented immigrants and some who are living in the country legally.

Responding to President Donald Trump’s February executive order to “identify all federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to illegal aliens and take corrective action,” the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Labor listed programs that provide literacy classes, career education, medical and mental health care, substance abuse treatment, free preschool and more.

In Wisconsin alone, the state Department of Justice estimates the new federal restrictions “put at risk more than $43 million each year in substance abuse and community mental health block grants that fund services in all 72 counties, 11 Tribal nations, and approximately 50 nonprofit organizations.”

Wisconsin Watch contacted more than a dozen Wisconsin organizations, government agencies and national experts to learn about the new policy’s effects. But we found more questions than answers. Most are unsure who is subject to the new rules or how to comply.

While we were reporting this story, Wisconsin joined 20 other states in a lawsuit challenging the new restrictions. That suit is still pending, but the parties have agreed to a deal that would delay most of the restrictions in those states until September.

Confusion created by the guidance could have serious consequences, experts say. Some providers might delay or cancel programs unnecessarily out of an abundance of caution, while some immigrants may avoid services for which they remain eligible, such as health care and education.

While much remains unclear, here’s what we know so far.

Which immigrants would be barred?

A 1996 law already prohibited certain immigrants from receiving 31 “federal public benefits,” including Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and cash assistance. The Trump administration’s new guidance bars the same immigrants from additional programs, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Those ineligible include:

People with Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

People with nonimmigrant visas, such as student visas, work visas and U visas for survivors of serious crimes.

People who have pending applications for asylum or a U visa.

People granted Deferred Enforced Departure or deferred action. This includes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients — those who entered the country as children.

Undocumented immigrants.

Lawfully present immigrants who don’t fall into categories below.

People in the following groups would remain eligible:

Lawful permanent residents (green card holders).

Refugees.

People who have been granted asylum or withholding of removal.

Certain survivors of domestic violence.

Certain survivors of trafficking.

Certain Cuban and Haitian nationals.

People residing under a Compact of Free Association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Why the confusion?

A range of institutions — including colleges, government agencies and nonprofits — manage the affected programs. Many did not previously check the immigration status of the people they serve; creating a process to do so may add costs and logistical challenges. It could prove especially daunting for organizations like soup kitchens and homeless shelters, which provide urgent services to people without easy access to documents.

Meanwhile, entities that administer these federal funds include nonprofits and federally funded community health centers, which operate under laws that conflict with the guidance.

Health and Human Services said its settlement with the suing states “will permit the agency to consider, as appropriate, whether to provide additional information” about the restrictions it announced.

How would the changes affect health care in Wisconsin?

Wisconsin has 16 federally qualified community health centers serving patients at 217 sites. They receive money from Congress to provide primary care to all, regardless of their ability to pay. Nationally, such clinics serve more than 32 million patients, making up 1 in 10 people in the United States and 1 in 5 people in rural America, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Aside from emergency rooms, they are often the only care options for undocumented immigrants or those with limited English proficiency, said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a national nonprofit providing information on health issues.

Federal law requiring those clinics to accept “all residents of the area served by the center” contradicts the Trump administration guidance.

The national association said in a July 10 statement that it’s working with experts and legislators to understand the impact of the new rules and ensure centers “have the information and resources needed” to continue serving their patients.

Access Community Health Centers, a nonprofit that provides medical, dental and mental health care at five south central Wisconsin clinics, will make “adjustments” if further federal guidance comes, CEO Ken Loving said.

“We don’t have the information we need to understand how this is going to impact us and how we can adapt to help our patients,” he said.

The new restrictions target adult education services under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act and career and technical education services under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. Community and technical colleges would likely face the brunt of the impact, but just how much is unclear.

The Wisconsin Technical College System has followed 1997 guidance that said public benefit restrictions did not apply to such educational services, spokesperson Katy Petterson said. She’s not sure how the updated guidance might affect the system, which will “wait to learn the impact of the lawsuit.”

If community-college-operated programs begin checking immigration status, ineligible immigrants may remain able to take federally funded classes through nonprofits that are subject to different rules.

The nation’s 1,600 Head Start agencies, which provide free early childhood education and family support services for low-income families, fall under the restrictions announced in the Department of Health and Human Services notice. But the document doesn’t say whether Head Start staff must verify the immigration status of children, parents or both.

“It’s very ambiguous about who this impacts. … If you read the language, it’s 26-plus-ish pages of legal jargon, and it’s shifting,” said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, which supports the state’s roughly 300 Head Start service sites.

One thing Mauer wants families to know: Children already enrolled in Head Start won’t be forced out.

“We want to follow the rules, but Head Start is not required to redetermine eligibility,” Mauer said, noting it has never been required to do so in 60 years. She’s been telling the center directors to sit tight, even as worried parents ask questions.

One entity that won’t start checking immigration status: K-12 schools. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that denying education to undocumented students violated their constitutional rights.

Must nonprofit providers start checking immigration status?

Probably not. The 1996 law restricting public benefits says nonprofit charities are not required to “determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”

At Literacy Network, a nonprofit offering a variety of free ESL and basic education classes in Madison, staff aren’t planning changes based on the new rule.

“It could certainly impact many of our students in other areas of their lives and therefore their ability to participate in our programs, but not who we can serve,” spokesperson Margaret Franchino said.

Still, guidance from the Department of Education is vague. It states that the exemption for nonprofits is “narrowly crafted,” and “the Department does not interpret (it) to relieve states or other governmental entities … from the requirements to ensure that all relevant programs are in compliance.”

Ryan Graham is the homeless systems manager at Wisconsin Balance of State Continuum of Care, a nonprofit that supports agencies responding to homelessness across most of the state.

As his agency discusses updates with partner agencies, it is preparing for an “increased administrative burden on already stretched staff.”

“We don’t yet know whether there will be delays caused by having to check or validate someone’s citizenship status, especially in emergency situations where time is critical,” Graham said.

When do the new rules take effect?

The notices published in July took effect immediately, though some federal agencies said they would likely not enforce them for about a month. The Trump administration later agreed to pause enforcement until Sept. 3 in the 21 states that sued.

The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, has voluntarily stayed enforcement of its directive in all states until Sept. 10.

What is the basis of legal challenges?

The multistate lawsuit argues the Trump administration failed to follow proper procedures in implementation and that it can’t retroactively change the rules after states accept grants to administer programs. Requirements to check the immigration status of every person served would unreasonably burden program staff and possibly force programs to close, the states argue.

States “will suffer continued, irreparable harm if forced to dramatically restructure their social safety nets and render them inaccessible to countless of the States’ most vulnerable residents,” the plaintiffs wrote.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance. That suit argued staffing cuts, funding delays and bans on diversity efforts threatened to destabilize Head Start — a long-standing, congressionally mandated program. A hearing in that suit was held Aug. 5 on a request to temporarily block the Health and Human Services notice.

What does the Trump administration say?

The 1996 public benefits ban exempted federal programs that offered services available to all people on the grounds that they were “necessary for the protection of life and safety.”

Trump calls that exemption too broad.

“A surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly strained,” the White House said.

Citing studies from congressional committees and groups that seek to severely curtail immigration, the White House argues that allowing broad access to federal resources incentivizes illegal immigration and costs U.S. taxpayers. The recent federal spending package also eliminated access to Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps for some authorized immigrants, including refugees and asylees.

Trump ran for office on a promise to carry out mass deportations, and the bureaucratic moves appear to be a new frontier in that immigration crackdown. Since he took office, the administration has raided stores and workplaces, built new detention centers and attempted to shut down the asylum process at the southern border. It has also urged many immigrants without permanent legal status, including DACA recipients, to self-deport.

Why does this policy change matter?

Experts worry the confusion about the new rule could have a chilling effect, leading even eligible immigrants to stop using services.

Pillai of KFF noted that the restrictions on community health centers, alongside congressionally approved changes “that limit health coverage to a smaller group of lawfully present immigrants,” will likely make immigrant families even more reluctant to seek health care and social services.

The changes “may increase their reliance on emergency room care, which can be more costly in the long term,” she added.

Graham, the homeless systems manager, believes the Trump change will create “a direct barrier to safe and stable shelter for undocumented individuals and mixed-status families” and qualified immigrants or citizens who “may not have identification or the means to attain identification after fleeing a dangerous situation or crisis.”

It could also prompt administrators of some programs not covered by the rule to start screening participants as a precaution, or shut down programs to avoid screening challenges.

That has happened before. When Trump issued an executive order in January saying the administration would no longer “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender-affirming health care for people under 19, some providers stopped offering those services even though state law protected them.

Likewise, a 2023 KFF study found that in states that institute abortion bans, the majority of health care providers say they worry about accidentally running afoul of the law.

Braden Goetz, who worked for more than 20 years in the U.S. Department of Education and now works as a senior policy adviser at the New America Foundation’s Center on Education and Labor, said it’s unusual for federal guidance to be so sparse and ambiguous.

“​​Maybe that’s the intention: to confuse people and chill services to people who are not citizens or not legal permanent residents, and scare people,” Goetz said.

Five things to know about the new public benefits rule

The rule bars some immigrants with legal status, as well as all undocumented immigrants. That includes people with TPS, DACA, guest worker visas or pending asylum applications.

Children already enrolled in Head Start can continue attending, regardless of their immigration status. That’s because Head Start programs aren’t required to redetermine eligibility, according to Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director Jennie Mauer.

Nonprofit charitable organizations appear to be exempt from the new requirement. That means immigrants barred from services under the new guidelines may still be able to get services through nonprofit organizations.

Community Health Centers are required by law to accept all people in their area. It’s not clear how the new rules, which state that these federally funded health centers should only be available to “qualified immigrants,” will work with that law.

The new rules do not affect access to K-12 education, which the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be a right of every child regardless of immigration status.",https://milwaukeecourieronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Children-play-during-aftercare-Head-Start-program-Easterseals-South-Florida.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 13:56:44.053873

We came to Ireland to save lives and now we’re scared to walk home after a shift,” it says.","In the west Dublin suburb of Tallaght, a group of teenagers accosted, beat and partially stripped an Indian man, who was then filmed staggering and bleeding. Days later a gang attacked another Indian man in the nearby suburb of Clondalkin, hitting him in the face, chest, back and legs, leaving him with a fracture, gashes and multiple bruises.

Days later again, two male passengers turned on an Indian taxi driver in the north Dublin suburb of Ballymun, striking him across the face with a bottle and shouting: “Go back to your country.”

Days later, boys in a County Waterford housing estate allegedly punched a six-year-old girl in the face, hit her in the genital area with a bicycle and told her: “Go back to India.”

These are just some of a spate of incidents in recent weeks that have sown alarm and bewilderment among the Indian community, and other immigrants, in Ireland. In each case police are investigating but no charges have yet been brought.

Indians held a silent protest outside the justice department and the Indian embassy in Dublin has urged its citizens to take security precautions and avoid deserted areas. Media in India have given prominent coverage to the assaults, a jolt to those from the country who had long considered Ireland a safe, welcoming destination.

“A fellow on a motorbike stopped and hit me in the face when I was stopped in traffic,” said a Dublin-based taxi driver from the state of Punjab, who declined to be named. “Why is this happening?”

Each new incident makes the question more urgent. Since the 1990s, immigration has transformed a once mono-ethnic country into one where a fifth of the population was born overseas. In recent years, anger over a lack of affordable homes has fuelled resentment towards immigrants and asylum seekers and led to protests, some violent. Thugs posted videos of attacks on tents with refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

Since June there has been a spate of brutal assaults on people from south Asia, many of whom have lived in Ireland for years and are taxi drivers, tech workers or medical professionals.

“We are accustomed to micro-aggressions,” said Fahmeda Naheed, a poet and human rights activist from Pakistan who has lived in Cork for 13 years. “We are seeing more physical assaults. It is more forceful and aggressive than in the past. It has coincided with the housing shortage and antisocial behaviour of the youth.”

Naheed called for improved policing and procedures to encourage victims to come forward, counselling, anti-racism education and hate crime legislation.

The far right remains a marginal political force but videos of anti-immigrant rallies are widely shared. A recent one shows a man in a playground telling a small crowd with Irish tricolours that immigrants are arriving who are not fit to work yet are buying property. “They’re never going to integrate either. Islam should never be allowed into a Christian country,” he said, prompting cheers.

Amal Women Ireland, a group that provides support to Muslim women, expressed alarm after what it called a “violent, racially motivated” assault on a colleague at a Dublin bus stop on 30 June.

An open letter posted on Reddit purportedly from an Indian nurse says the author and dozens of colleagues are thinking of quitting Ireland because of abuse and fear. It cites an incident in which Irish teenagers bullied and mocked an eight-year-old Indian girl. “What kind of place is this becoming? We came to Ireland to save lives and now we’re scared to walk home after a shift,” it says.

The letter is anonymous and the Guardian has not been able to verify the authenticity, but it has gone viral and amplified concern at racism and xenophobia.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cfac2fb1fbea33d7d510c0eb6b3052566c0bd71/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57ba93d79bfa901b27332c326d043736",N,,2025-08-10 04:56:17.565709

Attorneys from Innovation Law Lab and advocates from Oregon for All reported that the group was arrested around 6 a.m. on Aug. 7 after ICE agents stopped their van, allegedly breaking the driver's side window in the process.

Four workers—three men and one woman—were arrested , while two other women and a teenage girl were released.

KATU News has reached out to Portland's regional ICE spokesperson, who has declined to comment on pending litigation in the past.

Reyna Lopez, executive director of PCUN, Oregon’s farmworker union, criticized the actions of Immigration enforcement officers.

PAST ICE COVERAGE:

""ICE is terrorizing the very people who feed our communities, targeting farmworkers in their own neighborhoods on their way to work,"" Lopez said. ""These tactics will only scare folks from working during the peak harvest. This not only affects farmworkers’ ability to support their families, but also the many growers who rely on migrant labor and our collective ability to put food on our tables.""

The arrested workers are members of the Mam Nation, Indigenous to Guatemala, residing in Woodburn, according to a statement by Oregon for All.

Community members who witnessed the incident contacted the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) hotline, which mobilized community support as part of Oregon for All’s rapid response network.

Legal advocates from the Innovation Law Lab attempted to meet with the arrested group at the Portland ICE facility but were denied access.

""Imagine being arrested, unable to understand what’s happening, and cut off from legal help,"" said Puma Tzoc, director of the Collective of Indigenous Interpreters of Oregon at Pueblo Unido.

""As Mam speakers, these workers face additional barriers in understanding their rights and accessing legal help. This is a violation of their rights. We demand that they respect our Indigenous nations.""

Isa Peña, director of strategy at Innovation Law Lab, also expressed concern over ICE's actions.

""ICE's refusal to allow attorneys to speak with people who are detained violates basic due process rights,"" Peña said. ""We’re seeing a pattern: ICE acts with impunity, and communities are left to pick up the pieces.""

Attorneys managed to speak with the spouse of one of the workers and filed an emergency habeas corpus petition.

The worker, identified only as L-J-P-L-, is challenging his sudden detention by ICE without notice or explanation.

L-J-P-L- fled Guatemala after his brother was murdered and sought asylum in the United States.

READ ALSO:

He was released from immigration custody in Feb. 2024 and has complied with all legal requirements while pursuing his asylum claim. Despite this, he was arrested and arrested on Aug. 7 with no prior notice.

The petition argues that the detention and potential transfer of L-J-P-L- out of the district are arbitrary and violate his due process rights. It seeks to prevent his transfer and requests his release from custody.

The court has issued an order to show cause, requiring the respondents, including ICE officials and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to justify the detention by Aug. 13 of this year. A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 19.

The petition claims that the decision to revoke L-J-P-L-'s release was made without considering the individual facts of his case, constituting an abuse of discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It also alleges that the detention violates the Fifth Amendment's due process clause.

RELATED:

Attorneys from Innovation Law are representing L-J-P-L-, and they argue that the detention is part of a broader pattern of using immigration detention as a punitive measure against asylum seekers.

This incident is not isolated. In June, the Oregon Farm Bureau raised concerns following similar ICE arrests in Yamhill County, warning that immigration enforcement threatens the state’s food supply.

Oregon’s agricultural sector relies heavily on immigrant labor. According to the American Immigration Council, and 61.9% of general farm laborers, performing tasks such as planting, hand harvesting, pruning, and packing.

Portland and the state of Oregon as a whole are both mentioned in the Department of Justice's

Last week, Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated, ""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design.""

She added that the Department of Justice will continue to pursue litigation against these jurisdictions and collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate such policies nationwide.

Earlier this year in January, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson addressed the Portland City Council in a letter, expressing concern about the federal government's immigration enforcement plans.

Wilson stated that Portland is committed to its sanctuary city status, supported by Oregon's sanctuary state laws and the Sanctuary Promise Act of 2021.

""We must come together to live our city’s shared values of freedom from fear and sanctuary from federal overreach in the days ahead, no matter what our city may face,"" the letter read in part.
