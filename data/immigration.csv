MyNorthwest has reached out to the Seattle City Council for comment.","The Seattle City Council was interrupted Tuesday when two groups — one led by former Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant and the other by Seattle Alliance against Racist and Political Repression (SAARPR) — flooded the council chambers to have their respective voices heard.

Each group had roughly a dozen people in attendance, with many signing up to speak during public comment. Some speakers even led chants with their groups when they had a chance to talk.

“ICE out now! ICE out now!” one chant exclaimed during Tuesday’s city council meeting.

“Trump’s ICE agents are terrorizing our cities,” Sawant said at the council meeting. “Thousands of immigrant, working, and poor people are being grabbed off the street.”

SAARPR launched an “anti-ICE petition” for members of the Seattle City Council to sign, demanding accountability for ICE’s actions while additionally calling for an immediate end to ICE raids and mass deportations in the region.

The council engaged in a back-and-forth discussion with the public after the public comment period closed, but the interruptions got out of hand, prompting the council to briefly suspend its meeting.

“Will you let us continue our business?” Hollingsworth asked. “OK, we’re going to go into a 10-minute recess to cool it out.”

The Seattle City Council was able to take up business after a recess. Newly elected City Council President Joy Hollingsworth agreed to meet with SAARPR after the council meeting, but it ended abruptly when Hollingsworth would not commit to signing the petition at that time.

“Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth claimed that she would meet with us face to face, and we had a short meeting where she and the rest of the council admitted she had not read our letter, and would not be signing onto it,” SAARPR stated on social media after the meeting. “Knowing this, we have declined the meeting on Wednesday. We will not waste our time. We will continue to disrupt and demand action from the city council.

Platitudes are no longer acceptable,” the statement continued. “Now is the time for action.”

Kshama Sawant is running for Congress against incumbent Adam Smith.

Officials say those agents have arrested around 2,500 people so far.

Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, protests continue. Advocates say what's happening inside the courtrooms is also alarming.

A group of Minnesotans makes it their job to watch what happens. Known as court observers, they're a team dedicated to watching, listening and documenting.

Madeline Lohman is the advocacy director at The Advocates of Human Rights. She oversees court observers inside immigration courtrooms.

Their job is simple: monitor hearings like asylum claims and removal orders, providing a record of what happens.

""Courts are one of the places where people are supposed to access justice,"" Lohman said.

The group has conducted court monitoring since 2017. Observers typically sit in the back of the courtroom notebook and pen in hand, documenting how the hearing is unfolding and how the individual is treated during the proceeding. But advocates say this year has been the most challenging.

Lohman says since early 2025 access to court proceedings were limited, even at times doors were looked.

""They've spent really a lot of time in this administration to hide what they are doing to make it difficult to document,"" she said.

Lohman says when observers are granted access, they've seen injustices happening like people being denied to argue their case. Other times, names and complete case numbers are removed making it tough for observers to identify the person and follow the case.

That limitation is the reason why a demand letter from attorneys was sent to the courts Friday, putting them on notice.

Lohman said this week, observers were allowed inside the courtroom. But access to the lobby is still being denied.

That limitation is the reason why a demand letter from attorneys was sent to the courts Friday, putting them on notice.

According to a fact sheet on the U. S Dept of Justice's website, immigration courts are open to the public with limited exceptions. That includes if the judge grants a party's motion to close the hearing or if the judge decides to limit attendance.

Protests erupted in cities across the United States after Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross during a chaotic encounter.

Federal officials, including President Donald Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vance, have claimed Ross acted in self-defense. However, state and local leaders, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have emphatically rejected those claims while demanding federal agents leave.

An analysis by USA TODAY of videos taken at the scene of the shooting show the situation unfolded. A nationwide poll conducted in the days after the shooting found more than half of voters thought the shooting was not justified.

Here's what to know about your rights if federal immigration enforcement agents show up at your door.

Do I have to open my door for ICE?

You don't have to let police officers or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain types of warrants.

If police have an arrest warrant, they're legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. But a warrant of removal or deportation doesn't allow immigration agents to enter your home without your consent.

You have the right to remain silent even if the officer has a warrant.

What should I do if ICE is at my door?

To reduce the risk to yourself, stay calm and keep the door closed – opening the door doesn't give ICE permission to enter, the ACLU says, but it is safer to speak through the door.

Then, the ACLU recommends that you:

Ask if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.

Ask the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.

Ask if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.

Don’t lie or produce any false documents, and don’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.

State: “I do not consent to your entry.”

If agents force their way in, don't resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”

If you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159939007-2256087844.jpg?crop=5812,3270,x0,y302&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 02:57:28.137127

Since taking office a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards and screening immigrants' social media posts and past speeches.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump's immigration and travel-related policies, saying they harm due process guarantees and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies seek to improve domestic security.

ICE's actions have been subject to particular criticism by protesters, community leaders, Democrats and human rights advocates.

Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S.","Immigrant rights lawyers on Wednesday urged a federal appeals court in California to affirm a district court’s order that would block the Trump administration from ending temporary deportation protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States.

In oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, lawyers representing immigrants who had been covered under the protections said many of their clients had already lost their jobs and businesses as the program, known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., has been allowed to expire.

Hundreds of Venezuelans have been detained and deported, and parents are being separated from their American-born children, the lawyers said.

“We absolutely have shown harm in all 50 states,” Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the panel at the hearing in Pasadena, Calif.

Sarah Welch, a lawyer with the Justice Department, urged the appeals court to overturn the district court order. She said the Supreme Court had already made two rare interventions on the issue, both favoring the Trump administration’s decision to end T.P.S.

In October, the Supreme Court temporarily stayed the district court ruling and allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its new policy while arguments continued in the lower courts. Whatever the Ninth Circuit decides, the outcome is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Ms. Welch said that Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, had followed appropriate legal procedures to reverse the Biden administration’s extensions of the initiative and that Ms. Noem had done so in the interest of national security.

The hearing came as the relationship between the United States and Venezuela is entering new territory.

At the beginning of January, the Trump administration conducted a military operation that captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to New York to stand trial. Since then, President Trump has asserted that the United States is running Venezuela, working with Mr. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.

On Thursday, an envoy sent by Ms. Rodríguez will visit Washington to explore reopening Venezuela’s embassy. On the same day, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuela’s top opposition leader, María Corina Machado.

Administration officials have sought to encourage Venezuelan immigrants to return to their native country, arguing that the removal of Mr. Maduro — a man whom American prosecutors accuse of being a narco-terrorist and a drug kingpin — would soon ensure a safer and more stable Venezuela.

The court case, brought by several T.P.S. holders and the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy organization, also seeks to preserve the protected status for roughly 330,000 Haitians that is slated to expire in February.

The hearing is the latest salvo in a wave of legal challenges around the country that are seeking to stop the Trump administration’s efforts to upend the T.P.S. program, slash the number of people admitted as refugees, dismantle the asylum process and end other humanitarian protections for immigrants.

Over the past year, Mr. Trump, long a skeptic of asylum seekers and refugees, has sought to drastically curb the forms of legal immigration, arguing that some petitioners are exploiting the programs and threatening national security.

Immigration lawyers and advocates say that the administration is embarking on the largest de-legalization effort in U.S. history as it seeks to expel millions of immigrants from the United States.

T.P.S. allows people from nations going through natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises to live and work temporarily in the United States. For some recipients, the program had become all but permanent, as crises in their home countries have continued for decades.

Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S. program for more than a million people from Haiti, Venezuela and at least half a dozen other countries. This week, as more federal immigration agents descended upon Minnesota in the wake of a social services scandal implicating Somali Americans, the Trump administration announced that it would end T.P.S. for Somalis.

In the latest court filings, government lawyers argue that Ms. Noem initially moved to end the Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans because conditions in Venezuela had improved in critical areas, such as public health and the economy. But lawyers representing the T.P.S. holders countered that administration officials had not conducted a meaningful review of the country’s conditions, that Ms. Noem’s actions had violated federal legal procedures and that they were based on racial animus.

The big picture: Americans are showing signs of discomfort about the far-reaching federal intervention of ICE and Border Patrol, with major cities like Boston and Phoenix anticipating agent arrivals.

That expanded intervention has so far led to thousands of arrests across the country, a CEO's resignation, employees forced out of their workplaces and protesters directly arguing with federal agents, attracting criticism from lawmakers and prominent podcasters from Joe Rogan to comedian Tim Dillon.

""These are not well-trained law enforcement people in ICE,"" Dillon said. ""They're not the cream of the crop.""

By the numbers: A majority of Americans say ICE is making the country less safe rather than more safe (47% vs 34%), according to an Economist and YouGov poll released Tuesday and conducted from Jan. 9-12.

The same poll found that a majority of Americans say shooting Good was not justified (50% vs. 30%), while 20% were unsure.

Here are five flashpoint moments to know.

Renee Good shooting in Minnesota

An ICE officer shot and killed Good, a 37-year-old mother, in early January during ""targeted operations"" in Minneapolis, Axios previously reported.

Good was not the target of the enforcement activity, law enforcement officials said at the time.

The shooting came amid a surge of immigration enforcement in Minnesota, which included thousandsof agents entering the state.

Protesters took to the streets nationwide for ""ICE Out For Good"" protests and vigils after the fatal shooting.

DHS, DOJ investigations into ICE shooting

Tension has bubbled as federal authorities indicated they wouldn't probe the officer's conduct in the Minnesota shooting.

There's ""currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation,"" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Tuesday.

Federal investigators have restricted Minnesota investigators' access to case materials and put the FBI in charge of the probe.

What they're saying: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the shooting, calling Good's actions an ""act of domestic terrorism"" before any investigation concluded.

""As we uncover more of this criminal activity, we're going to continue to surge resources to make sure this abuse of government funds and government power no longer continues in Minnesota,"" Noem said, per CBS News.

The other side: More than 50 lawmakers signaled support for articles of impeachment against Noem.

""Secretary Noem is failing the American people by threatening, intimidating, and harassing my neighbors and I believe she must be removed from office,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.).

CBP shooting in Portland

A separate shooting incident involving federal agents in Portland further added to the mounting tension.

Federal officials said the two people who were shot were trying to harm Border Patrol agents. But local officials decried the incident as an example of federal law enforcement overreach.

Though not an ICE incident — ICE and Border Patrol are different entities — the shooting happened a day after Good's killing, giving protesters more fuel for their demonstrations.

Minnesota woman ripped from car in viral video

A woman in Minneapolis was arrested Tuesday after allegedly impeding an ICE operation in the city, according to multiple reports.

In a video with more than 3.3 million views on X, the woman can be seen near ICE vehicles while driving close to a protest. The agents then yanked the woman from her car in a chaotic scene.

As the woman was dragged away from her car, she can be heard yelling: ""I'm disabled, I'm trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I couldn't move. I am an autistic disabled person, I'm trying to go to the doctor.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe accuses ICE of holding members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, which is one of the largest Indigenous tribal nations in the U.S., accused ICE of illegally holding tribal members who were picked up during Minnesota raids, Axios reports.

Oglala Sioux Tribe president Frank Star Comes Out wrote in a memo to federal officials that the tribal members should be released.

The four men who were picked up were homeless, he wrote.

Zoom in: Star Comes Out said that federal officials told the tribal nation that they would receive information about the detained tribal members only if the tribe entered into an agreement with ICE.

The tribe declined.

So, I want to begin with a little legal news today, because I know your office had asked a federal judge to temporarily block a surge of ICE agents to the Minneapolis area. The judge declined to rule today, giving DOJ until Monday to respond.

So does that mean that another surge of agents is on their way? And what are you anticipating in the way of the size and scope of that new surge?

Keith Ellison:

Well, it certainly does mean that they have a little bit more time to search, which concerns me, because the searching they have done so far has been destructive, not helpful to anybody. It has risked public safety. It has depleted public resources. It has increased fear.

And It has eroded Americans' confidence in their government and has been a whole -- wholly a failure in every conceivable way. So I am a little disappointed. But I believe that this is a wonderful judge, who's a deeply thoughtful person, who really just wants to make sure the best decision she can make.

And that takes time. No doubt, however, that, as time is of the essence, right, and we need relief from this surge, this dramatic escalation founded on lies and untruths, which is doing so much damage.

Amna Nawaz:

I also want to put to you another piece of news today. We heard from the Border Patrol, Bovino, who said on FOX the Department of Justice is also sending additional prosecutors to Minnesota to process those immigration cases. What's your reaction to that?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I mean, quite honestly, I mean, it -- I'm not shocked, because the -- President Trump is making sure that he is targeting our state, which is odd because we are not a state that has the most immigration in America.

Many other states have dramatically higher rates of immigration than we do. We do have some, and we're very proud of our neighbors who've chosen to make America their home. But I guess I'm not surprised that we're getting unwarranted, unasked-for attention from President Trump.

He's made it very clear that, because he believes that he won Minnesota three times, but in fact lost it, he's upset about that, has repeated that numerous times. So we expect the persecution will continue while he operates the way he's operating.

Amna Nawaz:

You heard there the border czar...

(Crosstalk)

Amna Nawaz:

Sorry. Go ahead.

Keith Ellison:

Or until a court tells him he can no longer do it.

Amna Nawaz:

Well, you probably heard in our report there the border czar Tom Homan telling my colleague Liz Landers that this is about what they call their your sanctuary policies in Minnesota and Minneapolis.

Specifically, there is this idea of not honoring an ICE detainer, meaning, if there's an undocumented person in city or state custody in Minnesota, they're not handed over to ICE. And I do want to point out that you did issue in an informal opinion last year, you wrote that Minnesota law prohibits law enforcement from holding someone on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody.

So what does that otherwise released from custody mean? Do you ever hand people over to ICE or not?

Keith Ellison:

Well, what it means is that we comply with the law and the Constitution of the United States of America and the state of Minnesota.

And I would submit to you that Minnesota is not a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary state. What we do is, we devote all of our state resources to state matters and that the federal government has its responsibility. We don't interfere with them, but we don't devote state resources to federal projects like immigration enforcement.

So we don't really -- so this idea of some sort of a sanctuary state is a misnomer. We have never claimed that. And I think it's wholly -- I think the voters and the taxpayers of our state expect that the resources of our state will be devoted for the purposes of our state and that the federal government, they're paid to do their job and we don't interfere with them doing it.

We also don't do their job for them.

Amna Nawaz:

Before we go, I want to briefly ask you too about the ongoing investigation into the shooting and killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

I know Minnesota officials were shut out of the federal investigation. Your office has since launched essentially a parallel probe. You have probably seen the news of DHS saying that the ICE officer was injured and suffered internal bleeding. My question to you is, are you going to have any access to any of these medical records, the agent, any other evidence, body camera footage?

And, if not, how can your office carry out a thorough investigation on this issue?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I will just point out that all we have been asking for is a fair, free, open investigation. How they would make such a claim without producing a medical record to prove it I find curious and why in the world they would not just do the investigation.

We have heard that the Department of Justice Civil Rights Department has been excluded from doing the investigation. These people know the most about these cases in the federal government, yet they're not doing the case.

And at the same time, they're reject -- they're stopping the state from doing the work that we're supposed to do. I do not necessarily take the word of those people. I will take the word of a trained medical professional who's made a diagnosis and a medical record made for the purpose of diagnosis and medical treatment.

But I'm not going to just take the word of some nameless, faceless bureaucrat who's just -- I don't know. But, I mean, let me just say this.

I find it interesting that the federal government, the federal authorities shut the state of Minnesota out from the investigation, will not let the most expert people in their own institution investigate the case, but like to -- like to send out little pieces of information that they believe benefit them, like the video that is purported to be from Jonathan Ross and now this non-medical personnel giving testimony or giving public statements about medical conditions.

So I will stop right there.

Amna Nawaz:

That is Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison joining us tonight.

Thank you. It's good to speak with you.

For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle.
""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""","A federal court has upheld the new congressional map approved by California voters last month, giving Democrats a chance to counter the nationwide redistricting effort led by President Trump and his Republican allies.

The court challenge to the redistricting plan had been brought by the California Republican Party and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court found that the new district map did not violate laws against racial gerrymandering.

The Republicans argued that the new map was motivated by a desire to increase the voting power of Latinos. The court, in a two-to-one ruling, rejected that claim, noting that voters approved the measure, called ""Proposition 50"" and there was no evidence they acted on racial grounds.

""The evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton in the majority opinion.

The court denied the Republican plaintiffs' request the court issue an injunction blocking the redistricting as the case proceeds to a final judgement. The Republicans could still appeal the ruling.

Usually states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census. But Trump set off a mid-decade redistricting race as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the House. This summer he pushed Texas Republicans to redraw that state's districts, potentially helping the GOP win five House seats in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina have each redistricted to help the GOP in one seat.

After the Texas redistricting, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to respond by redrawing the map in his state. At his urging, lawmakers put the matter on the ballot and California voters approved a redistricting plan there in a special election Nov. 4. That measure passed with 64 percent of the vote.

For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump

For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle. Supporters largely viewed it as an opportunity for the blue state to push back against the Trump administration. Newsom argued the approach was necessary to counter the GOP-led redistricting effort in Texas and ""fight fire with fire"" and boost Democrats' chances ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The Republican-led lawsuit against the measure contended it violated the law by disproportionately giving the state's Latino voters a stronger voice over other racial voting blocs.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kenneth Lee, who was appointed by President Trump in 2018, said the designer of the map, hired by the Democrats, had publicly said that he was aiming to boost Latino voting power.

""The Democratic supermajority in the California state legislature wanted to curry favor with Latino groups and voters—and to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party,"" Lee wrote.

The majority ruling rejected that argument, finding that it was not the mapmaker or even the legislature that held the deciding power but rather the voters on the proposition and that it was debated by proponents and opponents as a partisan move.

In her opinion, Staton, appointed to the bench by President Obama, found a ""mountain of evidence produced by Defendants that the voters intended to enact a partisan gerrymander.""

""Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed,"" wrote Newsom in a statement. ""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""

Overall, the redistricting race is close with Republicans on track to tilt a couple or few more seats their way than Democrats have. Indiana Republicans refused to follow Trump's lead last month and redistrict there. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to lead his state in drawing a new map that will favor the GOP.

Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have started the redistricting process to favor their party in that state. Currently, the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats and if Democrats take control, they could slow Trump's agenda or launch investigations into his administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8253x4642+0+430/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F5d%2F3c49cc9043eeac66acbac65f3c2b%2Fap25309666893880.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 00:59:16.910989

The case is Carolina Migrant Network et al.","-- Two immigrant legal groups have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in North Carolina federal court Wednesday to pry loose records about the agency's purported blanket use of ankle monitors in its Alternatives to Detention program, which they said is intended to induce self-deportation.

Prompted by press reports about the policy shift, nonprofits Carolina Migrant Network and Amica Center for Immigrant Rights sought a June 9 memo and related field guidance containing a directive to place ankle monitors on everyone enrolled in the program, except pregnant women, according to their suit.

The groups first sought the documents, which they said have not been made public yet, through a Freedom of Information Act request filed Oct. 28, but sued after the agency failed to act on the request, they said.

The groups say ICE ""has a great deal of discretion"" to release immigrants with pending immigration court hearings into the community through the Alternatives to Detention, or ATD, program, which uses various forms of monitoring to ensure immigrants show up to those hearings.

Carolina Migrant Network and Amica says the program has ballooned over the past five years, with 181,000 immigrants enrolled as of December, nearly three times the number of detained immigrants.

Of those enrolled in the program, the groups said 36,000 are wearing ankle monitors, double the number as of the end of 2024.

Even though ICE has said the ATD program is meant to boost compliance, the groups cited reports showing that enrollees actually have lower compliance rates. They also said the use of ankle monitors inflicts serious financial, physical and psychological harms, disrupting day-to-day life and at times causing injuries and worsening health conditions.

A study cited in the complaint found that 60% of ATD program participants wearing ankle monitors reported severe ""impact"" to their health, the groups said.

""As media reporting on ATD makes apparent, ICE's true purpose in imposing a blanket 'ankle monitoring for all' policy is the goal of coercing noncitizens into accepting 'voluntary' deportation,"" they said.

Counsel for the groups and for ICE did not return requests for comment on Wednesday.

According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, a violent shooting occurred on December 20, 2025, where two individuals were shot and later pronounced dead at the hospital. Bravlio Galeano Ayala, 16, and Samir Canales Molina, 18, were identified as the victims.

According to local reports, the shootings happened around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, December 20, 2025, in southwest Charlotte. The two teens were found more than six miles away from each other, but detectives believe they were “shot at the same location during the same incident and then traveled away from the scene in an attempt to find help.”

Aristides Eli Orellana-Ramirez

“Another tragic loss of life at the hands of a criminal illegal alien. The two male victims were just 16 and 18 years old, both with a whole life ahead of them. Their lives were ripped away in moments by a criminal illegal alien who should have NEVER been in our country in the first place,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin “ICE lodged an arrest detainer. Unfortunately, North Carolina’s sanctuary politicians often REFUSE to allow us into their jails and release these known criminals back into American communities. President Trump and Secretary Noem launched Operation Charlotte’s Web to target these criminals and get them out of American neighborhoods.”

Orellana-Ramirez illegally crossed the border at an unknown date and location and without inspection by an immigration officer.

If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.","A top Trump administration lawyer pressed a federal judge Wednesday to block a newly enacted California law that bans most law enforcement officers in the state from wearing masks, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Tiberius Davis, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, argued at a hearing in Los Angeles that the first-of-its-kind ban on police face coverings could unleash chaos across the country, and potentially land many ICE agents on the wrong side of the law it were allowed to take effect.

“Why couldn’t California say every immigration officer needs to wear pink, so it’s super obvious who they are?” Davis told U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder. “The idea that all 50 states can regulate the conduct and uniforms of officers ... flips the Constitution on its head.”

The judge appeared skeptical.

“Why can’t they perform their duties without a mask? They did that until 2025, did they not?” Snyder said. “How in the world do those who don’t mask manage to operate?”

The administration first sued to block the new rules in November, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act and its companion provision, the No Vigilantes Act, into law. Together, The laws bar law enforcement officers from wearing masks and compel them to display identification “while conducting law enforcement operations in the Golden State.” Both offenses would be misdemeanors.

Federal officials have vowed to defy the new rules, saying they are unconstitutional and put agents in danger. They have also decried an exception in the law for California state peace officers, arguing the carve out is discriminatory. The California Highway Patrol is among those exempted, while city and county agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, must comply.

“These were clearly and purposefully targeted at the federal government,” Davis told the court Wednesday. “Federal officers face prosecution if they do not comply with California law, but California officers do not.”

The hearing comes at a moment of acute public anger at the agency following the fatal shooting of American protester Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis — rage that has latched on to masks as a symbol of perceived lawlessness and impunity.

“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” California Department of Justice lawyer Cameron Bell told the court Wednesday. “The state has had to bear the cost of the federal government’s actions. These are very real consequences.”

She pointed to declarations from U.S. citizens who believed they were being abducted by criminals when confronted by masked immigration agents, including incidents where local police were called to respond.

“I later learned that my mother and sister witnessed the incident and reported to the Los Angeles Police Department that I was kidnapped,” Angeleno Andrea Velez said in one such declaration. “Because of my mother’s call, LAPD showed up to the raid.”

The administration argues the anti-mask law would put ICE agents and other federal immigration enforcement officers at risk of doxing and chill the “zealous enforcement of the law.”

“The laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the government said in court filings.

Davis also told the court that ICE‘s current tactics were necessary in part because of laws across California and in much of the U.S. that limit police cooperation with ICE and bar immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as schools and courts.

California contends its provisions are “modest” and aligned with past practice, and that the government’s evidence showing immigration enforcement would be harmed is thin.

Bell challenged Department of Homeland Security statistics purporting to show an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE agents and a 1,000% increase in assaults, saying the government has recently changed what qualifies as a “threat” and that agency claims have faced “significant credibility issues” in federal court.

“Blowing a whistle to alert the community, that’s hardly something that increases threats,” Bell said.

On the identification rule, Snyder appeared to agree.

“One might argue that there’s serious harm to the government if agents’ anonymity is preserved,” she said.

The fate of the mask law may hinge on the peace officer exemption.

“Would your discrimination argument go away if the state changed legislation to apply to all officers?” Snyder asked.

“I believe so,” Davis said.

The ban was slated to come into force on Jan. 1, but is on hold while the case makes its way through the courts. If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.

The unbelievable claims were discredited by video evidence and by local officials. The president and his team peddled the lines anyway, hoping not only to smear the victim but also to convince Americans not to believe their lying eyes.

There’s some evidence to suggest those efforts haven’t worked, at least not yet.

Ms. Hochul appeared at a news conference last week to trumpet a 20 percent decline in murders in the city.
Perhaps the most surprising area of conflict between Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul involved a topic on which they ostensibly agree.","As the presumptive Republican candidate for governor of New York, Bruce Blakeman could be expected to find flaws in Gov. Kathy Hochul’s State of the State address.

Appearing in the State Capitol on Wednesday, a day after the annual address, he criticized the Democratic governor’s record on crime, complained about taxes and derided her child care agenda as a New York City giveaway.

But perhaps the starkest difference between them was in their stances on the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, which Ms. Hochul has portrayed as an outrage.

“When you look at both videos, it looks like the individual that was shot, that person was engaged in trying to run down the ICE officer,” Mr. Blakeman told reporters in Albany, with the caveat that he would like to see a full investigation.

And he mused that a similar incident, which he said had resulted from a lack of respect for law enforcement, could happen in New York City, now being led by Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.

It was a striking warning that underscored the differences between the visions of the state offered by Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The remarks came as Mr. Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, made his first trip to Albany as a candidate for governor. The visit was somewhat ill-timed: Scheduling conflicts (his own inauguration) kept Mr. Blakeman away from the Capitol on Tuesday; by the time he arrived in Albany, most of the Legislature had left for the weekend, leaving a single Republican assemblyman to stand by his side.

Mr. Blakeman announced his intention to run for governor last month, leading to a tense behind-the-scenes dance among state Republicans, a vast majority of whom had already committed to supporting Representative Elise Stefanik. But his candidacy received a boost from President Trump, who undermined Ms. Stefanik’s bid by declining to endorse her. Shortly after, she announced that she would not run for governor, or seek re-election to Congress.

On Wednesday, Mr. Blakeman, a staunch Trump ally, made his loyalty clear. “I support a lot of his policies, if not all of his policies,” he told the reporters gathered outside the press room on the third floor of the Capitol.

That seemed to include the president’s cutting and withholding of billions of dollars in city and state resources.

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he would withhold all funds from states like New York that contain so-called sanctuary cities, where local law enforcement officers are largely barred from helping federal immigration authorities. It was the latest in a series of Trump administration threats to cut funds for infrastructure, health care, social services and counterterrorism.

Asked about the cuts on Wednesday, Ms. Hochul took a hard line. “This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission, and that is something we’ll never do,” she said, noting that the state already cooperates with immigration authorities on criminal investigations.

But Mr. Blakeman disagreed, arguing that the president was right to withhold the funds.

“The problem is not with President Trump,” he said. “The problem is with the mayor and the City Council. You want to be a sanctuary city, you want to violate federal law, there are consequences.” He added later that he didn’t “want to put any shackles on ICE.”

Even so, Mr. Blakeman veered from the president’s insistence that prices have been falling and affordability is not an issue.

“It’s grocery bills, utility costs, rent, property taxes, and paychecks that don’t go far enough,” Mr. Blakeman said in a statement. “Families don’t need more rhetoric — they need results.”

And while Ms. Hochul has put forth a slate of programs, from energy assistance and auto insurance reform to universal child care and free school lunches, Mr. Blakeman said she had not done enough, and he promised to cut taxes if elected governor.

Mr. Blakeman is expected to replicate the strategy that his fellow Long Island Republican Lee Zeldin used to come within six percentage points of the governor’s mansion in 2022, prioritizing affordability issues and crime.

But on that front he may well face challenges: Crime in New York is down from its post-pandemic peak, when Mr. Zeldin was running. Ms. Hochul appeared at a news conference last week to trumpet a 20 percent decline in murders in the city. The decline came amid a 3 percent drop in major crime categories (the one exception was reported rapes, which increased partly because of a new broader definition of sexual assault).

The challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to office in January 2025. The outcome will impact the global economy.

During arguments in the case on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.

Yanira Cardona, the city’s Hispanic Outreach Coordinator appointed by Mayor Donna Deegan, said early Wednesday that people who are taken in should “comply,” but they should have a plan because “they’re out in Jacksonville.”

By the end of the day, a Deegan spokesperson said Cardona was on leave while the administration addressed the matter.

Here’s some of what led to her suspension.

“We are living in very difficult times, but my best advice is: 1. Have a plan in place with your lawyers. 2. Give someone you trust power of attorney for your business and your children. 3. If you are stopped by law enforcement, please cooperate and follow their instructions/orders,” Cardona wrote Wednesday, with a video explaining where people should be most careful.

The video was posted during business hours on a weekday and appears to be filmed in an office in City Hall, though the barking of a dog at one point suggests that may not be the case.

“ICE is out and about,” she said. “They are doing speed traps. They are, they’ve been seen on Emerson, on Beach Boulevard, on Atlantic and on the highway. They are targeting, literally, they’re targeting any lawn care companies, any AC company construction vans. They’re literally stopping them just to make sure that they have their paperwork.”

“I wish I could do more, and I wish I could say more. But this is the best I could do,” Cardona added.

Cardona’s comments elicited backlash.

Attorney General James Uthmeier said “this is illegal and needs to be seriously addressed!

“My office will be writing a response on this. Absolutely unacceptable! Her actions are not in alignment with Florida’s immigration laws. I want to know how many more taxpayers dollars are paying for salaries encouraging lawlessness?,” asked Rep. Kiyan Michael.

Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, who had joined three other Republicans to advance the resolution alongside Democrats last week, flipped after they said they received assurances from the Trump administration.

With Hawley and Young’s votes, the Senate was split 50-50 on the resolution. JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins cast their votes for the war powers resolution alongside Democrats.

Senate Democrats forcefully condemned Republican opposition to the resolution, which aimed to check the president as he threatens further action in other countries including Greenland, Iran and Mexico.

“Make no mistake about it: this vote makes things more dangerous, not less,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said. “It emboldens Donald Trump to push further down this reckless path.”

Tim Kaine, the Democratic senator from Virginia who has championed several war powers measures, said he was prepared to file “a whole lot more” to block Trump from carrying out military operations without congressional authorization.

“They can run but they can’t hide,” he said, referring to Republicans, whose support would be needed to approve the resolutions.

The president had put intense pressure on his fellow Republicans to vote down the measure that would have checked his ability to carry out further military attacks on Venezuela.

Trump lashed out at the five Republican senators who joined with Democrats to advance the resolution last week. Yet even the possibility that the Republican-controlled Senate would defy Trump on such a high-profile vote revealed the growing alarm on Capitol Hill about the president’s expanding foreign policy ambitions.

Democrats forced the vote after US troops captured the deposed Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month.

Young, one of five Republicans who voted with Democrats last week, says he now sides with Trump.

In a statement, Young said he “has received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela” after speaking with secretary of state Marco Rubio, and that if Trump were to pursue “major military operations”, he would ask Congress “in advance for an authorization of force”.

Hawley similarly told reporters that he had been persuaded after discussion with both Rubio and Trump that the resolution was no longer necessary.

The defeat comes less than a week after the US Senate advanced a bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela, after Trump authorized a pre-dawn raid to capture its leader, Nicolás Maduro, without giving Congress advance notice. The vote amounted to a rare rebuke of the president, and Trump responded by saying that the Republican senators who supported the resolution “should never be elected to office again”.

Wednesday’s vote hinged on a procedural maneuver challenging the resolution’s relevance based on the fact that no US troops were currently deployed in Venezuela. The motion allowed Young and Hawley to vote to kill the resolution without abandoning their initial objections to military action in Venezuela.

Paul, a libertarian long opposed to US military intervention abroad, called it an “absurdity” to argue Trump hadn’t already taken actions of war in Venezuela. “If we don’t know it’s a war until after all the people die ... wouldn’t it then be a little late?” he told reporters in advance of the vote.

Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said it was necessary for Congress to reassert its role and put a check on presidential authority that had “atrophied” under recent administrations.

Meanwhile, on social media, senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, accused Republicans of voting in favor of “forever wars, and against the best interests of the American people”.

The Trump Administration has taken action to share Medicaid data provided by states to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement purposes. This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share such information and ICE would not use such information for immigration enforcement purposes, including assurances made to the public, applicants and enrollees, health care providers, and states that information collected to determine eligibility for health coverage programs would not be used for immigration enforcement.

This issue brief provides an overview of a new data sharing agreement for CMS to share Medicaid data with ICE and its potential implications. This sharp departure in policy to allow sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE for immigration enforcement raises several key issues:

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with a current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing. Under pending litigation, CMS is prohibited from sharing certain information from the plaintiff states, including information for lawfully present individuals or citizens. If the data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present in the dataset that will be shared with ICE.

Going forward, the sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care and other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall. Even prior to the public notice of the new data sharing policy, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

The data sharing raises broader questions and concerns about data privacy and protections, which may extend beyond immigrant families. Individuals enrolled in Medicaid did so under prior assurances that information would not be shared for immigration enforcement purposes. Applying new policy retroactively to people who took actions under previous policy and safeguards may broadly increase concerns about privacy and safeguards of data. Health care providers, including community health centers and hospitals, may also have growing concerns about potentially being required to share patient information.

What Medicaid data do states report to CMS?

Medicaid is jointly administered by the federal government and states, and states must share certain information with CMS for program administration. State Medicaid agencies collect and maintain personal and health information for applicants and enrollees to determine eligibility and provide care. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other federally-funded coverage, but payments for emergency services may be made to hospitals on behalf of individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. States include information about these payments in their reports to CMS. Some states provide health coverage to some immigrants regardless of immigration status using state-only funds. However, states are not required to submit this state-only program information to CMS. States cannot require applicants to provide citizenship or immigration status for any family or household members not applying for coverage.

Under the data sharing agreement, CMS will be sharing data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System or T-MSIS with ICE, which provides robust information on Medicaid enrollees but is significantly lagged. T-MSIS data also are made available to researchers, providing insight into what data it includes. The data available to researchers are generally almost two years old (e.g., calendar year 2024 data are available in 2026) and include demographic and eligibility files with information on age, gender, race and ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, and coverage through Medicaid managed care. There are also claims files that include claims for all services covered by the states, premium payments from the states to managed care plans, and records of services used by managed care enrollees. In some cases, states provide more data to the federal government than are made available to researchers such as KFF. It is likely that CMS has access to more timely data too, but it is unknown how timely those data are and the extent to which timeliness varies across the states.

In the T-MSIS data available to researchers, there are a few types of information related to immigration status, but no indicator that allows for separate identification of immigrants who are undocumented. Specifically, T-MSIS includes the following data elements:

Immigration status, which indicates whether a person is one of the following:

“A qualified alien,” which is a specific subset of noncitizens with lawful immigration status, such as lawful permanent residents (LPRs or “green card” holders), who may be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP and certain other federal programs. Many must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll in coverage.

“Lawfully present under CHIPRA 214,” which includes lawfully residing pregnant people and children in states that have taken up the option to eliminate the five-year wait to enroll in coverage for eligible immigrants with qualified status and extend coverage to lawfully present pregnant people and/or children beyond those with a qualified status.

“Eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” which includes individuals who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. This group includes undocumented immigrants, noncitizen immigrants with a qualified status who are in the five-year waiting period for coverage, and lawfully present immigrants without a qualified status.

“A U.S. citizen or U.S. national.”

Whether or not the enrollee’s immigration status has been verified, and

The date on which the five-year waiting period for receiving Medicaid and other federally funded benefits ends.

Undocumented immigrants are included in the population that is “eligible for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” but that group also includes some groups of lawfully present immigrants, and the dataset available to researchers does not separately identify these groups within that population. Additionally, because of the data lag, immigration status may have changed for some people since the data were collected.

What actions has the Trump Administration taken to share Medicaid enrollee data?

In July 2025, CMS and ICE established an Information Exchange Agreement that enables immigration enforcement officials to access the personal data of millions of Medicaid enrollees. A news organization made the agreement public in January 2026, after it was released as part of a lawsuit several states brought against the Department of Health and Human Services and DHS. Under the agreement, CMS will provide ICE, “access to the CMS Integrated Data Repository to retrieve information concerning the identify and location of aliens in the United States.” The agreement indicates this information will allow ICE to, “receive information concerning the identity and location of aliens in the United States, such as address, telephone number, banking information (routing number, account type, account number), email address, internet protocol (IP) addresses and other information relevant to identifying and locating aliens in the United States.”

The agreement specifies that CMS will provide direct access to the T-MSIS to a select set of ICE employees for renewable two-month periods, and that ICE employees will access the T-MSIS to receive information concerning the identification and location of aliens in the U.S. It identifies Medicaid recipients’ name, address, Medicaid identification number, social security number, date of birth, sex, phone number, locality, ethnicity and race as the data elements to be shared. The agreement does not specify whether ICE access to Medicaid data is limited to a certain subset of Medicaid enrollees, such as noncitizens. As such, the agreement could provide ICE employees access to these data for all Medicaid enrollees, regardless of their immigration status. Also, the stated purpose of the access is to identify and locate aliens in the United States, not specifically those who are undocumented.

This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share and ICE would not use health coverage eligibility information for immigration enforcement purposes. Under this prior policy, ICE, CMS, and states made assurances to the public, applicants and enrollees, and health care providers that information collected to determine eligibility for and administer health coverage programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace, would not be used for immigration enforcement. CMS previously stated on its website that the information regarding individuals that it collects will only be used for administration of its programs: “To protect your privacy, we’ll tell you before we collect any personal information we need to run our health care programs and only use it for that purpose.” CMS also previously stated on its website that it will not use immigration status for immigration enforcement purposes: “We won’t use any immigration status you share with us for immigration enforcement purposes.”

A preliminary injunction temporarily halted the Trump Administration’s actions to share Medicaid enrollee data with ICE in some states. In June 2025, there were reports that the Trump administration shared the personal and health data of millions of noncitizen Medicaid enrollees living in California, Illinois, Washington, and D.C. with immigration enforcement officials. Following court challenges, a preliminary injunction temporarily blocked the data sharing in the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing in August 2025. The court found that while “there does not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement, that the data sharing was implemented without a “reasoned decision making process” and likely violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The injunction did not govern data sharing in other states that are not involved in the lawsuit.

On November 25, 2025, CMS issued anoticeoutlining its plans to begin sharing Medicaid data it receives from states with DHS and ICE once the preliminary injunction is lifted. The notice specifies that ICE, “contemplates requesting from CMS available biographical, contact, and location information, though ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting other information on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.” CMS indicates that the notice makes the public aware that it intends to disclose certain information to DHS and that it will update relevant websites to reflect its authority to share information with DHS. CMS asserts that the policy change is exempt from a notice and comment period because it is a policy statement outlining actions that are consistent with federal law. ICE also issued a policy memorandum to rescind its previous policy of not using health coverage eligibility information to pursue immigration enforcement action.

In December 2025, the court updated its ruling, allowing CMS to share a subset of information it intends to share as outlined in the CMS notice. Under the injunction, CMS may only share information with DHS and ICE that is associated with the Medicaid program (not any other health programs); pertains only to individuals who are not lawfully present in the U.S.; and is limited to citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID. It prohibits the sharing of any additional information, such as health information, or information related to lawfully present individuals or citizens and precludes sharing additional information that may be requested on a case-by-case basis. It also specifies that, “to the extent that such basic biographical, contact, or location information about unlawfully present aliens is not severable from other information that DHS and ICE are not entitled to obtain (e.g., information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, sensitive health records), HHS or CMS may not share it.” The injunction only applies in the 20 plaintiff states involved in the lawsuit, meaning the data sharing can proceed as outlined in the agreement and notice in other states.

Issues to Consider

Courts will ultimately determine the legality of the data sharing policy within the context of existing data privacy and protection laws. Beyond that determination, there are also issues to consider regarding how the data sharing policy can be operationalized in ways consistent with what the courts have allowed so far and broader implications for families, health care providers, and states.

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with the current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 states challenging the data sharing agreement. If the T-MSIS data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present. Existing T-MSIS data elements identify individuals eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services. However, any data shared with ICE using that identifier will include people who are lawfully present (those subject to the five-year waiting period and those who do not have qualified status) as well as individuals who are not lawfully present. The data may also include some individuals who may not have been lawfully present at the time their information was entered into the system, but who have since transitioned to lawfully present status. In the future, the 2025 reconciliation law’s restrictions on Medicaid eligibility for certain lawfully present immigrants (including refugees and asylees among others), which begin in October 2026, will mean that the share of lawfully present immigrants identified as eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services will increase.

Going forward, the sharing of health coverage data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care as well as other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall as well as other restrictive immigration policies, including changes in public charge policy and the recission of protections from immigration enforcement in sensitive locations such as health care facilities. Prior to the CMS notice of plans to share data, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or CBP (Figure 1). These fears may contribute to individuals delaying or avoiding medical care. About one in seven (14%) immigrant adults, including 48% who are likely undocumented and 20% who are parents, say that they or a family member have avoided seeking medical care since January 2025 due to immigration-related concerns.",https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2026/01/Potential-Implications-of-the-New-Medicaid-Data-Sharing-Agreement-Between-CMS-and-ICE_FI.png,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:29.753159

Illinois is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration, challenging everything from federal funding freezes to what the state calls aggressive and unconstitutional immigration enforcement tactics.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss how the legal efforts are going amid a tense relationship between the state and federal governments.

On the lawsuit over immigration enforcement:

Illinois and Chicago officials are suing the Trump administration over what they describe as “menacing, violent and unlawful” immigration enforcement actions.

Notable violent encounters with federal immigration agents include the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, in suburban Franklin Park in September. In October, Marimar Martinez was shot five times after following agents by car.

Minnesota filed its own, separate lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on similar grounds following the fatal shooting of poet and mother Renee Good earlier this month.

“It’s important to note that our lawsuit is not saying that immigration enforcement should not happen. Of course it should happen,” Raoul said. “There are what are called enforcement and removal officers who have traditionally done that work on the interior and they are trained to do so. It’s targeted enforcement with warrants -— with not being violative of people’s privacy — not just doing sweeps and asking everybody whether or not they are a citizen of the United States.”

On the Supremacy Clause:

There are concerns that Illinois’ lawsuit may clash with the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which maintains that federal law supersedes state law. However, both Illinois and Minnesota’s suits argue that the federal government’s aggressive tactics are trying to force the states to abandon their sanctuary policies that protect immigrant communities, and that those tactics violate the Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

The 10th Amendment states “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

“It was Justice Scalia that said in a case, U.S. v. Prince, that the federal government cannot commandeer states and state and local resources to do what is the federal government’s work,” Raoul said. “The 10th Amendment gives us our sovereignty, gives us a state’s rights. It used to be that Republicans would advocate for the protection of state rights.”

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “It really is astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law — which is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause — and then go right back to federalizing every state responsibility possible when they get back in power. Spare us.”

On sanctuary laws and the Constitution:

The legal battle intersects with Illinois’ Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Raoul said Illinois’ policies are consistent with the U.S. Constitution.

A recent report from Raoul’s office found that four Illinois sheriff’s offices complied with immigration detainers or civil immigration warrants, defying the state’s sanctuary laws.

“They’re self-reporting to us,” Raoul said. “We communicate back once they alert us that there may have been a violation as to how to avoid it happening again. These are situations where we’ve been alerted and we try to work with our law enforcement partners into making sure they’re abiding by the state law.”

On the federal government freezing funding to social safety net programs:

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary, two-week restraining order blocking the Trump administration from freezing roughly $10 billion in federal funding for child care and family services programs in Illinois, California, Colorado, Minnesota and New York. The order prevents the funding from being withheld while the case moves forward.

As justification for freezing the funds, the Trump administration cited concerns about fraud and undocumented immigrants receiving benefits and said it needed to conduct internal reviews and collect documentation.

“It’s violative of … the Administrative Procedures Act in that it’s arbitrary in how they’re doing it, but it’s also political retribution,” Raoul said. “It’s just five states. It’s a fishing expedition.”

He continued: “We have systems in place to make sure that people who are receiving these benefits are people who sorely need these benefits, truly need them and truly qualify for them. Could there be a case here or there where somebody scams the system? Absolutely. We actually partner with the federal government in investigating and sometimes prosecuting such fraud.”

On ongoing legal battles:

Illinois is currently involved in dozens of lawsuits against the federal government — a number Raoul said could grow.

“It’s looking that way, and it’s not because I’m looking for battles with the Trump administration, but it’s because our Constitution and our laws are being violated,” Raoul said.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:25.371245

A proposed policy affirms IPS will protect student confidentiality and provide access to education for all children

Indianapolis Public Schools has rescinded resolutions signaling support for undocumented students following a lawsuit from state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

Instead, a new proposed policy on student access, safety, and privacy says the district will continue to protect the confidentiality of student records and information while providing “equal access to public education” for all students who live within the district — regardless of immigration status.

The proposal comes in the wake of a November lawsuit from Rokita’s office that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement. Rokita alleged that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country with his son, an IPS student.

Attorneys for IPS have said in court that the district would adopt a new policy that would render the state’s lawsuit moot. The board is expected to vote on the policy proposal at its meeting in February, according to board president Angelia Moore.

The updates could ultimately change little in how the district serves and protects undocumented students, whose rights to education and privacy are already protected by a string of state and federal laws and a U.S. Supreme Court case. The lawsuit, however, claims the district policy violates a state law that prohibits government entities from restricting immigration enforcement.

Neither IPS nor Rokita’s office immediately responded to a request for comment. School board president Angelia Moore declined to comment on the proposed policy, citing the ongoing litigation.

New resolution maintains IPS support for all students

At a retreat on Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026, the IPS school board rescinded two prior resolutions supporting undocumented students. One was adopted early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and the other was adopted early in his second term, amid high-profile and controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

One 2017 resolution stated the district’s support for creating a safe place for all students regardless of immigration status. It directed employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

Another 2025 resolution reaffirmed this commitment to all students.

But the resolution to rescind these prior commitments still maintains that the district supports all students and employees. It also references a variety of state and federal laws to protect immigrant families, including the federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

The resolution also references the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. Legal experts say Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can only enter school grounds under certain circumstances.

And the resolution references the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe that undocumented students have a right to public education.

The proposed IPS policy states that IPS will operate within the legal framework provided by the United States Constitution, the state constitution, federal and state civil rights laws, federal education privacy laws, and Indiana statutes on public education.

The superintendent will adopt training and protocols for staff regarding student privacy and requests from outside agencies seeking information or access to students, the proposed policy states.

Rokita’s ICE lawsuit hinges on deportation flight

Rokita’s lawsuit alleges that an IPS student, the son of a Honduran national, went to school on the morning of his father’s scheduled deportation flight. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the lawsuit claims.

The district said it would not release the child to an ICE officer without a judicial warrant or court order, the lawsuit states.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as he had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” the lawsuit states.

Rokita’s lawsuit targeted several district policies, including the 2017 resolution.

His office has previously argued that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. He has also argued that school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2023/01/20/PIND/de6fa688-203b-4548-9b72-d2662b0acc23-IPSSchoolBoardMeeting_01192022_GH006.jpg?crop=7928,4460,x166,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 03:59:29.438696

The countries include Somalia, Russia, Afghanistan, Brazil, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Nigeria, Thailand, Yemen and more.

The pause will begin Jan. 21 and will continue indefinitely until the department conducts a reassessment of immigrant visa processing.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MINNESOTA’S ‘FEEDING OUR FUTURE’ FRAUD AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP’S LATEST CRACKDOWN

Somalia has drawn heightened scrutiny from federal officials following a sweeping fraud scandal centered in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered massive abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programs. Many of those involved are Somali nationals or Somali-Americans.

In November 2025, a State Department cable sent to posts around the globe instructed consular officers to enforce sweeping new screening rules under the so-called ""public charge"" provision of immigration law.

The guidance instructs consular officers to deny visas to applicants deemed likely to rely on public benefits, weighing a wide range of factors including health, age, English proficiency, finances and even potential need for long-term medical care.

Older or overweight applicants could be denied, along with those who had any past use of government cash assistance or institutionalization.

""The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,"" State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement.

""Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES MORE THAN 100,000 VISAS IN FIRST YEAR BACK

While the public charge provision has existed for decades, enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers historically given broad discretion in applying the standard.

Exceptions to the new pause will be ""very limited"" and only allowed after an applicant has cleared public charge considerations.

A 2022 version of the public charge rule under the Biden administration had limited the scope of benefits considered — primarily to cash assistance and long-term institutional care — excluding programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, Medicaid or housing vouchers.

The Immigration and Nationality Act has long permitted consular officers to deem applicants inadmissible on public charge grounds, but President Donald Trump in 2019 expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That expansion was challenged in court, with portions ultimately blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.

Philadelphia elected officials are doubling down on last week’s rhetoric against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who violate the law

District Attorney Larry Krasner joined Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal and some city council members in speaking out against the potential for mass ICE raids in the city during a news conference at Salt and Light Church in the city’s Kingsessing neighborhood.

Krasner said ICE agents who break the law in Philadelphia will be arrested.

“We will arrest you. We will put handcuffs on you. We will close those cuffs. We will put you in a cell,” he said. “We will do everything in our power to convict you and we will make sure you serve your entire sentence because Donald Trump has no power whatsoever to pardon you.”

Krasner also defended Bilal, who got national attention last week when she said she would “bring the smoke” against ICE. She doubled down on that statement today.

She said that when someone commits a crime “in the city and the DA charges you, you will be arrested and you will go to jail. That’s the smoke.”

Councilmember Rue Landau said ICE raids can have a chilling effect that will prevent those without documentation from coming forward to testify in criminal cases, especially in cases such as domestic violence where the perpetrator could go free because of a lack of eyewitness testimony.

“If folks are scared to go to court, if they are scared the second they step out of their house to even get to that court hearing, they are in jeopardy,” Landau said. “If going to the hearing and walking outside puts them in harm’s way of ICE agents who are going to jump out of unmarked cars with unmarked vests and not showing their badges, they are going to jump on them, attack them and drag them away. They’re not going to participate in the process.”

Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who is the daughter of immigrants, said her concerns with the ICE raids are not only focused on those without documentation.

President Donald Trump’s “secret police executed Renee Good, a mother, an American citizen, in broad daylight,” she said. “We see Trump’s actions for what they really are, a violent attempt to seize power and scare those who disagree with him.”

Gauthier pointed to next week’s commemoration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and urged those in attendance to implement his nonviolent method of protesting to send a message to Washington, D.C.

“What he would want from our city, I think we all know that he was calling us to fiercely fight for our immigrant neighbors, not remain silent in the face of injustice,” she said.

It’s the second week in a row that a group of Philadelphia’s elected leaders gathered to decry activities related to federal immigration agents.

Last Thursday, Bilal drew national headlines for her criticism of ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis. Bilal denounced ICE agents for wearing masks and called them “fake law enforcement.”

Krasner dismissed the argument that the ICE officer fired his weapon in self-defense and repeated his pledge to prosecute any federal officers who commit crimes in Philadelphia. “We will charge any ICE agent who tries this nonsense here,” Krasner said last week.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel put out a statement Friday saying the police department was flooded with calls from around the country in response to those comments. Bethel’s statement clarified that Bilal’s office is a separate entity from the police department and does not police the city or conduct criminal investigations.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/larry-krasner-kp-011426-02.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:26.436062

A fight over funding ICE, which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, could trigger a partial government shutdown if lawmakers don't reach a deal by the end of the month.

""If we are going to fund the Department of Homeland Security, we want to fund an agency that is simply complying with the law,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT).

Last year's One Big Beautiful Bill included nearly $75 billion in supplemental funding for ICE through 2029, and the agency is staunchly backed by President Trump.

The most important of these prerequisites requires that the federal officer be on duty, acting at the request of a local or state officer, and operating pursuant to the supervision of that local or state officer.

Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week.
Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training.","Since last Wednesday, both the general populace and policymakers have debated whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officer Jonathan Ross, who allegedly shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, properly applied the Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy. In the aftermath of the shooting, protests broke out not just in Minneapolis, where it occurred, but throughout the nation; those marching aver overly aggressive law enforcement officers outright murdered Good. Conversely, Vice President J.D. Vance alleged that Good was “part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to dox, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job” and that she used the techniques of domestic terrorism to target federal officials; Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem vowed to send hundreds more of her employees to Minnesota to support her department’s ongoing operations there in the face of local resistance. Little agreement exists between the political poles on how to describe that fatal moment.

Whether Ross violated Homeland Security’s deadly force policies—and thus also potentially Good’s Fourth Amendment rights—is certainly one of the most important questions to arise out of her death. But amid the high passion and tumult of the debate, other, equally pressing issues remain largely unaddressed: Namely, what do the events which occurred immediately before Ross took the slack out of his trigger, and the response of him and his colleagues right after the final press, tell us about how ICE is conducting itself as it executes the largest apprehension and deportation operation in the history of the United States?

The answers are not comforting; they will provide little balm to anyone concerned with civil liberties, the lives of civilians, or the application of safe and proven law enforcement techniques (by which I mean ones that protect officers themselves from both adversarial danger and legal liability). Based on what has been publicly released, the whole interaction between Good, Ross, and the other ICE officials was a series of unforced errors by the government. The entire encounter, even accounting for Ross’s own footage, illustrates the general lack of professionalism with which ICE has operated over the past few months and its abandonment of its own internal policies.

This article will not wade into the debate over whether deadly force was justified at the exact moment Ross fired into the vehicle (that debate will largely focus on a narrow legal question—did he have a reasonable belief that Good would use her car as a weapon to hit him—in a manner that will frustrate many observers, and should rely on a much larger tranche of evidence than many observers realize). Because even if Ross’s deadly force was justified in the moment he fired his weapon, what much of the nation has now seen was not professionalized or situationally appropriate law enforcement. It was a series of incredibly bad choices leading to an unnecessary death. At every step which led to the fatal trigger press, ICE could have behaved differently. It could have behaved more tactically. It could have behaved more humanely. The nation—to say nothing of Renee Nicole Good’s family—deserves an honest accounting of why it did not.

* * *

Why was ICE interacting with Good in the first place?

The question isn’t rhetorical. Video footage shows that she was clearly—at least for a few moments, if not longer—blocking traffic by positioning her car in the middle of the road; furthermore, she was doing so while in the presence of law enforcement vehicles with lights and sirens activated. Such behavior would appear to be a prima facie violation of Minnesota Statute 169.20 §5, a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine, and perhaps diversion to a remedial driving school. If a peace officer with the appropriate authority ordered her to move, and she chose not to comply, she also may have been violating Minnesota Statute 169.34 §1(11).

But much of the analysis actually hinges on the phrase “peace officer.” Not all law enforcement agencies are authorized to enforce all statutes; generally speaking, state and local departments enforce state and local laws, while federal officers and agents enforce federal laws and constitutional violations. States can provide exceptions to this general rule by enacting an enabling law granting federal officials the authority to enforce state laws, which confers peace officer status.

Minnesota defines a peace officer as “an employee of a political subdivision [i.e. a local municipality] or state law enforcement agency,” and only grants their federal counterparts arrest authorities for the purposes of state and local violations when a number of conditions are met. The most important of these prerequisites requires that the federal officer be on duty, acting at the request of a local or state officer, and operating pursuant to the supervision of that local or state officer. At this point, neither ICE management nor any executive branch officials have argued that these conditions were met; indeed, the tenor and tone of statements by the Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor would certainly suggest otherwise. The proper remedy, then, for Good’s obstruction of traffic would have simply been for the ICE officers to request that local police join in the response and facilitate the movement of her vehicle.

But let’s put this argument aside, for the moment.

Even if ICE had no authority to enforce state traffic regulations, it may argue that Good was violating 18 U.S.C. §111, which prohibits “assaulting, resisting, or impeding” federal law enforcement officials. But as the Justice Department itself maintains, that statute requires an element of force on the part of the offender, and also requires that the officer be engaged in the performance of official duties. With respect to the first part, it is difficult to see, in any of the videos released thus far, any moment at which Good deployed force against the officers. What she and others appear to have been doing is videotaping them, verbally sparring with them, and perhaps blowing whistles. But every federal appellate court which has addressed the issue recognizes a First Amendment right to film the police, regardless of whether one is a bystander or the actual criminal subject; ICE’s behavior with regard to this sort of activity in other jurisdictions, which is becoming increasingly frequent, clearly violates the Constitution. Even Ross’s own footage does not appear to demonstrate any behavior by Good at the outset of the interaction which violates a federal criminal law or would not be shielded by First Amendment protections.

But let’s put this argument aside for the moment as well.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, and the question still remains whether they acted in a manner that comports with their own internal policies. The agency’s Employee Code of Conduct §5.4 mandates that “ICE employees must be professional, polite, respectful, and patient in all official activities that involve contact with…members of the public, even in the face of considerable provocation.” It is difficult to understand how yelling at a woman to “get out of the fucking car” when she is not acting violent, or calling her a “fucking bitch,” after shooting at her three times, would comport with this rule. ICE’s own disciplinary guidance mandates suspensions for “using rude, impolite, discourteous, unprofessional, obscene…or similarly inappropriate language, gestures, or conduct…to members of the public.” Making improper comments during operations is similarly prohibited and punishable under the guidance. It might be a small violation, not particularly important for the larger issues at play here, but it is a data point, nonetheless.

But let’s put aside this argument, too, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law and operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines. The question still remains whether they appropriately de-escalated the situation before resorting to force. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons himself recently noted, in an Associated Press feature, that “[i]n any type of law enforcement situation you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.” The agency’s head firearms instructor promised that “[w]e do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that [dangerous] environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision. Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot…” But none of the footage thus far released, by bystanders or the agency, reveals any moment in which any of the officers tried to defuse the situation without violence. Ross spent an inordinate amount of time videotaping his interaction with Good on his cellphone, and at no point in his own recording does he attempt to calm the situation or even betray any sense of his own self-possession. The officers who come to assist him do not interact with Good at all, except to run towards her vehicle while shouting “Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car,” before trying to forcibly open her door.

But let’s also put this argument aside, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, and had attempted to de-escalate the situation. The question still remains whether they needed to immediately approach Good’s vehicle. Other standard law enforcement techniques exist to remove someone from an automobile that will less likely lead to a violent outcome, and are actually safer for the involved officers. The intersection near which Good was parked—East 34th Street and Portland Avenue—lay on a standard city grid. A plethora of law enforcement vehicles were in the immediate vicinity, some of which could have redeployed in less than a minute to block Good’s means of egress. ICE could have established a “surround and call out,” wherein they isolated and contained Good, stayed themselves in a position of safe cover, and, if necessary and justified, had drawn and aimed their weapons as a prophylactic measure. After establishing a perimeter, they could have utilized their vehicles’ microphones and loudspeakers to issue instructions for Good to exit her vehicle in a manner that ensured everyone’s safety.

To be clear, while this would not be a common technique to use for someone who was not the identified subject of a warrant or acting violent, it was an available option if ICE seriously thought removing Good from her car, for some reason, was absolutely necessary.

But let’s put this argument aside as well, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, had attempted to de-escalate the situation, and that a surround and call out had not successfully extricated Good from her vehicle. The question still remains whether ICE approached her automobile in a tactically sound manner. Video footage indicates that the first movement occurs when Ross maneuvers himself from the side of Good’s vehicle to its front, all the while videotaping his actions with his cellphone in what appears to be his dominant hand (he switches the device to his other side when it comes time for him to draw his weapon). This change in position defies both standard practice and common sense: As the former chief of the FBI’s Tactical Training Unit noted to The New York Times, “Obviously just from a safety standpoint, officers are taught to approach vehicles from angles that would not put themselves squarely in the traffic path if at all possible.” If Ross thought himself in danger, it also defies explanation why he occupied his best hand with his phone, solely to capture video footage.

The other officers, who quickly join Ross, similarly eschew standard law enforcement techniques. Generally speaking, most agencies train personnel to approach a vehicle deliberately when there is an unknown risk combined with no imminent threat; all the officers here sprinted toward Good’s automobile. A car contains a number of potentially dangerous areas that officers need to observe before any substantive interactions with the occupants: the trunk or rear cabin; the back passenger side, which gives a view as to whether anyone is ensconced in the back seat or on the floor of the vehicle; and, the front driver’s side, which allows the approaching officer to see who is sitting in the front of the car while simultaneously keeping an eye on the hands of the driver. Officers generally should approach these positions cautiously and with enough distance to look through the windows before making any further tactical decisions. (Although I’m referring to deliberate movement and observations, these words do not mean that the personnel should move tentatively or without alacrity, but simply that their actions should rely more on forethought and training than adrenaline and emotion.) In this case, the officers other than Ross both proceed immediately to the driver’s door. Only one maintains a distance and position that would not entangle him with the vehicle should it begin moving.

At this point, we have run out of arguments which we can momentarily cabin. As videos of the incident show, as Renee Nicole Good turns her steering wheel to the right and begins to drive away, three shots ring out, her vehicle careens into a parked car and light post, and the assembled bystanders scream.

* * *

The crack of the shots dissipates into the air, the car sits crumpled and smoking, and then something does not happen. None of the ICE officers appear to be in any hurry to go render aid to Good; they do not approach the crash site tactically, nor do they rush towards it. The only reaction any of the officers seem to have is when Ross appears to exclaim that Good was a “fucking bitch.” ICE personnel actually prevented civilian medics on the scene from rendering any aid.

The withholding of aid alone could have serious consequences for the involved officers if they ever find themselves facing a color of law civil rights investigation, as it speaks to a deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition as prohibited by the relevant statute. The notion that law enforcement personnel would rush to provide medical assistance to someone they have just shot seems counterintuitive to those who have never worn a badge, but in the years following the death of George Floyd, the federal government overhauled its guidelines to mandate this very behavior. The Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy specifically requires the following:

As soon as practicable following a use of force and the end of any perceived public safety threat, DHS LEOs shall obtain appropriate medical assistance for any subject who has visible or apparent injuries, complains of being injured, or requests medical attention. This may include rendering first aid if properly trained and equipped to do so, requesting emergency medical services, and/or arranging transportation to an appropriate medical facility.

Federal law enforcement officers and agents generally receive fairly extensive medical training throughout their careers, particularly with respect to gunshot wounds; a standard part of their issued tactical gear, carried on their ballistic vests, is the basic equipment necessary to staunch the attendant bleeding, such as tourniquets, Israeli bandages, and occlusive dressings. Many personnel—certainly those certified as tactical medics—can perform a field tracheotomy and, if needed, intubate someone with an endotracheal tube. Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week. Officers refine their training throughout their careers, and most have a refresher of the basics during the active shooter training which are now a regular part of the job[1] [2] . It is possible that not a single ICE officer on the scene ever received any of this instruction, or that none of them had any medical equipment on hand. But it is also unlikely.

Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training. But perhaps, then, their leaders should reconsider whether the agency is best suited to be the tip of the spear in operations to apprehend “the worst of the worst.”

After a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renée Good in Minneapolis last Wednesday, Trump administration officials were quick to come out in the agent’s defense.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Jonathan Ross—a veteran officer with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm who has been identified by multiple media reports as the shooter—followed his training and the agency’s protocol. Vice President JD Vance claimed Ross had reason to fear for his life and acted in self-defense. And press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to Good as a “deranged lunatic woman” who tried to run over the office with her vehicle as a weapon. Officials repeatedly accused Good of perpetrating “domestic terrorism.”

The narrative put forward by the administration is largely disproved by available video evidence. And it has even been received with skepticism by some former ICE employees, who are condemning Ross’ use of force against the 37-year-old mother of three and warning that their one-time agency has lost its way.

Former ICE chief of staff Jason Hauser recently wrote in USA Today: “When enforcement is driven by messaging instead of mission, when optics outweigh judgment and when leadership substitutes spectacle for strategy, the risk to officers, civilian and public safety increases exponentially.”

The second Trump presidency has taken ICE off the leash. The agency is now the highest-funded law enforcement body in the United States, with a budget that eclipses that of some countries’ militaries. With its near-unlimited resources and aggressive directions from the White House, ICE is sending federal immigration agents not trained in community policing to make at-large arrests in cities across the country. (Days after the shooting, Noem announced DHS would deploy hundreds more agents to Minneapolis.)

Two ex-ICE workers I spoke with described an agency that, in pursuit of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mandate, is engaging in reckless and risky behavior.

“They’re essentially operating now in a resource constraint-free environment and doing very dangerous things,” said Scott Shuchart, who previously worked at the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within DHS and more recently as ICE’s assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy under the Biden administration. Violent interactions with the public aren’t surprising, he added. “That’s sort of by design.”

Dan Gividen, an immigration lawyer who acted as deputy chief counsel for ICE’s Dallas field office between 2016 and 2019, compared what the agency is doing as akin to running into a crowded movie theater and yelling “fire.” “You’ve got these ICE officers that are pouring out of these vehicles, pointing guns at US citizens—people who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong—and causing chaos.”

ICE removal agents charged with doing administrative arrests, he said, lack the tactical training to safely do operations out in communities. “It’s not at all surprising that this is happening with these ICE ERO officers being sent out to basically treat people terribly,” he said, anticipating more escalation of violence.

Another former ICE trial attorney I spoke with said that, typically, removal officers weren’t trained in high-risk operations because the daily demands of the job didn’t require it. In the past, if such an encounter took place, local law enforcement might have gotten involved to help keep the situation under control. “What has changed is there has been an encouragement from the top to be much more aggressive in enforcement and ramp things up and get the job done,” the ex-counsel for the agency told me.

In Gividen’s view, the federal immigration agents didn’t have a reason to interact with Good to begin with. “He had no reason to believe she had committed any offense that he actually has the authority to investigate,” Gividen said of Ross. “They murdered her, plain and simple. That is all there is to it. The notion that they were in any way, shape, or form acting in self-defense to put three bullets in that woman is absolutely absurd.”

An ICE’s use of force and firearms policy directive from 2023 states that authorized officers should only use force when “no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” is available. It also mandates that the level of force be “objectively reasonable” given the circumstances and instructs officers to “de-escalate” the situation. The guidelines further state that an agent who uses deadly force should be placed on administrative leave for three consecutive days. (ICE didn’t respond to questions from Mother Jones about its policies and whether Ross had been put on leave.)

“The question isn’t: Was he in any danger?” Shuchart said. “The question is: Was the use of force the only thing he could do to address the danger? And was the use of immediate deadly force the appropriate level of force?”

One of the videos shows that Ross appeared to move out of the way to avoid possible contact with the car. “I don’t understand how you get from there to the idea that deadly stop and force against the driver was necessary to protect the officer from serious bodily harm,” added Shuchart, who until January 2025 was part of a team that handles ICE-wide policy and regulations.

A DHS-wide 2023 policy on use of force generally prohibits deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject” and the discharging of firearms to “disable moving vehicles.” But a recent Wall Street Journal investigation identified at least 13 instances since July where immigration agents fired at or into civilian cars, shooting eight people—including five US citizens—and leaving two dead.

Instead of de-escalating, Shuchart said, Ross only “exacerbated the danger.” Shuchart pointed to a number of errors Ross made that could have been avoided, starting with his decision to step in front of the car. “This officer was not just freshly coming across the scene when a vehicle lurches at him,” he said. “[He] had already violated policy creating a danger to himself by crossing in front of the vehicle that wasn’t in park. You have to assess what was reasonable in those circumstances from the fact that he had created the potential danger to himself.”

Prior to joining ERO, Ross did a stint with the Indiana National Guard in Iraq and worked as a field intelligence agent for the Border Patrol. His job as an ICE deportation officer in the Twin Cities area involved arresting “higher-value targets,” according to his own testimony from court records obtained by Wired, related to an accident last June when Ross was dragged by a car during an arrest.

“As a matter of what someone in law enforcement anywhere would be trained to do, and what someone would be trained to do under DHS policy, what he was doing was nuts,” Shuchart said of Ross’ actions last week. “He was so completely out of line with respect to what would have been safe for him and the other people on that operation. It was not at all how any kind of operation should go.”

According to Shuchart, the agents at the scene also failed to follow protocol in the aftermath of the shooting by appearing to not immediately render medical assistance or confirm that, if the target was in fact a threat, they no longer presented danger.

Speaking to the New York Times, Trump appeared to try to justify Good’s killing by saying she had been “very, very disrespectful” to law enforcement.

“The fact that their feelings are hurt by US citizens disapproving of what they do loudly is completely irrelevant,” Shuchart said. “The point of the job is not to have your feelings well-cared for by the public.”

Under pressure to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 daily arrests, ICE has been on a hiring spree. The agency is offering candidates signing bonuses and plans a $100 million “wartime recruitment” effort that includes geo-targeted ads and influencers targeting gun rights supporters and UFC fights attendees to bring in as many as 10,000 new hires. Earlier this month, DHS publicized the addition of 12,000 officers and agents—from a pool of 220,000 “patriotic” applicants who responded to the government’s “Defend the Homeland” calls—more than doubling ICE’s workforce.

So far, the result of that expansion drive has been less than optimal, with recruits failing fitness tests and not undergoing proper vetting. Experts have also raised concerns about the lowering of standards and reduced training times for new hires as the administration pushes to get more agents in the streets and rack up arrest numbers quickly.

“I would be skeptical of anyone who would take a job with an agency that is willing to defend behavior this unprofessional,” Shuchart said. “There are thousands of law enforcement agencies in this country. If you’re a decent recruit, go work for one of the others that has more reasonable standards and expectations.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260113_trump-ice-design_2000_v2b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:08.333630

Since January 2025, Austin officers have reported people with administrative warrants to ICE dozens of times.

APD Chief Lisa Davis told The Texas Newsroom that she will create new department “general orders” that will explicitly state that local police can cooperate more fully with federal immigration officers in the execution of immigration warrants. She said the change reflects the fact that state law gives officers greater discretion in contacting ICE than is outlined in the department’s current policy.

“Officers may but are not required to call ICE,” Davis told The Texas Newsroom in an interview on Tuesday.

In a follow up email ahead of publication, APD spokesperson Anna Sabana said, “Chief Davis said the rule change comes after city legal advised her that current general orders should address administrative warrants and ensure mandates of [Senate Bill 4] are adhered to.”

The move comes after immigration advocates and legal experts raised questions about APD’s decision to turn over a Honduran mother and her young daughter to ICE earlier this month.

APD officers called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after encountering the woman during a disturbance call. In a statement, Davis initially said APD was required to notify ICE because the woman had an ICE “administrative warrant.” In fact, Austin police officers have reported dozens of people with similar warrants to ICE since President Donald Trump started his second term, city records show.

Legal experts questioned whether this cooperation was required, noting the department’s policy only required contact with ICE for people who federal authorities have formally requested they detain.

But Davis said the department’s policy has been out of step with state law and needs updating. She said local police will now be able to freely contact ICE and may even ask for the immigration status of people they encounter, a notable departure from current policy that has discouraged prioritizing immigration enforcement.

“I have no doubt that officers have been confused on this,” she said. Adding that the new general order “is going to help with that confusion.”

Late Wednesday, multiple members of the Austin City Council said they do not anticipate more cooperation between APD and ICE under the new department policy. .

Councilmember José “Chito” Vela said his understanding was that individual APD officers will not be freely calling ICE because they would need to run their decisions by a commanding officer. He hopes that under the new policy, which he pointed out has not been finalized, notifications to ICE would only happen rarely, as when the person involved also was guilty of certain violent criminal offenses.

“We have to be very careful in our decisions when to call ICE about the administrative warrants.” he said “Because of [state law], we cannot adopt a blanket policy of ‘we can’t call ICE,’ so we have to be very judicious about the policy that we do adopt and make sure it’s an exceptional circumstance.”

The City of Austin did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Newsroom, but Vela provided a memo dated January 14 from the city’s legal team that he anticipates will shape the final policy.

He said he expects the new APD policy to be finalized soon.

While ICE actions in Austin have remained relatively low profile, the move comes as immigration enforcement has become a part of daily life in some US cities, prompting nationwide protests.

APD reported dozens of people to ICE

APD’s current policy, General Order 318.3.4, only explicitly mandates officers alert ICE when a so-called “ICE detainer” or request to hold a person is issued.

A detainer is a formal request from federal authorities to hold someone in police custody for a suspected immigration violation. Administrative warrants, by contrast, are routinely issued by federal agents to flag someone who may have violated civil immigration law.

Administrative warrants and detainers “are different things in federal immigration law,” Elissa Steglich, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Texas Newsroom. She said as far as she can tell, “there is room for Austin to not notify ICE” regarding warrants.

But lawyers working for the city disagreed, according to Davis.

She said they advised her recently that APD cannot stop officers from contacting ICE when they uncover administrative warrants under state laws. Those laws require local police to cooperate with federal law enforcement and allow local officers to detain people they suspect of being undocumented. Some of these provisions are being challenged in court.

“Senate Bill 4 does not allow us to tell officers they cannot call ICE on these things,” Davis told The Texas Newsroom.

Davis said she was unaware that department policy needed to be updated until after the incident with the Honduran mother and her child this month. Advocates with Grassroots Leadership said the pair was deported, despite them saying the daughter is a U.S. citizen, after APD reported them to ICE.

The Texas Newsroom was unable to independently confirm this information.

Davis said ICE notified APD of the uptick in administrative warrants in early 2025, when immigration authorities flooded a federal police database with 14,000 warrants under the second Trump administration.

Some officers began reporting people with these warrants to ICE but APD policy was never updated to reflect their ability to do so, Davis added.

Since January 2025, Austin officers have reported people with administrative warrants to ICE dozens of times. The City of Austin requires APD to file quarterly reports detailing police interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over someone’s immigration status. An analysis of these reports shows that APD contacted ICE 33 times from January through September of last year.

Data for the fourth quarter of last year has yet to be released.

Some of the people reported to ICE were reaching out to police for help. In one instance, a man contacted EMS “to speak with a doctor about his mental health.” EMS contacted APD, which found that the person was the subject of what the report calls an “ICE warrant.”

“Officers contacted ICE,” the report described, “but no federal officials were available.”

In this case, EMS voluntarily took the caller to the hospital. It’s unclear whether immigration agents contacted that person after he was discharged.

In total, around 13 of the individuals who were determined to have ICE warrants were not taken into custody.

In eight instances, the people were booked into the Travis County jail, from which ICE routinely takes people into its custody. Four times, ICE arrived at the scene of an APD investigation to immediately take people into custody.

Davis said she was unaware local police were present during ICE apprehensions until this month.

The city reports also documented the race/ethnicity of the people reported to ICE: 26 were listed as Hispanic, eight as White and one as Middle Eastern. The reporting did not indicate if any of those people listed as White also identify as another ethnicity as well.

Advocates say that administrative warrants are commonly applied even to immigrants pursuing legal asylum claims. They worry that migrants who may have been flagged with a warrant without being aware may misunderstand their risk of deportation when interacting with local police.

“They may not be aware that [in] calling the police, or coming into contact with police, their information may be run and they will then have ICE called on them,” Sabina Hinz-Foley Trejo, an organizer with the group Grassroots Leadership, told The Texas Newsroom.

How APD policy on ICE will change

Davis said that she does not believe the new policy will contradict earlier statements she made that it is not APD’S job to enforce civil warrants.

Last year, she told The Texas Newsroom that officers lose community trust and their ability to fight crime when they become immigration enforcers. She said at the time, “We do not ask about immigration status here in Austin.”

She said the new general orders will specify a chain of communication that officers must observe when they decide to notify ICE that they have found someone with an administrative warrant. Under her proposal, officers will first notify a duty commander that they intend to contact immigration authorities.

“The officer may want to call ICE and may opt to do that [...] the decision to remain on scene will be with the commander,” Davis said. “The decision to wait would be on a commander.”

She said some details of the new policy are still awaiting input from city legal staff. But the city and police department may be releasing more information about the changes by the end of the week, according to an APD spokesperson.

The Texas Newsroom asked if the changes to policy mean Chief Davis may stop telling the public that APD officers do not ask about people’s immigration status. She replied, “you know what? I don't know how to answer that.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90995d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4583x2406+0+324/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fd9%2Fea1fd16e4c32bbc8e24dfa6fc36d%2Faustin-police-department-49585644311-o.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:12.169662

Currently, New Jersey is home to two detention centers, Delaney Hall and Elizabeth Detention Center.","New Jersey’s congressional Democrats and Roxbury residents are decrying Trump administration plans to turn a warehouse in this Morris County town into the state’s third immigration detention center.

The lawmakers called it “unconscionable” that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider building another migrant jail in New Jersey, even after an uprising and a detainee’s death at Delaney Hall, the Newark facility that opened last year. They urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to “immediately cease” any plans for a jail in Roxbury.

Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

“Immigration detention facilities in New Jersey have become notorious for inefficiency and waste in addition to humanitarian failure. These failures have inflicted trauma both on detained individuals and on surrounding families, communities and local governments who have been forced to grapple with the ongoing harms associated with immigrant detention,” they wrote in the three-page letter.

According to the Washington Post, internal ICE documents show the Trump administration is seeking contractors to turn industrial warehouses into jails to hold thousands of immigrant detainees. Roxbury is among two dozen locations across the country where officials are mulling warehouse jails.

“The proposal would subject thousands of people, the majority of whom pose no threat to public safety, to confinement under cruel and inhumane conditions. Warehouses are designed for storage and shipping, not for safely housing people,” the lawmakers’ letter reads.

They stressed that ICE detention facilities “already have a poor track record.” Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, making it one of the deadliest years in the agency’s history, according to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that track in-custody deaths.

The Democrats noted in their letter that prior to Delaney Hall’s opening, they warned of the dangers of expanding immigrant detention and urged officials to reverse those plans. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered into a 15-year contract with prison company Geo Group to operate the 1,000-bed facility anyway, and the facility opened last spring.

Since then, Delaney Hall has been at the center of numerous controversies. Newark city officials alleged Geo Group opened it without securing the proper permits, prompting a lawsuit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there May 9 — he was charged with trespassing, and prosecutors quickly dismissed the case — and Rep.

Hearing: Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program – A Trojan Horse with Flawed Vetting and Deadly Consequences

Date: January 14, 2026

Submitted by: Refugees International, Afghan American Foundation

Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee:

Between 1996 and 2001, Afghanistan was governed by the Taliban, then an unrecognized but highly centralized regime that imposed an extreme social order, ruling primarily through clerics and armed militias rather than civilian institutions. Under heavy international sanctions and with virtually no technocratic bureaucracy, the Taliban remained diplomatically isolated and incapable of delivering economic recovery nor a viable future for the Afghan people. Girls’ education was largely banned nationwide, women were barred from most work and severely restricted in their movement, and public life was stripped of music, television, and most sports. Punishments were carried out publicly and included beatings, amputations, and executions. At the same time, humanitarian conditions were catastrophic – millions faced chronic hunger amid drought and economic collapse, with widespread shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, and medicine. Regrettably, many of these conditions have resurfaced following the United States withdrawal in 2021.

For two decades, the United States pursued a political and development mission in Afghanistan at enormous cost in American lives and resources. Alongside combat operations, sustained investments in education, healthcare, and human rights produced measurable gains across the country. Afghanistan’s education system expanded dramatically, moving from a period in which girls’ public schooling had been effectively shut down to one in which, by 2020, roughly nine million students were enrolled—up to three and a half million of them girls. Literacy rates among children, including girls, rose substantially over the same period. Health outcomes also improved. The expansion of clinics and the training and deployment of female health workers enabled millions of women and girls to access essential care for the first time. Life expectancy increased, while infant mortality fell by nearly half. These development gains were closely intertwined with advances in human rights and public participation. Millions of Afghans—many of them women—entered civic and public life as teachers, doctors, journalists, civil society leaders, and elected officials. Independent media and civil society organizations expanded, and space opened, however imperfectly, for public debate, political participation, and accountability.

Many of these gains would not have been possible without the close partnership between American forces and Afghan allies, some of whom came to the United States and became valuable community members. For two decades, Afghans stood with the U.S. mission in the belief that it offered a path away from repression and extremism. Afghans supported and sacrificed alongside American service members and civilians so that their children could return to school, their wives and daughters could become doctors, engineers, journalists, and public servants, and their country could begin building institutions capable of sustaining a more just and stable democratic future. That shared project created not only progress in Afghanistan, but trust, personal relationships, and migration pathways to the United States for certain Afghans. Congress established the Special Immigrant Visa program in 2009 to provide a viable pathway to safety in the United States for Afghans who supported the U.S. mission, were subject to extensive vetting, and faced serious threats as a result of their service. Afghans who arrived in the United States in the 2010s, as SIVs or who sought asylum in fear of return to Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban, have become integrated members of our communities, establishing businesses, raising U.S. born-children, working as professionals and continuing to support the U.S. mission of advancing human rights in Afghanistan.

Following the United States withdrawal, interpreters, women leaders, journalists, and partners of U.S. organizations in Afghanistan were placed at acute risk of reprisal by the Taliban. Indeed, following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, the remaining hope for many Afghan allies was the promise, explicit and implicit, that the U.S. would stand by those who stood with it. The U.S. prioritized evacuation and resettlement through the US Refugee Admissions Program of these individuals who met specific eligibility requirements and passed security and medical screenings. Afghans were also evacuated to U.S. military bases and paroled into the United States through Operation Allies Welcome. Although different policy choices could have been made regarding the operational execution and processing of Afghans on overseas bases and in the United States, the screening and vetting procedures were rigorous to protect our national security.

At the outset of Operations Allies Welcome, community-based organizations– such as two in Virginia, one founded by veterans, volunteers, and neighbors called NovaRaft and another founded by Afghan-Americans whose families had arrived as refugees in the 1980s and 1990s called Fresh Start Refugee Assistance–stepped in to resettle newly arrived Afghans. They secured apartments, enrolled children in school, provided English and IT classes, helped obtain drivers licenses, and connected people with jobs. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, Jason Malloy, a U.S. military veteran who had worked closely with Afghan interpreters, began volunteering with the Afghan-American community in Omaha. He helped newly paroled Afghan evacuees with airport pickups, transportation to medical and DMV appointments, and school enrollment for their children. He remains in touch with many of the families he supported and describes them as among the hardest-working and most grateful people he has known. For him, and for the many thousands of our veterans, supporting Afghan allies is not an act of charity, but a continuation of service and a fulfillment of the United States’ moral obligation to those who stood with it.

Even so, tens of thousands of Afghan allies were left behind, either hiding across Afghanistan or stranded in precarious conditions in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan. Many Afghans fled in hopes of accessing parole, refugee or SIV pathways, but have since faced mistreatment, detention, and/or forcible return to the Taliban. The Trump administration has not only cut off access to refugee resettlement in the United States for Afghans abroad at risk of return to persecution, it has also stopped processing asylum applications by Afghans in the United States, begun detaining Afghan asylum seekers for deportation, and called for re-examination of resettled Afghan refugees. This betrays not only Afghan allies, but also the many Americans who generously welcomed them to communities across the country.

There are several stories of our Afghan allies now at risk, including from those below, using pseudonyms to protect their identity.

Hajera worked on a USAID-supported medical project that provided life-saving care to pregnant Afghan women. Massoud worked as an interpreter with U.S. military training programs for the Afghan National Army. Massoud, Hajera, and their three children were unable to board U.S. evacuation flights in August 2021. They remained in hiding in Kabul for several months and then moved to Mazar-e-Sharif, hoping it would be safer. They repeatedly sought evacuation options, but months passed without a viable pathway. Without any other option, they traveled first to Brazil, then to Mexico, and entered the United States through the CBP One process. They are now in the U.S. with a pending asylum case. Under the new policies, their case has been suspended.

Fatima was a police officer in Afghanistan. She escaped the Taliban with her elderly mother and sister. They made their way through the Darien Gap and eventually to Mexico, where for most of 2024 they waited for a CBP One appointment, first in Mexico City, and then, after being bussed southward by Mexican immigration authorities, in Villahermosa. Once they received their appointment, they flew to Tijuana, were screened and paroled for two years by CBP officers at the port of San Ysidro, joined their friends and relatives in Sacramento, and applied for asylum. Like all others who arrived via CBP One appointments, they received a notice sent en masse terminating their parole regardless of the specifics of their individual cases. Their immigration court hearing, which had been scheduled for a date in June, disappeared and has been listed as “pending” in the immigration court system ever since. Fatima wrote to Refugees International asking whether they would be detained when they go to their regular check-in with ICE.

These are just a few of the tens of thousands of Afghan allies who took extraordinary risks to support U.S. objectives and help rebuild their country. Fatima and Hajera are now at risk of being deported back to Afghanistan. This is unconscionable. It would return two women who supported U.S. objectives to a country where the state enforces gender apartheid through a tightening national system of bans and restrictions designed to remove women and girls from public life—blocking education, employment, movement without a male guardian, and participation in public spaces and civil society. For humanitarian actors, the result is an operating environment where women’s visibility and agency are treated as violations, and where the impact of donor withdrawal is magnified by deliberate repression. Across the country, the Trump administration is also arbitrarily detaining law-abiding Afghans who arrived in the United States more than a decade ago and have active asylum cases. These are parents, elderly, business owners, and community members, who are now deeply rooted in their neighborhoods, paid taxes, and call America home. These actions do not make our country safer. They are tearing families apart and punishing our Afghan allies using pretext that has no relationship to their cases nor respects their longstanding contributions.",https://d3jwam0i5codb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RI_Social_Share.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:58:04.371362

The State Department, which oversees visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, said it would indefinitely pause the issuance of immigrant visas requested by citizens of 75 countries, halting legal immigration channels for roughly 38% of all nations in the world.

Officials said the pause would apply to immigrant visas, meaning those requested by people abroad who have been sponsored by American relatives or employers to move to the U.S. permanently. The suspension, officials said, does not affect temporary visas requested by would-be tourists and travelers seeking to come to the U.S. on a short-term basis.

The State Department said the 75 countries were chosen as part of an effort to bar the entry of immigrants who were likely to rely on public assistance once in the U.S. Officials said they would examine immigration procedures during the pause to better identify and bar would-be immigrants from those countries who were likely to become a ""public charge"" — or an economic burden — on the U.S.

""The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,"" the department said Wednesday. ""The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.""

The State Department did not formally publish a full list of the 75 affected nations, but said Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea are among them. A list first reported by Fox News, and confirmed by the State Department to CBS News, includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Guatemala, Pakistan and Senegal.

The pause on immigrant visas is set to take effect next week, on Jan. 21, according to a U.S. official and a congressional official briefed on the move.

Longstanding federal law bars immigrants from coming to the U.S. or getting lawful permanent residency if they are deemed to become a public charge. Historically, the restriction has been applied in limited cases, such as when immigrants would require long-term institutionalized care in the U.S.

But dating back to President Trump's first administration, his aides have sought to dramatically expand who can be considered ineligible to immigrate to the U.S. on public charge grounds.

While the Trump administration has launched a highly-visible crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S., it has simultaneously issued a series of policies to sharply restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/08/64149989-78e0-4137-b90a-0dea76b5b1f3/thumbnail/1200x630/f4dd7ba3861e69c37135a32b676b6423/IAD-US-Evacs2L-Apr2020.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:04.700457

Surprising, I know. Why?

Obama was the last Democrat who, despite my disagreements with many of his ideas and policies − especially Obamacare, which I view as a failure − often made sense, particularly on immigration. In two terms, Barack ""Deporter-In-Chief"" Obama deported over 3.1 million immigrants via ICE. In fiscal year 2012, over 407,000 people were removed. He was even publicly scolded for doing home raids and told to stop.

Though this was a bit controversial, Democrats didn't seem to mind much. Republicans did criticize Obama for favoring amnesty, but these actions were necessary to maintain law, order, and our social contract.

This is different from what the Democratic Party espouses today. Rather than looking at the meltdown in Minnesota as an example to avoid, the Democratic Party seems to be doing the opposite. Progressive Democrats in both chambers are urging their party to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless it includes restrictions tied to ICE. Some prominent Democrats are even calling to abolish ICE after last week's deadly event.

This would be a huge mistake, but one that I'd suggest Democrats go ahead and make, especially if it's truly reflective of their values and beliefs. This way, Americans can truly see that they have become a party purposely defying the very social contract that keeps America's fabric stitched together. It will cost Democrats.

National spotlight is on the mess in Minnesota

My home state of Minnesota remains in the national spotlight after a flurry of events involving ICE, residents, and Minnesota lawmakers. On Jan. 14, a judge allowed ICE operations in Minnesota to continue despite the fact that state officials are suing the Trump administration over his immigration crackdown, something they say is an authoritarian reach of power by President Donald Trump.

Several prosecutors in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were resigning after they learned that the DOJ would not be opening an investigation into what happened during the shooting that led to Renee Nicole Good's death. For what it's worth, I think this is a mistake, not just for optics' sake but clarity.

Good's death sparked controversy and outrage over ICE's role in Minnesota and immigration issues at large. The mess in Minnesota has also demonstrated, probably, the single biggest difference between Republicans and Democrats right now.

Democrats want to upend our social contract

Minnesota's Democratic lawmakers, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who are outraged over ICE's very presence, have made this entire debacle much harder than it needs to be.

I understand that home raids, or ICE agents going door-to-door seems scary. ICE agents should strive to act in accordance with our laws. They should not behave like thugs. But they are in a difficult position: entering the U.S. illegally is already a crime. If Minnesota law enforcement apprehended more lawbreakers, there would be no need for ICE to participate in home raids or for ICE to swarm metro cities, arresting known rapists and drug traffickers.

Walz and Frey blame ICE's tactics for Minnesota's brewing civil unrest, but in reality, being soft on state and federal crime created the need for ICE to swoop in and enforce them.

I've been disappointed to see that since Obama's term ended in 2017 − perhaps as a reaction to Trump's presidency − the Democratic Party began viewing immigration, in particular, as laws that are optional and ICE as federal agents who aren't legitimate members of law enforcement. This seems to have encouraged former President Joe Biden to undo several Trump-era policies that helped secure the border, allowing a record number of migrants into the U.S. in 2023. ICE is now forced to rectify what Biden allowed.

Federal immigration laws are not just a cornerstone of America's sovereignty and well-being, but of most advanced countries. Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama believed this. The ideas of philosophers − Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau − reinforced this.

They are rooted in the idea that there is a delicate but vital social contract between citizens and governments: Individuals collectively give up some liberty and agree to obey laws to receive security, peace and order. Without this, there is chaos.

Democrats now seem to be openly advocating for the disruption of this social contract − even calling to defund or abolish ICE altogether.

Most Americans don't agree with or want this. Before the 2024 election, immigration was among the top concerns of most Americans.

The Trump administration could do its part better. They need not make this overtly political by trading jabs and smearing Democratic lawmakers. That riles everyone up more and is not a good example of leadership. But they must continue to systematically and methodically enforce immigration law, through ICE, and steer clear of actions, antics or optics that make it look like they are simply thugs hunting down innocent people for kicks.

Our social contract depends on this. Just ask Obama. Democrats upend this at their peril.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159938007-20260113-t-163347-z-1171368889-rc-2-f-0-jau-3-g-8-l-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpminnesota.JPG?crop=5494,3091,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-14 18:59:20.589586

This announcement follows Congresswoman McCollum’s Friday announcement(link is external) that she would support efforts to impeach Secretary Noem.

“Secretary Noem should be fired, but we know President Trump won’t do that. That’s why I support impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate for her obstruction of Congress and violation of the public trust,” said Congresswoman McCollum. “Over the past year, Americans in cities across the United States have felt the chaos and terror of Secretary Noem’s Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Secretary Noem has demonstrated that she is unable to enforce immigration law in a peaceful and ethical manner. Her deployment of unprofessional, poorly trained, masked immigration agents has put our neighbors in danger of physical harm. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go.”

The Constitution gives the U.S. House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Congresswoman McCollum is an original co-sponsor of Congresswoman Kelly’s three articles of impeachment:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants. Members of Congress have been denied entry into ICE facilities in Minnesota, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She’s also violated due process by directing ICE agents to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against U.S. citizens and lawful residents.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing, residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million in public funds to award an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the standard competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

The suspension would not apply to people seeking to enter the United States temporarily for tourism, business or medical treatment.
The Trump administration has taken various steps in recent months to tighten legal pathways for migrants.
The Trump administration has also intensely focused on Somalis in recent weeks, deploying roughly 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minnesota.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration also said it would end temporary deportation protections for more than 2,000 Somali migrants living in the United States.","The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would suspend the processing of immigrant visas for people from 75 countries, intensifying its efforts to curtail legal migration to the United States.

The State Department said in a social media post that the effort was meant to discourage immigration from countries “whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.” It did not provide a full list of the countries affected by the pause, but it confirmed that Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea would be included. It also did not specify the percentage of immigrants from those countries who use public assistance.

The announcement is part of the federal government’s crackdown on immigration, which has included efforts to upend legal pathways for migrants seeking to enter or stay in the United States. It also comes as the Trump administration conducts an immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota, the state with the largest population of Somalis in the United States.

Federal officials said that the pause would begin on Jan. 21 and would remain in place while the department reassesses its processing procedures. The suspension would not apply to people seeking to enter the United States temporarily for tourism, business or medical treatment.

“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement.

Mr. Pigott said the department would “use its longstanding authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge,” referring to people who rely on government benefits.

The Trump administration has taken various steps in recent months to tighten legal pathways for migrants. The administration has already imposed full or partial travel restrictions on citizens from 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, Somalia and Chad. Federal officials have said the travel ban was necessary to protect national security.

The administration has also taken measures that could make it more difficult for certain immigrants already living in the United States to remain in the country. In December, the Department of Homeland Security put on hold immigration applications from citizens of the countries subject to the president’s travel ban, pausing their efforts to obtain benefits such as U.S. citizenship and green cards.

The announcement on Wednesday is also a reprisal of the Trump administration’s focus on immigrants who depend on public assistance. During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration sought to deny green cards to immigrants who relied on public benefits such as food assistance and housing vouchers.

The Trump administration has also intensely focused on Somalis in recent weeks, deploying roughly 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minnesota. Federal officials said the move was meant to crack down on fraud and illegal immigration. On Tuesday, the Trump administration also said it would end temporary deportation protections for more than 2,000 Somali migrants living in the United States.

His administration’s focus on Minnesota came after revelations about a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the state in recent years.

No immediate judicial decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown

A judge made no immediate decision Wednesday on Minnesota's request to suspend the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in the head on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

""What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,"" state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case ""on the front burner"" and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

""It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,"" the judge said of the timetable, noting there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Government attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down.

""What we see right now is discrimination taking place only on the basis of race: Are you Latino or are you Somali? And then it is indiscriminate thereafter,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told Fox News. ""In other words, they are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets and you don't need to take my word for it at this point. This has been very well documented.""

Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.","Representative Seth Moulton Wednesday introduced a bill that would reverse a recent funding boost to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made through President Donald Trump’s signature budget reconciliation bill and reallocate the dollars to fund premium-lowering health care tax credits.

The bill comes after more than a dozen House Republicans broke from party leadership and sided with Democrats to pass an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that lapsed at the beginning of the new year. Negotiators in the U.S. Senate are now reportedly finalizing a compromise measure to revive the subsidies.

“We absolutely want to extend the ACA premiums tax credits, they shouldn’t be lapsing, but we’re funding it by taking money from ICE’s budget,” said Moulton in an interview, calling the Trump administration’s priorities “completely out of whack.”

“The One Big Beautiful Bill nearly triples ICE’s budget at a time when American families across the country are facing higher premiums due to the ACA premiums tax credit lapsing,” said Moulton referring to the Trump administration’s signature spending package that gave ICE $75 billion in funding through 2029.

The bill, Moulton said, would restore ICE funding to its previous annual level of $10 billion and repurpose the rest. Cosponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. André Carson on Indiana, Darren Soto of Florida and Sylvia Garcia of Texas.

Moulton’s bill also comes as public outrage grows over the recent killing of a woman by an ICE agent in Minnesota, and as Congress struggles to piece together spending measures ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline to avoid another shutdown. The shooting, according to multiple outlets, has threatened to destroy spending negotiations with some Democrats calling for a freeze on ICE funding even if it means another deadlock.

The latest shutdown lasted a record 43 days as Democrats refused to support a funding deal that allowed the health care subsidies to expire. Eventually, a portion of Democrats voted to support a GOP deal to reopen the government.

Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.

“What happened in Minnesota was an outright murder for anyone who can look at it with their own two eyes, and we should not be funding the continuation of ICE terrorizing American cities,” said Moulton.

The Trump administration has defended the shooting in the name of self defense.

“A lot of GOP colleagues are privately concerned about ICE,” Mouton said. “One approached me after the Minnesota shooting and said that as a former law enforcement official himself, he thinks it’s criminal what happened, but they won’t say any of this out loud because they’re too scared of Donald Trump.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/d21ab5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5248x2755+0+372/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2F5d%2F58190f000ec7699b087344d6112a%2Fap20043631430758.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:25.331150

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.
That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said.
“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd.

Bucks County Sheriff Danny Ceisler officially withdrew his office from a collaboration agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, citing public safety concerns and the need to reestablish trust between local law enforcement and the county’s more than 50,000 immigrant residents.

“When large numbers of our residents are afraid to call 911, or come to court and testify, that makes our entire community less safe,” Ceisler told a small crowd Wednesday in front of the Bucks County Justice Center. “This is not a public safety problem for immigrants. This is a public safety problem for everyone.”

Sheriff’s deputies are now prohibited from asking crime victims, witnesses and court observers about their immigration status per the order Ceisler signed this morning.

Former Sheriff Fred Harran signed the 287(g) agreement with ICE last spring, triggering widespread backlash and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania that argues Harran did not have the authority to enter into the agreement without the approval of county commissioners. In October, a judge upheld Harran’s authority and rejected a preliminary injunction order seeking to stay implementation of the program.

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.

That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said. “It allows them to stop anybody, detain anybody who they believe is in the country without current authorization.”

Harran argued that the sheriff’s office would only assist ICE in detaining people who have committed “serious” crimes.

Sixteen sheriff’s deputies underwent training to participate in the program, Ceiseler said, but Harran never fully implemented the collaboration.

Ceisler, a U.S. Army veteran, campaigned heavily on the issue in the 2025 elections, vowing to withdraw from the program. The Democrat won more than 55% of the vote to oust Harran, a Republican.

“This is what was on voters’ minds, and we won, and we won handily,” Ceisler said Wednesday.

Immigrant rights advocate and Bucks County resident Heidi Roux said the immigrant community is “breathing a collective sigh of relief.”

Because of the agreement, Roux said that some immigrant community members feared calling 911 or coming to the courthouse to pay a parking ticket.

“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd. “Violent criminals should absolutely be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their immigration status. I believe criminal activity can be addressed while simultaneously supporting the human rights and the dignity of all of our residents.”

Bucks is ‘not a so-called sanctuary county’

Ceisler said that the county “has not severed all ties with ICE, nor precluded future partnership with ICE when it comes to dangerous criminals.” The county “is not, has never been, and will never be a so-called sanctuary county,” he said.

“We will ensure that actual criminals, people involved in human trafficking, fentanyl distribution, child exploitation, violent crime and fraud and are in the country illegally are deported, which had been the standard practice in Bucks County for decades,” he said.

The county’s Department of Corrections shares data and fingerprints from anyone booked in the system via a database called LiveScan, Ceisler said, which is accessible to ICE and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies across the country. Bucks County correctional facilities continue to honor ICE judicial warrants, he said.

“After months of open dialogue with our local police chiefs and community leaders, they have affirmed that this is the right balance between protecting our community from crime and protecting our community from fear,” Ceisler said.

Ceisler condemned Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal’s remarks last week calling ICE “fake, wannabe law enforcement” as “counter-productive.” Bilal “blurred jurisdictional lines,” Ceisler said, and “stepped on the toes of [Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin] Bethel.”

“I understand that many people are angry and frustrated, but we all have our role and responsibility in this process, and as a law enforcement executive, what she did is not it,” he said.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ceisler-ice-agreement-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:29.669364

“Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://theoutlookonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:07.947378

Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.","The current and former agents spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record on behalf of the agency.

The DHS told TIME that Good had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.”

But videos of the incident contradict that account. They appear to show Ross positioned to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired three shots that killed her, with her wheels turned away from him.

Both the former agent and the current agent also questioned why Ross was assigned to this operation in the first place, given a previous injury involving a driver at the wheel of a vehicle just a few months before the confrontation with Good.

“That, to me, has red flags all over it,” the former ICE agent said.

“So when this person took off, I'm sure that prior incident came to mind, because he's an experienced officer. And then he just reacted, in my opinion, not in the correct way,” the former agent added.

Last Monday, the Trump administration deployed roughly 2,000 agents from ICE to the Twin Cities area amid a growing fraud scandal at day care centers run by Somali residents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media that the agents are there to conduct “ a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.”

The current ICE agent pointed out that while the pretense of the immigration operation in Minneapolis is to investigate welfare fraud, neither border patrol officers nor ICE agents in charge of deportation, also known as Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers, are trained to investigate financial fraud.

“You can't train someone to do all the basic law enforcement stuff, let alone the law. Immigration law used to be a five or six-month course at the academy. How do you know that people are here legally unless you know the law? You use Google?” the current ICE agent said.

The former ICE agent also said that this rushed training could lead to a domino effect as more senior ICE agents plan for retirement, and the new recruits, who didn’t have as much legal and enforcement training as previous generations, fill the gap.

Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.

“The biggest concern is jeopardizing your pension. And then, of course, violating the law. If you're ordered and you know that you're violating the law and you say no, then you stand a chance of being terminated. And then you jeopardize your pension,” the former agent said, adding that some officers are asked to work for 16-hour shifts six to seven days a week. “For most of us, it's not worth it.”

Even before Good’s shooting, public support for the agency has been dropping sharply. A YouGov poll conducted the same day as the shooting killing found that 52% of respondents now either somewhat or strongly disapproved of how ICE was handling its job, compared to 39% who somewhat or strongly approved. For the first time, more people now support abolishing the agency than oppose it.

Asked about the public’s biggest misconception about ICE, both the current and former agent said that ICE, like all government agencies, is at the mercy of the Administration.

“Where was all this energy when the election was happening? Everyone knew this was what the Administration was going to do,” the agent said, adding that for the most part, the agents conducting deportations and arrests are not breaking the law.

“You're putting people in a position where they have to quit and try to find work in a really bad job market. So they justify themselves, and they say, hey, it's legal, and as long as I'm not violating rights or doing something immoral or illegal, I'm going to do it because this is what the American voters voted for.”",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254678149.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 15:59:10.105506

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – who they describe as people who may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

The state department wrote on social media that it “will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates”.

The Guardian obtained a state department cable with the full list of countries affected.

“The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,” the statement continued. “We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused.”

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has intensified to record levels, even as nationwide protests over the killing of Renee Good have drawn attention to law enforcement practices. The state department says it revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office, while the homeland security department reported last month that more than 605,000 people have been deported, while an additional 2.5 million left the country on their own.

The administration has particularly focused on Somali Americans following fraud allegations and federal investigations in Minnesota. Trump referred to the Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar as “garbage” during a cabinet meeting last month and said he did not want Somalis in the US and they should “go back to where they came from”.

The pause follows Trump’s December expansion of travel bans to 39 countries, suspension of asylum processing, and halting of citizenship and green card applications for citizens of countries already subject to restrictions.

Research contradicts administration claims about immigrant welfare use. In February 2025, the libertarian Cato Institute published a paper showing that native-born Americans consumed, on an average per capita basis, more welfare and entitlement benefits than all immigrants. The study found immigrants consumed 21% fewer welfare and entitlement benefits than native-born Americans on a per capita basis in 2022.

Migration policy experts also warned the move will have far-reaching consequences beyond those directly affected by visa denials.

“The likely result will be that many immigrant families will be afraid to access any public benefits for which a household member is eligible, forgoing supports in times of need to preserve future immigration prospects,” Julia Gelatt, associate director of the US immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an analysis posted on Wednesday.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ba42c16b4c0adaa21271947f5936cb3231c20f/387_0_4409_3526/master/4409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7e530d704caf8e6c48bb58af15eac95",N,,2026-01-14 15:58:57.936413

The safety alert from the State Department comes days after the United States bombed military installations in Caracas and snatched Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
The State Department issued its advisory for Americans.
But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension.
The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.","The Trump administration is publishing contrasting information about on-the-ground conditions in Venezuela, raising questions about how different agencies are making policy decisions towards Venezuela and its nationals in the U.S., as well as American travelers.

The Department of Homeland Security, when ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in February 2025, said that while some conditions for the deportation protections continue, there have been “notable improvements” in sectors like the economy, public health and crime. That made it possible for Venezuelans “to be safely returned.”

But in a recent security alert on Jan. 10, the State Department urged any Americans to depart Venezuela immediately. It emphasized reports that pro-regime groups were stopping people for evidence of U.S. citizenship or U.S. support and highlighted the risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, kidnapping, crime, poor health infrastructure and civil unrest.

The safety alert from the State Department comes days after the United States bombed military installations in Caracas and snatched Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. It also comes as uncertainty around Venezuela’s political future has renewed calls in the U.S. to restore TPS for the over half-a-million Venezuelans residing in the U.S. who lost the protections.

The United States has said since 2019 that U.S. citizens should not visit Venezuela for any reason, and its embassy in Caracas suspended diplomatic operations and consular services that same year.

Both the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department told the Miami Herald that the descriptions of Venezuela agency communications and documents about conditions in Venezuela are not inconsistent with each other.

“The State Department’s travel messaging is for American citizens and is written with their safety in mind. Noting that it may be safe for Venezuelans, does not mean it is safe for Americans,” spokespersons for both agencies in separate statements.

A spokesperson for the State Department said that “the Trump administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.” Meanwhile, Tricia McLaughlin at DHS said “there is no discrepancy here. The State Department issued its advisory for Americans. You seem to be under the impression that the United States is here to serve foreigners and act as a forever haven for gang members, rapists, drug dealers and narco terrorists.”

The State Department’s “Do not travel” advisory, reissued Dec. 3 without changes, says that violent crimes like armed robbery and homicides are common; that the government is engaged in a brutal crackdown against opposition groups; that shortages of basic supplies like gasoline, electricity, and water are commonplace throughout much of the country; and that access to medical care is limited and that facilities may not have basic medications available.

“You cannot warn Americans not to travel to Venezuela because of extreme risk, persecution and danger, while simultaneously telling Venezuelans in the United States that they can safely return because the country is now safe for them. That contradiction is not just policy inconsistency, it is a failure of common sense, humanitarian responsibility and due process,” said Adelys Ferro, the director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus.

Independent groups like Human Rights Watch say the Venezuelan government intimidates human rights advocates, arrests and detains protesters and harasses journalists. There are also armed gangs in border states that control daily life and pro-regime groups that intimidate opposition candidates, according to the watchdog organization.

Nearly 8 million people have fled Venezuela in the past decade In the last days of the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela another year and a half, citing the “severe humanitarian emergency.” About 5.1 million Venezuelans live with hunger and 53% of the population in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations.

But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension. It noted the “notable improvements” in certain conditions that allowed for a safe return and warranted the end of TPS. The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.

“Temporary Protected Status is meant to be just that: temporary. President Trump is bringing stability to Venezuela and bringing to justice an illegitimate Narco Terrorist dictator who stole from his own people. Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love,” said McLaughlin.

Human Rights First, which tracks Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals, said in a Jan. 9 report that the Trump administration has not sent any deportation flights to Venezuela since Dec. 10. Last month, the Venezuelan government announced that the federal government had unilaterally suspended its twice-weekly deportations amid escalating tensions.

It remains to be seen how ongoing negotiations following Maduro’s capture will impact future deportations.

In a recent letter, U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Darren Soto of Florida, along with Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, asked the Trump administration to bring back TPS for Venezuela in the wake of Maduro’s capture, which has left his former vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, as interim president.

“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the lawmakers wrote. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/kqlgmm/picture314147088/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GettyImages-2253875369.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:33.995116

""The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,"" Tommy Pigott, Principal Deputy Spokesperson at the State Department said.

""Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,"" he added.

The move was first reported by Fox News.

Trump has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown since returning to office in January. His administration has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and sparking violent confrontations with both migrants and U.S. citizens.

While he campaigned on stopping illegal immigration into the United States, his administration has made legal immigration more difficult, for example, by imposing new and expensive fees on the applicants of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.

""This administration has proven itself to have the most anti-legal immigration agenda in American history,"" David Bier, Cato’s Director of Immigration Studies and The Selz Foundation Chair in Immigration Policy, said in a statement.

""This action will ban nearly half of all legal immigrants to the United States, turning away about 315,000 legal immigrants over the next year alone,"" Bier said.

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

The State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump took office, it said on Monday. The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.

In November, Trump had vowed to ""permanently pause"" migration from all ""Third World Countries"" following a shooting near the White House by an Afghan national that killed a National Guard member.

The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.

""Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.""

President Donald Trump's administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

The November guidance on which Wednesday's decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S.

While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn't be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.

Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations.

The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants' English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.

Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already tightening those rules.

Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will die.” As many as 2,800 grantees through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa) received a letter immediately ending their funding – about 26% of Samhsa’s entire budget.
Many of these programs are on the frontlines of mental health and substance use, functioning as the first point of contact for people who need care.
“Overnight, our entire backbone and infrastructure of addiction and mental health in this country flipped up on its head,” Hampton said.
The administration’s goals include “innovative programs and interventions” to reduce mental illness, substance use, overdoses and suicide, the letter said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday evening unexpectedly canceled up to $1.9bn in funding for substance use and mental health care, which providers say will immediately affect thousands of patients.

“It feels like Armageddon for everyone who’s on the frontlines of the addiction and mental health space,” said Ryan Hampton, founder of Mobilize Recovery, a national advocacy organization for people in and seeking recovery.

“The scope of care that’s disrupted by these grants is catastrophic. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will die.”

As many as 2,800 grantees through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa) received a letter immediately ending their funding – about 26% of Samhsa’s entire budget.

Staff at Samhsa were not consulted on the cuts or even told they were happening, according to two sources familiar with the cuts who asked for anonymity to speak about sensitive matters. The agency also endured massive cuts throughout 2025.

Providers woke up this morning to learn they would need to lay off staff and end programs immediately, Hampton said. Many of these programs are on the frontlines of mental health and substance use, functioning as the first point of contact for people who need care.

“These are programs that save lives, so the impact could be really devastating,” said Regina LaBelle, former acting director of the Biden White House office of national drug control policy and professor at Georgetown University.

“It really covers the spectrum of prevention, treatment and recovery services, both on substance use and mental health,” said Yngvild Olsen, who until last July served as the director for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at Samhsa and is now a national adviser at Manatt Health.

The cuts will affect overdose-prevention work, naloxone distribution and use by first responders, mental health and substance use support within schools, support for pregnant and postpartum women who receive assistance for substance use disorder, underage drinking prevention and recovery support programs – all cut without warning.

“Overnight, our entire backbone and infrastructure of addiction and mental health in this country flipped up on its head,” Hampton said. “These grants are lifesaving tools that honestly are a good reason why we have started to see a reversal in trends of drug overdoses in this country.”

Overdoses soared over the past two decades, but in recent years they began falling. In 2024, the US overdose rate dropped by 27%. Now, with these abrupt cuts, “a lot of lives are going to be lost”, Hampton said. “A lot of harm is happening in real time this morning.”

The cuts “came as a surprise, given all the changes that grantees had already made in response to executive orders and Samhsa guidance”, Olsen said. “This potentially could have an unbelievably disruptive impact on people’s access to services. It could mean really thousands of people losing access to the treatment.”

The funding was appropriated by Congress to Samhsa, which then disburses funding to organizations around the country. Congress does not appear to have been involved in the cancellations. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating funding, and these cuts seem to be politically motivated, said LaBelle, who added: “We didn’t know that the administration would just basically use their regulatory authority to pull the plug.”

The awards were terminated because they no longer aligned with the Trump administration’s priorities, according to a letter to grantees from Christopher Carroll, the deputy assistant secretary at Samhsa, obtained by the Guardian. The administration’s goals include “innovative programs and interventions” to reduce mental illness, substance use, overdoses and suicide, the letter said.

“You can’t tell me that naloxone distribution, providing mental health support in schools, providing outreach to get people into treatment who are unhoused, providing drug court services, that these are not in line with administration priorities. They are 100% in line with administration priorities, as stated by the administration as recently as two or three months ago,” Hampton said.

“All of us are in a state of complete and utter shock that the administration would take such a reckless action.”

The cuts are for nearly all discretionary funds, which account for nearly $2bn of Samhsa’s budget. The grants that were not affected include the state opioid response block grants, the certified community behavioral clinics program, and the 988 hotline.

Samhsa did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s inquiry about whether staff were consulted or informed of these changes and how they would affect care.

The cuts were made under the same rule as previous health agency layoffs and cutbacks, which were successfully challenged in court.

“My hope is that this will go to court and the courts will stop it,” Hampton said. But “the harm is happening in real time right now, and as this gets sorted out in the courts, people will die. People will die.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489573a411a21951fbaac3e40c36ceb70f5b6c19/900_7_4135_3307/master/4135.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61c2e8a7b5c971076dd6d0bc1dd2650b",N,,2026-01-14 16:58:26.255033

But many election law experts had warned that a decision in the congressman’s favor in Wednesday’s case could clear the way for a host of lawsuits challenging all kinds of election rules in states throughout the country, particularly from Republicans who have advanced a narrative that some state rules, especially involving mail-in ballots, unfairly favor Democrats.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the Constitution required a legal challenger to have a “personal stake” in a case in order to sue. And indeed, the chief justice found that Representative Mike Bost, the Illinois Republican who challenged his state’s election rules, clearly had that kind of stake in the outcome. Mr. Bost argued that his campaign would incur extra costs to monitor the counting of late-arriving ballots.

“He is a candidate for office,” the chief justice wrote. “And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.”

The case is one of several lawsuits brought by allies of President Trump challenging rules around mail-in ballots after his 2020 election loss. Mr. Trump has long falsely blamed fraud resulting from the increased use of mail-in ballots during the pandemic in part for his loss.

The court’s other conservatives joined the chief justice in the outcome, although Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, wrote separately to say they would have found for Mr. Bost for slightly different reasons. The court’s other two liberals, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.

Chief Justice Roberts analogized the congressional elections to a 100-meter dash. He wrote that each runner would suffer if the race were “unexpectedly extended to 105 meters.” In much the same way, he wrote, “an unlawful extension of vote counting,” if one took place, would deprive candidates “of the opportunity to compete for election.”

Justices Barrett and Kagan said Mr. Bost had standing to sue because he had shown he suffered a financial injury, not because he was a political candidate.

Justice Barrett, in her concurrence, wrote that Mr. Bost had “suffered a traditional pocketbook injury” because of his increased campaign costs to monitor the ballots received after Election Day.

In her dissent, Justice Jackson said the majority had incorrectly carved out “a bespoke rule” for political candidates in a decision that “now complicates and destabilizes” the court’s standing rules and “America’s electoral processes.”

In a statement, Mr. Bost said he was thankful the court had ruled in his favor, a decision he called “a critically important step forward in the fight for election integrity and fair elections.”

A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. (As a result of the ruling, Mr. Bost’s lawsuit can now proceed in lower courts.)

The case is one of a number related to elections pending before the justices. In October, they heard arguments in a dispute over Louisiana’s congressional district map. That case, Louisiana v. Callais, began as a traditional fight over whether the map was an illegal racial gerrymander, but the justices significantly broadened the question last summer to include an evaluation of what role race can play in drawing electoral maps. That move called into question whether the Supreme Court would gut the Voting Rights Act, a landmark law from the civil rights era.

In the Mississippi case that will be heard later this term, Watson v. Republican National Committee, the committee, along with the state’s Republican Party and some individual voters, sued in 2024 over the state’s rules for mail-in ballots. They argued that allowing mail-in ballots to arrive after Election Day and still be counted ran counter to Congress’s intent.

The case will test the meaning of “Election Day.” Mississippi has defended its laws, asserting that Congress set a date for voters to decide, not a date for the ballots to arrive.

The justices have not announced a date for oral arguments in the case, but a decision upending Mississippi’s rules could affect dozens of other states, throwing election rules into chaos before the midterms.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14dc-scotus-ballots-gcjl/14dc-scotus-ballots-gcjl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:45.065336

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/kristinoemmay82025.jpg?h=616f4463&itok=3bzKipV5,N,,2026-01-14 14:57:53.840429

It also lowered the standard of review for those determinations.

“The law allows members of Congress to conduct unannounced visits to ICE facilities whenever we want, no advanced notice or permission needed,” Jayapal said in a statement to The Seattle Times.","WASHINGTON — A new Homeland Security policy requires Washington’s members of Congress to provide seven days’ notice before visiting the immigrant detention center in Tacoma, drawing concerns from state lawmakers and advocates who say the move undercuts oversight of the increasingly crowded facility.

“One thing is clear — this administration doesn’t want us to know what goes on inside these facilities,” Rep. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “Accountability is not optional.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued the rule late last week, a day after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis. The incident sparked nationwide outrage and calls — including by Randall — to impeach Noem.

Citing violence against ICE facilities, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that all requests by members of Congress to enter ICE detention facilities must be made “at least seven days in advance.”

“This was done in order to ensure the safety of staff, law enforcement, visitors and detainees alike,” McLaughlin said.

The privately run Northwest ICE Processing Center is one of the largest detention centers nationwide, with 1,575 beds. Advocates have decried the conditions for years, and government agencies and human rights groups have published wide-ranging concerns. It’s among various detention centers across the country that Democratic members of Congress have descended on for spontaneous oversight visits in the last year as the Trump administration ramped up immigration detentions and raids.

In April, Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was charged with two counts of assault after trying to block the arrest of Newark’s mayor during a tour of the city’s detention facility. Randall said the Tacoma facility denied her entry in August, and over the weekend, Minnesota Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to a detention center in Minneapolis.

Randall visited the Tacoma facility three days before Homeland Security published the new rule. “I heard again and again from detainees that they’re being denied proper medical care, and conditions continue to worsen,” Randall said.

It’s the federal agency’s second attempt at such a policy: A federal judge last month rejected a similar rule by Noem, stating that federal spending laws require unrestricted congressional visits to ICE detention facilities. Noem sidestepped the decision by leaning on a funding technicality: the judge said that funding derived from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is exempt from the limitation.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, who last visited the Tacoma facility in May, characterized the move as an attempt by the administration to hide the center’s poor conditions.

“The law allows members of Congress to conduct unannounced visits to ICE facilities whenever we want, no advanced notice or permission needed,” Jayapal said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “We are the authorizing and funding branch of government, and it is absolutely outrageous that DHS is trying yet again to prevent members from conducting our oversight responsibility.”

Jayapal, who is ranking member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, will host a field hearing Friday with Omar in St. Paul, Minn., to review actions by the Trump administration and ICE in Minneapolis and hear from witnesses.

Josefina Mora-Cheung, director of organizing at immigrant advocacy group La Resistencia NW, said she worries about the conditions that detained immigrants are facing, and that they may be aggravated without proper oversight.

“It’s funny that they would say it’s for the safety of people in detention” Mora-Cheung said. “It’s not about safety.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01132026_2_110003.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:00.546352

With whistles and chants, cowbells and clanging pots, demonstrators gathered Tuesday night outside the Hyatt Regency Morristown to loudly protest the weekend’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions.

A Morristown High School senior, Juan Daniel Mendoza, was among several individuals rounded up Sunday morning near a Speedwell Avenue laundromat.

“I hear there are people saying that he is 19, that he’s in a gang back in Honduras, and that’s just not true. He’s a school student. He’s 17. He’s just trying to get an education,” said MHS freshman Zoe Lopez.

The Morris County Sheriff’s Office backed up Morristown cops, who estimated the crowd at 300. It was boisterous yet peaceful; officers occasionally reminded participants to be careful about keeping clear of traffic.

Some motorists honked in solidarity with people chanting “ICE out of Morristown” or waving flags from Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia. A couple of upside-down U.S. flags symbolized a nation in distress under President Trump’s immigration policies.

Video by Andrew Dutton and Kevin Coughlin for MorristownGreen.com:

Other demonstrators bore signs remembering Renee Nicole Good, an activist shot in Minneapolis last week by an ICE officer who claimed it was self-defense.

“People are getting killed, people are getting hurt, and people are getting taken. And we … don’t know what happened to them…that’s the issue, the lawlessness and the lack of accountability and the cruelty,” said recent MHS grad Miles Gorman.

“They are behaving lawlessly and cruelly, and nobody wants them here,” a woman named Liz said of ICE, over her cacophonous cowbell.

‘NOT A DREAM PLACE ANYMORE’

The throng included at least one Congressional candidate.

“I’m out here because this is home… we want to show that New Jersey stands with its neighbors, its friends and its family, and that ICE is not welcome here,” said Zach Beecher of Morristown, running for Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s former 11th District seat. Congress should fix the immigration system, he said, instead of funding “punitive, targeted raids that are based on politics and not on policy.”

Further down the sidewalk, Alexis Lake of Sussex and her friend Jackie Malone of Madison craned for a better view.

“Morristown runs on immigrants,” Lake said. “We have immigrants everywhere. They are our family, our friends, our co-workers, and it’s not right what’s happening right now.”

Lake is against open borders. “But for people that are here that are working that haven’t committed a crime, there’s no reason that they should be taken off the streets in the ways that we are seeing,” she said.

“My kids grew up here, they went to school here,” explained Morristown resident Dave Olander. “They enjoyed the diversity, and they are part of the community. I anticipated something like…this raid that happened over the weekend. And this just can’t happen.”

TAKING A STAND

Madeline Nelson, 34, emigrated from Haiti as a teen and is grateful for opportunities that enabled her to become a nurse practitioner.

“I just think that this is a time for people to take a stand,” Nelson said.

“I’m an immigrant, and I love this country. America is a great country. Wherever you are in the world, you dream of America. That was the past. I feel like now, people don’t think of America as a place to come anymore. It’s not a dream place anymore.”

Joel Tapia, 25, handed out more than 200 whistles, for blowing warnings when ICE is in the neighborhood. He was born in Denville, but his parents hail from Uruguay.

“I’m here because we have to remember that at the end of the day, if we don’t stand for something, we will fall for everything,” Tapia said. “The only thing that’s really a threat is the chaos that (ICE is) creating.”

Twenty-eight-year-old Keyri Escobar of Morristown organized the protest; she heard rumors that ICE agents were bunking at the Hyatt.

Escobar’s parents survived a perilous journey from El Salvador to the U.S. “I started this because I myself, and my parents, are immigrants. My parents have been here since 1995, working their ass off, paying taxes, giving me a better life.”

Haverford Township commissioners have voted Monday night to restrict the police department from aiding United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on noncriminal federal immigration policies.

Following last week’s fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, Commissioner Laura Cavender sponsored the resolution for the meeting on Monday night.

Cavender said the resolution speaks to the township’s values, affirms the police department practices, and draws an important boundary in that immigration policy should not be pushed onto local officers.

In July, Radnor Township passed a similar resolution that states the municipality will not enter into any 287G agreement, which would allow ICE officers to partner with municipal law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.

The wording at the agency website is “allows your law enforcement agency to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law.”

According to U.S. census records, about 7 percent of the township, whose median household income is $127,000, is foreign born. Officials did not have an estimate on any number of illegal residents in the township.

A full house was on hand for the spirited discussion as residents and commissioners alike had a chance to present their views.

One resident said from a fiscal position signing a 287G agreement would cost the township financially with local police responsible for personnel expenses used in carrying out any mission while the officers were under ICE supervision.

“I don’t understand why we would imagine that entering into a 287G agreement would benefit us given that our property taxes go to pay for our public safety … ICE’s budget … has more than tripled. It’s now up to $27.5 billion annually, that’s more than all of the federal law enforcement agencies combined,” the resident said. “It is sufficiently funded.

Another speaker said the Minneapolis incident offers a teachable moment.

“In a situation involving law enforcement, even if concerned about actions of law enforcement, do not get directly involved, especially if you are operating a vehicle which is capable of becoming a weapon, keep your distance. If an officer tells you to do something, comply with what they ask,” he said.

Another man, who said he is a former police officer, opposed the resolution on the ground that, in his opinion, it puts residents, law enforcement and the future of the community at risk.

“Cooperating with ICE stops the engagement at street level,” he said. “It puts the engagements exactly where they belong, in detention centers.”

He went on to say reports that “jack booted” ICE agents ripping babies from their mothers and sending them back is not what is happening. That brought a groan from the audience, which consisted mostly of supporters of the resolution.

President Judy Trombetta quieted the crowd to allow the man to speak.

He finished repeating his oath when he became a police officer to uphold the constitution: “to protect the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.” He added, “And we have to protect this country from both foreign and domestic intrusion.”

One of the next speakers had a differing view.

“Clearly, ICE has overstepped,” she said.

She said what she sees is armed militia’s patrolling streets, dragging people from their cars and day care centers who are “on the hunt for people who are not breaking laws, and are only here to try to forge a better life for themselves and their families.”

She also noted the Boston Massacre was spurred when a militia was brought in to patrol the streets.

“We don’t like it. We haven’t liked it since the beginning of the Revolution,” she said in support of the resolution.

One resident asked if information from license plate readers is shared to track immigrants. Police Chief John Viola said to his knowledge that is not the case.

A woman said it is criminal to be here illegally, and she is worried that some undocumented immigrants who might be here, even if it is 1 percent, want to hurt us badly. She said police should support federal officers.

A woman speaking for the Havertown Community action group spoke strongly in support of the resolution.

“We have watched in horror as masked ICE agents have increasingly relied on violence, which has turned deadly as in the case of Renee Nicole Good,” she said. “Aggressive and unlawful ICE actions make our communities far less safe.”

One longtime resident said an illegal immigrant raped her 13-year-old niece. She said police had no facts on the man and the judge gave him a second chance and he then went on to impregnate three other women.

“I approve of ICE coming to Havertown … don’t we want to know who might want to hurt and kill our children … Dammit, we need to know who else is here, who has a criminal background,” she said.

She added the proclamation before the board is “laughable” and “come legally, become a citizen and do good.”

Haverford School Board member Chris Shelton reminded commissioners that in 2018 the school district adopted a resolution to welcome all students, regardless of immigration status.

“If the police department were to enter into any agreement with ICE, that would present where we could have students become at risk … I would ask the board to support the resolution in lines with the goals of the district,” he said.

‘Grandstanding’

One speaker who said he was a lawyer, compared the resolution to performance art, and in his opinion what has gone on to this point is legal.

He also asked if they have considered costs to the township could incur if the federal government decides to withhold funding or file suit against the township.

After reading on immigration law, another woman called the resolution “grandstanding” on the emotions of what has happened in Minnesota saying the law already exists.

Following the public time, Commissioner Larry Holmes said the Constitution protects everyone in the country, not just citizens. Holmes said he doesn’t want the township police department’s reputation to be hurt by the “reckless and criminal activity of ICE.”

Commissioner Brian Gondek said 287G actually consists of multiple programs.

He said he doesn’t like political theater and the topic creates a lot of hostility, which results in confusion. He said in reviewing the language of the resolution it would add to that confusion, adding to the combustion of the topic.

Gondek added ICE could still come into the town at any time and there is nothing the municipality can do.

Cavender said the feds don’t need local assistance.

“ICE does not need the assistance of our local government and they have been encouraging local municipalities to partner,” Cavander said, with that number growing by 600 percent.

Commissioner Kevin McCloskey said no one wants to see a 37-year-old mother get shot.

“None of us should want armed militia in the streets shooting us citizens at any point,” McCloskey said. “No disagreement, or blowing a whistle, or saying I don’t agree with what you are doing should ever lead to someone being shot by a trained officer of the federal government … it really shouldn’t be that complicated

Holmes said ICE has ignored laws and any benefit of the doubt they are entitled to “has been flushed down the toilet.”

Trombetta said she sees the resolution as a proactive measure so police are never put into an impossible situation between supporting federal requests and protecting all residents of the community.

She said the resolution makes clear police will enforce all criminal law but they will not be used as agents of federal civil immigration enforcement unless there is a judicial warrant signed by a judge. She said it protects civil liberties, protects safety and gives police officers clear direction.

“We are not refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement on criminal matters, we are not creating a sanctuary,” Trombeta said.

Gondek asked for an amendment on the wording, to include federal law, which was agreed to.

The motion passed 7-2 with commissioners Gondek and Michael McCollum voting against.",https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DTD-L-HAVERFORD-11020-1.jpg?w=1024&h=778,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:17.676595

Cellphone videos of the encounter have prompted a mix of reactions from officials and lawmakers.

Federal officials have said that when Good pulled forward in her vehicle toward the ICE officer, he acted in self-defense and described the driver’s actions as ""an act of domestic terrorism."" Authorities have also said that Good had been following and harassing federal officers earlier that day.

The Illinois law allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to two weeks later. More than a dozen states, as well as the District of Columbia, accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday.
Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.
They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities.
House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House.","The Democratic representative Robin Kelly on Wednesday formally introduced articles of impeachment against Donald Trump’s homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, following the fatal shooting of a US citizen by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions”.

The new push comes amid mounting national outrage over the death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, killed at the wheel of her car on a residential street by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer during high-octane deployments of law enforcement in cities and towns across the country.

Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.

While Noem and the Trump administration have characterized the incident as an act of “domestic terrorism” by a “professional agitator”, video evidence and local officials have sharply contested that narrative. The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, described the shooting as a reckless use of power and demanded the agency leave the city. The administration has responded by sending more federal agents, as tensions between officers and residents escalate.

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” said a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. “We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”

In response, Kelly said of Noem: “You have violated your oath of office and there will be consequences.”

Late last year, the representative Delia Ramirez, a fellow Illinois Democrat, moved to impeach Noem, amid an immigration crackdown in Chicago.

They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities. It further alleges a violation of public trust through the use of “warrantless arrests” and the use of “violence against US citizens and lawful individuals”. It also charges Noem with self-dealing for “inappropriately” using taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment, and awarding the $200m recruitment contract to a firm run by the husband of the senior DHS official and chief spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin.

Despite rising fury among Democrats over the administration’s increasingly violent enforcement tactics, the party is at odds over how to respond. House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House. Other Democrats have called for using an upcoming government funding deadline to try to rein in ICE and slash funding to the agency. Kelly, who is running in a competitive Democratic primary to replace retiring Senator Dick Durbin in Illinois, has positioned herself more aggressively on the issue than leadership.

“We haven’t ruled anything in and we haven’t ruled anything out. Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, told reporters on Monday. Noem, Jeffries added, was “completely and totally unqualified” and should be “run out of town as soon as possible” but he questioned whether impeachment was “the best way to accomplish that objective”.

In 2024, House Republicans impeached Joe Biden’s secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, breaking precedent and pushing through charges that even some in their own party warned were political in nature. The Senate dismissed the charges on the basis that they did not”allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor”.

Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House to approve the charges, and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2dc5d994c2f52bb659f3f04425bc7b14b600d1/417_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65781cb03df0f40dcc45105b93fdfe5a",N,,2026-01-14 14:57:58.246891

The hearing follows the resignation of at least half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota amid pressure from the Trump administration on how to conduct an investigation into the deadly shooting of a woman by an ICE agent last week, a source said.

The killing of Renee Good, a US citizen and mother of three, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis as the Trump administration said it was deploying around 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection personnel to the region.

Here are the key things to know:

Lawsuit: The Wednesday court hearing involves the Minnesota lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, which is seeking a court order halting immigration enforcement operations. The lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action and says the Twin Cities are being targeted because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the federal government during immigration enforcement efforts. In response to the lawsuit, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Constitution was on the administration’s side and the surge of federal officers was needed because politicians in Illinois and Minnesota were not protecting their citizens.

Prosecutors resign: The senior career prosecutors who stepped down reportedly objected to pressure from the White House to shift the investigation into Good’s shooting away from the agent’s use of force and toward Good, her widow, and others connected to immigration protests. Joseph Thompson, who frequently handled investigations with political implications including one into social services fraud, was among those who resigned. Read more about who some of the other prosecutors were here.

No civil rights investigation: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department does not believe there is evidence to back a criminal civil rights investigation into the actions of the ICE agent who shot Good. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized the move. An FBI investigation of the shooting is ongoing, though local authorities have been blocked from joining the probe.

More federal agents: US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino said “hundreds and hundreds” of additional federal agents are being deployed to Minneapolis. The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, according to two federal law enforcement sources. This comes on top of the deployment of about 2,000 agents to the area that CNN reportedearlier.

White House reaction: Trump on Tuesday defended ICE agents operating in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” and warning online that a “day of reckoning and retribution is coming,” as the administration sends more federal agents to Minneapolis.

Federal funding: During a speech Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced the federal government will not make “any payments” to sanctuary cities or states with sanctuary cities starting February 1. A judge blocked the administration from denying funding to over 30 cities last year for policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Protests: A few blocks away from where Renee Good was killed federal officers clashed with protesters Tuesday. Agents smashed one woman’s car window and pulled her out of the vehicle, video showed. In the Powderhorn neighborhood in Minneapolis, federal agents dispersed pepper balls and flash bangs amid the protests. Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, protesters chanted, waved signs and flags, and confronted federal agents parked at the gate, at times stepping into the street to try to block vehicles they believed were carrying ICE officers.

Somali community targeted: The Trump administration sharpened it’s focus on Minneapolis after allegations of widespread fraud at Somali-run child care centers in the area were raised in a video posted by a conservative YouTuber last month, with little evidence. On Tuesday, DHS said it will terminate humanitarian relief for Somali nationals living in the US, arguing conditions in Somalia no longer justify those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, drew swift backlash from Minnesota leaders, who said they were not consulted and warn the decision, combined with the president’s escalating rhetoric and stepped‑up enforcement is fueling fear in the Somali community and could affect people with legal status and no criminal records.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26014061838437-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 12:58:29.503774

At least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota have quit.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

The six have one big reason - Justice Department officials pressured them to twist the investigation of a shooting in Minneapolis. Rather than focus on the federal agent who shot Renee Macklin Good in the head, political leaders wanted an investigation to find dirt on Good's widow. The resignations have disrupted other federal probes, such as an investigation of Social Service fraud the Trump administration says it cares about.

MARTÍNEZ: Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic has been covering both the fraud cases and the shooting death. Matt, why did the six attorneys resign?

MATT SEPIC, BYLINE: The attorneys aren't speaking publicly, but there are several reasons, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. That person asked that we use their name because they're not authorized to talk to the media. One of those reasons is tied to last week's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Trump administration officials say the agent fired in self-defense, but many state and local officials are pointing to video taken from multiple angles that contradicts claims that Good posed any threat.

The person with knowledge of the situation I spoke with says there's pressure from DOJ leaders to investigate Good's widow, Becca Good, for ties to activist groups, which is not illegal. The group also objects to the DOJ's reluctance to investigate Agent Ross and to exclude state police from the investigation. And the same source tells me that the veteran prosecutors are concerned that Trump's focus on immigration has drawn resources away from the fraud investigations.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. You mentioned they're veteran prosecutors - been around a while. What's significant about their decision?

SEPIC: Well, it's a loss of big talent. The attorneys spent their careers with the Justice Department and prosecuted many major cases. One of them is Melinda Williams, an assistant U.S. attorney who led the criminal division here. Another is Joe Thompson. He's been key in the government's prosecution of fraud, particularly the infamous Feeding Our Future case. Thompson charged 78 people with stealing around $300 million from federal child nutrition programs during the pandemic. Fifty-eight have been convicted. Investigators also uncovered massive Medicaid fraud. Last month, Thompson estimated that around $9 billion may have been stolen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOE THOMPSON: Taxpayers deserve to know the truth of the fraud. The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated.

SEPIC: The convicted food fraud ring leader is white, but nearly all of the other defendants are Somali American. Even though the majority are U.S. citizens, President Trump is using the fraud as a pretext for his immigration crackdown.

MARTÍNEZ: I would imagine leaders in Minnesota have a lot to say about these resignations.

SEPIC: Yeah, they do. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, is calling the prosecutors heroes. In a statement, he adds, quote, ""the people pushing to prosecute Renee's widow are monsters."" And U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democrat and a former prosecutor herself, says DOJ is politicizing the investigation into Good's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

AMY KLOBUCHAR: The first way they did it was cutting out the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That was such a bad sign that there was more bad to come because our Minnesota bureau has seasoned professionals. They've always worked together, and they cut them out.

MARTÍNEZ: What about the Justice Department, Matt? What are they saying?

SEPIC: Assistant Attorney General Todd Blanche says in a short statement, quote, ""there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation."" The DOJ tells me ICE is running its own investigation that's parallel to, quote, ""any FBI investigation."" But the same source, not authorized to speak on the record, calls that a lie and says ICE is not investigating the shooting.

MARTÍNEZ: That's Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public Radio. Thanks.

SEPIC: You're welcome.

The post follows his Tuesday speech at the Detroit Economic Club when he said sanctuary cities “do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.” Sanctuary jurisdictions often limit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

“ALL THEY DO IS BREED CRIME AND VIOLENCE! If States want them, they will have to pay for them! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” he added.

The post follows his Tuesday speech at the Detroit Economic Club when he said sanctuary cities “do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.”

Sanctuary jurisdictions often limit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Some also provide social benefits to immigrants lacking legal status.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws. The list of states included California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

She urged them to comply with the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts or lose funding, citing an executive order signed by Trump in April.

The order directs Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”

The latest move comes after a federal judge ruled the executive order, which would have paused funding for more than 30 sanctuary cities, was likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge William Orrick, who was appointed by former President Obama, extended his preliminary injunction in August after the administration did little to object to the original order.

Orrick also barred officials from imposing conditions on grant programs that provide funding “for a variety of critical needs.”

Still, the Department of Homeland Security ramped up pressure by publicly listing more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including cities, counties and states, arguing they put American lives at risk by obstructing immigration enforcement.

In a moment where the focus should be on de-escalating tension between federal agents and communities, masks are making it worse.","Protect and serve. That’s supposed to be the job.

What could be further from that than masked agents roaming American streets in packs, refusing to identify themselves, and terrorizing—there is no other word for it at this point—American citizens?

Early on, the excuse for wearing masks was that it was necessary to protect the agents. From what? There were reports that they were being doxxed, which no one in law enforcement likes to deal with. But they’re the ones assaulting and killing people, which is far more problematic. Back in July, the Acting Director of ICE, Todd Lyons, said that he did not encourage agents to use masks but would continue to let them wear them in the field “if that’s a tool they need to keep them and their families safe.” Now masks and gaiters are emblematic of ICE agents and their colleagues from CBP (Customs and Border Protection) doing immigration work in places like Minneapolis.

You don’t routinely see the FBI or U.S. Marshals out doing their jobs with masks on. There is literally no legitimate reason for ICE and Customs Border Patrol (CBP) to continue to operate this way during immigration “enforcement actions,” especially in light of the recent history of documented abuses. Anonymity accelerates that kind of behavior. It tells the agents they aren’t accountable for violating people’s civil rights.

The overwhelming majority of federal law enforcement agents I worked with during my 25-year career at DOJ were men and women who were committed to following the law themselves while protecting their communities and prosecuting crimes. They believed citizens had constitutional rights. There’s no reason for the sudden change, a world where an agent shoots and kills a woman for no good reason, except that the current leadership in the White House and at DHS is willing to tolerate, if not encourage, what we’re now seeing. There are people ripped out of their cars, homes entered without a judicial warrant, agents who treat American citizens like they have no rights. This administration dishonors the service of the federal agents who spent their careers committed to constitutional policing.

Law enforcement officers are trained to de-escalate tense situations. Instead, we’re watching ICE agents act like the accelerant to a smoldering fire. The administration’s take on the failure of agents to behave like the good guys they’re supposed to be isn’t to put a stop to it. Instead, they revel in the Gestapo-like images of doors being busted down, school kids being knocked to the ground, and peaceful protesters being hit with pepper spray. So, it’s up to someone else to stop it.

The state of training at ICE is unclear, as new agents are rapidly hired and deployed. But what we’re seeing is troubling.

Some states have tried passing laws to prohibit masking.

California passed SB 627 (the “No Secret Police Act”) in late 2025, restricting law enforcement, including federal agents, from using extreme face coverings like ski masks during operations, effective Jan 1, 2026. There are logical exemptions to protect officer safety and the identity of undercover operatives. California Governor Gavin Newsom said at the time, “This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.”

The language of the bill explains that “facial coverings limit the visibility of facial expressions, which are essential components of nonverbal communication. In high-stress or emotionally charged interactions, the inability to read an officer’s expression may lead to misinterpretation of tone or intent, increasing the risk of conflict escalation” and that “the visibility of an officer’s face is vital for promoting transparency, facilitating communication, and building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.” It also points out that “when officers are not readily identifiable, it increases the risk of impersonation by unauthorized individuals, which further undermines public trust, endangers public safety, and hinders legitimate law enforcement operations.”

But the Constitution protects federal supremacy, and the predictable challenge to the law from DOJ ensued in November 2025, arguing that the measure infringes on federal authority and endangers agent safety in an environment of accelerating threats made against them. California agreed it would not enforce the law until a judge had the opportunity to rule on the federal government’s request for a preliminary injunction. The concession was viewed as “a tactical decision by the state, speeding the court proceedings toward a conclusion while avoiding a temporary restraining order that likely would have prevented the law from taking effect in the meantime.” A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to take place this week.

Other states and localities are working with similar measures, including Denver, New Jersey, and New York. Congress could get into the act, too, avoiding the Supremacy Clause issue. California Representative Eric Swalwell has suggested it could be possible, for instance, to deny agents who are inappropriately masked the benefits of qualified immunity if they engage in misconduct. Greg Sargent detailed his conversation with Swalwell in a series of tweets. Other Democratic representatives have suggested on social media that they, too, would support such a move, but it remains to be seen whether it can gain any traction with Republicans.

Law enforcement can adapt to measures that prohibit masking except when necessary (as in SWAT operations or for undercover agents). Although federal law doesn’t contain any restrictions on wearing masks, in 2022, the Secret Service and the Park Police agreed to wear badges and identify themselves in public, as a result of the debacle in Lafayette Square during the first Trump administration, when rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash bangs were used on peaceful protestors. Federal agents and police cleared the Square to facilitate Trump’s desire for a photo opportunity at St. John’s Church.

Whether or not the California law passes constitutional muster, its rationale is strong. In a moment where the focus should be on de-escalating tension between federal agents and communities, masks are making it worse. It would be a simple measure and a show of good faith toward communities like Minneapolis to end their use. That the administration won’t take even that simple step tells you all you need to know about where this is headed.

Three of the four Oglala Sioux Tribe members who were arrested in Minneapolis on Friday have been transferred to an ICE facility at Fort Snelling, President Frank Star Comes Out said in a statement released with a memorandum sent to federal immigration authorities.

“The Oglala Sioux Tribe's memorandum makes clear that ‘tribal citizens are not aliens’ and are ‘categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,’” Star Comes Out said. “Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty.”

Details about the circumstances that led to their detention were unclear.

In the memorandum sent to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Star Comes Out said the when tribal nation reached out to the agency it was provided with only the first names of the men. Homeland Security refused to release more information, unless the tribe “entered into an immigration agreement with ICE.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

Star Comes Out said the tribe has no plans enter an agreement with ICE.

In a post to his Facebook page, Star Comes Out said that the four detained tribal members are experiencing homelessness and living under a bridge in Minneapolis. One of the members was released from detention.

In the press release, he demanded information on the status of the three men in detention, the release of all tribal citizens in ICE custody and a meeting between the tribe and the government.

Fort Snelling has a troubling history for Indigenous people. It was the first military outpost in the area, and Dakota people were held prisoner there during the Dakota War of 1862, an armed conflict between the U.S. and Native Americans, said Nick Estes, an associate professor in American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.

“It has this really notorious anti-Indigenous, specifically anti-Dakota, history,” Estes said. “It’s kind of like a continuation on the monopoly of violence from the military outpost to the ICE facility.”

It's not the first time in recent months that ICE agents have detained tribal members.

Last year, elected leaders in the Navajo Nation said that tribal citizens in Arizona and New Mexico reported being stopped and detained by ICE officers. In November, a member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona who had been arrested in Iowa was mistakenly scheduled to be deported before the error was caught and she was released.

That same month, Elaine Miles, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon and an actress known for her roles in “Northern Exposure” and “The Last of Us,” said she was stopped by ICE officers in Washington state who told her that her tribal ID looked fake.

Indigenous rights groups as well as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians have established places in Minneapolis where tribal citizens can apply for tribal ID cards, in case they are approached by ICE and need to provide identification.

“I never thought that I’d have my tribal ID hanging around my neck, but I do,” said Mary LaGarde, executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Center. “So, it’s just important that they have proper identification on them and not to panic.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a75f3f9e-257a-4036-af1e-d3dd70607921/wirestory_29ac43de85569b80bd64875388097ab6_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-14 12:58:25.362892

Hours after the shooting, a crowd of thousands gathered around the site to remember Good and protest the ICE action that took her life. Thousands more have gathered at other events since then, including an ""ICE out of Minnesota"" march hosted by the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee on Jan. 10.

Anne Attea, a longtime parishioner at Church of the Ascension in North Minneapolis, attended a ""Vigil of Hope"" at the state capitol Jan. 9. She said many in the Spanish-speaking immigrant community at her parish experienced what she described as an ""Advent of darkness"" as the ICE crackdown in the city began. Both documented and undocumented immigrants have been living in fear, she said, because ICE agents have been engaged in aggressive racial and ethnic profiling.

""We as a Catholic body should become more forceful in denouncing hate, evil, racism and lack of respect for human dignity,"" said Attea, who is program minister in the Center for Spirituality & Social Justice at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.

About 400 people prayed Jan. 13 outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where people are being detained by ICE. Participants held signs denouncing ICE and remembering Good.

""I think solidarity in times like this is so important,"" said Aaron Sinner, a parishioner at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in St. Paul. ""ICE has a pretty clear mandate, and it's a pretty narrow mandate by law. It's scary to see the wanton disregard for what their scope of duty is and the reckless abandon with which they are exceeding their mandate and putting lives at risk.""

Marty Roers, of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Justice Office in St. Paul, belongs to an interfaith group that has been showing up to pray at the federal immigration detention facility every month for 12 years. On Jan. 13 he said he was there ""standing up for a better way to work with the issues and struggles of immigration.""

The ICE agents in the Minneapolis area in recent weeks wearing black head coverings have reminded Houa Her, a parishioner at Presentation of Mary Parish in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood, of the Communist military forces that came to his village in Laos. They questioned people about their activities and loyalties and took some away, never to return, he said.

People were living in fear, he told The National Catholic Reporter. Her was 12 years old at the time. He eventually came to the U.S. with his brother from a refugee camp in Thailand and has been a U.S. citizen since 1995.

Currently in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, ICE agents have not limited their actions to city streets. They have also entered people's homes and, in doing so, have created a sense of fear that is disrupting family life, according to a Latino parish ministry worker in the archdiocese who did not want her name to be used out of safety concerns. She described a feeling of great desolation in the community.

""These (people) are not threats to our community,"" said Fr. Dale Korogi, pastor of Ascension Church, in remarks about immigrants at an interfaith press conference in Minneapolis Jan. 8. ""These are really good people!"" The priest said that families were afraid to leave their homes. They're not being inconvenienced by ICE, he said, they're being harassed, terrorized and traumatized by ICE. In the memory of Renee Good and in the name of God, Karogi called for an end to this cruelty.

Korogi said Mass attendance among Spanish-speakers at Ascension is down about 80%. Fear of leaving home has also contributed to an over 60% drop in attendance numbers at the Sunday afternoon Spanish-language Mass at Assumption Catholic Church in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, another parish with a large Spanish-speaking immigrant congregation. The same story is playing out at other parishes in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis since ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge"" began in December.

""Currently in Minneapolis we see so much inhumanity,"" said one South Minneapolis pastor in his weekend homily. ""Whatever our nationality or race, our true citizenship is in the Kingdom of God. Let's live that way,"" said the priest who didn't want to be identified out of concern for his parishioners' safety.

""When it comes to ICE operations, I understand they are doing their job,"" said Digna Yaurincela, a parishioner at St. Richards Catholic Church in Richfield, ""but they're focusing on the wrong people.""

Yaurincela, who is a U.S. citizen, related several accounts of people being picked up by ICE agents. They included a 17-year old who was picked up at the Richfield Target store, then released 3 miles away at the Bloomington Walmart after producing a passport to establish his U.S. citizenship. She worries her own children might be picked up based simply on how they look.

""We're human beings, people with children trying to provide for our families,"" Yaurincela said.

“Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:08.731906

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-shooting-minneapolis-01-07-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:59:05.435992

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars.
But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.

“When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not.","It began in Los Angeles, in Signal chats and strategy sessions on Zoom. Last year, as immigration raids proliferated throughout the city, Latino activists and neighbors began organizing a response, monitoring for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents along sidewalks and in Home Depot parking lots and texting their networks when they spotted an arrest underway.

By late summer, activists in Chicago were trained and ready. Before the Trump administration had announced a crackdown called Operation Midway Blitz, immigrant rights organizations had handed out orange whistles for volunteers to use as a public warning system, formed “rapid-response” groups and advised people to report sightings of ICE agents and memorize their own legal rights. Chicagoans, even many without formal ties to protest groups, showed defiance against ICE with “Hands Off Chicago” signs adorned with the city’s beloved starred-and-striped flag, placed prominently in windows of restaurants and bungalows.

And in recent weeks in Minneapolis, the latest focus for a Trump administration surge of immigration enforcement, a loose but growing network of neighborhood volunteers has shown up near reported arrests, yelling at agents and recording them on iPhone cameras. Some gathered near hotels where agents were believed to be staying, pounding drums and making noise.

President Trump’s sweeping effort to tamp down illegal immigration, using masked federal agents who film their interactions with cellphones and often question American citizens about their legal status, has set off a surge in confrontational activism fueled by both large liberal advocacy groups and hyperlocal neighborhood networks.

Participants say they have been propelled into action with two goals in mind: an urge to protect their neighbors, many of whom are in the country without authorization but have no criminal backgrounds, and also to push back against what they see as a violent and overreaching federal government.

“It’s a lot of people who wouldn’t normally involve themselves in politics, but at the same time don’t like what’s happening in their community,” said Sandra Trevino, a Chicago resident who works in sales but spends her weekends patrolling the city for immigration agents and texting her networks with updates.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, has called the actions of such activists dangerous, part of “a coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement.”

In Minnesota, where an ICE agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, last week, tensions have mounted since an immigration crackdown began there in early December. Some Minnesota residents have thrown icy snowballs or other objects at agents, called them Nazis and fascists and trailed them in their cars, honking their horns, a practice frequently used in Chicago last year.

“Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who obstructs or assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the department said in a statement on Tuesday.

It is not yet clear how deeply the Goods were connected to anti-ICE efforts in Minneapolis. Becca Good was wearing an orange whistle around her neck as she confronted federal agents while filming them with her cellphone, videos show, moments before Renee Good was fatally shot in her car.

In a statement issued to Minnesota Public Radio, Becca Good suggested that the two women had taken part in a protest on the day of the shooting, but their involvement beyond that day is unknown.

“On Wednesday, Jan. 7, we stopped to support our neighbors,” Becca Good said. “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Anti-ICE tactics by volunteers and so-called patrollers who track and follow immigration agents in caravans have only intensified in the Twin Cities in the last week, despite Ms. Good’s death, activists and officials said in interviews.

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars. But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.

Ashley Lopez, who works in education and lives in the city of West St. Paul, has become active in anti-ICE neighborhood groups only in the week since Ms. Good’s death.

“Because of what happened to Renee, I felt like we had nothing to lose anymore,” said Ms. Lopez, who has joined patrols that blow whistles and set off their own car alarms if they see ICE agents. “Why should she be the only one who put herself in danger?”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, said that before the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, her organization received dozens of emails a day from people asking how they could get involved. That has now grown to hundreds daily.

“People are still showing up and defending their community despite seeing such a violent act,” she said. “They’re calling for justice, even though there is a chance they could be hurt in the process.”

Patrollers in Chicago said this week that they were still roaming around the city looking for ICE agents. But many of their Signal chats and Facebook groups have gone quiet, a sign that the Trump administration’s focus has shifted squarely to Minneapolis — at least for now.

That feels far different from how it did in Chicago last fall, when masked federal agents walked down the Magnificent Mile downtown, startling residents and tourists. As residents began protesting their presence in neighborhoods, agents used aggressive methods to disperse crowds, releasing tear gas and pepper spray along blocks around the city.

“In a way, it really galvanized local support against them everywhere they went,” said Brandon Lee, a coordinator for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not. You’re going to get tear-gassed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 10:58:37.074702

But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.
Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.
Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged.
“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said.","“The broader Hispanic community certainly feels let down,” said Javier Palomarez, the organization’s president and CEO. “It would be different if immigration and the economy had not been principal talking points for [Trump]. On both fronts, we didn’t get what we thought we were going to get.”

The combination of ongoing economic uncertainty and stubbornly high prices driven by Trump’s tariffs — coupled with the economic impact of the Trump administration’s ongoing raids in immigrant-heavy communities — makes the situation increasingly dire for some Hispanic business owners.

Trump and his allies argue that they’re just cleaning up the mess left by the previous president.

“Republicans are putting in the work to fix the Bidenflation mess we inherited. From lowering inflation to creating a housing plan, President Trump is fighting for the working families Democrats left behind,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Monica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told POLITICO about a South Phoenix restaurant hit hard by tariffs and labor shortages. Then, a series of ICE raids in the parking lot in front of the restaurant caused customers and workers to stop showing up and forced the owners to shut it down for several days. She predicted this kind of situation will blow back on Republicans in the next election.

“We certainly do sense that our members — our clients in Arizona and across the country — feel a sense of betrayal by this administration, given its excessive overreach,” Villalobos said. “Now that we’ve had a taste of [the Trump administration], I think you’re going to see a big shift [in the vote].”

In 2024, Trump won 48 percent of self-described Hispanic or Latino voters, the highest mark for a Republican presidential candidate in at least a half-century, driven largely by economic anxiety. But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.

In a November POLITICO Poll, a plurality — 48 percent — of Hispanic respondents said the cost of living in the U.S. is “the worst I can ever remember it being,” and a majority (67 percent) said responsibility lies with the president to fix it.

According to a November Pew Research poll, about two-thirds (68 percent) of U.S. Hispanics say their situation today is worse than it was a year ago, and just nine percent say it is better; 65 percent of Latinos disagree with this administration’s approach to immigration, and a majority (52 percent) said they worried they, a family member or a close friend could be deported, a ten-point increase since March.

Trump’s net favorability rating among Hispanics is now at 28 percent, per a recent The Economist/YouGov poll, 13 points lower than it was in February of last year.

“Small business owners are becoming a swing constituency, when you think about the midterms coming up,” said Tayde Aburto, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of E-Commerce. “And not because their values have changed—it’s just because their costs did.”

Latino voters have swung hard back toward Democrats in recent elections as well. In Passaic County, New Jersey, Latinos voted narrowly for Trump in 2024 but in November backed Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill by double digits. And in Miami, where over 70 percent of residents are Hispanic, a Democratic mayor was elected last month for the first time in 28 years last month.

Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.

“[Trump’s] agenda literally does little to nothing to help Hispanic families,” Ulvert said. “Worse, it preys on Hispanic families. And what we heard on the campaign trail most pointedly is the old adage: is my life better today than it was yesterday under new leaders? And resoundingly, not only verbally, but through the ballot box throughout the year, Hispanic families are saying, ‘no, my life is actually worse.’”

Joe Vichot, the Republican Party chair in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, said he knows many Hispanic Republicans in Allentown who are supportive of curbing illegal immigration and fighting crime. “But there’s also stories of people who have been here for 10 years or more with their family, but they’ve never been legal, that are now caught up into the [deportation] system,” he said.

“There should be a way to find some type of common ground where that won’t happen.”

The White House has tried to ease the ailing economic sentiment by sending Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the road, delivering a series of stump speeches on affordability in working-class areas, including Vance’s Dec. 16 stop in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which includes the Hispanic-majority city of Allentown. They insist the economy deserves an “A+++” grade, and are now buoyed by a December consumer price index report released Tuesday that showed inflation rising at a slower pace than expected.

“Joe Biden gave us a colossal catastrophe, but my administration has rapidly and very decisively ended that,” Trump said during a speech in Detroit Tuesday. “We have quickly achieved the exact opposite of stagflation — almost no inflation and super high growth.”

But cooling inflation rates just mean prices aren’t rising as fast as they had been — prices still remain much higher on many goods than they had been in recent years. And improving macroeconomic trends are not yet being felt by consumers, said Massey Villarreal, a business executive in Houston.

“I’m like most Americans. I hear the inflation number and I don’t translate it to my going to the grocery store, when I look at the cost of hamburger meat,” said Villarreal, a former chair of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.

Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged. “While we were talking about GDP and unemployment and jobs growth rates, people were worried about the rent and the price of gas and the price of eggs. And we’ve got kind of the same thing here,” he said.

In Chicago, where some of the most-publicized immigration enforcement occurred last year, Hispanic-run businesses have been hit hard. Sam Sanchez, CEO of Third Coast Hospitality, said 2025 was the hardest period for business of his four decades in restauranteering, aside from the COVID pandemic.

“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said. “Everything’s just starting to fall apart.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F11%2F74%2F1b0726414d549e42ba7e117b7668%2F201101-trump-az-ap-773.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:52.340179

Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document.","The woman killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week served on the board of her son’s school, which linked to documents encouraging parents to monitor ICE and directing them to training.

The documents shed new light on Renee Good’s connection to efforts to monitor and potentially disrupt ICE operations – an association that federal officials have made clear is at the center of their review into the deadly incident that occurred as she partially blocked ICE agents in the street with her SUV.

But four legal experts who reviewed the documents for CNN said they largely describe nonviolent civil disobedience tactics practiced at American protests for generations – far from the sinister depiction of extremism and domestic terrorism portrayed by Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance.

“There’s nothing in there that suggests attacking ICE agents or engaging in any other form of physical harm or property damage,” said Timothy Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School who wrote a book on protest law. “This is authoritarianism 101 where you blame the dissenters and the activists for causing their own death.”

At least six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis resigned Tuesday over pressure from the Trump administration to focus their probe on the actions of Good and those around her, according to a person briefed on the matter.

One of the documents linked by the school appears to be a message to parents dated December 16 that begins, “Thank you to families who have been on ICE watch, helping to protect their neighbors.”

The note links to a separate training document with guides on getting whistles to alert neighbors to ICE raids and contact information for a school parent offering “noncooperation training.”

“ICE are untrained bullies looking for easy targets. Neighbors showing up have saved lives,” that training document reads.

Another guide linked to in the training document stresses nonviolent responses to ICE agents, while also encouraging a refusal to “comply with demands, requests, and orders.” It suggests “creative tactics,” noting that “Crowds, props, traffic, and noise can make detentions difficult, sometimes ICE vehicles can’t move (‘whoops!’).” It does not specifically suggest blocking operations with a vehicle.

The December 16 note, titled “School Report,” was an item on the school board’s meeting on that date, an agenda shows – a meeting that Good attended as one of three parents on the board of the Southside Family Charter School.

Records don’t indicate that the board voted on the message. It’s unclear whether it was more widely shared with families at Southside, a small charter school with a long history of progressive activism. Neither the school nor other board members who served with Good responded to messages from CNN.

Two sources familiar with the school said the “School Report” message appeared similar to past newsletters shared with parents, but neither was on the email list at the time to confirm if it was sent out.

The “School Report” message was uploaded to the school’s public Google Drive about two weeks into the federal operation ramping up immigration enforcement actions in the Minneapolis area, which federal officials had launched to target the region’s Somali community.

Good was partially blocking a street with her SUV on Wednesday as ICE agents operated in the area. An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV. Videos of the deadly interaction show that Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it’s unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.

Federal officials have claimed without providing evidence that Good was engaging in “domestic terrorism” and had been “stalking agents all day long,” while some state and local lawmakers have decried that rhetoric as false and incendiary.

Good’s family members have said that she and her wife had come from dropping off their son earlier that morning at Southside, about a mile and a half from where Good was shot.

Good’s wife, Becca Good, said in a statement last week that the couple had “stopped to support our neighbors,” adding, “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Legal experts who spoke to CNN said it was troubling that federal officials appeared to be focusing on low-level violations by protesters instead of the shooting of Good itself.

Gregory Magarian, a professor and First Amendment expert at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said that the noncooperation tactics described in the guide could potentially violate some laws depending on the context of the situation. But overall, he said, the document endorsed standard nonviolent protest actions that don’t merit an investigation by federal law enforcement.

“If the FBI has an inkling of investigating the protest organizers, it should read that and say, ‘OK, there’s not a fruitful path of inquiry here. Nothing about that raises red flags, nothing about that raises alarms, we should get back to doing our job,’” Magarian said. The idea that the agency would investigate protesters instead of the use of deadly force is “appalling and really dangerous,” he added.

Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, added that attempts to investigate activists and protesters appear to have “the goal of trying to justify the officer’s conduct.”

Good joined the Southside school board in August 2025, a few months after she moved to Minneapolis with her wife and six-year-old son, according to board meeting notes. Her leadership role at the school has not been previously reported.

Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document. It offers programming like student trips to the South to study the history of the Civil Rights Movement and “hands-on experience planting and harvesting” as part of a curriculum on environmental issues.

“The heart of the school’s mission, social justice education, is woven into every subject and grade level,” an annual report read. “By addressing social justice issues at an early age, the school encourages children to see themselves as citizen activists who can change the world and also helps children avoid internalizing the effects of discrimination.”

The documents show that Good was deeply involved with the school community, even as a relatively recent arrival. Good regularly attended board meetings, with records of one meeting noting that “Renee had some questions about the future growth of the school.”

The same school bulletin that encouraged activism to monitor ICE last month also shared how Good and her wife had “brought pots for us to paint” to a school event: “We will sell them at our plant sale in the spring. They look beautiful!”

Rashad Rich, a former physical education teacher at Southside who taught Good’s son in his class, said the couple were familiar faces at the school.

When they dropped off their son, he “would say goodbye several times before they could leave, and then they would drive around the front of the school so they had a window where he could see them,” Rich told CNN. “They’d wave. They were just awesome parents.”

In the wake of Good’s shooting, Rich said, teachers and staff members at the school have had their names and addresses posted on social media.

“They’re getting threats,” he said. “It’s a scary thing right now.”

Donald Trump’s administration said Tuesday it will end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Somalia, the latest move in the president’s mass deportation agenda.

The move affects hundreds of people who are a small subset of immigrants living in the United States with TPS protections. It comes during Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where many native Somalis live and where street protests have intensified since a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed a U.S citizen who was demonstrating against federal presence in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that affected Somalis must leave the U.S. by March 17, when existing protections, last extended by then-President Joe Biden, will expire.

“Temporary means temporary,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, adding that the decision puts “Americans first.”

The Congressional Research Service last spring said the Somali TPS population was 705 out of nearly 1.3 million TPS immigrants. Trump has ended protections across multiple countries in his second presidency.

Homeland Security secretary says conditions in Somalia have changed

Noem insisted circumstances in Somalia “have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which advocates for fair treatment of Muslims in the U.S., criticized the latest rollback as a “bigoted attack” that will send some Somalis back to a war-torn, unstable nation.

“This decision does not reflect changed conditions in Somalia,” CAIR said in a statement released jointly with its Minnesota chapter. “By dismantling protections for one of the most vulnerable Black and Muslim communities, this decision exposes an agenda rooted in exclusion, not public safety.”

Located in the horn of Africa, Somalia is one of the world’s poorest nations and has for decades been beset by chronic strife exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. Al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab controls parts of the country and has carried out truck bombings and other assaults in the capital, Mogadishu, in recent years that killed dozens of people.

Congress established the Temporary Protected Status program in 1990 to help foreign nationals who’ve fled unstable, threatening conditions in their home countries and are living in the U.S. It allows the executive branch to designate a country, generally in 18-month increments, for the protected status. Citizens of that country who are already in the U.S. and qualify for protection can apply with Homeland Security for the designation.

If approved, recipients can legally work and are protected from deportation but there is no pathway to a green card or U.S. citizenship and they are reliant on the government renewing the TPS designation every few years.

Critics say that while these designations are supposed to be temporary, they are renewed so often that they essentially become permanent.

Somalia designation traces to the elder Bush’s administration

Somalia first received the designation under President George H.W. Bush amid a civil war in 1991. The status has been extended for decades, most recently by Biden in July 2024.

The 2025 congressional report stated that Somalis had received more than two dozen extensions because of perpetual “insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees.”

Trump has targeted Somali immigrants with racist rhetoric and accused those in Minneapolis of massively defrauding federal programs, charges he renewed again Tuesday speaking in Michigan. He promised, without a clear legal basis, to “revoke the citizenship of any naturalized immigrant from Somalia, or anywhere else who was convicted of defrauding our citizens.”

In December, Trump said he did not want Somalis in the U.S. at all, saying they “come from hell” and “contribute nothing.” He made no distinction between citizens and non-citizens or offered any opinion on immigration status.

Temporary status widened during Joe Biden’s presidency

Biden’s administration broadly expanded the number of people covered by Temporary Protected Status but the Trump administration has steadily sought to strip protections away from various nationalities including 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians. The actions have prompted multiple court challenges but the U.S. Supreme Court has twice issued emergency rulings, last May and again in October, that allowed the Venezuelan revocations to continue as court cases proceed.

It’s not immediately clear how quickly those Somalis covered by TPS could be removed from the country once their protections expire. Most attempts by the administration to end a TPS designation have ended up in the courts. And people covered by TPS can also apply for asylum or other immigration avenues to stay in the U.S., although the Trump administration has made those options more difficult as well for Somalis as well as other nationalities.

Officials in Minnesota have criticized federal authorities for barring the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the investigation.
The Trump administration cited the fraud investigation when it dispatched ICE officers to Minnesota.","At least three prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a person familiar with the resignations told NBC News on Tuesday.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment by NBC News.

The attorneys had felt pressure from Justice Department leadership, both in Minneapolis and in Washington, to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thompson was a “principled public servant” who spent more than a decade in law enforcement in the state.

“This is a huge loss for our state,” Walz said of the resignations. “This is the latest sign that President Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the Department of Justice.”

Good was in the driver’s seat of an SUV in a residential part of Minneapolis last week when she was killed.

Video from eyewitnesses shows officers telling Good to get out of her car before she begins driving away. Gunshots can be heard, and the SUV slams into a parked vehicle. Video obtained by NBC News that appears to have been recorded by Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good, captured Good and her wife talking to an officer in the moments before he opened fire.

In the video, Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

Ross shouts what sounds like “whoa” and fires, as multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face.

Ross’ phone levels out and captures the SUV accelerating down the street. A male voice said, “f-----g bitch” moments before Good’s car crashes.

The FBI is investigating. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement Tuesday there was ""currently no basis"" for an investigation by the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

ICE’s Office of Public Responsibility is conducting its own internal investigation, Blanche said, as is protocol for the agency after every officer-involved shooting. Any investigation runs parallel to the FBI’s investigation into the shooting, a Justice Department official said.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Good, an award-winning poet, “weaponized” her vehicle against the ICE officer who fatally shot her in self-defense.

Local and state officials have disputed that claim, saying Good, 37, was only trying to leave the scene.

Officials in Minnesota have criticized federal authorities for barring the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the investigation. Asked about the decision last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused state investigators of allowing people to harass and incite violence against federal officers.

The New York Times first reported the resignations.

Thompson, one of the prosecutors who resigned, oversaw a yearslong investigation that resulted in dozens of charges against people accused of defrauding millions of dollars in government funds. The Trump administration cited the fraud investigation when it dispatched ICE officers to Minnesota.

The statement from the governor’s office said Thompson “has worked extensively with state regulators and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to bring federal prosecutions against fraud involving public programs. His work supported oversight, enforcement, and program integrity.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a statement about the resignations, “The legitimacy of the justice system depends on institutions — not rhetoric.”

“Joe Thompson is an institution within law enforcement, directly responsible for building and prosecuting the fraud cases now being cited to justify this moment,” he said, referring to allegations of fraud at child care facilities.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making those cases, it signals that this isn’t about prosecuting fraud,” O’Hara said in the statement.

Last week, the Trump administration deployed more than 2,000 officers and agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations to Minneapolis after a right-wing influencer accused several Somali-run day care facilities of fraud.

State officials who investigated the allegations said they found no evidence to back up the claims.

Within the main Justice Department in Washington, at least six leaders at the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division were taking early retirement, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News. A third person familiar with the departures said that they were planned before the Minnesota shooting.

The division, which is tasked in part with investigating possible abuse by law enforcement, has lost hundreds of attorneys since President Donald Trump returned to office. MS NOW first reported on the departures.

Kristen Clarke, the former head of the division under President Joe Biden, said the departures would have a major impact.

“The hollowing out of the Civil Rights Division’s national expertise hurts every American,” Clarke said. “Unparalleled expertise and commitment to impartiality is precisely what’s needed in this moment.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260113-minneapolis-ice-car-ew-312p-7dd794.jpg",N,,2026-01-14 10:58:52.002625

“The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve,” the senators wrote in their letter to the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Judiciary, and Intelligence Committees. “Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct oversight and reassert its role in future decisions regarding Venezuela.”

The senators demanded answers on the President’s legal justification and his plans to “run Venezuela,” including funding the expansion of U.S. oil companies’ in Venezuela as he promised. They also noted that the President’s intervention in Venezuela deviates from decades of U.S. foreign policy and puts American service members in harm’s way.

Previously, Hickenlooper called out President Trump for launching a war in Venezuela without congressional authorization. Hickenlooper also voted to block the use of the U.S. Armed Forces to engage in further hostilities within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Shaheen, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Durbin, Chairman Cotton, and Vice Chairman Warner:

We write to urge you to convene immediate public oversight hearings covering President Donald Trump’s January 3, 2026 military operation in Venezuela, which Congress did not authorize. The American people deserve clarity as to why the President put our service members in harm’s way and what his plan is in Venezuela moving forward.

Nicolás Maduro was an illegitimate, brutal leader who lost, and then stole, the country’s 2024 elections. There is also no doubt as to the bravery and skill of the U.S military, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel who contributed to this operation. However, we have seen no evidence justifying the administration’s initial decision to take military action to oust Maduro – particularly without Congressional authorization or even Congressional notification.

Equally important, with Maduro now in U.S. custody, the administration has provided Congress absolutely no coherent justification for keeping 15,000 U.S. forces and dozens of U.S. military assets in the region. Congress must decide whether we should permit this administration to maintain this military build-up, and assess the broader national security implications of the President’s military intervention in Venezuela.

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

1. What are U.S. interests in Venezuela and how do they justify the military actions that President Trump ordered without Congressional authorization? President Trump mentioned oil roughly 20 times in his January 3 press conference. Meanwhile, other senior administration officials justified U.S. actions as necessary to counter illicit narcotics, assert U.S. influence as a “great power” in the Western Hemisphere, access Venezuela’s vast natural resource wealth, and prevent illegal immigration. The American people deserve to understand why the President put our military in harm’s way and may do so again.

2. Under what legal authority did the administration carry out the January 3 operation? The scope of the operation, involving hundreds of U.S. military personnel and planes, is not consistent with a law enforcement operation.

3. How many people were killed in the January 3 operation, and what country or countries were they from? Reports suggest that 32 Cubans may have been killed.

4. With Maduro in U.S. custody, why have we not redeployed our military personnel to other priority missions from which they were distracted? Every member of Congress should be asking why this administration still has thousands of U.S. personnel and dozens of U.S. assets deployed off the coast of Venezuela, and be wary of the openended nature of this mission.

5. Did the administration misrepresent intelligence to justify its military operation? In July 2025, the Department of the Treasury designated Cartel de los Soles as a “terrorist organization” and in November 2025 the State Department followed suit, although the administration never provided Congress intelligence to justify this designation. Yet on January 3, 2026, the Department of Justice issued a revised indictment against Maduro, which no longer claims that Cartel de los Soles is an organized entity that threatens Americans. This reversal calls into question the legal and intelligence framework that the Trump administration repeatedly cited to justify Congressionally unauthorized military operations in the region since September 2025.

6. What diplomacy did President Trump authorize prior to invading Venezuela? U.S. officials and the Maduro regime reportedly held detailed negotiations, including at least one phone conversation between President Trump and Maduro. Congress needs to better understand the substance of those negotiations and why they did not produce a peaceful outcome.

7. When did President Trump authorize U.S. military action to capture Maduro? In recent months, officials from some U.S. departments and agencies may have failed to fulfill their statutory obligations to keep Congress currently and fully informed of their agencies’ activities planning for regime change in Venezuela

8. Why did the Trump administration consult privately with oil companies “before and after” the operation, as the President put it – but not with Congress?

There is no reason for the President to brief corporate interests ahead or instead of the American people’s elected representatives regarding a U.S. military operation in a foreign country. While President Trump and Secretary Rubio claimed that they could not brief Congress for fear of potential leaks, this justification rings hollow when President Trump himself and members of his cabinet have disclosed sensitive, apparently classified information to the public, to journalists in Signal chats, and even U.S. adversaries. Moreover, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the President to consult Congress “in every possible instance” before sending troops into war, unless the action is in response to an imminent threat facing American citizens or servicemembers – which was not true regarding Venezuela.

9. What does President Trump mean when he says he is prepared to deploy “boots on the ground” in Venezuela? Venezuela’s legitimate leadership did not invite the U.S. military to occupy its territory, and Congress has not authorized a military occupation.

10. What is the Trump administration’s plan to “run” Venezuela, as the President put it, and does that plan include a timeline for transitioning to Venezuela’s democratically elected government? President Trump stated on January 3: “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” However, other administration officials have suggested there will not be a transition and that U.S. policy is to coerce what remains of the Maduro regime to undertake unspecified actions in line with U.S. interests.

11. What factors led the Trump administration to abandon the bipartisan U.S. policy of recognizing Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate democratically elected leader of Venezuela? President Trump suggested that the opposition lacks support, but González overwhelmingly won the 2024 elections.

12. Did the Trump administration cut a deal with elements of interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her associates prior to the January 3 military operation, and what specific demands have we made of Rodríguez? The administration must publicly disclose the terms of any arrangement, as well as what the administration intends to do should Rodríguez not comply with any U.S. demands.

13. What intelligence led the Trump administration to conclude that Maduro’s security services will cooperate with any U.S. plan to “run” Venezuela and exploit its oil? The Venezuelan security services have a clear financial interest in maintaining the status quo. Congress must determine if the Trump administration plans to bribe illegitimate, corrupt, and repressive elements of the Maduro regime as part of the White House’s quest to control Venezuela’s oil.

14. What financial or other commitments has the Trump administration made to facilitate the expansion of U.S. oil companies’ footprint in Venezuela? On January 5, President Trump said that the United States may subsidize oil companies so that they can rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. Congress must determine if the President plans to make the American people foot the bill for private corporate interests in Venezuela.

15. Does the Trump administration plan to invade Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Greenland? President Trump has long asserted that Greenland, which is part of Denmark, should be a U.S. territory, implying willingness to take U.S. military action against a NATO ally. He similarly indicated a desire to pursue military action against Colombia and Mexico, longstanding U.S. counternarcotics and trade partners. Secretary Rubio also suggested that Cuba could be a future target of U.S. military action. Congress has not authorized any of these dangerous potential military operations.

The President’s recent actions in Venezuela risk implicating the United States in a corrupt bargain to govern a sovereign country alongside elements of an authoritarian regime, seemingly for the purpose of exploiting Venezuela’s oil. This is an unprecedented and dangerous break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. What the Trump administration does next in Venezuela – to say nothing of potential action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, and Mexico – will have serious implications for U.S. national security.

Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct oversight and reassert its role in future decisions regarding Venezuela. The American people expect that we will do our jobs on a bipartisan basis, and we encourage you to convene hearings on these questions and related issues without further delay.

Sincerely,

The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death.","President Trump seemed angry after the Senate voted last Thursday to pass a war powers resolution to the next stage, where lawmakers could approve the measure and seek to curb the president’s ability to wage war in Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Trump said that day that five Republican senators who supported bringing the measure to a vote — Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.), Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Todd Young (Ind.) — “should never be elected to office again.”

Why should he get so riled up about this, to the point where he could put his own party’s control of the Senate at risk in November? Even if this resolution were to pass both houses of Congress, he could veto it and ultimately be unrestrained. He did this in 2019, when a war powers resolution mandating that the U.S. military cease its participation in the war in Yemen was passed in both the Senate and the House. Many people think that such legislation therefore can’t make a difference.

But the president’s ire is telling. These political moves on the Hill can get results even before the resolution has a final vote, or if it is vetoed by the president.

The Trump administration made significant concessions before the 2019 resolution was approved by Congress, in an attempt to prevent it from passing. For instance, months before it was approved, the U.S. military stopped refueling Saudi warplanes in midair. These concessions de-escalated the war and saved tens of thousands of lives.

A war powers resolution is an act of Congress that is based on a 1973 law of the same name. That law spells out and reinforces the power that our Constitution has allocated to Congress, to decide when the U.S. military can be involved in hostilities.

The U.S. military raid in Caracas that seized Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is illegal according to international law, the charters of the Organization of American States and the United Nations, as well as other treaties to which the United States is a signatory. According to our own Constitution, the government violates U.S. law when it violates treaties that our government has signed.

None of that restrained the Trump administration, which has not demonstrated much respect for the rule of law. But the White House does care about the political power of Congress. If there is an expanded war in Venezuela or anywhere else that Trump has threatened to use the military, the fact that Congress took steps to oppose it will increase the political cost to the president.

This is likely one of the main reasons that the Trump administration has at least promised to make concessions regarding military action in Latin America — and who knows, possibly he did make some compromises compared with what had been planned.

On Nov. 5, the day before the Senate was to vote on a war powers resolution to halt and prevent hostilities within or against Venezuela by U.S. armed forces, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and White House counsel had a private briefing with senators.

They assured lawmakers that they were not going to have a land war or airstrikes in Venezuela. According to news reports, the White House counsel stated that they did not have a legal justification for such a war. It is clear that blocking the resolution was very important to these top officials. The day after that meeting, the war powers resolution was blocked by two votes. Two Republicans had joined the Democrats and independents in support of the resolution: Murkowski and Paul. That added up to 49 votes — not quite the needed majority.

But on Thursday, there were three additional Republicans who voted for the new resolution, so it will proceed to a final vote.

The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death. The blockade involved in the seizure of oil tankers is, according to experts, an unlawful use of military force. This means that the blockade would be included as a participation in hostilities that would require authorization from Congress.

Since 2015, the United States has imposed unilateral economic sanctions that destroyed Venezuela’s economy. From 2012 to 2020, Venezuela suffered the worst peacetime depression in world history. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP, or income, fell by 74%. Think of the economic destruction of the U.S. Great Depression, multiplied by three times. Most of this was the result of the sanctions.

This unprecedented devastation is generally attributed to Maduro in public discussion. But U.S. sanctions deliberately cut Venezuela off from international finance, as well as blocking most of its oil sales, which accounted for more than 90% of foreign exchange (mostly dollar) earnings. This devastated the economy.

In the first year of Trump sanctions from 2017-18, Venezuela’s deaths increased by tens of thousands of people, at a time when oil prices were increasing. Sanctions were expanded even more the following year. About a quarter of the population, more than 7 million people, emigrated after 2015 — 750,000 of them to the United States.

We know that the deadly impact of sanctions that target the civilian population is real. Research published in July by the Lancet Global Health, by my colleagues Francisco Rodriguez, Silvio Rendon and myself, estimated the global death toll from unilateral economic sanctions, as these are, at 564,000 per year over the past decade. This is comparable to the worldwide deaths from armed conflict. A majority of the victims over the 1970-2021 period were children.

The Trump administration has, in the last few days, been moving in the direction of lifting some sanctions to allow for oil exports, according to the president’s stated plan to “run Venezuela.” This is ironic because Venezuela has for many years wanted more investment and trade, including in oil, with the United States, and it was U.S. sanctions that prohibited it.

Such lifting of sanctions would be a big step forward, in terms of saving lives of people who are deprived of food, medicine and other necessities in Venezuela, as a result of these sanctions and the economic destruction that they cause.

But to create the stability that Venezuela needs to recover, we will have to take the military and economic violence out of this campaign. There are members of Congress moving toward that goal, and they need all the help that they can get, before it’s too late.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/076818f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2F33%2F7943dedc407e900a8e9892bf9cc0%2Fmurkowski-reelection-21054.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 09:57:37.382778

And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.
That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.
It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.
Nancy Albrecht, John Cairns, John Davenport and Barb Iverson, who are members of the Re-imagining Community Safety group at Plymouth Congregational Church, also contributed.","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to unleash raids in Minneapolis, our police officers face the same struggle as in other target cities — including our sister city of St. Paul — to keep people safe without assisting in those raids.

After several months of study and public input following questions raised about Minneapolis police’s crowd control tactics during the overly militarized Lake Street raid in June, the city amended the separation ordinance to strengthen and clarify this issue. In addition, MPD has used its own settlement agreement process with the state Department of Human Rights to gather its own public input, and released a revised immigration policy that both more clearly prohibits assisting ICE and provides more protection to the public.

One can make the case that this wouldn’t have happened without strong and sustained public pressure, but the bottom line is that it did happen.

MPD Chief Brian O’Hara described the new policies at a press conference just days after the Trump administration announced “Operation Metro Surge,” which continues to seize members of both our Somali and Hispanic communities and create chaos. The new policy restates the current general rule that MPD will “not participate in immigration enforcement,” and goes further to say that MPD also shall “not assist in the removal or transportation of people”; “not provide crowd management solely at the request of immigration enforcement agencies”; and, absent “a clear an immediate threat to life, serious injury, or destruction of property…will not escort federal immigration agents to enforcement locations or close streets when there are no traffic or public safety issues.”

Finally, the new policy specifically affirms that gathering a crowd to protest is a “First Amendment-protected event”; that MPD will record and report any federal violations of this right; and that MPD “will verbally or physically intervene” against any federal use of excessive force as soon as there is “a reasonable and safe opportunity to do so.”

During his press conference, O’Hara made clear that this incudes responding to 911 calls from terrified residents. Indeed, he told the New York Times this week that his agency has seen a marked increase in 911 calls responding to the newly volatile situation.

Of course, MPD cannot and must not launch an armed attack against federal officers, but they have made clear that their foremost duty is to “protect and serve” our community, not invasive federal agents. And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.

As O’Hara pointed out, the new policies and training will “remind our officers of their duty to intervene.”

The dilemma that our community faces is that MPD’s recent commitment to the law and Constitution — refraining from escorting ICE agents or providing ICE crowd control, while upholding First Amendment rights by declining to dispatch officers to ICE protests absent a “clear and immediate threat” — means that MPD may not be present to intervene when ICE attacks protesters suddenly and without any forewarning or provocation.

That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.

Even in the face of this dilemma, however, MPD has continued to honor its reinforced commitment to constitutional policing during the massive protests following the killing. It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.

This is a good example of the kind of transformation that citizens demanded after the police murder of George Floyd, and which was codified by the settlement agreement with the Department of Human Rights.

Even in the face of the current chaos and distress, we should all be encouraged by this strong step by our local law enforcement in the right direction.

""President Trump is making our country safer, and the American people will remember it in November.”","NEW YORK -- It's only two weeks into the new year, and President Donald Trump has already claimed control of Venezuela, escalated threats to seize Greenland and flooded American streets with masked immigration agents.

And that's not even counting an unprecedented criminal investigation at the Federal Reserve, a cornerstone of the national economy that Trump wants to bend to his will.

Even for a president who thrives on chaos, Trump is generating a stunning level of turmoil as voters prepare to deliver their verdict on his leadership in the upcoming midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Each decision carries tremendous risks, from the possibility of an overseas quagmire to undermining the country's financial system, but Trump has barreled forward with a ferocity that has rattled even some of his Republican allies.

“The presidency has gone rogue,” said historian Joanne B. Freeman, a Yale University professor. She said it's something ""we haven’t seen in this way before.”

Trump seems undeterred by the potential blowback. Although he doesn't always follow through, he seems intent on doubling and tripling down whenever possible.

“Right now I’m feeling pretty good,"" Trump said Tuesday in Detroit. His speech was ostensibly arranged to refocus attention on the economy, which the president claimed is surging despite lingering concerns about higher prices.

However, he couldn't resist lashing out at Jerome Powell, who leads the Federal Reserve and has resisted Trump's pressure to lower interest rates.

""That jerk will be gone soon,” Trump said.

Republican leaders have overwhelmingly rallied behind Trump throughout his turbulent second term. But new cracks began to appear this week immediately after Powell disclosed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve was facing a criminal investigation over his testimony about the central bank's building renovations.

Over the last year, the Justice Department has already pursued criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former national security adviser John Bolton, among other Trump adversaries.

But going after Powell, who helps set the nation's monetary policy, appeared to be a step too far for some conservatives. Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, a fierce Trump defender, was unusually critical.

“It just feels like most on Wall Street do not want to see this kind of fight,” she said during her Monday show. “The president has very good points, certainly. But Wall Street doesn’t want to see this kind of investigation.”

The Federal Reserve plays a key role in the economy by calibrating interest rates, which Trump insists should be lower. However, reducing the institution's independence could backfire and cause borrowing costs to increase instead.

At the same time, Trump has decided to expand the United States' role in complicated foreign entanglements — a seeming departure from the “America First” foreign policy that he promised on the campaign trail.

No move was more significant than the U.S. military operation earlier this month to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from his country. In the months leading up to the attack, Trump frequently insisted he was targeting Maduro because of his role in the drug trade. He has quickly pivoted to portraying the move as an economic opportunity for the U.S.

Trump has said the U.S. will start controlling the sale of some Venezuelan oil, and he declared that the South American nation will be run from Washington. He even posted a meme declaring himself the “acting president of Venezuela.”

Trump has also threatened the leadership of Cuba and Iran, while insisting that the U.S. will control Greenland “ one way or the other ” — a position that has raised questions about U.S. relations with European allies. Greenland belongs to Denmark, a NATO member.

Meanwhile, Trump's immigration crackdown continues to spark confrontations in American cities. Some have turned deadly, such as when a federal agent shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis.

Administration officials have said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer acted in self-defense, accusing Good of trying to hit him with her car. But that explanation has been widely disputed by local officials and others based on videos circulating online.

The incident came after Trump dispatched 2,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, responding to reports of fraud involving the state's Somali community.

On Tuesday, Trump said the administration was targeting “thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention.”

The Trump administration's moves have created “chaos, confusion and uncertainty,” said Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, who leads the Democratic Mayors Association.

“There’s so much uncertainty across my city right now. The ICE raids in Minneapolis have really shocked the consciousness of many of my residents, and we’re trying to do everything we can to calm that concerns and quell those fears,"" Bibb said. “But people don’t feel like the world is getting better. People don’t feel like the economy is getting better.”

Voters across the nation will have their next chance to weigh in on Trump's leadership at the ballot box this November, when Republicans hope to retain control of Congress for the last two years of his presidency.

Democratic campaign officials in Washington are focused largely on the economy in their early political messaging. Most voters maintain a decidedly negative view on the issue, despite Trump's rosy assessment this week.

Just 31% of U.S. adults approved of how the president is handling the economy, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That marked the lowest economic approval he’s registered in an AP-NORC poll in his first or second term.

“Donald Trump’s visit to Michigan puts a glaring, unflattering spotlight on how he and House Republicans have failed to address the affordability crisis,"" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the Democrats' House campaign arm.

But some activists are frustrated that their party's leadership isn't focusing more on Trump's unprecedented power grabs.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he expects Trump's actions to get worse as his second and final term nears its conclusion.

“Folks at the end of last year who thought he would become a typical lame duck and limp toward a midterm loss have a framework for understanding this moment that is drastically outdated,” Levin said. “Authoritarians don’t willingly give up power. When weakened and cornered they lash out.”

Trump has repeatedly insisted he's only doing what voters elected him to do, and his allies in Washington remain overwhelmingly united behind him.

Republican National Committee spokesperson Kiersten Pels predicted that voters will reward the party this year.

“Voters elected President Trump to put American lives first — and that’s exactly what he’s doing,"" she said.

GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.
“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said.
A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.
“It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants.","The ‘skip tracing’ contract will supercharge surveillance of immigrants, financial incentives will turn contractors into bounty hunters, critics say.

The federal government has hired a company owned by a controversial private prison firm to track immigrants they’re looking to deport, even as experts and civil rights activists condemn the move as a “recipe for disaster.”

Under a two-year, $121 million contract between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a subsidiary of GEO Group called BI Incorporated, the company will perform “skip tracing” services for the federal government. GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.

According to an announcement about the contract, the work includes “enhanced location research with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation to verify current address information and investigate alternative address information for individuals on the federal government’s non-detained docket.”

In other words, the company will be searching public records and other data sources to track down the undocumented immigrants ICE hasn’t been able to find yet, experts said.

In the statement announcing the deal, GEO Group Chairman George Zoley crowed that the contract “is a testament to the high-quality solutions BI has provided to ICE for more than 21 years.”

But others, including advocates for immigrants, academics, and civil liberties watchdogs, say the federal government’s decision to outsource and effectively privatize data mining and surveillance operations will lead to nothing but trouble.

“Basically, it’s going to be what we would think of as bounty hunting — minus the ability to actually physically detain someone,” said Lori Nessel, a law professor at Seton Hall University and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights and International Human Rights Law Clinic.

“But what’s really disturbing is the language allows for ‘all available technology’ in terms of the surveillance. So there are huge privacy concerns,” she told The Jersey Vindicator.

Nessel also said the contract is incentive-based, which will encourage the firm to find as many people as it can, and quickly. That rush to meet a quota often leads to mistakes and constitutional violations.

She also suspects there will be little transparency about how, exactly, BI Incorporated goes about its work.

“It’s not clear where the legal authority comes from for a government agency to contract out this type of law enforcement function without limits,” she said. “So, I’m not sure where the accountability and oversight will come from … It’s a recipe for disaster.”

The deal has also attracted the attention of at least one member of Congress, and he expressed similar concerns in a November letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

“Allowing private contractors to perform enforcement activities under a system of performance-based financial incentives, essentially bounty hunting, outsources one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability,” Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote.

“Once the state begins contracting out its power to police, it invites the very abuses, secrecy, and corruption our founders sought to prevent,” Krishnamoorthi, who is also running for the U.S. Senate, said. “The idea of authorizing unknown private individuals to walk through neighborhoods, observing, photographing, and verifying the whereabouts of those they believe to be undocumented, is deeply troubling.”

Dillon Reisman, a staff attorney with the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, also worried that the contractor happens to be a subsidiary of GEO Group, which has for months been accused of abusing and neglecting detainees at Delaney Hall.

“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said. “Why would we trust this specific company with our data and with this task that is inherently harmful to civil liberties?”

BI Incorporated did not respond to a request for comment. A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.

How skip tracing works

Skip tracing isn’t new, experts said.

But it’s usually performed by real law enforcement agencies trying to find missing people who skipped out on bail, a debt, or a court date, according to David Opderbeck, a Seton Hall law professor and the co-director of the Gibbons Institute of Law, Science & Technology and the school’s Institute for Privacy Protection.

The job’s gotten easier as more and more public records migrate online, and recent leaps in artificial intelligence will let contractors use automated tools to scrape social media profiles and other parts of the web.

“It’s getting pretty sophisticated,” Opderbeck said.

And because ICE has information-sharing agreements with other federal agencies — including the IRS — contractors will likely be able to get their hands on tax records and other financial documents, he said.

“It’s always a concern when you’ve got a third-party contractor handling potentially very sensitive data,” he said. “Who knows what civil rights guardrails are built into this contract? I doubt many.”

Opderbeck worried ICE could weaponize the information against legal immigrants and those with valid asylum claims — or citizen watchdog groups who constantly protest the agency.

“Governments have been doing this kind of stuff for a long time,” he said. “But there’s a big potential for overly aggressive surveillance and maybe abuse of these tools … that’s pretty frightening to me.”

Nessel, his Seton Hall colleague, agreed.

“I think everyone needs to be concerned about losing privacy protections,” she said. “It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants. It’ll be U.S. citizens, it will be all of us that will be impacted by this surveillance.”

The final details of ICE’s plan are still unclear, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security gave a glimpse of the operation in documents obtained by The Intercept via a Freedom of Information request in late October.

In the nine-page document, the agency said it wants its contractor to use “government-furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation services to verify alien address information, investigate alternative alien address information, confirm the new location of aliens, and deliver materials/documents to aliens as appropriate.”

That might include searching through public records, social media sites, and other apps for information, then using the results to track down an undocumented immigrant’s home and job.

The request also asked for “a collection of photos and documents” to verify the addresses, and asked contractors to document each visit and provide “time-stamped photographs of the location.”

Then they would report back to the feds as soon as possible.

Given the Trump administration’s fixation on deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, the work will be plentiful. Department of Homeland Security officials said its initial docket would include the names of 10,000 people, and that could balloon up to 1 million over time.

The agency also offered an “incentive-based pricing structure” that pays out based on the contractor’s success rate, according to the document.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security will pay more if the contractor verifies an immigrant’s home on the first try or finishes 90% of the caseload before the deadline.

“This encourages the vendor to prioritize accuracy, efficiency, and professionalism in their operations,” an agency official wrote.

In his letter, Krishnamoorthi, the Illinois congressman, pilloried the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for those pay incentives, which he said turn contractors into bounty hunters.

“In such a system built on quotas and cash rewards with minimal oversight, mistakes are not just possible — they are certain. When that happens, it is not a paperwork error but an entirely predictable violation of rights with real human costs,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

“This approach does not invite abuse; it guarantees it, putting the liberty and well-being of the American public at risk,” he wrote.

Reisman, of the ACLU, would agree.

“It’s really dangerous to get private companies invested in the mission of investigating, arresting, and detaining people — it makes the incentives profit-based,” he said.

“That means the system is not geared towards justice or mercy or fairness,” he said. “It’s geared towards getting more money.”",https://jerseyvindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/K104269-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 06:58:45.954302

The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers are again positioning the state in direct opposition to the Trump administration, this time with legislation that would allow residents to sue federal immigration officials for alleged constitutional violations.

The proposal, Senate Bill 747, authored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, seeks to close what supporters call a longstanding legal loophole that shields federal law enforcement officers from civil lawsuits in cases where state or local officers could be held liable.

Wiener has dubbed the measure the “No Kings Act,” arguing it is necessary amid increased immigration enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“We’re here today because ICE and the Trump administration are trampling over the Constitution and need to be held accountable,” Wiener said. “We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE.”

Under current federal law — specifically Section 1983 of the U.S. Code — individuals may sue state or local officials for violations of constitutional rights, but federal officers are excluded. SB 747 would create a state-level cause of action allowing lawsuits against federal agents for misconduct occurring in California.

Supporters say the bill does not break new legal ground but instead addresses an imbalance in accountability.

“We are not breaking radical new ground here,” said Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park. “We are closing a loophole.”

They also clarified the intention of the bill.

“This is not an attack on law enforcement. This bill is not anti-law enforcement. This bill is pro Constitution, pro accountability and pro public trust,"" said Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park.

Civil liberties advocates argue the lack of accountability has left victims with little recourse. Anya Bidwell, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, said federal officers are often able to avoid lawsuits because courts routinely dismiss claims under doctrines such as discretionary immunity.

“If this were state or local officials, we would be in court right now,” Bidwell said.

The Institute for Justice represents George Retes, a U.S. citizen and military veteran who was detained for 72 hours by ICE last July while driving to work. Retes said officers broke his car window, deployed tear gas and pepper spray, and forcibly removed him despite his claims that he did not resist.

“I was free to go, and I just got to live with the experience that they put me through,” Retes said.

Bidwell said Retes has not filed a lawsuit because existing law makes such cases unlikely to succeed. That is why the two stand firmly behind SB 747.

“The reason ICE does what it does is because they know it is extremely difficult to sue,” she said.

Opponents argue the bill would infringe on federal authority and create legal chaos by allowing states to regulate federal agents.

“We cannot have 50 different states deciding how they think we should be operating,” said Bill Essayli, first assistant U.S. attorney. “The states do not have the authority to regulate federal agents, period.”

Essayli added that it's Congress that regulates federal authorities.

Republican lawmakers also criticized the proposal. Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale -- who served in law enforcement for decades himself -- said the bill could further inflame anti-law-enforcement sentiment.

“I believe that this is going to feed a fire of anti-law enforcement that is unjustified,” Lackey said.

Supporters acknowledge that Congress could amend federal law to address the issue directly but argue states must act in the absence of federal reform.

If passed, SB 747 would apply only to incidents occurring in California and would be retroactive to March 1, 2025, a provision that could open the door to lawsuits over recent enforcement actions.

The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability. A separate bill by the senator that would restrict most officers from wearing masks while on duty is scheduled for a hearing this week and has already drawn opposition from the Trump administration.

The bill passed through the Senate Judicial Committee with a majority vote late Tuesday. The bill advances to the Senate Appropriations Committee next then would advance to the Senate floor.

This article features a Government Accountability Project case and was originally published here.

Lawmakers from both parties and houses of Congress have agreed to provide about $653 million to fund Voice of America’s parent agency, rejecting President Donald Trump’s demand to defund the international broadcaster and shut it down.

The outlay is included in a broader bipartisan spending deal negotiated by House and Senate appropriators. The package still requires House and Senate approval before heading to Trump’s desk.

“We understand the realities of the appropriations process, but I am disappointed that Congress is proposing half a billion dollars more in funding than we requested,” Kari Lake, the deputy CEO installed by Trump to shut down the agency, wrote in a statement Monday. “While reductions from prior years are a step in the right direction, USAGM can still advance President Trump’s message and share America’s story globally without wasting so much taxpayer money.”

The bipartisan commitment to funding USAGM reflects continued congressional support for America’s role in promoting the free flow of news and information abroad, a long-standing foundation of its soft power around the world.

Congress’s funding proposal comes after a dire year for USAGM. Trump signed an executive order in March calling for the dismantlement of the government agency, which oversees Voice of America and funds nonprofit groups including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. To carry out the order, Lake placed more than 1,300 Voice of America staffers on paid administrative leave — many of whom are still not working — and halted broadcasting operations the same month.

Lake, a former Arizona television anchor who lost high-profile races for governor and U.S. Senate in recent years, has defended the cuts and called for the agency’s eventual elimination. She told Congress in a June hearing that USAGM was “incompetent, corrupt, biased, and a threat to America’s national security and standing in the world.” She has also said USAGM is “not salvageable.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in April ordering the agency to uphold its statutory obligations for broadcasting. As a result, VOA began producing content again in four languages: Farsi, Pashto, Dari and Mandarin. (VOA previously broadcast in 49 languages.)

When Lake subsequently ordered mass layoffs at USAGM through a reduction-in-force, or RIF, Lamberth blocked her from doing so, saying those cuts would put the agency out of compliance with his injunction. He also chastised Lake and her “concerning disrespect” for the law and ordered that she be deposed under threat of contempt proceedings.

Lamberth, an 82-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan, also criticized the administration for not spending what it was appropriated by Congress. “When Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for FY 2025, it did not anticipate that such a significant sum of taxpayer funds would be used to pay employees to sit at home for months on end, making no contribution to VOA’s statutory mandate,” Lamberth wrote, noting the total specifically appropriated for VOA’s use in USAGM’s last budget.

The bill allocates $199.5 million of the total appropriation to VOA and $138 million for USAGM’s operations. Additionally, nonprofit grantees will also be funded through this bill to the tune of $112.5 million for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, $69 million for Middle East Broadcasting Networks, $53.5 million for Radio Free Asia and $40.5 million for the Open Technology Fund. The Trump administration pushed to defund the nonprofit media outlets, but Lamberth has largely restored their funding in court after they all sued.

Radio Free Asia previously said it was pausing operations but in recent months has resumed some publishing activities. “With new funding, if enacted, RFA anticipates ramping up additional news operations that have been paused in the Asia-Pacific region,” RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan said in a statement.

Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the top Democrat on the state and foreign operations subcommittee, applauded the bipartisan negotiation that led to the bill but expressed worry that it still represented a cut to government broadcasters.

“While the bill ensures continued funding for our international broadcasting grantees,” he wrote in a statement, “it forces cuts at a time when they are trying to provide critical services in Ukraine, the Middle East, and across the Indo-Pacific.”

Schatz and his House counterpart, Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Florida), previously criticized the Trump administration’s “illegal gutting” of the agency.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Florida), the Senate and House appropriations subcommittee chairs, did not respond to requests for comment.",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_2345816587.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 00:57:24.990375

Retes, a contracted security guard at the farm that was raided, said he was brought to Port Hueneme Naval Base. Officials swabbed his cheek to obtain DNA, and then moved him to Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He was not allowed to make a phone call or see an attorney, he said.

“I did not resist, I did not impede or assault any agent,” Retes said.”What happened to me that day was not a misunderstanding. It was a violation of the Constitution by the very people sworn to uphold it.”

He also accused Department of Homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin of spreading false information about him to justify his detention. DHS said in a statement last year that Retes impeded their operation, which he denies.

Retes has filed a tort claim against the U.S. government, a process that is rarely successful, said his attorney, Anya Bidwell.

Lawsuits can also be brought through the Bivens doctrine, which refers to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Agents that established that federal officials can be sued for monetary damages for constitutional violations. But in recent decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly restricted the ability to sue under Bivens.

Wiener’s bill, if passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be retroactive to March 2025.

“We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE,” said Wiener at a news conference before the hearing. “We need the rule of law and we need accountability.”

Weiner is running for the congressional seat held by former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).

Representatives for law enforcement agencies appeared at Tuesday’s hearing to ask for amendments to ensure that the bill wouldn’t lead to weakened protections for state and local officials.

“We’re not opposed to the intent of the bill. We’re just concerned about the future and the unintended consequences for your California employees,” said David Mastagni, speaking on behalf of the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, which represents more than 85,000 public safety members.

Wiener’s bill is the latest effort by the state Legislature to challenge President Trump’s immigration raids. Newsom last year signed legislation authored by Wiener that prohibits law enforcement officials, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks, with some exceptions.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95cd40f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4277x2245+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F93%2F87e0f4594209aa9a142572c4ae05%2Fimmigration-raids-los-angeles-76939.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 23:57:26.319451

Blanco Gallegos told News4 he fears what would happen if his husband is deported back to his home country.","A D.C. couple has been forced apart for more than a month and now their future together is in limbo.

The husbands are a mixed-status couple — Jonathan Blanco Gallegos is a U.S. citizen, and his husband, Elias Perez-Zuazo, is undocumented.

Perez-Zuazo was detained Dec. 10 during what they thought was supposed to be a routine, annual check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The couple was already in the process of applying for Perez-Zuazo’s green card.

Blanco Gallegos and Perez-Zuazo were married in D.C. Feb. 27, 2024. At the time, the idea of life apart was unthinkable. Now, it’s their reality.

“Basically, it feels like something from inside you,” Blanco Gallegos said. “They take him away, and your life’s put on pause. And I need somebody to come back and press play, right, but it’s not gonna happen.”

Perez-Zuazo had a check-in with ICE at a facility in Chantilly, Virginia, which Blanco Gallegos says his husband had been doing annually. What normally would take 45 minutes, Blanco Gallegos says, took several hours. As he waited for Perez-Zuazo in the parking lot, he realized something was wrong.

“He has been detained with no reason, no excuse, no paperwork, no nothing,” he said. “They just give me his stuff outside of the parking lot. An ICE agent coming out from the building and says, ‘oh, are you Elias' husband?’ Yes. ‘Okay, here is his stuff. He's been in detention.’”

Perez-Zuazo is from Panama. Blanco Gallegos says his husband crossed into the U.S. without documentation in November 2021. Blanco Gallegos says his husband was processed by immigration authorities at the Texas/Mexico border and was released on his own recognizance, allowed to go live with a sponsor in Washington, D.C. while his immigration case played out in court.

Perez-Zuazo and Blanco Gallegos met in 2023, started dating and eventually got married. They’ve started the green card application process and have made some progress. Perez-Zuazo’s I-130 petition was approved, which is the first step needed for someone to obtain U.S. residency through a spouse or family member. But now, with Perez-Zuazo detained and with no clarity over if or when he’ll be released, Blanco Gallegos says he’s not sure that the future they pictured will come together.

“I got home; my bed is empty. He's not in there. He's not cooking anymore for me. So it's so many things that your life changed,” he said. “Like from day to night. My heart is broken.”

Blanco Gallegos says their attorney has been seeking clarity from ICE, trying to figure out why his husband was detained and whether he’s facing any charges. Blanco Gallegos claims ICE has not been responsive.

News4 reached out to the agency asking why Perez-Zuazo was detained. ICE sent a statement which says, “On December 10, ICE arrested Elias Enoc Perez-Zuazo, an illegal alien from Panama. He illegally crossed the border in November 2021 and was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration. He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 2021 and was RELEASED into this country by the Biden administration. This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.”

Blanco Gallegos shared his husband’s “Order of Release On Recognizance” form with News4 – which was issued by ICE. The form states Perez-Zuazo was placed in removal proceedings after he was initially processed by immigration authorities in November 2021, but so far, News4 has been unable to find out if an immigration judge has issued a deportation order for Perez-Zuazo. A search for his case in the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online database yields zero results. Perez-Zuazo’s attorney denies that an immigration judge has issued a deportation order, saying that’s not consistent with the documents he’s reviewed in the case and argues that if such an order was actually issued, Perez-Zuazo would have already been deported.

In the meantime, Perez-Zuazo’s attorney filed a ""habeas corpus petition” in federal court, which challenges the detention, characterizing it as unlawful. Blanco Gallegos told News4 he fears what would happen if his husband is deported back to his home country.

“It’s going to be hard since Panama is not a gay-friendly country,” he said. “Because same-sex couples is not allowed over there. So our life is going to be at risk.”

Perez-Zuazo’s case underscores the Trump Administration’s massive push to detain immigrants in ICE facilities. According to the latest data compiled by the The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, the number of people detained by ICE jumped by nearly 40,000 from 2024 to 2025.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2026/01/DC-couple-in-limbo-after-husband-is-detained-by-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-13 23:57:22.567636

Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.
Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

The quick pronouncement by administration officials before any meaningful investigation could be completed has raised concerns about the federal government’s determination to conduct a thorough review of the chain of events precipitating the shooting. Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/464f823/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2194+0+204/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F36%2F79%2F6a20b336abcc5a36022284269229%2F36c7ff5099fa495885f8579d8a5b0355,N,,2026-01-14 00:57:34.572282

“We’re going to revoke the citizenship of any naturalised immigrant from Somalia or anywhere else who is convicted of defrauding our citizens,” Trump said on Tuesday.

The administration has additionally cut off Minnesota’s access to federal childcare assistance and surged immigration enforcement agents to the state, home to a sizeable Somali population, prompting widespread anger and condemnation from local and state officials over aggressive immigration raids.

Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.","Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on Tuesday over the Justice Department’s push to investigate the widow of a woman killed by an ICE agent and the department’s reluctance to investigate the shooter, according to people with knowledge of their decision.

Joseph H. Thompson, who was second in command at the U.S. attorney’s office and oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that has roiled Minnesota’s political landscape, was among those who quit on Tuesday, according to three people with knowledge of the decision.

Mr. Thompson’s resignation came after senior Justice Department officials pressed for a criminal investigation into the actions of the widow of Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman killed by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

Mr. Thompson, 47, a career prosecutor, objected to that approach, as well as to the Justice Department’s refusal to include state officials in investigating whether the shooting itself was lawful, the people familiar with his decision said.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said in an interview that Mr. Thompson’s resignation dealt a major blow to efforts to root out rampant theft from state agencies. The fraud cases, which involve schemes to cheat safety net programs, were the chief reason the Trump administration cited for its immigration crackdown in the state. The vast majority of defendants charged in the cases are American citizens of Somali origin.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making the fraud cases, it tells you this isn’t really about prosecuting fraud,” Mr. O’Hara said.

The other senior career prosecutors who resigned include Harry Jacobs, Melinda Williams and Thomas Calhoun-Lopez. Mr. Jacobs had been Mr. Thompson’s deputy overseeing the fraud investigation, which began in 2022. Mr. Calhoun-Lopez was the chief of the violent and major crimes unit.

Mr. Thompson, Mr. Jacobs, Ms. Williams and Mr. Calhoun-Lopez declined to discuss the reasons they resigned. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tuesday’s resignations followed tumultuous days at the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota as prosecutors there and in Washington struggled to manage the outrage over Ms. Good’s killing, which set off angry protests in Minnesota and across the nation.

After Ms. Good was shot, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, told her staff that she would not consider opening an investigation into whether the agent had violated federal law, according to three current and former department officials who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the situation. At least four prosecutors who had already intended to quit or retire signaled they would accelerate their departures, those officials said.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation” into the ICE agent.

Instead, the Justice Department launched an investigation to examine ties between Ms. Good and her wife, Becca, and several groups that have been monitoring and protesting the conduct of immigration agents in recent weeks. Shortly after Wednesday’s fatal shooting, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, referred to Ms. Good as a “domestic terrorist.”

Mr. Thompson strenuously objected to the decision not to investigate the shooting as a civil rights matter, and was outraged by the demand to launch a criminal investigation into Becca Good, according to the people familiar with the developments, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.

Mr. Thompson had originally set out to investigate the shooting in partnership with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state agency that reviews police shootings. Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.

Drew Evans, the superintendent of the bureau, called Mr. Thompson’s departure a major setback for the effort to root out fraud in the state and for public safety.

“We’re losing a true public servant,” said Mr. Evans. “We really need professional prosecutors.”

The absence of a credible and comprehensive investigation into Ms. Good’s killing stands to “undermine trust in our public safety agencies,” Mr. Evans added.

Mr. Thompson’s departure came during the chaotic immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which has angered many residents and left officials bracing for an escalation of violence.

Begun in December with the deployment of roughly 100 federal agents from out of state, the operation has swelled to include some 2,000 federal agents. By comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.

Local leaders and immigrant rights groups have decried the agents’ conduct, saying that they have been stopping people based only on looks and accents. Often, these stops have led to the violent arrest of both immigrants and American citizens, according to local officials and observers who have recorded mayhem using cell phones.

On Monday, Minnesota’s attorney general and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an end to the crackdown, asserting that it had led to numerous abuses and civil rights violations.

The Minneapolis police chief, Mr. O’Hara, told The New York Times in an interview that the operation could lead to more deaths and the kind of widespread civil unrest that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

The Trump administration has cited the fraud investigation that Mr. Thompson led to justify the surge of agents, which federal officials have called the largest immigration enforcement operation in history.

Most of the defendants charged to date are of Somali ancestry, but are American citizens by birth or naturalization.

President Trump and several top aides have seized on the matter to argue that Somalis are swindling the nation. Mr. Trump has called Somalis “garbage,” and he said his administration was considering denaturalizing some, because, he says, “they hate our country.”

Mr. Thompson grew frustrated in recent weeks as the immigration surge became a distraction for the office’s work on fraud, undermining the goal the administrations said it was trying to pursue, according to people familiar with his thinking.

The fraud cases — which involve plots to bill state agencies for safety net services that were never provided — have cost taxpayers several billion dollars, according to Mr. Thompson.

After new facets of the investigation came to light this fall, the scandal became a major crisis for Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who has struggled to explain why so much money was stolen on his watch.

But this month, facing threats and investigations from federal agencies, the governor suspended his campaign. Mr. Walz said he concluded that the work of rooting out fraud demanded his entire attention during the final year of his term, which will end shortly after the end of this year.

Mr. Walz lamented Mr. Thompson’s resignation on Tuesday, calling him “a principled public servant who spent more than a decade achieving justice for Minnesotans.” He added: “It’s also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants.”

Mr. Thompson’s departure is a major blow to the effort.

(January 13, 2026)—Today, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem demanding records and information about the hiring of individuals connected to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol and the use of face coverings by federal law enforcement officers to hide their identities.

“We know that some participants in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have been rewarded with high-ranking positions in the Department of Justice (DOJ). However, it remains unclear how many more have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents and officers that have dragged, tackled, beaten, tased, shot, and killed citizens and non-citizens alike in communities around the country,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Earlier this month, Ranking Member Raskin and House Judiciary Committee Democrats released a report documenting the careers of individuals involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election who are now employed in senior roles within the DOJ and DHS.

For example, Jared Wise, a former Supervisory Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), stormed the Capitol on January 6. He threatened police and applauded violence against them, shouting: “Yeah, fuck them! Yeah, kill ‘em!” After President Trump issued a blanket pardon for January 6 rioters, Wise escaped accountability for two pending felony charges—civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers—plus four additional offenses, including unlawful entry. Today, Wise serves as senior adviser to the Deputy Attorney General, alongside fellow January 6 participant Ed Martin, now the U.S. Pardon Attorney and head of the DOJ Weaponization Working Group.

DHS appears to be actively courting pardoned January 6 participants. It has deployed white nationalist “dog whistles” in its recruitment campaign for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seemingly targeting members of extremist militias—including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters—involved in the insurrection. The campaign launched with a $50,000 sign-on bonus, elimination of college degree requirements, and relaxed vetting standards.

Less than one year into Donald Trump’s second term, masked DHS agents and officers have terrorized communities, including more than 170 US citizens who have been detained. Unlike any other law enforcement agency or armed services branch, ICE officers conceal their identities by wearing masks and removing their names from uniforms. Last week, a masked ICE agent shot a mother of three(link is external) at point-blank range as she attempted to drive away from him.

“Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6 and were convicted of their offenses? The American people deserve to know how many of these violent insurrectionists have been given guns and badges by this Administration,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Ranking Member Raskin is demanding that Bondi and Noem produce information on federal agents’ use of facial coverings to obscure their identities and provide information on all individuals employed by DOJ and DHS who have received or sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, or who have been charged or investigated in connection with the January 6, 2021 attack.",,N,,2026-01-13 21:57:21.825019

As ICE agents and civilians clashed on Jan. 12 near the intersection of Third Street North and 33rd Avenue North in St. Cloud, some St. Cloud-area residents continue to keep an eye on where agents go next. Those interested in ICE activities are posting sightings online at iceout.org.

As of Jan. 13, there are unconfirmed civilian reports listed on iceout.org in St. Cloud, Clear Lake, Clearwater and Princeton. These civilian submissions typically disclose the time of the sighting, whether it is confirmed, what type of activity was observed and the uniform the agents were wearing.

There are several categories of sightings on iceout.org. Report types include observed, active and critical. Observed includes activities like eating or visiting a gas station, active includes questioning people and critical includes raids, according to the website.

Tensions with ICE agents have increased after an agent on Jan. 7 reportedly shot Renee Good, 37, in south Minneapolis. The shooting sparked protests across the country.

The website is often referred to as People Over Papers, according to the site, which is powered by the Pueblo Project Foundation.

What to know about Monday's clash in St. Cloud

Immigration agents reportedly tried to detain one individual midday near Star Market, 3425 Third Street N., according to state Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud. He said some people at the strip mall engaged with ICE agents. Putnam said he was at the scene to reduce tension.

“ICE came to collect one individual,” Putnam said. “The community responded.”

There were at least 65 ICE agents present and at least 50 civilians. Immigration officials reportedly pepper-sprayed individuals at the scene, including St. Cloud resident Ali Warsme. It was not disclosed as to what perpetuated the pepper spray.

”I was one of the first people who got sprayed,” Warsme said. “Luckily someone had milk, but my eyes are still irritated.""

St. Cloud Police Chief Jeffrey Oxton wrote in a statement that he was not initially aware of a federal operation taking place in St. Cloud on Monday. Oxton said the operation happened in the strip mall's parking lot. St. Cloud police assisted with crowd control.

On Monday night, a group of at least 25 protesters voiced frustrations about ICE agents in St. Cloud outside area hotels where they thought agents might be staying.

Immigration surge in Minnesota

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security deployed roughly 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota earlier this month. That deployment started on Jan. 4, just days before Good's death. The DHS said the shooting was an act of self-defense by the agent, while local leaders, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, dispute that claim.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference on Jan. 7. ""Having seen the video myself I want to tell everybody directly, that is bull----.""

United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that hundreds of additional ICE agents would be deployed to the North Star State.

USA TODAY reports that Minnesota and Illinois sued Noem on Monday. Officials in Minnesota want the DHS to stop deploying agents to the state, according to USA TODAY. While Illinois wants bar federal agents to stop tactics like excessive force, such as chemical agents.

Pending court approval, case will be fully and permanently resolved in Maryland’s favor

BALTIMORE, MD – Attorney General Anthony G. Brown today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss its appeal of the final judgment that permanently blocks the Trump administration’s effort to unlawfully impose immigration enforcement requirements on U.S. Department of Transportation grants and other funding that amount to more than $1 billion a year for Maryland. By dropping its appeal, the Trump administration submits to the lower court ruling, fully resolving the case in favor of Maryland and the 21 other states that sued the administration.

“The Trump administration’s unlawful actions threatened funding that keeps Marylanders safe and our State moving,” said Attorney General Brown. “Our lawsuit protected the federal resources that maintain our roads and bridges, support public transit, reduce deadly crashes, and ensure people can get to work, school, and their homes safely. Those investments are essential to Maryland’s economy, public safety, and daily life.

Maryland receives more than $1 billion a year in funding from the Department of Transportation to build and maintain vital travel infrastructure like the roads, highways, airways, and bridges that connect communities and carry their residents to their workplaces and homes. This includes the funding necessary to prevent fatal traffic accidents and stop drunk drivers; the funding to provide transit for seniors and those with disabilities; and the funding that protects and restores roads after environmental disasters like fires or flooding. Neither the purpose of these funding programs, nor the criteria that govern them, are in any way connected to immigration enforcement.

The Constitution is clear: Congress, not the President, decides how federal money is spent. And for decades, Congress has passed laws guaranteeing funding to states like Maryland to improve their roads and protect those who use them — funds that the federal government generally has by virtue of the taxes it receives from the people of Maryland and other states. Yet despite the constraints imposed by Congress and the Constitution, the Trump administration attempted to seize Congress’s power of the purse by imposing unlawful conditions on transportation funding. In doing so, the Trump administration violated two key principles that underlie the American system: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act outside the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government is subject to strict limits when it seeks to use the spending power to influence states to adopt its preferred policies.

On November 4, 2025, the district court issued final judgment in favor of Maryland and the states that challenged this unlawful conduct, issuing an order permanently enjoining the Trump administration from unlawfully imposing the conditions and vacating the conditions across all U.S. Department of Transportation funding programs. In issuing its decision, the Court found that the Trump administration has “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitutions demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Illinois and Minnesota officials are separately suing the Trump administration over the enforcement tactics used by federal immigration agents.

The lawsuits seek broader limits on the conduct of immigration agents in both states.

It comes after last week’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Following the shooting, Vice President JD Vance said the agent was “protected by absolute immunity.”

The Illinois lawsuit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsti Noem and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, among others, as defendants. A spokesperson for DHS said the lawsuit is “baseless,” and that DHS looks forward to “proving that in court.”

Harold Krent, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss the lawsuits and the legality of immigration agents’ use of force.

Do immigration agents have absolute immunity?

“The vice president is simply wrong. There have been a number of cases and judicial pronouncements that say that the individuals are not absolutely immune, and no Supreme Court decision has ever held that. That being said, the road to a prosecution by a state official is tough, and obviously we’re not going to see a federal prosecution in this administration, but there could be a federal prosecution in a subsequent administration. There are some civil damages routes that are available as well. … There are some avenues available for some kind of accountability.”

Could the Illinois and Minnesota lawsuits clash with the Supremacy Clause?

“What Illinois and Minnesota are saying is that the use of these aggressive tactics, moving patrols, interrogations and the use of tear gas, is simply trying to bludgeon the states into changing their form of government, which is also protected under the Constitution in our 10th Amendment. What these lawsuits are saying is that this use of aggressive tactics is trying to brow-beat the states into abandoning their sanctuary policies to protect migrants within the communities, and that the use of tactics to affect that aim is actually itself a violation of the Constitution because of the rights protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution.”

Several supervisors in the criminal section of the Justice Department's civil rights division have also given notice of their departures, they said.

The resignations follow growing tensions over a decision by the Trump administration to block the state out of the investigation into the shooting of Renee Good, who was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week.

Lawyers in the civil rights division, which generally investigates high-profile officer shootings, were also recently told that the section would not be involved in the probe at this stage, two people familiar with the matter said.

The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into Good's killing, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the division out of the investigation marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said.

At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

Concerns over political pressure

The resignations are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations ""a loss for our state and for public safety"" and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics.

Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the civil rights division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday.

The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program ""well before the events in Minnesota,"" and added that ""any suggestion to the contrary is false.""

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the civil rights division has a long history of investigating shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges.

The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what's known as a ""pattern or practice"" investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0e7621b9-d53a-4bc5-95b5-ed33bf43e6ea,1768343522203/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C189%2C2796%2C1572%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-13 22:58:38.049489

Santa Clara County has taken a stand against President Donald Trump in court over the last year, challenging efforts to end birthright citizenship, disrupt federal funding for not complying with Trump’s agenda and more.

The county sued the federal administration nine times in 2025 — and has won favorable rulings in five cases. During Trump’s first term, the county filed seven lawsuits in total. The actions are part of a broader effort of local governments, organizations and states fighting against Trump’s actions. California has sued the administration 53 times so far, including its most recent lawsuit over Trump freezing welfare and child care funding.

“When brazen, politically motivated and unlawful edicts are imposed by fiat — disregarding the rule of law and harming our residents — we have a duty to act,” Otto Lee, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, told San José Spotlight. “We have taken decisive legal action to halt reckless, cruel and arbitrary orders and to protect our communities.”

Trump’s actions are putting $3.6 billion of federal funding at risk in the county every year, according to estimates provided by county officials. A spokesperson for County Executive James Williams said his office isn’t tracking how much is being spent on these lawsuits. The spokesperson said one case has protected $48 million in federal homeless funds, keeping more than 1,800 county residents housed.

“We are fortunate to have one of the strongest public law offices in the nation, steadfastly representing the interests of our county and our community every day,” Williams told San José Spotlight. “Time and time again, we have fought — and won — against the Trump administration in court before, and we will continue to push back against its unprecedented and unlawful overreach, which has only grown more extreme in this second term.”

Here are the lawsuits the county has filed and where they stand.

County of Santa Clara v. Trump

Santa Clara County filed a Jan. 30, 2025 lawsuit to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship, calling the order unlawful and unconstitutional.

Trump issued the order within hours of taking office on Jan. 20, calling for the rejection of a 150-year-old constitutional provision stating everyone born in the United States is a citizen regardless of their parents’ citizenship.

The 14th Amendment guaranteed birthright citizenship in 1868, as one of the post-Civil War reconstruction amendments to address the treatment of enslaved people. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the amendment in a 1898 ruling involving a baby born in San Francisco to Chinese parents, which was filed in the same federal court as Santa Clara County’s lawsuit.

The court issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump from ending birthright citizenship.

San Francisco v. Trump

After Trump issued executive orders to deny federal funding to “sanctuary” cities, San Francisco, Santa Clara County and other local governments sued the Trump administration on Feb. 7, 2025. A sanctuary city protects immigrants by limiting local cooperation with federal immigration agents.

A preliminary injunction was granted, protecting the 50 plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit including Oakland, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Portland, Oregon and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The case is ongoing before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

“At a time when we continue to see tremendous federal overreach, the court’s ruling affirms that local governments can serve their mission and maintain trust with the communities they care for,” Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti previously said in a statement.

Louisiana v. Department of Commerce

On Jan. 17, 2025 Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and Ohio sued the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Census Bureau, challenging a longstanding rule that counts all residents for the census. The states argued only citizens should be counted in the census. Santa Clara County intervened on Feb. 14, 2025 as a defendant.

The case was temporarily paused to allow time for the new leadership at the Department of Commerce to transition.

American Federation of Government Employees v. Trump

A coalition of labor unions and local governments including Santa Clara County sued Trump on April 28, 2025 in response to an executive order to conduct mass reductions in the workforce and reorganize federal agencies.

A preliminary injunction was granted to block the mass layoffs from happening in the agencies named in the lawsuit, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on June 2, and the justices intervened to allow Trump to continue restructuring the agencies.

The case was vacated and sent back to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where the case is being litigated. The federal government must produce a plan for the restructuring as part of the discovery process.

King County v. Turner

Santa Clara County, San Francisco and more than 70 local governments sued the Trump administration on May 2, 2025 for imposing conditions onto grants to align with the president’s policy agenda, including prohibiting programs supporting immigrants, abortion and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

A preliminary injunction was granted, blocking the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services and HUD from imposing these requirements. The case is ongoing before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The Department of Health and Human Services issues the most grants of any federal agency, providing funding for child welfare, social services and more. Santa Clara County gets more than $275 million through the department annually.

“The grant funding at stake in this lawsuit is more important than ever in light of the unprecedented federal funding cuts the county is facing,” LoPresti said in a statement. “These grants are essential for the county’s work to deliver lifesaving care at our hospitals and clinics, prevent infectious disease, serve vulnerable children and families and many other services.”

County of Santa Clara v. Noem

Santa Clara County, San Francisco and more than two dozen local governments filed a Sept. 30, 2025 lawsuit challenging the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security for imposing conditions onto emergency funding to comply with Trump’s agenda. A preliminary injunction was granted, blocking the federal administration from withholding funding.

District 2 County Supervisor Betty Duong said the administration’s attempt to cut emergency funding puts thousands of lives in danger, particularly the most vulnerable Americans.

“County of Santa Clara v. Noem is a prime example of the mean-spiritedness and pettiness of the current federal administration,” Duong told San José Spotlight. “I am so proud that our county is a leader in this lawsuit. And I’m also proud that the court agrees with us that the Constitution forbids the Trump administration from forcing local governments to abandon their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in order to receive lifesaving federal funding that has long been critical to safeguarding the safety and resilience of our communities.”

San Francisco v. Department of Justice

Santa Clara County, San Francisco, San Diego and Tucson, Arizona sued the Trump administration on Oct. 28, 2025 in response to the U.S. Department of Justice imposing requirements to comply with Trump’s agenda to receive Community Oriented Policing Services grants. The case is ongoing.

The grants are one of the federal government’s primary sources of funding for local law enforcement agencies, and have allowed jurisdictions to create community policing programs and more. More than $21 billion in grants has been given since the program was established in 1994.

National Council of Nonprofits v. McMahon

The county — along with a coalition of nonprofits, unions and local governments — filed a lawsuit on Nov. 3, 2025 against Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for disqualifying those not aligned with Trump’s agenda from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, including organizations working toward LGBTQ+ rights and racial equity. The case is ongoing.

The loan forgiveness program allows people working in public service and certain nonprofits to have their federal student loans forgiven after 10 years if they have made monthly payments.

National Alliance to End Homelessness v. HUD

The county, San Francisco and other local governments and nonprofits sued the federal administration on Dec. 1, 2025 in its attempt to upend grants dedicated to permanent housing programs.

A judge has temporarily blocked HUD from stripping permanent housing funds and moving it to temporary housing programs.

“At a time when the federal government is taking aggressive action to undermine the Constitution, attack our immigrant communities and strip critical funding for health care and other services, the county has been proud to stand as an example of good government that remains deeply committed to serving our residents,” LoPresti told San José Spotlight. “We’re taking a multifaceted approach to responding to the Trump administration’s policies. Litigation has been — and will continue to be — an important tool for protecting the county’s interests.”

According to the report, DHS intends to build several detention centers across the country, including in Kansas City, to hold approximately 80,000 immigrants. DHS recently awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to an organization that had no previous history of government contracts to facilitate the plan—which is just shy of the $30 million threshold that requires the administration to justify forgoing a competition process for the award.

“Since day one, this administration has fractured communities with ICE raids and severed families with hundreds of thousands of deportations, sweeping up legal residents and American citizens in the process. While we believe strongly in an orderly immigration system, Kansas Citians and I do not want to see the stench of these extreme mass deportation policies centralized in Kansas City,” Congressman Cleaver wrote in a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons.

“No human deserves to be rounded up as cattle, shipped across the country, imprisoned in warehouses, and stripped of their dignity. The proposed plan will degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture,” Rep. Cleaver continued.

“America’s immigration system is far from perfect, and border security is a key component. But those millions of dollars for detention centers would be better spent on finding criminals rather than attacking families and those with no criminal history,” Cleaver concluded.

In addition to condemning the administration’s plans, Rep. Cleaver requested answers to the following questions by January 23:

Has the administration briefed Congress on the plans and locations of these facilities?

Why did the administration pursue a no-bid contract, as opposed to a competitive, transparent application process?

Will the administration provide Congress and the general public with the locations of the proposed facilities?

How has the administration coordinated with local governments? Will the administration honor the local zoning policies and process?

The official letter from Rep. Cleaver is available here.

United States two complicated questions concerning federal habeas review.

Federal habeas law allows persons to challenge in federal court the grounds for their detention. It creates separate procedures for state inmates seeking relief from their state convictions in federal court and for federal inmates challenging their federal convictions. Addressing that division, Bowe identified two ways in which the procedures for state and federal inmates differ in federal court.

The case deals with federal inmates who are filing a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (the habeas statute for federal inmates) to challenge their convictions and sentences. In Bowe’s case, he filed multiple motions under Section 2255 seeking to invalidate his guilty plea to a firearm offense resulting from his role in a robbery of an armored car in which two guards were shot. But before a federal inmate like Bowe may file a successive Section 2255 motion, the inmate must satisfy certain gatekeeping requirements. The gatekeeping requirements are described in general terms in Section 2255(h), which sets forth two possible grounds for getting relief in a successive Section 2255 motion – newly discovered evidence of innocence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court – and identifies procedures for pursuing a successive Section 2255 motion. As to the procedures, which were at the heart of the case, Section 2255(h) says that the successive motion “must be certified [approved of] as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals” before these motions may move forward.

The first question in Bowe addressed what happens if the panel of the court of appeals refuses to grant the inmate permission to file a successive motion (because it fails the gatekeeping requirements), which happened in Bowe’s case. Under one provision in Section 2244 – namely, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(E) – the inmate may not seek further review of an appellate panel’s decision before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court: “The grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application,” according to Section 2244(b)(3)(E), “shall not be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of certiorari.” One issue in Bowe was therefore whether that provision applies to federal inmates seeking to file a successive Section 2255 motion and whether the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review rulings on such a motion.

Court rejects interpretation that would limit its appellate jurisdiction

To understand the majority’s and dissent’s analyses of whether (or to what extent) Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to federal inmates, it is helpful to understand both the rules that apply to state – as opposed to federal – inmates and what the other provisions in Section 2244(b)(3) say. (Warning: it’s about to get complicated.)

To begin with, all of the justices agreed that Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to state inmates who file successive petitions seeking federal habeas relief and blocks state inmates from filing petitions for a writ of certiorari (or petitions for rehearing en banc (by the full court)) if a panel on the court of appeals refuses to grant permission to file the successive habeas petition.

The justices also all agreed that the preceding subsections in Section 2244(b)(3)(A) through (D) apply to state and federal inmates. Those provisions require that for an inmate to obtain authorization to file successive petitions from the appropriate federal court of appeals (Section 2244(b)(3)(A)), the authorization: (1) should be decided by a three-judge panel of the court of appeals (Section 2244(b)(3)(B)); (2) that the successive petition must make a prima facie case of satisfying the requirements for a successive habeas petition (Section 2244(b)(3)(C)); and (3) that the appellate panel should decide within 30 days of the inmate’s filing whether to grant or deny permission to file the successive petition (Section 2244(b)(3)(D)). The justices also seemed to agree that the bar on filing en banc petitions in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applies to both state and federal inmates.

But by a 5-4 vote, the justices held that the clause in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) barring certiorari petitions applies to state inmates only, and federal inmates may thus still seek Supreme Court review if the court of appeal’s panel denies them authorization to file a successive Section 2255 motion.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, began by invoking a principle that Congress must provide a “clear indication” in a statute before removing the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction and it had not done so here. Justice Sotomayor denied “that this clear-indication requirement comes from ‘thin air’” (as asserted in Justice Neil Gorsuch’s dissenting opinion). In addressing the clear-indication rule, the majority focused on a handful of Supreme Court opinions from the last several decades that briefly discuss the subject. Given that the issue implicates fundamental questions about the relationship between Congress and the Supreme Court, this discussion is surprisingly abbreviated, however. The court further invoked avoiding harsh consequences to habeas petitioners, but that rationale neither distinguishes federal from state inmates nor explains how its review of overwhelmingly nonprecedential decisions is particularly helpful to inmates.

Turning to how to apply the clear-indication rule, the majority did not dispute a variety of features of the habeas statutes that point toward Section 2244(b)(3)(E) applying to federal inmates: the statutory scheme overall limits successive habeas petitions; is designed to make adjudication of applications to file successive motions relatively speedy; and strips Supreme Court review for state inmates of a denial of permission to file a successive habeas petition. Also, closely neighboring provisions in Section 2244(b)(3)(A) though (D) apply to federal inmates.

Against those considerations, Justice Sotomayor relied on not only the clear-indication rule, but also stressed that when Section 2255(h) cross-references Section 2244, it does so by referring to what the court of appeals panel must do, not what the Supreme Court must do.

Gorsuch’s dissent, which Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas joined in full and which Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined as to the jurisdictional issue, relied on the language and structure of the habeas statutes in arguing that all of Section 2244(b)(3) applies to federal inmates. As Gorsuch summarized, “§2244 bars state prisoners (and governments) from invoking our certiorari jurisdiction to challenge adverse certification decisions. Section 2255 extends that bar to federal prisoners. And because that bar applies here, we lack jurisdiction to decide this case.”

Court rejects that statute barring inmates from refiling the same claim applies to federal inmates

After determining that the court possessed jurisdiction over Bowe’s petition, the justices turned to whether 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(1) applies to federal inmates. The majority concluded that it did not.

According to Section 2244(b)(1), “[a] claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under Section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.” Here, the court emphasized that Section 2244(b)(1) expressly refers to “Section 2254,” which governs only state inmates, not federal ones. Although the court rejected for several reasons that Section 2244(b)(1)’s bar on refiling the same claim applies to federal inmates, the court allowed in footnote 10 that common-law standards, like abuse of the writ, may still preclude “repetitive filings made by federal prisoners in the absence of § 2244(b)(1).” That said, little binding precedent elaborates on when common-law standards bar an inmate from raising a claim again – and the court thus left that issue unresolved.

Implications

Based on the above, the effects of Bowe will likely be limited. Although the case deals with a law stripping the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction – a matter of great importance – few other statutes do so. That said, if Congress seeks to strip jurisdiction in the future, it now knows that it must say so clearly.

As to habeas litigation, many practical considerations ought to limit how often the court agrees to review the denial of an application for a successive petition, including the stringent standards in Section 2255(h), statutes of limitations, and mootness, to name just a few. Indeed, for some of these reasons and others, it is unclear whether Bowe will lead to meaningful relief for Bowe himself on remand. Some features of Bowe may nevertheless engender further litigation in the lower courts. For example, parties may dispute whether the court left in place the bar on en banc review in Section 2244(b)(3)(E) for federal inmates. Presumably, the clear-indication rule deals with the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction and therefore does not apply to en banc review in a court of appeals, but defendants will point to ways that Sotomayor’s opinion could be read as stopping short of deciding the issue.

In short, Bowe is unlikely to yield seismic change in habeas litigation, but the breadth of the court’s discussion of habeas law may make it relevant to a variety of habeas issues.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/supremecourt-2-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 22:58:59.997992

At least five tribal citizens were reportedly detained by ICE last week in Minneapolis, reported ICT, an Indigenous news organization. Four are citizens of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, and the fifth is a descendant of the Red Lake Nation, the news organization reported.

Reports of Indigenous people being targeted by ICE agents prompted Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chair Steve Sitting Bear to issue a public safety alert on social media Friday.

Standing Rock is working on a designated telephone line to ensure tribal members know their rights if they come into contact with immigration agents, Sitting Bear said in a statement.

“Our Nation is a sovereign government and our members are not immigrants,” he said. “We are not subject to immigration enforcement on our own lands.”

The Spirit Lake Nation and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate in a joint statement with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe said ICE’s activities in Minnesota have “caused fear and uncertainty” among their citizens.

The joint statement also condemned the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

“As Dakota people, we are reminded of the sacrifices of our ancestors and the enduring impacts of displacement and violence experienced by our Nations,” the tribes said.

Tribal governments have advised tribal members to carry tribal identification cards, certificates of degree of Indian blood or other official documentation.

The warnings come as at least 2,000 ICE agents are in neighboring Minnesota, with Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem reportedly ordering additional federal agents to the area.

“As tribal nations, our fundamental rights are not granted, they are inherent and written in our treaties, our sovereignty, and our laws,” North Dakota Native Vote Deputy Director Kendyl Harrison said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor. “Any attacks or discrimination on any Indigenous person is a clear violation and intrusion upon those rights.”

Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure in a Facebook post also denounced ICE’s activity as “divisive and abhorrent.” He told tribal citizens that ICE cannot go on tribal land without the consent of the tribe.

In addition to the incidents in Minneapolis, ICE reportedly detained multiple Arizona tribal citizens last year, with one woman nearly being deported in November, according to the Arizona Mirror.

Tribal leaders also urged citizens who are approached by immigration agents to contact their respective tribal governments, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Native American Rights Fund.

“We’re seeing the same reports that Native people are being unlawfully detained as U.S. citizens,” said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. “It appears that there is certainly unlawful force and violence being used in these detentions.”

He said the organization is investigating the reports. Campbell invited any tribal citizen who has been detained by ICE to contact his organization.

“We certainly welcome speaking to them to understand the issues and what has been happening, and looking at what a lawsuit may look like,” he said.

A public database tracking U.S. government contracts and spending shows that on Nov. 28, 2025, DHS and ICE awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to KPB Services LLC, a Holton, Kansas-based company owned and operated by the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.

The contract description states that KPB would be responsible for “due diligence services and concept design for processing centers and mega centers throughout the United States.”

These records coincide with a December 2025 report from the Washington Post, which describes a large-scale immigration enforcement operation spearheaded by the Trump administration to renovate seven industrial warehouses across the U.S.

The administration’s goal is to transform them into detention centers capable of housing approximately 80,000 immigrant detainees (up to 10,000 each) and renovate 16 smaller processing sites. These sites would have enough space for about 500-1,500 people at a time.

This operation is part of the Trump administration’s latest immigration efforts to make deportation operations more efficient for ICE, as they process and transport immigrant detainees in and out of these new facilities.

The Washington Post report lists six states as potential mega center sites, including Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri. Texas is slated to potentially see two new detention facilities in the eastern portion of the state, bringing the total number of facilities to seven.

Since news of the report spread, local politicians, like U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver, II, issued a statement condemning the DHS’s contract and asking the agency to share more information about its plans.

The long-time representative sent a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons on Tuesday, in which they stated that the contract with the Kansas-based company raises concerns, as KPB has no prior affiliation or contract with a government agency.

He said he fears a lack of transparency from KPB and that it may not meet the legal and safety requirements necessary to operate under a large-scale federal contract.

Cleaver added that since the Trump administration took over, it has “fractured communities” through its ongoing ICE raids and deportation efforts. He elaborated further, emphasizing his distaste for Kansas City having any association with said immigration processes.

“While we believe strongly in an orderly immigration system, Kansas Citians and I do not want to see the stench of these extreme mass deportation policies centralized in Kansas City.”

“No human deserves to be rounded up as cattle, shipped across the country, imprisoned in warehouses, and stripped of their dignity. The proposed plan will degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture,” Rep. Cleaver further stated.

The local representative concluded that, although he is aware that America’s immigration system is “far from perfect,” he would rather see the money from the nearly $30 million contract go toward “finding criminals rather than attacking families and those with no criminal history.”

Cleaver then added a list of four questions for the administration to answer by Jan. 23:

Has the administration briefed Congress on the plans and locations of these facilities?

Why did the administration pursue a no-bid contract, as opposed to a competitive, transparent application process?

Will the administration provide Congress and the general public with the locations of the proposed facilities?

How has the administration coordinated with local governments? Will the administration honor the local zoning policies and processes?

“Kansas Citians do not want this administration’s reckless, deadly, and incompetent deportation

policies in our back yards,” Cleaver stated in the letter.

“Instead of focusing on the root causes of mass migration and the growing costs of living for Americans, this administration is wasting taxpayer money on no-bid contracts with unqualified LLCs.”

Cleaver’s statement was further backed by Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, who said on Tuesday afternoon that his office is “working to verify press reports of potential DHS or ICE detention facilities in Kansas City.”

He concluded that he “stands in agreement with the words of Congressman Emanuel Cleaver that such a facility would be a stain on Kansas City.”

Over the course of the last year, the Trump administration has repurposed and reopened various facilities across the nation to serve as immigrant holding facilities.

Locally, the city of Leavenworth, Kansas, has been at the forefront of immigration talks, with CoreCivic having filed for a special use permit (SUP) back in December after a lengthy legal battle with the city to reopen and operate a small immigrant detention facility at the site of the former Leavenworth Detention Center.

The Tennessee-based company, which has owned the detention center since 1992, has seen several lawsuits from the City of Leavenworth since its facility shut down in 2021, and it was awarded a contract with ICE last year.

For months, CoreCivic fought the city and its demands that it file for an SUP — a key statute listed in Leavenworth law.

The company tried to claim that its contract with ICE gave it the authority to bypass this ordinance, allowing it to forcefully open the 1,000-person detention facility without the SUP.

However, CoreCivic’s opening was denied by a federal judge in May 2025, and it eventually complied with city law when it filed for the SUP in December.

Over the last year, Leavenworth has been the only local spot that has seen itself in the mix of immigration conversation. However, the latest news about the nearly $30 million contract with KPB, the Washington Post’s report and Cleaver’s letter to top DHS officials place Kansas City at the center of the debate.

Representative David Rouzer has already introduced the Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would make the Trump administration’s policy permanent through legislation.","The lawsuit stemmed from an April letter in which Duffy threatened to withhold billions in transportation funding from states that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell wrote in his November ruling that Duffy and DOT had “blatantly overstepped” their authority in attempting to link highway funding to immigration demands.

“The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior,” McConnell wrote.

What matters for trucking operations is that, while DOT lost this particular fight, the agency has pursued the same policy objectives through entirely different channels. Last week, Duffy announced the cancellation of $160 million in highway funding for California after the state missed a deadline to revoke 17,000 licenses issued to legal immigrants, including refugees and asylum seekers. That’s separate from the $40 million already withheld for California’s refusal to enforce English-language requirements for truckers.

These actions don’t require the same Congressional authorization that DOT sought in the dropped appeal. They’re structured as compliance enforcement actions under existing FMCSA authority, giving the agency a different legal footing entirely.

The Non-Domiciled CDL Situation Remains a Mess

For fleets relying on non-domiciled CDL holders, the regulatory environment has become nearly impossible to navigate. DOT’s September emergency interim final rule, which would have restricted non-domiciled CDL eligibility to only H-2A, H-2B, and E-2 visa holders, effectively eliminating approximately 194,000 drivers from the market, sits frozen under a D.C. Circuit Court stay.

The court’s November 13 order questioned whether non-domiciled CDL holders are actually underrepresented in fatal crashes. According to FMCSA’s own data, while they account for approximately 5% of all CDL holders, they represent only about 0.2% of fatal crashes. The court noted that DOT’s rule was based on five crashes out of more than 2,399 fatal crashes involving large trucks and buses through September 2025.

Even with the court stay in place, most states have chosen not to resume issuing non-domiciled CDLs. California is actively revoking 17,000 licenses it determined were improperly issued. Texas is conducting a full internal review with no timeline for reopening. Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio are proceeding with extreme caution.

Arizona technically resumed issuing non-domiciled CDLs, but only to the narrow categories the stay rule would have allowed anyway, not the broader pre-September eligibility criteria.

What This Means for Motor Carriers

Fleet operators with non-domiciled CDL holders on their roster need to understand that Tuesday’s dropped appeal changes nothing about their immediate operational challenges. The regulatory pressure on immigrant drivers isn’t going away; it’s being applied through different mechanisms.

Current non-domiciled CDL holders aren’t losing their licenses immediately under the stayed rule. But as those licenses come up for renewal over the next two years, FMCSA anticipates that roughly 190,000 of approximately 200,000 current holders would fail to meet the new eligibility requirements. The court stay pauses that outcome but doesn’t resolve it.

Carriers that built capacity around non-domiciled drivers are already reporting disruptions. Spot rates have increased in multiple regions as driver availability tightens, according to industry reports. The U.S. Postal Service announced last week it will require contracted trucking providers to phase out any use of non-domiciled CDL operators who haven’t been thoroughly vetted by the Postal Inspection Service.

Meanwhile, the American Trucking Associations at its November conference made a notable shift, acknowledging that the industry faces a shortage of “quality drivers” rather than an absolute driver shortage. Secretary Duffy has been unambiguous in his position: “We don’t need non-domiciled CDL drivers to make sure our goods flow through the country.”

The States Are On Their Own

The dropped appeal means states can’t be forced to participate in immigration enforcement as a condition of receiving transportation funding. But individual enforcement actions against states for alleged CDL compliance failures continue.

California faces the most aggressive enforcement posture. DOT alleges that more than 25% of non-domiciled CDLs reviewed in the state were improperly issued, with some licenses valid for years beyond the expiration of drivers’ legal presence documentation. State officials dispute the findings and claim California’s CDL holders have a fatal crash rate nearly 40% lower than the national average.

The legal battle will continue through separate proceedings. States that issued non-domiciled CDLs under the previous regulatory framework now face potential funding consequences for compliance failures, regardless of Tuesday’s dropped appeal.

Whats Next

For carriers, the future requires acknowledging that federal policy is actively hostile to non-domiciled CDL holders regardless of their legal status in the country. If you’re running a fleet that relies on non-domiciled drivers, you need a transition plan. That doesn’t mean immediate panic; the court stay provides breathing room, but it does mean recognizing that the current situation is temporary. Either the D.C. Circuit will eventually rule on the merits of DOT’s emergency rule, or Congress will act to codify the restrictions permanently.

Representative David Rouzer has already introduced the Non-Domiciled CDL Integrity Act, which would make the Trump administration’s policy permanent through legislation. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association supports the bill, arguing it protects “critical safety reforms from being undone by future court decisions or a new administration.”

The dropped appeal on transportation funding doesn’t change any of this. It’s one skirmish in a much larger campaign. Motor carriers would be wise to plan accordingly.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/08/Borderlands_Mexico_cargotheft.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 21:11:51.275985

The entirety of Kristi Noem’s tenure at DHS has marred by the trampling of the department’s stated values of “integrity, vigilance, and respect.""

Americans across the country have witnessed ICE and Border Patrol Agents in masks racially profiling Americans, using aggressive and often violent tactics against communities, destroying property, and violating people's civil rights. Guns have been pointed at protestors, and under Sec. Noem’s “leadership,” eight people have been shot by DHS, 5 of whom were U.S. citizens, and two were killed. One of those killings happened in Minneapolis last week, when an ICE agent shot and killed a mother of three. Instead of ensuring accountability and transparency would be at the center of a joint investigation with state officials, Noem immediately defended the agent, lied about what Americans saw for themselves, and attacked the victim.

At the same time, Secretary Noem has sought to deny Members of Congress access to federally-funded immigration detention facilities, blocking important oversight, especially of privately-run facilities. Her agency has been slow and frequently unwilling to respond to casework inquiries, and she has established a pattern of ignoring Congress in order to obscure what is happening within her agency from the American public. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE detention while she flew around the country for photo ops.

On her watch, DHS violates court orders, fails to hold private contractors accountable, and engages in blatant corruption. She has protected agents who have used excessive force, encouraged antagonism instead of deescalation, and has ignored well-established norms for accountability.

Secretary Noem has weaponized a powerful federal law enforcement agency to create an environment of fear and intimidation across communities in America. She has been untruthful, created a poisonous culture inside DHS, and made America less safe.

Americans should not have to live in fear of their own government.

I support the impeachment of Kristi Noem.

Referendum on justice reform set for 22-23 March; immigration courts could feel impact

The Meloni government confirmed on 12 January that Italians will vote on a constitutional reform separating the careers of judges and prosecutors on 22-23 March.​cite​​turn7view0​​

Supporters argue the overhaul will curb politicised prosecutions and accelerate decisions in economic and immigration cases by clarifying jurisdictional responsibilities. Critics—including magistrates’ unions and centre-left parties—see a power grab that could hamper investigations into migrant-detention conditions and asylum-fraud networks.

If approved, the reform will split the Superior Council of the Judiciary into two bodies chosen partly by lottery, and ban career-switching, a change expected to reduce transfers into overloaded immigration benches. Legal analysts predict an initial slowdown as new appointment rules take effect, followed by faster case-processing once specialised career paths mature.

Amid this shifting legal landscape, organisations and travellers can streamline visa and residence-permit planning through VisaHQ’s Italy portal (https://www.visahq.com/italy/), which tracks regulatory updates in real time and offers end-to-end application support—an asset if new court procedures temporarily slow permit appeals.

For multinational companies, the referendum introduces uncertainty around timelines for challenging work-permit refusals or labour-law fines. Firms with active litigation may wish to accelerate hearings before structural changes take hold. HR teams should follow the campaign closely; a “No” vote could weaken the current coalition and stall parallel migration-law initiatives.

Polling remains tight, and the government has ruled out early elections if defeated, but business-lobby groups worry that prolonged political wrangling could delay secondary legislation needed to implement the 2026 Flow Decree and EU Blue-Card digitisation.

The crisis of missing migrants represents one of the most urgent humanitarian tragedies of our time. Thousands of people have gone missing while attempting to reach safety through migration routes, particularly those fleeing armed conflicts, persecution, poverty, and environmental disasters. According to estimates by the International Organization for Migration, more than 50,000 people have gone missing along migration routes worldwide since 2014, including over 28,000 in the Mediterranean Sea alone. These figures do not merely represent numbers; they reflect shattered lives and families condemned to a state of perpetual uncertainty. Despite the magnitude of this tragedy, the fate of the majority of missing migrants remains unknown, and their families continue to wait—often for years—for any news or evidence that might dispel the darkness of the unknown and put an end to the torment of waiting.

The Mediterranean Sea is considered the most dangerous migration route in the world. Since 2014, it has witnessed the deaths and disappearances of tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, turning it into a vast, open grave. For families, the tragedy does not end with the sinking of a boat or the loss of contact; rather, a prolonged and painful suffering begins, marked by the absence of information, the lack of official recognition, and the failure of states to assume responsibility. Mothers, fathers, spouses, and children remain suspended between hope and despair, unable to mourn, unable to move on, and unable to access their most basic rights, while they await a piece of news or proof that might illuminate the fate of their loved ones and bring closure to an unending ordeal.

Impact of Enforced Disappearance on Families of the Missing

The suffering of victims’ families does not end with the sinking of a boat or the loss of contact; rather, it marks the beginning of a long and bitter phase of suffering for the families of the missing. Families live in a state of chronic uncertainty, described in psychology as “ambiguous loss,” in which the family does not know whether it should mourn the missing person or continue waiting for their return. This situation causes severe psychological pain that extends over many years: persistent anxiety and trauma, nightmares and insomnia, feelings of guilt stemming from the inability to know the fate of their sons, daughters, and family members or to save them, and a hope that is repeatedly rekindled and extinguished over time in the absence of any definitive news. Studies have shown that family members of the missing are at heightened risk of mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as a result of remaining trapped in a cycle of doubt and being unable to obtain final answers. Human rights experts have considered that the prolonged psychological suffering imposed by this state of waiting -combined with the failure of authorities to reveal the truth- may amount to cruel or inhuman treatment of families, particularly where there is evidence of officials’ involvement in withholding information or deliberate negligence.

In addition to psychological pain, the disappearance of a family member produces serious social and legal consequences. Families frequently find themselves in legal limbo due to the absence of a death certificate or official proof regarding the fate of the missing person. For example, the wife of a missing person may be deprived of her rights to inheritance or child support and may be legally unable to rebuild her life (such as remarrying) unless a court issues a ruling declaring her husband deceased in absentia. Similarly, children may face difficulties in establishing legal parentage or accessing entitled social assistance. In cases where the missing person was the primary breadwinner, families also suffer economic hardship as a result of the loss of income. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe has noted that the absence of a death certificate for parents can even hinder the swift family reunification of orphaned children with relatives. In addition, families face practical difficulties in searching for the missing: many exhaust their savings communicating across multiple countries with smugglers or witnesses in an attempt to obtain any information about the fate of their loved ones. When the family itself is composed of refugees or migrants, these obstacles multiply, as they encounter language barriers and bureaucratic obstacles in the countries where they search, and may fear approaching authorities due to their irregular legal status or the risk of deportation. This combination of psychological pain, social dislocation, and legal pressure renders the right to know the truth an urgent and vital necessity for these families. It is the only means of breaking the cycle of uncertainty, enabling a degree of psychological closure, and allowing families to move forward in adapting to a new reality, however painful. Knowing the truth- even if it is the death of the missing person- is better for families than living indefinitely in the shadow of the unknown.

The Right to Know the Truth

The United Nations has affirmed that the right to know the truth for victims of gross violations and their families is an independent and fundamental right that is non-derogable. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has concluded that the right to know the truth constitutes an integral part of the effective enjoyment of other fundamental rights and may not be restricted, even in states of emergency. For families of the missing, access to the truth is considered a basic condition for moral recovery and for achieving a form of closure to an open wound. Conversely, the prolonged deprivation of any information regarding the fate of their loved ones, and the maintenance of families in a state of waiting and psychological torment, may amount to inhuman treatment under international human rights law—particularly where the disappearance results from the failure or complicity of the relevant authorities in providing information or conducting investigations.

Accordingly, the right to know the truth is not merely a moral demand made by victims’ relatives; rather, it is an inherent legal right whose content is grounded in the rules of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and which forms part of the victims’ and their families’ right to remedy and justice. International humanitarian law implicitly recognizes this right by obliging parties to conflicts to search for the missing and to inform their families of any available information. Article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1977 provides that “the right of families to know the fate of their relatives” must be respected. Although the migration context differs from that of traditional armed conflict, the spirit of this humanitarian rule applies wherever comparable human suffering arises from the disappearance of persons. The United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances (CED) has affirmed that States must guarantee every family’s right to know the fate of their missing relatives and take the necessary steps in this regard—including the establishment of DNA databases, the collection of information on unidentified bodies, their identities and possible burial sites, and enabling families to access such information. Notably, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has indicated, in the context of migration, that systematic failure to comply with duties of search and disclosure—including cases of widespread pushbacks carried out by certain States’ authorities—may amount to enforced disappearance in the legal sense, where State involvement and failure to fulfil obligations are established.

Obligations of International Law and Principles of Responsibility

International laws and instruments impose clear responsibilities on States with regard to cases of missing migrants and victims of irregular migration. The most salient of these obligations and principles may be summarized as follows:

First: The duty to protect the right to life. States bear a fundamental responsibility to protect the lives of all individuals within their legal jurisdiction, without discrimination—including migrants and asylum seekers present on their territory or within their effective control. This requires governments to take proactive measures to prevent avoidable deaths during migration. The European Court of Human Rights has clarified that Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to life) imposes a positive obligation on States to protect the life of everyone within their jurisdiction. In the migration context, this means that States should provide safe and lawful pathways to access asylum procedures, refrain from extreme deterrence policies that force people into dangerous routes, and ensure the availability of effective search and rescue operations on land and at sea to respond promptly to migrants in distress. These obligations also include refraining from any deliberate acts that endanger migrants’ lives, such as pushbacks or ignoring distress calls—practices that are prohibited under international maritime law and may constitute serious violations of the right to life.

Second: The duty to investigate deaths and disappearances. When a disappearance or death of a migrant occurs under unclear circumstances or as a result of violent acts (such as drowning caused by collision or gunfire at borders), the concerned State must conduct an effective and thorough investigation to uncover the circumstances of what occurred. This includes collecting available evidence and information (such as boat wreckage, victims’ belongings, and communication records), hearing the testimonies of survivors and witnesses, and cooperating across borders where incidents span more than one jurisdiction. It also entails efforts to identify victims through forensic and medico-legal examinations. International principles emphasize that investigations into disappearances must be prompt, effective, and independent, with the involvement of families of the missing and the guarantee that they are informed of developments without delay. Failure to conduct serious investigations into migrant deaths or disappearances may itself constitute a violation of the State’s legal obligations and sends a negative message that migrants’ lives are valued less than others—contrary to the principle of the universality of human rights.

Third: The right of families of the missing to know the truth and the State’s obligation to realize it. As noted above, the right to know the truth has increasingly been recognized as an inalienable legal right. In cases of enforced disappearance in the context of human rights violations, this right is considered a State obligation linked to victims’ rights to justice and reparation. In the context of missing migrants, this right also applies—particularly where State actions or policies contribute to the disappearance or increase the opacity surrounding it. For example, authorities’ failure to conduct adequate rescue operations despite having the capacity to do so, the implementation of unlawful pushbacks that forcibly return migrants, or poor border management leading to fatal incidents without documentation—all constitute failures that may engage State responsibility for the disappearance of persons. The United Nations has recognized the right to truth as an independent right that may not be restricted and has affirmed that States are obliged to take effective steps to realize it. These steps include—as highlighted by the Committee on Enforced Disappearances—the establishment of national DNA databases and their linkage to international platforms, the creation of information banks on unidentified bodies and burial sites, and ensuring families’ access to such information to assist in identifying their loved ones. The State’s obligation to disclose the truth to families of the missing extends its duty to provide an effective remedy to victims and their relatives (as stipulated in Article 2(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), including the right to receive information regarding the outcomes of investigations and the circumstances of the incident.

Fourth: Obligations under international humanitarian law. In addition to the above, international humanitarian law imposes explicit obligations—within the context of armed conflicts—regarding the search for missing persons and the provision of information to their families. Article 32 of Additional Protocol I (1977) requires parties to a conflict to work to ascertain the fate of missing persons and to inform their relatives. Although missing migrants do not usually fall within the framework of armed conflict, the core values of humanitarian law—particularly respect for human dignity and families’ right to know the fate of their loved ones—apply in situations of humanitarian catastrophe such as the crisis of missing persons along migration routes. From a humanitarian perspective, it is unacceptable that thousands of families remain unable to know what happened to their children simply because the loss occurred outside the context of a traditional armed conflict.

Fifth: International accountability for patterns of violations. Systematic policies or practices that result in deaths and disappearances among migrants may engage international responsibility and require accountability. For example, where a pattern of unlawful pushbacks at a State’s borders is established and contributes to migrants’ disappearance or death without identification, this may constitute a violation of the State’s obligations under human rights law. Such conduct may even fall within the definition of enforced disappearance if its constituent elements are met, particularly where official authorities are complicit or deliberately refrain from providing information. In the European context, the Council of Europe has stressed that those responsible for such violations must not enjoy impunity—whether unscrupulous smugglers or official actors whose actions or omissions contributed to the loss of life. It is worth noting that collective expulsions have been judicially ruled unlawful because they expose migrants to the risk of disappearance and death, and the international community has called for their immediate cessation. Ending the culture of impunity in this area and holding perpetrators accountable will send a clear message that migrants’ lives are neither cheap nor expendable.

Existing Efforts and Gaps in the Response

Despite the gravity of the crisis of missing migrants, the international response remains insufficient, fragmented, and far below the scale of the tragedy. Nevertheless, recent years have witnessed some positive initiatives and growing attention, including, for example:

At the United Nations level, the issue has been strongly placed on the agenda of the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. In 2023, more than 200 international civil society organizations launched a joint appeal addressed to the Human Rights Council, calling for the establishment of an independent international mechanism to monitor violations at borders and enhance accountability in cases of migrant deaths and disappearances. This pressure resulted in an unprecedented discussion within the Council on the suffering of families of missing migrants and their right to know the truth. Although no new mechanism has yet been established, the mere presentation of this proposal at this level constitutes significant progress in breaking the wall of neglect surrounding the issue.

At the European regional level, the Council of Europe adopted a qualitative step in 2024 through the adoption of Resolution No. 2569 (2024) by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on missing migrants. The resolution recommended a set of concrete measures, most notably facilitating the issuance of necessary documents for families of the missing (such as certificates of disappearance or legal certificates of absence) to enable them to exercise their rights to inheritance and other rights, and to proceed with family reunification or resettlement procedures where applicable. The resolution also called on member States to appoint national focal points for missing migrants to serve as designated contact entities for inquiries and cross-border coordination regarding cases of disappearance, with these focal points exchanging expertise within a network overseen by the Council’s Special Representative on Migration and Refugees. This aims to enhance the speed of information exchange and cooperation between States when incidents of drowning or disappearance of migrants occur. These steps—although European in scope—represent a model that can be built upon globally to improve governmental responses to the issue of missing persons.

In the field of data and documentation, the Missing Migrants Project of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) constitutes a key tool for monitoring and documenting incidents of death and disappearance during migration. Since its establishment in 2014, the project has documented approximately 56,000 cases of migrant deaths/disappearances worldwide up to 2023, shedding light on hotspots where tragedies are concentrated (foremost among them the Mediterranean). However, the role of this project is limited to the collection of statistical data and does not extend to field search operations or criminal investigations into the fate of missing persons as individuals. It also does not include all cases of disappearance, meaning that while it provides an important general picture, it does not answer families’ questions about the specific whereabouts of their missing loved ones.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement also play an important role through the Restoring Family Links programme. Red Cross offices receive reports from families about their missing relatives and attempt to trace them through international humanitarian networks. They also provide some psychological and social support to families to help them cope with their ordeal. However, these humanitarian search efforts face numerous obstacles, most notably the lack of official information—government authorities often refrain from sharing data for political or bureaucratic reasons—as well as weak cross-border governmental cooperation in many complex cases involving multiple countries. This undermines the effectiveness of the programme in fulfilling families’ right to know the fate of their loved ones.

Some States have taken limited national initiatives. For example, Italy established a special commission to identify the bodies of migrants who drowned off the coast of Lampedusa in the 2013 disaster, using DNA analysis to match victims with samples from their relatives. Spain also established a DNA bank dedicated to relatives of missing migrants in the Canary Islands to facilitate the identification of remains found there. Although these initiatives remain limited in geographic and logistical scope, they represent steps in the right direction and confirm that techniques such as genetic analysis can succeed in determining the fate of missing persons even after many years.

Despite these efforts, major gaps continue to impede the achievement of a comprehensive and genuine solution to this humanitarian tragedy:

Absence of a specialized central international mechanism: Unlike situations of armed conflict—where mechanisms such as the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) were established after the Balkan wars, or the Kosovo Missing Persons mechanism under ICRC supervision, and more recently the Independent Institution on Missing Persons in Syria (IIMP) established by the United Nations in 2023—there is still no international entity dedicated exclusively to missing migrants and to coordinating efforts among States in this field. The proposal to establish an international mechanism to search for missing persons along migration routes has been under discussion for some time but has not yet been translated into practical reality. This institutional vacuum leads to fragmented initiatives and the absence of a clear reference point to which families can turn for assistance in cross-border searches.

Weak cross-border coordination: Most cases of migrant disappearance occur in border areas (such as buffer zones between States), in international waters outside the jurisdiction of any single State, or during long journeys passing through multiple countries. This necessarily requires transnational cooperation among all concerned States—of origin, transit, and destination—to piece together the full picture. Currently, there is a clear deficiency in information-sharing and coordination among the authorities of these countries. Often, one State is unaware that its nationals are among the victims of an incident that occurred in another State, or data-sharing procedures falter due to the absence of a formal and secure cooperation framework. Experts in forensic medicine and disaster management have pointed out that international coordination is among the greatest challenges hindering the identification of migrant victims, given the multiplicity of jurisdictions and the difficulty of tracing missing persons across different systems. Even within a single State, fragmentation of competencies among multiple regions or provinces can complicate identification efforts if no central mechanism exists to unify information.

Lack of legal and procedural frameworks at the national level: Many States lack clear laws or protocols for dealing with cases involving unidentified migrant bodies or migrants missing during migration. For example, national legislation may not oblige forensic authorities to conduct thorough investigations when an unidentified migrant body is found on a shoreline; in some places, burial occurs quickly without analysis or attempts at identification. Several States also lack routine procedures for collecting DNA samples from unidentified bodies or from relatives of missing persons, thereby squandering the opportunity for later identification should new evidence emerge. The European Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that this legislative vacuum and lack of resources have sometimes left the task of identifying victims of maritime incidents to individual efforts, whereas in cases of air crashes or natural disasters, specialized teams and organized international coordination are deployed. This disparate treatment highlights the urgent need to close legal gaps and establish unified standards that take into account the specific context of migration.

Lack of technical and financial resources: Efforts in this field suffer from severe shortages of funding and technical equipment. Searching for missing boats, recovering bodies from deep waters, or conducting DNA tests and cross-border data comparisons all require substantial financial resources and advanced expertise. At present, most of this work relies on voluntary initiatives or limited budgets provided by some States and international organizations, which is entirely disproportionate to the scale of the global problem. The absence of sustainable funding hampers even existing good initiatives and limits their expansion, while discouraging potential new projects due to the lack of support resources.

Politicization of the issue and lack of political will: It cannot be overlooked that the issue of missing migrants has fallen victim to political polarization surrounding irregular migration. Rather than being viewed through a purely humanitarian lens as a matter concerning human lives and the suffering of their families, governmental responses are often influenced by domestic political considerations related to “migration deterrence” and avoiding appearing lenient. Consequently, some States may hesitate to highlight the high number of deaths at their borders to avoid media pressure or demands for compensation and accountability, or out of fear that this might encourage more migrants to come, believing that search and rescue efforts will be undertaken. Experts have pointed out that some governments fear that families’ knowledge of the truth could lead to legal claims against State authorities and demands for compensation for negligence or abuse. Official acknowledgment of large numbers of missing persons may also be considered politically embarrassing and provoke criticism of existing policies. As a result, this issue has largely remained in the shadows, and collective political will to take serious action has been absent despite the ongoing tragedy.

As a result, despite the aforementioned positive steps, the right to know the truth for families of missing persons along migration routes remains far from being fully realized to this day. There is an urgent need for international political will that transcends narrow calculations and adopts a shared humanitarian approach to a tragedy that knows no borders. The international community must act to close existing gaps and place the issue of missing migrants at the forefront of humanitarian priorities, in fidelity to human dignity and the universal rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In the following section, we present specific practical recommendations to advance this approach.

Recommendations

Based on the foregoing facts and legal provisions, this paper presents a set of practical recommendations that we hope will be adopted by the Human Rights Council, Member States, and the international community to support the right of families of the missing to know the truth and to take tangible steps in this direction:

1. Strengthening international cooperation through the activation of existing institutions:

We call for enhanced activation of cooperation and coordination among existing international institutions already engaged with the issue of missing persons. For example, the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) possesses advanced technical expertise in managing genetic databases and identification at the international level—acquired through its work in the Balkans and elsewhere—and could play a pivotal role in addressing missing migrants along migration routes. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also has mechanisms for information exchange through the Restoring Family Links network. The same applies to the International Organization for Migration (Missing Migrants Project) and to specialized civil society organizations such as the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), which has collected thousands of DNA samples from families of missing migrants in Latin America and contributed to identifying hundreds of them. We also specifically note the Syrian National Authority for Missing Persons, established in 2025 as a national effort with international support, which swiftly signed a memorandum of understanding with ICMP aimed at building a sustainable and comprehensive mechanism to search for missing persons and clarify their fate in Syria, with a focus on developing the capacities of local experts in criminal investigations, forensic medicine, genetic analysis, and database management. This fruitful cooperation between a national civil authority and international expertise represents a model to be emulated for integrating local and international efforts in addressing the issue of missing persons. Accordingly, the paper recommends that the Human Rights Council call for the establishment of an international coordinating task force under the auspices of the United Nations, comprising representatives of the aforementioned entities (ICMP, ICRC, IOM, IIMP, EAAF, among others), as well as advisors from families and their associations. This task force would organize efforts, distribute roles, and facilitate the exchange of information and resources to ensure the absence of gaps or duplication. The task force should focus exclusively on the global crisis of missing migrants, serving as a global network linking national search and identification bodies with international platforms and establishing unified cross-border procedural standards.

2. Establishing and developing a unified international database linked to national databases, with a focus on DNA:

There is a need to adopt a project for a central database on missing migrants and victims of migration, overseen by a neutral international body such as ICMP or the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This database should include all available information from States and organizations: data on reported missing migrants (names, descriptions, photographs, fingerprints if available, DNA samples from relatives) and data on unidentified bodies recovered (forensic descriptions, distinguishing features, fingerprints, post-mortem DNA samples). Linking these data globally would enable rapid matching through computational technologies, potentially resolving thousands of unresolved cases and identifying many missing persons. We emphasize the role of DNA testing in identification processes: experience has shown that comparative genetic analysis is the most reliable method, particularly when bodies are decomposed or disfigured. Accordingly, national DNA banks should be established in destination and transit States to collect samples from survivors and relatives of the missing, securely linked to the international database. States should also be required to collect DNA samples from survivors of shipwrecks immediately upon reaching safety, following informed consent (especially survivors of incidents in which others went missing), for two purposes: first, to compare them with samples from families who reported missing relatives (in case some survivors were themselves reported missing by families unaware of their survival); and second, to use them as references for identifying other victims (for example, when one family member survives and another drowns, the survivor’s DNA can help identify the drowned relative’s body). Linking national databases regionally and internationally—with strict safeguards for privacy and personal data protection—would constitute a major breakthrough in efforts to clarify fate, fulfilling the call long made by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement for a global system to register missing migrants. In this context, existing tools such as Interpol’s databases on missing persons and unidentified bodies can be utilized by feeding them with new information and ensuring access for relevant authorities in each State.

3. Improving cross-border cooperation in search and investigation operations:

The threads of a missing migrant’s case are often spread across several countries—the country of origin where the family initiates the search, the transit country where the incident may have occurred, and the destination country that may hold some information or remains. Progress can therefore only be achieved through bilateral and regional cooperation agreements that remove bureaucratic obstacles to information exchange and joint investigations. The paper recommends that concerned States, particularly in the Mediterranean and Europe, initiate specific agreements for cooperation in boat sinkings and border death cases. These agreements should provide for rapid information-sharing mechanisms (such as the secure exchange of fingerprints, biometric data, and forensic reports) and for the possibility of forming joint investigation teams in major incidents affecting more than one State. Countries of origin (from which migrant victims originate, such as Arab and African States) should also be involved by appointing focal points in embassies and consulates to facilitate information transmission to families and coordination in the transfer of bodies or samples. Particular emphasis is placed on the responsibility of coastal States at points of departure—such as Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Türkiye, and Greece—which must be legally and ethically bound to intensify search and rescue efforts in their territorial waters and designated search and rescue (SAR) zones, and to exert every effort to identify those who perish on their shores. These States have, de facto, become the first line of confrontation in the Mediterranean tragedy and must cooperate transparently with destination States and international organizations in documenting shipwrecks and local burials. They must also cease any dangerous or hostile practices toward migrant boats—such as deliberately ramming boats or forcibly pushing them back—since such acts violate international maritime law and the right to life and have caused preventable deaths. We call on the Human Rights Council to appoint a Special Coordinator on Missing Migrants to facilitate international communication, urge States to cooperate, and monitor the implementation of relevant cross-border agreements and protocols.

4. Making investigation and accountability mandatory and ensuring no impunity for perpetrators:

States must align their national legislation to mandate the immediate and comprehensive investigation of any migrant death or disappearance within their jurisdiction, just as any death of a citizen within the country would be treated. The law should clearly stipulate the responsibility of competent authorities (naval forces, border guards, police, forensic services) to collect and examine evidence in such incidents—including boat debris, victims’ phones and belongings, and survivor testimonies—in addition to conducting autopsies and DNA testing and comparing results with missing persons data. Authorities should also prepare public reports announcing investigation findings and causes of incidents, as transparency is an integral part of the right of society and victims’ families to know the truth. Legal frameworks must include the possibility of holding accountable any entity proven to have contributed to the death or disappearance, whether unscrupulous smuggling networks whose negligence or criminal acts caused the disaster, or State agents who acted unlawfully (such as coast guard personnel who used violence against migrant boats or officials who deliberately ignored distress calls). Ending the culture of impunity in this context requires criminalizing acts that deliberately endanger migrants’ lives. We therefore recommend explicitly criminalizing the failure to render assistance to persons in distress at sea, holding accountable any ship captain or official who knew of a distress situation and failed to act to save lives. Likewise, failure to report any known sinking or disappearance should be criminalized as a complicity that deprives families of their right to know. Sending firm messages through prosecution of those responsible will affirm that migrant lives are not expendable and will ensure a minimum level of justice for their families. In this context, we also call on States to cooperate with international accountability mechanisms—such as universal jurisdiction or UN investigative mechanisms where appropriate—with respect to violations of migrants’ rights at their borders, to ensure that no accountability gaps allow perpetrators to evade justice.

5. Ensuring the effective participation of families of the missing in search and investigation processes:

Families who have lost relatives during migration have the right to be genuine partners in efforts to investigate and determine fate. States concerned—particularly transit and destination States where incidents occurred—should therefore be obliged to involve families of the missing at all relevant stages. This includes enabling families to submit any information or evidence they possess (such as dental records, distinguishing marks, or DNA samples) and listening to their testimonies regarding last contact with the missing person and their expected route. Authorities must also inform families regularly and without undue delay of investigation developments and results. International principles, including the Human Rights Committee’s General Comments, have emphasized that families’ right to know the truth about the fate of their relatives is inalienable, and that authorities have a duty of transparent communication with rights-holders. Accordingly, the paper recommends appointing liaison officers or contact persons within investigative bodies whose role is to communicate with families of the missing, keep them informed of updates, and involve them in decisions related to the fate of remains (such as consulting families on burial locations once a body is identified). Translation and logistical services should also be provided to ensure that language or geographical barriers do not hinder family participation—for example, facilitating visas and providing travel and accommodation support when families from another country are summoned to identify a body or give testimony. Treating families with respect and involving them effectively not only fulfills a humanitarian dimension but also enhances the effectiveness of investigations, as families often hold critical pieces of information that can assist authorities when assembled.

6. Empowering families of the missing and supporting survivors (psychologically, socially, and legally):

Families of missing migrants suffer from complex psychological and social crises, as previously noted, and require support and accompaniment throughout the long search process. This paper therefore recommends that States, in cooperation with international organizations, establish contact centers or dedicated offices to communicate with families of the missing and victims of migration. These offices should be tasked with receiving families’ disappearance reports and officially registering them, providing updated information on any progress in search operations or criminal investigations, offering legal guidance on available procedures (such as how to obtain a judicial declaration of absence or death after a certain period, or how to access entitlements and documents), and delivering psychological and social support through professionals—particularly to children and women—to help families cope with trauma. Special attention must also be given to survivors of tragic shipwrecks, who often suffer from acute psychological trauma and survivor’s guilt, requiring professional mental health care immediately upon arrival. States, in cooperation with relevant bodies and organizations, must therefore provide sustainable psychosocial rehabilitation programmes for survivors, with particular consideration for the most vulnerable groups, such as women who lost children or experienced violence during the journey, and child survivors who lost caregivers and require specialized support and care. We urge the ICRC, given its global presence, to ensure continuity of psychosocial support across different phases of movement, so that if survivors or families move from one country to another, their follow-up is transferred to the Red Cross or Red Crescent branch in the new country without interruption. Regarding contact centers, these should also provide multilingual hotlines to receive families’ inquiries from any country and facilitate communication with authorities. We further propose the establishment of an international assistance fund, contributed to by affluent States and donors, dedicated to covering families’ expenses during the search process—such as DNA testing costs, travel to identify bodies, or repatriation for burial—particularly for families with limited resources. Providing such material and moral support constitutes a humanitarian and ethical obligation of the international community toward those who have endured prolonged suffering while awaiting the truth.

7. Promoting safe migration pathways and preventing the recurrence of tragedies:

In the long term, the root solution to reducing the number of missing persons lies in preventing the tragedy from occurring in the first place by creating safe alternatives for migration and asylum. Numerous international organizations, including the International Organization for Migration and the Council of Europe, have called for the provision of regular pathways through which those seeking asylum or humanitarian migration can reach their destination without risking their lives across seas or deserts. These alternatives include increasing resettlement quotas for the most vulnerable refugees, opening humanitarian visa programmes or safe transit corridors coordinated between countries of origin and destination, and simplifying family reunification procedures through embassies instead of forcing families into dangerous journeys. The tightening of deterrence and pushback policies has proven ineffective in stopping migration; it has only driven people toward more dangerous routes, as statistics confirm. Accordingly, concerned States—especially in Europe—must review their policies and prioritize saving lives and preventing deaths as a supreme objective that takes precedence over border control considerations. It is ethically unacceptable to allow people to die of thirst in deserts or drown at sea under the pretext of sending a deterrent message to others. Adherence to the principle of non-refoulement and respect for human dignity must remain central to any migration management approach. In this regard, we recommend that the Human Rights Council encourage States to sign multilateral and bilateral agreements to fairly share responsibilities for rescue and reception—for example, as seen in European agreements on the disembarkation of migrants rescued in the Mediterranean on a rotational basis among different States. Ultimately, prevention is better than cure: providing safe options will directly reduce incidents of death and disappearance and alleviate the burden on search, rescue, and investigation mechanisms that consume extensive resources.

8. Honoring victims and preserving collective memory:

As part of respecting the right to truth and ensuring non-repetition, it is important for the international community and concerned States to take steps to document the memory of migrants who died or went missing during these journeys of hope. The paper recommends that States establish memorials or name plaques at appropriate sites (such as unidentified graves or coastal cities that witnessed major incidents) to commemorate the lives of those who perished while seeking a better future. International memorial gardens jointly funded by multiple States could also be established as symbols of cross-border human solidarity. In terms of awareness-raising, we call for annual events on the International Migrants Day (18 December) to highlight the issue of missing migrants and the suffering of their families, with official participation from governments and civil society organizations. Public acknowledgment of the scale of the tragedy and the pain of families breaks the wall of indifference surrounding this issue and increases public pressure on decision-makers to act and take necessary measures to prevent recurrence. A European newspaper once published a list of 34,000 migrants who died at the gates of the continent as a form of moral wake-up call; such initiatives are commendable and should be repeated and expanded officially, as assigning a name and identity to each number in the missing persons tally preserves victims’ dignity and reinforces the reality that they are not mere statistics, but human beings with stories and dreams cut short by borders.

9. Ratifying relevant international conventions and closing legal gaps:

Finally, we urge States—particularly transit and destination countries in Europe and elsewhere—to accede to core international instruments that strengthen the right to know the truth and combat impunity. Foremost among these is the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance of 2006, which to date has been ratified by only 68 States. This Convention obliges States to criminalize enforced disappearance, guarantee families’ right to know the fate of their relatives, and establish effective search mechanisms. Ratifying it and incorporating its principles into national legislation—including explicit recognition of families’ right to know and criminalization of information concealment—would send a strong message of States’ commitment to closing legal gaps in dealing with missing persons. We also recommend that States support the development of a new international protocol, if necessary, specifically addressing missing persons and deaths during cross-border migration. Such a protocol could establish binding standards for States regarding joint search efforts, data exchange, identification of remains, respectful handling of bodies, and protection of families’ rights across different judicial frameworks. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has recently proposed developing global guidelines to protect the rights of deceased migrants; this call can be built upon to develop a more comprehensive legal instrument. The existence of a clear international legal framework would remove much of the current ambiguity and strengthen State accountability and adherence to unified procedures, rather than leaving matters to disparate national practices. We also call on States of origin of refugees to establish national mechanisms to search for missing persons, following the example of Syria in establishing the National Commission for Missing Persons in Syria (NCMP), which, within its mandate, follows up on the cases of Syrian refugees outside Syria.

Taken together, these recommendations constitute a humanitarian and legal action plan that must be urgently translated into reality. We appeal to the forthcoming Human Rights Council and all concerned States to adopt and politically and logistically support these proposals. We also call for the establishment of a follow-up mechanism within the Human Rights Council to monitor the implementation of these measures, such as appointing a Special Rapporteur or expert group on the right to know the truth for missing migrants, to ensure sustained momentum and the translation of words into action. It is time for the suffering of thousands of families to no longer remain in the shadows, and for their right to truth to become a tangible reality safeguarded and protected by concerted international efforts. Let us finally grant these mothers, fathers, and children the answers they deserve, and honor the memory of those we lost by transforming the story of their tragedy into a catalyst for change and prevention. Human dignity is indivisible—and the dignity of every family in knowing the fate of its missing child is part of the dignity of us all.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota have resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division have given notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, according to people familiar with the matter.

The resignations follow growing tensions over a decision by the Trump administration to block the state out of the investigation into the shooting of Renee Good, who was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week. Lawyers in the Civil Rights Division, which generally investigates high-profile officer shootings, were also recently told that the division would not be involved at this stage in the probe, two people familiar with the matter said.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division's criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.

The lawsuit was filed Monday, five days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, sparking nationwide protests. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried the actions of the federal agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement. We are not asking ICE not to do ICE things. We are asking this federal government to stop the unconstitutional conduct that is invading our streets each and every day. You’ve seen the videos. At times, there are as many as 50 agents arresting one person. The scale is wildly disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe.”

The state of Illinois has also sued the Trump administration over use of federal forces in the state.

Iran says it is prepared for war but ready to negotiate, as the Trump administration considers attacking Iran over Tehran’s crackdown on the recent mass protests. Trump is expected to be briefed today on options including launching strikes inside Iran and offensive cyberattacks. On Monday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that conduct business with Iran, including China, India, Turkey and Pakistan.

The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights says at least 648 protesters have been killed over the past two weeks. An Iranian official also reported today the number of dead could be as high as 2,000. We will have more on Iran later in the show.

In other news from Gaza, a headstone has finally been placed on the grave of Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer, more than two years after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on December 6, 2023. His body wasn’t recovered until 10 months ago. Inscribed on the headstone are the closing lines of his most famous poem: “If I must die, / Let it bring hope; / Let it be a tale.”

A bipartisan group of former Treasury secretaries and other top economic officials has blasted the Trump administration for launching a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The probe was set in motion after Powell refused Trump’s demands to lower interest rates. The former officials described the investigation as an “unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine” the independence of the Federal Reserve. Signatories to the letter include former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. The Wall Street Journal reports Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately warned Trump the move to investigate Powell could backfire.

The House Oversight Committee is facing growing criticism for voting to subpoena the prominent investigative journalist Seth Harp after he posted publicly available information about a Delta Force commander who reportedly played a role in the recent U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Harp is the author of the book “The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces.” On Monday, 20 press freedom and First Amendment groups, including the ACLU and Reporters Without Borders, called on the House committee to rescind the subpoena, saying Harp’s reporting is “fully and squarely within the protections of the First Amendment.” This is Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights and Dissent.

Chip Gibbons: “The subpoena against Seth Harp has few parallels in recent memory. We have to remember Seth Harp has done some of the most important investigative reporting on U.S. foreign policy. It’s been critical reporting. The House knows full well the dangers to press freedom that subpoenaing a journalist poses. That’s why in 2024 they actually passed legislation to prevent executive branch subpoenas against journalists about their news gathering.”

The New York Times is reporting the Pentagon may have committed a war crime by using a secret aircraft painted to look like a civilian plane to attack a boat in the Caribbean in September. Eleven people died in the attack. The Trump administration claimed, without offering proof, that the boat was carrying drugs. Under international law, it is a war crime to commit what’s known as “perfidy” — disguising military equipment as civilian.

Russia launched another massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, launching nearly 300 drones, as well as 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles. The attack targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving thousands more without heat. Four people were killed in Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, a U.N. monitoring group says about 2,500 Ukrainian civilians were killed last year, making it the deadliest year yet for civilians since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.

In Sudan, the UAE-backed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a drone strike on a Sudanese army base in the southeastern city of Sinjah on Monday. Twenty-seven people were reportedly killed. The attack came a day after Sudan’s military-led government returned to the country’s capital Khartoum after operating in the eastern city of Port Sudan for nearly three years. The government’s return comes nearly a year after the military recaptured Khartoum from the RSF.

In labor news, nearly 15,000 nurses have launched the largest nursing strike in New York City history. Striking nurses have accused management at six private New York hospitals of refusing to negotiate fair contracts that improve safe staffing, fully fund health benefits and protect them from workplace violence. Striking nurses picketed outside NewYork-Presbyterian and other hospitals on Monday.

Striking NYC Nurse: “I am fighting for my healthcare insurance. I don’t know how I can be here working at a hospital that will not give me health insurance. It is so important for me to have health insurance. It’s so important to take care of the community. I love being a nurse. I want to take care of patients. I want to be at bedside. And it’s so important for us to strike, because we are fighting for patient safety.”

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined the striking nurses on Monday and praised their work.

“The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on January 7 by ICE agent Jonathan Ross is tragic proof that the Trump administration’s immigration policy has totally failed our country and is increasing danger for Minnesotans and all Americans. I demand that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) cease all operations in Minnesota immediately to allow local law enforcement officials to return to protecting our community from further violence and conduct a full and transparent investigation into ICE’s actions and conduct which caused this horrific shooting.

“My constituents are deeply troubled, and many are fearful of the dramatic chaos and unrest being stoked as a direct result of the Trump administration’s tactics of ordering more than 2,000 ICE and DHS agents to Minnesota to racially profile and arrest people in their homes, their workplaces, their schools, and on our streets. The outrageous and unprofessional behavior exhibited by ICE and other federal immigration agencies is not only making our neighborhoods, our cities, and our state more dangerous for everyone, it is making it more difficult for local law enforcement to conduct their daily work to protect and serve our community. Our children have a right to be safe at school, at home, and in our community. As parents and adults, it is our solemn responsibility to protect our children and our neighbors from violence. It is unconscionable this now includes violence perpetrated by our own government.

“Additionally, since December, I have been contacted by constituents and public officials who are deeply concerned about reports in the Washington Post and other publications that ICE is actively soliciting warehouse space to hold as many as 1500 detainees in Woodbury, Minnesota, located in my congressional district, and other communities across the country. Inquiries made to DHS/ICE by local officials have gone unanswered as they seek answers to their many questions about these reported plans.

“According to comments by ICE acting director Todd M. Lyons at a border conference in April, the Trump administration’s goal is to deport immigrants like Amazon moves packages: ‘Like Prime, but with human beings.’ Not only is this plan dehumanizing, it fails to account for the fact that structures designed for storage and shipping are not fit for human habitation, because they lack adequate ventilation and temperature controls.”

If the ICE officer who shot and killed Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week is not prosecuted criminally, or even if he is, can he also be sued?

Legal experts have different takes. Last week I spoke with a police misconduct attorney in Minnesota who seemed hopeful about the odds Good’s family might face in court. Others I spoke with were somewhat less optimistic. Winning lawsuits against cops who kill “is challenging by design,” as Michelle Lapointe, legal director of the American Immigration Council, an immigrant rights advocacy group, wrote on the group’s website.

To flesh that out, I caught up with Lauren Bonds of the National Police Accountability Project, a national group that works with civil rights attorneys to file lawsuits over police misconduct. Our conversation below, edited for length and clarity, explores the legal hurdles to beating an ICE officer like Good’s killer, Jonathan Ross, in civil court.

It’s notoriously tough to sue police, but it’s even harder when the officer is federal. What are the challenges?

You’re absolutely right: All the problems you have with suing a regular law enforcement officer exist, and then you have additional barriers. There are two distinct pathways to sue a federal officer for misconduct or excessive force: One is a Bivens action—a court-created pathway that allows you to sue federal agents for constitutional violations. And then there’s the Federal Tort Claims Act, a statutory provision that allows for these lawsuits to move forward.

The problem with Bivens is it’s been really, really narrowed in recent years by this particular Supreme Court. First there was Hernandez v. Mesa, a 2020 case where a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a child on the other side of the border in Mexico. And the court said it didn’t fit within the narrow confines of Bivens. And then there was a case in 2022, Egbert v. Boule, that foreclosed any new Bivens action: Basically the court said that this type of civil rights violation is something you can pursue under Bivens, but if it’s anything new, we’re not going that far.

The Federal Torts Claims Act (FTCA) is where more people are going to get relief for violations by federal officers. It basically says that any tort that you would suffer under state law [such as false arrest, assault, or battery] you can sue the federal government for—with vast exceptions: There’s one that comes up a lot for law enforcement cases, the “discretionary function” exception, which says an officer can’t be sued for anything that he or she needs to use discretion for. Courts have done a good job of interpreting that to mean discretion in terms of policymaking decisions, but some courts get it wrong. So those are the two pathways—they’re both narrow, and they’re both complicated.

There’s the issue of qualified immunity for police officers, or even sovereign immunity for the federal government, right?

Sovereign immunity [a legal principle that says the federal government can’t be sued without its consent] wouldn’t come up in an FTCA case, because it’s a statute in which Congress waived sovereign immunity and agreed to be sued under certain circumstances. It does come up as a defense when [the government is] saying, Oh, this case falls within an exception, but they can’t assert it otherwise.

If you were to file a constitutional claim under Bivens, they could invoke qualified immunity, another protection that law enforcement officers have; it asks whether there is case law in the circuit that would have put the officer on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional. [If not, the officer is essentially off the hook.]

A lot of courts have taken that requirement to an extreme place, basically saying it’s got to be identical facts—like there are cases that have been thrown out on qualified immunity because a person was sitting with their hands up versus standing with their hands up. That level of granularity has been applied to defeat civil rights claims. And so it’s a difficult barrier to overcome.

Given how hard it can be to sue, what about criminal charges?

It’s definitely possible. There isn’t any immunity from criminal prosecution that federal officers are entitled to, none that I’m aware of anyway. I know this issue came up when some ICE raids were planned to take place in San Francisco back in early fall, with the DA of San Francisco asserting that she did have authority to pursue criminal action against ICE agents if they broke California laws.

What about the Supremacy Clause? It protects federal officers from state prosecution if they were performing their federal duties, right?

The Supremacy Clause protects federal officers when they’re engaged in legal activity, and so if their conduct is illegal, they wouldn’t be protected. So in Minneapolis, if the officer engaged in a Fourth Amendment violation, he’d be beyond the protection of the Supremacy Clause.

This issue has come up with California, too. The Trump administration is suing California over new state legislation that would create a crime for wearing a mask and obscuring your identity if you’re a law enforcement officer. And it’s suing Illinois [for a state law that allows residents to sue ICE agents in certain circumstances]. Those lawsuits have asserted that the Supremacy Clause makes these [state] laws unconstitutional—that you can’t take any action against federal law enforcement officers under state law.

Have you heard of cases in this past year of ICE officers being sued or prosecuted for misconduct?

I haven’t seen any prosecutions yet. In terms of lawsuits, we’ve seen an increase in FTCA cases against DHS agents.

Regarding the recent killing in Minneapolis, what do you see as the main path to accountability, and the main challenges?

There’s going to be all the standard barriers that we talked about, including the Supremacy Clause defense, particularly because you have so many high-ranking federal officials, including the president and Secretary Noem, who are saying that this shooting was the right thing to do and was consistent with him carrying out his obligations.

On the civil side, this could be a potentially difficult Bivens or FTCA case. I would note, since we’re on the heels of January 6: Ashli Babbitt, the woman who died during the Capital insurrection, filed a FTCA case, or her family did, and got a $5 million settlement from the government. It’s hard to factually distinguish these cases.

The federal government has authority to settle a case like that, but since the Trump administration is taking a very opposing position against Good, the woman who died in Minneapolis, I would be surprised if they would be willing to put money on the table.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/12Jan2026_LaurenBonds.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-13 18:58:52.263512

What we know:

The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Rubio Bohorquez, 53, at an immigration facility in Bethpage, Long Island, calling him a ""criminal illegal alien"" who has no legal authorization to remain or work in the United States.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and other officials have called for Bohorquez's immediate release.

Happening Today:

A group of City Council members, staffers and supporters is planning to hold a rally outside the ICE office in Lower Manhattan at noon.

Who is Rubio Bohorquez?

According to DHS, Rubio Bohorquez entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa in 2017 and was required to leave the country by Oct. 22 of that year.

They say he overstayed the visa and had no work authorization and that his criminal history includes an arrest for assault.

What they're saying:

""He had no legal right to be in the United States,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement. ""Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you and we will arrest you.""

DHS responds

Statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin:

On Jan. 12, ICE New York City arrested Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela and an employee of New York’s City Council. His criminal history includes an arrest for assault. He had no work authorization.

Rubio entered the United States on a B2 tourist visa in 2017 that required him to depart the U.S by October 22, 2017. He had no legal right to be in the United States.

Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you and we will arrest you.

The other side:

City officials disputed that account Monday, saying Rubio Bohorquez was detained despite complying with immigration requirements. City Council Speaker Julie Menin said the staffer had a valid work visa through October and described his arrest as ""egregious government overreach.""

Featured

Menin said Rubio Bohorquez had gone to what she described as a routine court appointment when he was taken into custody and later transferred to a detention center in lower Manhattan. She said the city was not given an explanation at the time for his detainment.

""Despite every indication that he was doing everything the right way, he still found himself the victim of egregious government overreach,"" Menin said at a Monday evening press conference.

Menin said Rubio Bohorquez has worked in city government for about a year and signed an attestation in January stating he had never been arrested. DHS later contradicted that claim.

Dig deeper:

City leaders said they learned of the arrest after Rubio Bohorquez used his one phone call following detainment to contact the City Council’s human resources department.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani called for Rubio Bohorquez’s immediate release, saying on social media that the detention amounted to ""an assault on our democracy, on our city, and our values.""

U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman said federal authorities were targeting migrants who comply with immigration requirements.

""That is the people who are going to court and going to their check-ins,"" Goldman said.

The arrest comes amid heightened tensions between Democratic officials and ICE over immigration enforcement tactics, including arrests at routine court appointments.

City Comptroller Mark Levine and New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued statements condemning the detainment and calling for Rubio Bohorquez’s release.

What we're watching: Minnesota officials are launching their own investigation into possible state charges against the ICE agent for Good's killing.
Flashback: The 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff raised the same legal knot now dogging the ICE agent shooting.","The investigation into the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good would likely be going very differently if a local police officer, instead of an ICE agent, had pulled the trigger last week in Minneapolis.

Why it matters: A local police shooting usually initiates a multi-agency investigation and the threat of prosecution. An ICE agent shooting is handled almost entirely inside the federal government — where accountability is far harder to reach.

ICE is a relatively young federal agency — created after the 9/11 attacks with fewer guardrails — and hasn't faced the number of court challenges that forced other agencies to rein in their officers.

That's unlikely to change under President Trump. His administration has halted all Department of Justice ""pattern-or-practice"" investigations into police departments accused of excessive force, and likely won't launch one into ICE despite a spike in shootings.

Catch up quick: Video footage of Good's death, watched by millions of Americans, splintered the nation into two irreconcilable camps, with one crying murder and the other terrorism.

Trump accused Good of ""violently, willfully, and viciously"" running over an ICE officer, and said ""it's hard to believe"" the officer survived, though critics said footage showed Good posed no threat.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President Vance also defended the ICE officer, as activists in hundreds of cities nationwide held ""ICE Out For Good"" protests last weekend.

Between the lines: Similar shootings or the use of excessive force by local police officers — when caught on video — are often followed by promises of a thorough investigation by independent agencies or a panel.

If the case is one of many drawing scrutiny of that agency, the DOJ faces pressure to launch a pattern-or-practice probe. That could force a city, county, or state to enter a consent decree on court-ordered reforms aimed at revamping a department, changing hiring standards and agreeing to more oversight.

DOJ's Civil Rights Division has launched dozens of pattern-and-practice investigations into local police departments since the 1990s.

But ICE has never faced one of them.

Zoom in: There have been at least seven ICE officer-involved shootings, two of them fatal, since Trump surged Homeland Security agents in city-by-city operations in early 2025, Axios' Brittany Gibson reports.

An Axios analysis of publicly known ICE excessive force cases shows that before 2025, the agency, on average, had one agent shooting case per year, and sometimes had none.

The big picture: An uptick in alleged abuse since Trump re-entered office should trigger a DOJ pattern-and-practice probe into ICE, Ira Kurzban, a civil rights lawyer and author of ""Kurzban's Immigration Law Sourcebook,"" tells Axios.

A growing number of U.S. citizens — many of them Latinos — have reported getting detained by ICE agents in what critics say are instances of racial profiling and overzealous policing.

Some Native American tribes say ICE immigration agents are harassing tribal members.

""The central question isn't whether they can prosecute. It's whether this Justice Department is willing to act like a Justice Department and actually do it,"" Kurzban said.

What we're watching: Minnesota officials are launching their own investigation into possible state charges against the ICE agent for Good's killing.

Some are accusing the Trump administration of limiting access to materials, interviews and the scene, possibly setting up more legal fights.

Flashback: The 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff raised the same legal knot now dogging the ICE agent shooting.

Why it matters: The issue is resurfacing fundamental divisions over strategy and messaging that have been dogging Democratic lawmakers throughout the second Trump administration.

Reps. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) clashed during a closed-door Democratic leadership meeting Tuesday over Kelly's efforts to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

Kelly, a Steering Committee co-chair running in a competitive primary for U.S. Senate, argued that her effort fires up the base, sources said. Lee, the battleground representative to leadership, shot back that an impeachment vote would hurt Democrats in swing districts.

Driving the news: Kelly is not the only one trying to take action.

Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) is introducing a bill called the Quick Recognition Act that would require ICE agents to wear scannable QR codes on their uniforms linking to webpages with their names, badge numbers and other information, his office told Axios.

Democrats are also trying to use the appropriations process to implement policy changes that would constrain ICE.

Some progressives want to go even further, as Axios reported Monday, and refuse to vote to fund the government ahead of the Jan. 31 fiscal cliff unless ICE's funding is slashed.

What they're saying: Lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill this week telling Axios they got an earful from constituents back in their districts about the Minneapolis shooting.

""There were a number of protests about it, very concerned about the lawless nature of what ICE is doing,"" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), adding that the issue is ""at the top of the list of continued incoming to our office.""

""We've gotten calls, letters, people coming up to me, people texting me ... telling me how upset they are about it,"" said Rep. Rob Menendez (D-N.J.).

Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) told Axios that ICE is ""incredibly unpopular"" in her district and that the issue is ""high salience.""

What we're hearing: The topic came up during House Democrats' full caucus meeting Tuesday morning, according to lawmakers who were in the room, but only after leadership spent the first portion of the meeting focused squarely on issues like health care and affordability.

Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) were given time to speak about a field hearing they are holding in Minneapolis on Friday about the Renee Good shooting, which leadership has encouraged members to attend, sources said.

But there was only muted discussion about issues like ICE funding and no talk of impeachment, several lawmakers said.

One House Democrat told Axios that, despite the ICE issue ""popping up because of what just happened,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has been ""masterful"" at keeping the caucus as focused as possible on affordability and not sidetracked by ""shiny objects.""

The intrigue: While efforts to slash funding for ICE or impeach Noem are extreme long shots, some reform to the agency may be very much be on the table.

Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees DHS, said his panel was ""down to a few issues"" in its negotiations on a bill to fund the department when the Renee Good shooting happened.

The incident meant ""that we have to come up with additional language"" to ""provide oversight"" of the agency, he said.

However, the centrist Texas Democrat shut down progressives' musings about going any further: ""We're not going to defund ICE.""

The bottom line: For some members, issues like ICE will simply never break through enough take precedence over kitchen table economic issues.

""It adds to the larger narrative of chaos and concern for this administration,"" said Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio), but ICE ""has never been a top three issue"" in his district.

WASHINGTON – Today, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced the termination of Somalia’s designation for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The termination will be effective on March 17, 2026.

“Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status,” said Secretary Noem. “Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests.

Somalia’s designation expires March 17, 2026. At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, after consultation with appropriate U.S. government agencies, must review the country to determine whether the conditions supporting its designation continue to be met and, if so, how long to extend the designation.

Somali nationals who do not have a legal status other than TPS that would allow them to remain in the United States should use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP Home mobile app to report their departure from the United States. The app is a safe, secure way to self-deport and includes a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and the opportunity for potential future legal immigration.

Indianapolis Public Schools has rescinded resolutions signaling support for undocumented students following a lawsuit from state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

Instead, a new proposed policy on student access, safety, and privacy says the district will continue to protect the confidentiality of student records and information while providing “equal access to public education” for all students who live within the district — regardless of immigration status.

The proposal comes in the wake of a November lawsuit from Rokita’s office that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement. Rokita alleged that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country with his son, an IPS student.

Attorneys for IPS have said in court that the district would adopt a new policy that would render the state’s lawsuit moot. The board is expected to vote on the policy proposal at its meeting in February, according to board president Angelia Moore.

The updates could ultimately change little in how the district serves and protects undocumented students, whose rights to education and privacy are already protected by a string of state and federal laws and a U.S. Supreme Court case. The lawsuit, however, claims the district policy violates a state law that prohibits government entities from restricting immigration enforcement.

Neither IPS nor Rokita’s office immediately responded to a request for comment. School board president Angelia Moore declined to comment on the proposed policy, citing the ongoing litigation.

New resolution maintains IPS support for all students

At a retreat on Saturday, the IPS school board rescinded two prior resolutions supporting undocumented students. One was adopted early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and the other was adopted early in his second term, amid high-profile and controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

One 2017 resolution stated the district’s support for creating a safe place for all students regardless of immigration status. It directed employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

Another 2025 resolution reaffirmed this commitment to all students.

But the resolution to rescind these prior commitments still maintains that the district supports all students and employees. It also references a variety of state and federal laws to protect immigrant families, including the federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

The resolution also references the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. Legal experts say Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can only enter school grounds under certain circumstances.

And the resolution references the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe that undocumented students have a right to public education.

The proposed IPS policy states that IPS will operate within the legal framework provided by the United States Constitution, the state constitution, federal and state civil rights laws, federal education privacy laws, and Indiana statutes on public education.

The superintendent will adopt training and protocols for staff regarding student privacy and requests from outside agencies seeking information or access to students, the proposed policy states.

Rokita’s ICE lawsuit hinges on deportation flight

Rokita’s lawsuit alleges that an IPS student, the son of a Honduran national, went to school on the morning of his father’s scheduled deportation flight. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the lawsuit claims.

The district said it would not release the child to an ICE officer without a judicial warrant or court order, the lawsuit states.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as he had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” the lawsuit states.

Rokita’s lawsuit targeted several district policies, including the 2017 resolution.

His office has previously argued that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. He has also argued that school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment.",https://www.chalkbeat.org/resizer/v2/6JI5UYPYSBAXFGY2WPYQ733XG4.JPG?smart=true&auth=f76a93a2180eb40b83b863510362dfe54db760f665f5af8ae9314460042d14e6&width=1200&height=630,N,,2026-01-13 15:58:39.435191

“Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests.
We are putting Americans first.” The Trump administration has moved to end T.P.S.
The choice is yours.” The announcement to end the program came after President Trump pledged to end the protections for Somalis in November.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalis living in the country, saying he does not want them in the United States.","The Trump administration is ending deportation protections for more than 2,000 migrants from Somalia, homeland security officials said on Tuesday.

The end of the program comes as federal officials are carrying out an intense immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota, the state with the largest population of Somalis in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security is dispatching roughly 3,000 officers and agents to Minnesota, a move that federal officials say is meant to crack down on fraud and illegal immigration.

The termination affects 2,471 Somali nationals who are able to live and work in the United States through the program, called Temporary Protected Status, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. About 1,380 Somalis in the country have pending applications.

The program, which is meant to help migrants who cannot safely return to their countries, is expected to end on March 17.

The protections were first authorized in the early 1990s, when the Somali government collapsed and the nation descended into civil war. Although T.P.S. is meant to be temporary, the protections for Somalis have been extended many times because of ongoing armed conflict and other safety threats in Somalia.

In justifying the termination, homeland security officials said that conditions in Somalia had improved and allowing Somalis to stay would not be in the “national interests” of the United States.

“Temporary means temporary,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement. “Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.”

The Trump administration has moved to end T.P.S. for hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela. Some of those efforts have prompted concerns that migrants would be returning to unstable countries that still face conflict and violence.

In a social media post, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials urged Somalis covered by the program to leave the United States.

“Leave the U.S. on your own terms between NOW and March 17th … ,” the agency said in the post, “or receive a visit from ICE. The choice is yours.”

The announcement to end the program came after President Trump pledged to end the protections for Somalis in November. Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked Somalis living in the country, saying he does not want them in the United States.

His administration’s focus on Minnesota in recent weeks stems in large part from revelations about a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the state in recent years. More than 90 people have been charged in the federal fraud investigations, and Justice Department officials have said many are of Somali descent.

Roughly 80,000 people of Somali ancestry live in Minnesota, and a majority are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.

Last week, the Department of Homeland Security said it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota that had already been approved, a move that prompted backlash among immigrant advocates who said those refugees had already been through an extensive screening process.

Other federal agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Labor, have also announced new investigations and other efforts they say are meant to root out fraud in Minnesota.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/13dc-somalis-pwgc/13dc-somalis-pwgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 14:58:58.572553

Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.
In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so.
“What can HPD do to federal agents?” Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.","Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns.

An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard that his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; she then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.

After George Floyd’s murder by a police officer six years ago in Minneapolis — less than a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good last week — police departments and federal agencies banned chokeholds and other moves that can restrict breathing or blood flow.

But those tactics are back, now at the hands of agents conducting President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Examples are scattered across social media. ProPublica found more than 40 cases over the past year of immigration agents using these life-threatening maneuvers on immigrants, citizens and protesters. The agents are usually masked, their identities secret. The government won’t say if any of them have been punished.

In nearly 20 cases, agents appeared to use chokeholds and other neck restraints that the Department of Homeland Security prohibits “unless deadly force is authorized.”

About two dozen videos show officers kneeling on people’s necks or backs or keeping them face down on the ground while already handcuffed. Such tactics are not prohibited outright but are often discouraged, including by federal trainers, in part because using them for a prolonged time risks asphyxiation.

We reviewed footage with a panel of eight former police officers and law enforcement experts. They were appalled.

This is what bad policing looks like, they said. And it puts everyone at risk.

“I arrested dozens upon dozens of drug traffickers, human smugglers, child molesters — some of them will resist,” said Eric Balliet, who spent more than two decades working at Homeland Security Investigations and Border Patrol, including in the first Trump administration. “I don’t remember putting anybody in a chokehold. Period.”

“If this was one of my officers, he or she would be facing discipline,” said Gil Kerlikowske, a longtime police chief in Seattle who also served as Customs and Border Protection commissioner under President Barack Obama. “You have these guys running around in fatigues, with masks, with ‘Police’ on their uniform,” but they aren’t acting like professional police.

Over the past week, the conduct of agents has come under intense scrutiny after an ICE officer in Minneapolis killed Good, a mother of three. The next day, a Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot a man and woman in a hospital parking lot.

Top administration officials rushed to defend the officers. Speaking about the agent who shot Good, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said, “This is an experienced officer who followed his training.”

Officials said the same thing to us after we showed them footage of officers using prohibited chokeholds. Federal agents have “followed their training to use the least amount of force necessary,” department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

“Officers act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

Both DHS and the White House lauded the “utmost professionalism” of their agents.

Our compilation of incidents is far from complete. Just as the government does not count how often it detains citizens or smashes through vehicle windows during immigration arrests, it does not publicly track how many times agents have choked civilians or otherwise inhibited their breathing or blood flow. We gathered cases by searching legal filings, social media posts and local press reports in English and Spanish.

Given the lack of any count over time, it’s impossible to know for certain how agents’ current use of the banned and dangerous tactics compares with earlier periods.

But former immigration officials told us they rarely heard of such incidents during their long tenures. They also recalled little pushback when DHS formally banned chokeholds and other tactics in 2023; it was merely codifying the norm.

That norm has now been broken.

One of the citizens whom agents put in a chokehold was 16 years old.

Tenth grader Arnoldo Bazan and his father were getting McDonald’s before school when their car was pulled over by unmarked vehicles. Masked immigration agents started banging on their windows. As Arnoldo’s undocumented father, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, drove off, the terrified teenager began filming on his phone. The video shows the agents repeatedly ramming the Bazans’ car during a slow chase through the city.

Bazan Carrillo eventually parked and ran into a restaurant supply store. When Arnoldo saw agents taking his father violently to the ground, Arnoldo went inside too, yelling at the agents to stop.

One agent put Arnoldo in a chokehold while another pressed a knee into his father’s neck. “I was going to school!” the boy pleaded. He said later that when he told the agent he was a citizen and a minor, the agent didn’t stop.

“I started screaming with everything I had, because I couldn’t even breathe,” Arnoldo told ProPublica, showing where the agent’s hands had closed around his throat. “I felt like I was going to pass out and die.”

DHS’ McLaughlin accused Arnoldo’s dad of ramming his car “into a federal law enforcement vehicle,” but he was never charged for that, and the videos we reviewed do not support this claim. Our examination of his criminal history — separate from any immigration violations — found only that Bazan Carrillo pleaded guilty a decade ago to misdemeanor driving while intoxicated.

McLaughlin also said the younger Bazan elbowed an officer in the face as he was detained, which the teen denies. She said that Arnoldo was taken into custody to confirm his identity and make sure he didn’t have any weapons. McLaughlin did not answer whether the agent’s conduct was justified.

Experts who reviewed video of the Bazans’ arrests could make no sense of the agents’ actions.

“Why are you in the middle of a store trying to grab somebody?” said Marc Brown, a former police officer turned instructor who taught ICE and Border Patrol officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. “Your arm underneath the neck, like a choking motion? No! The knee on the neck? Absolutely not.”

DHS revamped its training curriculum after George Floyd’s murder to underscore those tactics were out of bounds, Brown said. “DHS specifically was very big on no choking,” he said. “We don’t teach that. They were, like, hardcore against it. They didn’t want to see anything with the word ‘choke.’”

After agents used another banned neck restraint — a carotid hold — a man started convulsing and passed out.

In early November, ICE agents in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, stopped a young father, Carlos Sebastian Zapata Rivera, as he drove with his family. They had come for his undocumented wife, whom they targeted after she was charged with assault for allegedly stabbing a co-worker in the hand with scissors.

Body camera footage from the local police, obtained by ProPublica, captured much of what happened. The couple’s 1-year-old daughter began crying. Agents surrounded the car, looking in through open doors.

According to the footage, an agent told Zapata Rivera that if his wife wouldn’t come out, they would have to arrest him, too — and their daughter would be sent into the foster system. The agent recounted the conversation to a local cop: “Technically, I can arrest both of you,” he said. “If you no longer have a child, because the child is now in state custody, you’re both gonna be arrested. Do you want to give your child to the state?”

Zapata Rivera, who has a pending asylum claim, clung to his family. His wife kept saying she wouldn’t go anywhere without her daughter, whom she said was still breastfeeding. Zapata Rivera wouldn’t let go of either of them.

Federal agents seemed conflicted on how to proceed. “I refuse to have us videotaped throwing someone to the ground while they have a child in their hands,” one ICE agent told a police officer at the scene.

But after more than an hour, agents held down Zapata Rivera’s arms. One, who Zapata Rivera’s lawyer says wore a baseball cap reading “Ne Quis Effugiat” — Latin for “So That None Will Escape” — pressed his thumbs into the arteries on Zapata Rivera’s neck. The young man then appeared to pass out as bystanders screamed.

The technique is known as a carotid restraint. The two carotid arteries carry 70% of the brain’s blood flow; block them, and a person can quickly lose consciousness. The tactic can cause strokes, seizures, brain damage — and death.

“Even milliseconds or seconds of interrupted blood flow to the brain can have serious consequences,” Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurologist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, told us. Saadi said she couldn’t comment on specific cases, “but there is no amount of training or method of applying pressure on the neck that is foolproof in terms of avoiding neurologic damage.”

In a bystander video of Zapata Rivera’s arrest, his eyes roll back in his head and he suffers an apparent seizure, convulsing so violently that his daughter, seated in his lap, shakes with him.

“Carotid restraints are prohibited unless deadly force is authorized,” DHS’ use-of-force policy states. Deadly force is authorized only when an officer believes there’s an “imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury” and there is “no alternative.”

In a social media post after the incident and in its statement to ProPublica, DHS did not cite a deadly threat. Instead, it referenced the charges against Zapata Rivera’s wife and suggested he had only pretended to have a medical crisis while refusing help from paramedics. “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice,” the post said.

“These statements were lies,” Zapata Rivera alleges in an ongoing civil rights lawsuit he filed against the ICE agent who used the carotid restraint. His lawyer told ProPublica that Zapata Rivera was disoriented after regaining consciousness; the lawsuit says he was denied medical attention. (Representatives for Zapata Rivera declined our requests for an interview with him. His wife has been released on bond, and her assault case awaits trial.)

A police report and bodycam footage from Fitchburg officers at the scene, obtained via a public records request, back up Zapata Rivera’s account of being denied assistance. “He’s fine,” an agent told paramedics, according to footage. The police report says Zapata Rivera wanted medical attention but “agents continued without stopping.”

Saadi, the Harvard neurologist, said that as a general matter, determining whether someone had a seizure is “not something even neurologists can do accurately just by looking at it.”

DHS policy bars using chokeholds and carotid restraints just because someone is resisting arrest. Agents are doing it anyway.

When DHS issued restrictions on chokeholds and carotid restraints, it stated that the moves “must not be used as a means to control non-compliant subjects or persons resisting arrest.” Deadly force “shall not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject.”

But videos reviewed by ProPublica show that agents have been using these restraints to do just that.

In Los Angeles in June, masked officers from ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agencies pepper-sprayed and then tackled another citizen, Luis Hipolito. As Hipolito struggled to get away, one of the agents put him in a chokehold. Another pointed a Taser at bystanders filming.

Then Hipolito’s body began to convulse — a possible seizure. An onlooker warned the agents, “You gonna let him die.”

When officers make a mistake in the heat of the moment, said Danny Murphy, a former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, they need to “correct it as quickly as possible.”

That didn’t happen in Hipolito’s case. The footage shows the immigration agent not only wrapping his arm around Hipolito’s neck as he takes him down but also sticking with the chokehold after Hipolito is pinned on the ground.

The agent’s actions are “dangerous and unreasonable,” Murphy said.

Asked about the case, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said that Hipolito was arrested for assaulting an ICE officer. Hipolito’s lawyers did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Hipolito limped into court days after the incident. Another citizen who was with him the day of the incident was also charged, but her case was dropped. Hipolito pleaded not guilty and goes to trial in February.

Some of the conduct in the footage isn’t banned — but it’s discouraged and dangerous.

A video from Los Angeles shows a Colombian-born TikTokker who often filmed ICE apparently passed out after officers pulled her from her Tesla and knelt on her neck. Another video shows a DoorDash driver in Portland, Oregon, screaming for air as four officers pin him face down in the street. “Aire, aire, aire,” he says. “No puedo respirar” — I can’t breathe. Then: “Estoy muriendo” — I’m dying. A third video, from Chicago, shows an agent straddling a citizen and repeatedly pressing his face into the asphalt. Onlookers yell that the man can’t breathe.

Placing a knee on a prone subject’s neck or weight on their back isn’t banned under DHS’ use-of-force policy, but it can be dangerous — and the longer it goes on, the higher the risk that the person won’t be able to breathe.

“You really don’t want to spend that amount of time just trying to get somebody handcuffed,” said Kerlikowske, the former CPB commissioner, of the video of the arrest in Portland.

Brown, the former federal instructor and now a lead police trainer at the University of South Carolina, echoed that. “Once you get them handcuffed, you get them up, get them out of there,” he said. “If they’re saying they can’t breathe, hurry up.”

Taking a person down to the ground and restraining them there can be an appropriate way to get them in handcuffs, said Seth Stoughton, a former police officer turned law professor who also works at the University of South Carolina. But officers have long known to make it quick. By the mid-1990s, the federal government was advising officers against keeping people prolongedly in a prone position.

When a federal agent kneeled on the neck of an intensive care nurse in August, she said she understood the danger she was in and tried to scream.

“I knew that the amount of pressure being placed on the back of my neck could definitely hurt me,” said Amanda Trebach, a citizen and activist who was arrested in Los Angeles while monitoring immigration agents. “I was having a hard time breathing because my chest was on the ground.”

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said Trebach impeded agents’ vehicles and struck them with her signs and fists.

Trebach denies this. She was released without any charges.

Protesters have also been choked and strangled.

In the fall, a protester in Chicago refused to stand back after a federal agent told him to do so. Suddenly, the agent grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him to the ground.

“No, no!” one bystander exclaims. “He’s not doing anything!”

DHS’ McLaughlin did not respond to questions about the incident.

Along with two similar choking incidents at protests outside of ICE facilities, this is one of the few videos in which the run-up to the violence is clear. And the experts were aghast.

“Without anything I could see as even remotely a deadly force threat, he immediately goes for the throat,” said Ashley Heiberger, a retired police captain from Pennsylvania who frequently testifies in use-of-force cases. Balliet, the former immigration official, said the agent turned the scene into a “pissing contest” that was “explicitly out of control.”

“It’s so clearly excessive and ridiculous,” Murphy said. “That’s the kind of action which should get you fired.”

“How big a threat did you think he was?” Brown said, noting that the officer slung his rifle around his back before grabbing and body-slamming the protester. “You can’t go grab someone just because they say, ‘F the police.’”

Roving patrols + unplanned arrests = unsafe tactics.

In November, Border Patrol agents rushed into the construction site of a future Panda Express in Charlotte, North Carolina, to check workers’ papers. When one man tried to run, an officer put him in a chokehold and later marched him out, bloodied, to a waiting SUV.

The Charlotte operation was one of Border Patrol’s many forays into American cities, as agents led by commander-at-large Gregory Bovino claimed to target “criminal illegal aliens” but frequently chased down landscapers, construction workers and U.S. citizens in roving patrols through predominantly immigrant or Latino communities.

Freelance photographer Ryan Murphy, who had been following Border Patrol’s convoys around Charlotte, documented the Panda Express arrest.

“Their tactics are less sophisticated than you would think,” he told ProPublica. “They sort of drive along the streets, and if they see somebody who looks to them like they could potentially be undocumented, they pull over.”

Experts told ProPublica that if officers are targeting a specific individual, they can minimize risks by deciding when, where and how to take them into custody. But when they don’t know their target in advance, chaos — and abuse — can follow.

“They are encountering people they don’t know anything about,” said Scott Shuchart, a former assistant director at ICE.

“The stuff that I’ve been seeing in the videos,” Kerlikowske said, “has been just ragtag, random.”

There may be other factors, too, our experts said, including quotas and a lack of consequences amid gutted oversight. With officers wearing masks, Shuchart said, “even if they punch grandma in the face, they won’t be identified.”

As they sweep into American cities, immigration officers are unconstrained — and, the experts said, unprepared. Even well-trained officers may not be trained for the environments where they now operate. Patrolling a little-populated border region takes one set of skills. Working in urban areas, where citizens — and protesters — abound, takes another.

DHS and Bovino did not respond to questions about their agents’ preparation or about the chokehold in Charlotte.

Experts may think there’s abuse. But holding officers to account? That’s another matter.

Back in Houston, immigration officers dropped 16-year-old Arnoldo off at the doorstep of his family home a few hours after the arrest. His neck was bruised, and his new shirt was shredded. Videos taken by his older sisters show the soccer star struggling to speak through sobs.

Uncertain what exactly had happened to him, his sister Maria Bazan took him to Texas Children’s Hospital, where staff identified signs of the chokehold and moved him to the trauma unit. Hospital records show he was given morphine for pain and that doctors ordered a dozen CT scans and X-rays, including of his neck, spine and head.

From the hospital, Maria called the Houston Police Department and tried to file a report, the family said. After several unsuccessful attempts, she took Arnoldo to the department in person, where she says officers were skeptical of the account and their own ability to investigate federal agents.

Arnoldo had filmed much of the incident, but agents had taken his phone. He used Find My to locate the phone — at a vending machine for used electronics miles away, close to an ICE detention center. The footage, which ProPublica has reviewed, backed the family’s account of the chase.

The family says Houston police still haven’t interviewed them. A department spokesperson told ProPublica it was not investigating the case, referring questions to DHS. But the police have also not released bodycam footage and case files aside from a top sheet, citing an open investigation.

“We can’t do anything,” Maria said one officer told her. “What can HPD do to federal agents?”

Elsewhere in the country, some officials are trying to hold federal immigration officers to account.

In California, the state Legislature passed bills prohibiting immigration officers from wearing masks and requiring them to display identification during operations.

In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law that allows residents to sue any officer who violates state or federal constitutional rights. (The Trump administration quickly filed legal challenges against California and Illinois, claiming their new laws are unconstitutional.)

In Colorado, Durango’s police chief saw a recent video of an immigration officer using a chokehold on a protester and reported it to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which announced it was looking into the incident.

In Minnesota, state and local leaders are collecting evidence in Renee Good’s killing even as the federal government cut the state out of its investigation.

Arnoldo is still waiting for Houston authorities to help him, still terrified that a masked agent will come first. Amid soccer practice and making up schoolwork he missed while recovering, he watches and rewatches the videos from that day. The car chase, the chokehold, his own screams at the officers to leave his dad alone. His father in the driver’s seat, calmly handing Arnoldo his wallet and phone while stopping mid-chase for red lights.

The Bazan family said agents threatened to charge Arnoldo if his dad didn’t agree to be deported. DHS spokesperson McLaughlin did not respond when asked about the alleged threat. Arnoldo’s dad is now in Mexico.

Asked why an officer choked Arnoldo, McLaughlin pointed to the boy’s alleged assault with his elbow, adding, “The federal law enforcement officer graciously chose not to press charges.”

How We Did It

ProPublica journalists Nicole Foy, McKenzie Funk, Joanna Shan, Haley Clark and Cengiz Yar gathered videos via Spanish and English social media posts, local press reports and court records. We then sent a selection of these videos to eight police experts and former immigration officials, along with as much information as we could gather about the lead-up to and context of each incident. The experts analyzed the videos with us, explaining when and how officers used dangerous tactics that appeared to go against their training or that have been banned under the Department of Homeland Security’s use-of-force policy.

We also tried to contact every person we could identify being choked or kneeled on. In some cases, we also reached out to bystanders.

Research reporter Mariam Elba conducted criminal record searches of every person we featured in this story. She also attempted to fact-check the allegations that DHS made about the civilians and their arrests. Our findings are not comprehensive because there is no universal criminal record database.

We also sent every video cited in this story to the White House, DHS, CBP, ICE, border czar Tom Homan and Border Patrol’s Gregory Bovino. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin provided a statement responding to some of the incidents we found but she did not explain why agents used banned tactics or whether any of the agents have been disciplined for doing so.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hiresArtboard-1_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2026-01-13 15:58:22.081628

On CNN’s “State of the Union” Jan. 11, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told anchor Jake Tapper the Trump administration had shortened ICE agents’ training time while scaling up its hiring.

“Remember we’re beefing up ICE 10,000 more agents,” Warner said. “They are not getting the traditional five months training. Literally, Jake, the training for the ICE agents now is 47 days. Why 47 days? Because Donald Trump is the 47th president.”

He also used this figure Jan. 8 when talking to a liberal commentator and Jan. 12 on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

Other lawmakers, social media posts and journalists repeated the same line in the days after ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot Renee Good.

The Trump administration has confirmed to multiple news organizations it shortened the duration of immigration agent training, while taking issue with some outlets’ framing and declining to answer follow-up questions. Neither ICE nor DHS responded to PolitiFact’s queries. We were unable to confirm whether the number of training days is connected to Trump’s status as the 47th president.

Ross had been a deportation officer with the agency since 2015, The Associated Press reported, so he was subject to earlier, longer training standards.

Warner, who did not respond to PolitiFact, said on CNN that the investigation into Good’s killing needed to be completed before people reached conclusions.

When Tapper pointed out to Warner that the ICE agent who shot Good “had at least 10 years experience,” Warner said, “So be it, and again that’s why there ought to be an investigation.”

Trump’s ICE shortened training, but reports vary on how much

The training talking point stems from The Atlantic August story “Fast Times at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” Reporter Nick Miroff wrote that training for new deportation officers had been reduced from about five months to 47 days, citing three unnamed officials.

“Administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses,” the report said. “Academy training was shortened to 47 days, three officials told me, the number picked because Trump is the 47th president. DHS officials said the training will run six days a week for eight weeks.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that The Atlantic’s reporting was “false,” because training is eight weeks. The Examiner story, however, cited ICE acting director Todd Lyons as confirming an eight-week training schedule of six work days per week. That amounts to 48 training days.

The frequently asked questions page on ICE’s career website reflects the outdated training schedule, saying new deportation officers will complete almost five months of training — five weeks of language and 16 weeks of law enforcement.

The AP in August reported the agency “cut Spanish-language requirements to reduce training by five weeks,” citing Caleb Vitello, who runs ICE training. Vitello told AP the Spanish-language training that was cut would be supplemented with translation technology services.

News organizations and administration officials have reported training times shorter than 48 days in recent months:

An unnamed DHS official told NBC News in October that ICE had originally shortened its training from 13 to eight weeks before shortening it again to six weeks.

Government Executive, a news outlet that covers federal agencies, reported Jan. 5 that DHS has shortened ICE agent training from six months “to around six weeks.”

DHS has not offered clarity about new officer training since the Minneapolis shooting. A senior DHS official told People magazine Jan. 8, “Training to become an Enforcement and Removal Operations officer is 8 weeks long,” and declined to specify the number of days.

“The official did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for clarification, since eight weeks matches the timeframe that The Atlantic previously reported,” it reported.

ICE officer who shot Good had 10 years experience, additional training

Having worked for ICE for a decade, Ross would have followed the previous 16-week training schedule and five-week language program.

Ross also received specialized training after being selected for ICE’s special response team, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told AP.

Before becoming an ICE agent, Ross served in the Indiana National Guard and was deployed to Iraq and also worked as a Border Patrol field intelligence officer.

Our ruling

Warner said immigration agents “are not getting the traditional five months training. … The training for the ICE agents now is 47 days.”

News outlets and Homeland Security officials reported cuts to the length of ICE training during Trump’s second term, reducing it from about five months to six days a week for eight weeks. That’s 48 days of training over a 56-day period. (What it has to do with Trump’s status as 47th president is outside of the scope of this fact-check.) Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Good, had been with the department for about 10 years.

Two news organizations have since reported that the duration of training was further reduced to about six weeks; spokespersons from DHS and ICE did not respond to our requests for confirmation.

In the big picture, ICE officers’ training time has been significantly shortened to a period at or near what Warner cites.

Gas clouds filled a Minneapolis street near where Renee Good was fatally shot in the head by an immigration agent last week. A man scrubbed his eyes with snow and screamed for help as agents in an unmarked Jeep sprayed an orange irritant and drove away.

It's common for people to boo, taunt and blow orange whistles when they spot heavily armed agents passing through in unmarked vehicles or walking the streets.

""Who doesn't have a whistle?"" a man with a bag of them yelled.

Brita Anderson, who lives nearby and came to support neighborhood friends, said she was ""incensed"" to see agents in tactical gear and gas masks, and wondered about their purpose.

""It felt like the only reason they'd come here is to harass people,"" Anderson said.

In Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, students protesting the immigration enforcement operation walked out of school as students elsewhere have done this week.

With the Department of Homeland Security pledging to send more than 2,000 immigration officers into Minnesota, the state, joined by Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued President Donald Trump's administration Monday to halt or limit the surge.

The lawsuit says the Department of Homeland Security is violating the First Amendment and other constitutional protections by focusing on a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants.

""This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities in Minnesota, and it must stop,"" state Attorney General Keith Ellison said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: ""What we are seeing is thousands — plural — thousands of federal agents coming into our city. And, yeah, they're having a tremendous impact on day-to-day life.""

Dozens of protests or vigils have taken place across the U.S. to honor Good since the 37-year-old mother of three was killed.

Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to the lawsuit, accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety.

""President Trump's job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,"" McLaughlin said.

The Trump administration has repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot Good, saying he acted in self-defense. But that explanation has been widely panned by Frey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and others based on videos of the confrontation.

Two Democratic lawmakers from Massachusetts announced Tuesday they are sponsoring a bill to make it easier for people to sue and overcome immunity protections for federal officers who are accused of violating civil rights. The bill stands little chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress.

In Wisconsin, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez is proposing that the state ban civil immigration enforcement around courthouses, hospitals, health clinics, schools, churches and other places. She is hoping to succeed Gov. Tony Evers, a fellow Democrat, who is not running for a third term.

""We can take a look at that, but I think banning things absolutely will ramp up the actions of our folks in Washington, D.C.,"" Evers said, referring to the Trump administration. ""They don't tend to approach those things appropriately.""

Article Summary

Illinois filed a 103-page lawsuit that seeks to severely limit federal immigration agents’ authority to execute the types of aggressive raids that began in Chicago last September.

The state and city of Chicago asked a court to prevent the feds from using “roving patrol” tactics used by immigration agents, as well as face scans and crowd control tactics such as tear gas.

State and city leaders say the feds have used such aggressive tactics to try to coerce them into changing their immigration policies.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, seeking to severely limit immigration agents’ authority in the state after accusing the feds of unleashing an “organized bombardment” to coerce state and local officials to change their immigration policies.

State and city leaders want to end the feds’ “roving patrol” policy of interrogating people they encounter on the street about their citizenship and immigration status without any probable cause. They’re also seeking to limit crowd control tactics such as using tear gas to disperse nonviolent crowds and to prevent the feds from scanning the biometric information of state residents.

“Border Patrol agents and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers.”

Raoul, along with the city of Chicago, filed the 103-page lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. It accused the federal government of applying pressure over policy differences through means such as withholding federal funds, attempting to deploy the National Guard and, most disruptively, executing an immigration enforcement operation described by state officials as “causing turmoil and imposing a climate of fear.”

It also seeks to prevent immigration enforcement at “sensitive locations” without “appropriate reasoning,” including courthouses, schools, social service organizations and medical facilities. And it seeks to bar immigration agents from “trespassing” on private property to make arrests, in violation of the 4th Amendment. The suit argues immigration agents only have the authority to do so within 25 miles of a U.S. Border to prevent illegal entry to the country.

The state is asking the court to find that the federal government’s “menacing, violent, and unlawful incursion” violates the 10th Amendment, and to order federal agents to stop using tactics that exceed their statutory authority.

‘Unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations’

Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement in support of the lawsuit, writing that “in the face of the Trump Administration’s cruelty and intimidation, Illinois is standing up against the attacks on our people.”

“Today, Illinois is once again taking Donald Trump to court to hold his administration accountable for their unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations, and flagrant abuses of power,” Pritzker said.

The lawsuit names, among others, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino — the public face of DHS’ Operation Midway Blitz immigration enforcement campaign — as defendants.

Much of the lawsuit pulls from claims brought in an earlier suit by media organizations and protestors who challenged the feds’ use-of-force tactics. The plaintiffs motioned for the case to be reassigned to the same judge in that challenge, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, according to reporting by the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times. Previously, she issued an injunction against use of force in that case, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed it.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois in a statement the latest suit was “baseless.”

“The fact is that sanctuary politicians in Illinois and Chicago released violent criminals including murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists, onto its streets and their dereliction of duty cost lives—just ask Katie Abraham’s father,” McLaughlin said, referring to a 20-year-old Glenview woman who was killed in a hit-and-run crash last year allegedly by a Guatemalan in the country without legal authorization. “This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.”

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a similar lawsuit Monday seeking to block a surge of immigration enforcement in that state. It comes less than a week after an ICE agent shot 37-year-old American citizen Renee Nicole Good at close range while she was apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop.

‘Campaign of coercion’

The Illinois lawsuit claims that Midway Blitz is part of a “campaign of coercion” by the Trump administration attempting to force state and local governments, including Illinois and the city of Chicago, to change their sanctuary immigration policies.

The state’s TRUST Act, signed by then-Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017, generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with immigration enforcement unless a federal criminal warrant is presented.

Chicago has had “sanctuary city” status since 1985.

The state and federal policies are meant to foster trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by ensuring that interactions do not result in immigration detention or deportation. But these policies, which predominate in the nation’s blue states and blue cities, have been the target of ire from the Trump administration, which has accused state and local jurisdictions of impeding their mass deportation goals.

Trump sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last year seeking to invalidate the state and local policies, but the challenge was dismissed by a federal judge in July, who found that they were protected under the 10th Amendment.

Federal ‘occupation’

Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region. The department claims that it has resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants in the country without legal authorization.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview.

Confrontations initiated by immigration officers resulted in two shootings, including one with deadly consequences, during the height of Midway Blitz. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park in September after he attempted to flee a traffic stop. In October, a federal agent shot Marimar Martinez five times in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. She survived and the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago has dropped all charges against her.

Characterizing it as a federal “occupation” of a sovereign state, the suit accuses the feds of sending armed immigration agents to roam city streets to question people about their citizenship status, capture and retain biometric data without consent, arrest people without a warrant or probable cause and deploy tear gas and other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods and trespass on private property — all while concealing their identities with face masks and covering up license plates.

The suit includes a laundry list of documentation, alleging, for instance that federal agents deployed tear gas and other chemicals without warning at least 49 times in 18 separate incidents in Chicago over a 90-day period in 2025.

And following the launch of a “plate watch” hotline in late October, at least thirty-five distinct license plates were reported being swapped or used on more than one federal vehicle operated by Border Patrol or ICE, according to the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, which sent a “cease and desist” letter to DHS in October over the practice.

Return of Midway blitz?

While Midway Blitz has wound down in recent weeks, federal officials have been teasing a return with even larger numbers of agents in March. The filing includes Bovino stating, “Don’t call it a comeback; we’re gonna be here for years.”

The state is asking the court to bar Border Patrol agents from conducting civil immigration enforcement in Illinois, arguing that they are “not authorized or trained for large-scale removal enforcement in the interior of the United States.”

It’s also asking a judge to declare that tactics such as roving patrols, warrantless arrests, deploying tear gas and swapping plates, at least in this context, are in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs want those tactics barred in the future.

The lawsuit is just the latest in a litany of litigation between the state and federal government. Raoul has filed or joined in more than four-dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration over the past year, challenging everything from cuts to congressionally appropriated state funding to Trump’s now-aborted push to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago over the strenuous objections of Illinois’ elected leaders.

Actions like those, Raoul alleged in the latest lawsuit, are part of the Trump administration’s “coercion” campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court preventing the deployment of troops in Illinois. The underlying case Is still working through the courts, though Trump late last month dropped plans to deploy troops to American cities.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down a split decision on December 30, 2025, that could reshape how organizations conduct workplace training on sensitive topics. In a razor-thin ruling, five judges sided with two Missouri school employees who said their free speech rights were trampled during a required equity session.

Brooke Henderson and Jennifer Lumley worked for Springfield R-12 School District when they were told to attend Fall District-Wide Equity Training in October 2020. What happened during those sessions became the center of a constitutional fight that divided eleven federal judges in Henderson v. Springfield R-12 School District.

The training started with what seemed like standard ground rules. Staff received a handout listing principles: stay engaged, lean into your discomfort, acknowledge your privileges, be professional. Then came the warning that caught everyone's attention. A slide displayed during the presentation read: ""Be Professional - Or be Asked to Leave with No Credit.""

For Henderson and Lumley, that warning carried weight. No credit meant no pay, since the training was mandatory. Henderson attended virtually and was told to keep her camera on the entire time, even if she felt uncomfortable. Trainers said turning cameras off was disrespectful.

Both women spoke up initially. Henderson shared her view about Kyle Rittenhouse during a discussion. The district's chief equity and diversity officer told her she was wrong and confused. After that exchange, Henderson stayed quiet. She later said she felt unsafe voicing opinions and feared being written up or fired.

Lumley attended in person. After watching a video about George Floyd, she told her small group that his death wasn't a commentary on all law enforcement. Another attendee disagreed and seemed upset. When Lumley later said she didn't believe every white person is racist or that she was privileged because she grew up poor, a trainer told her that Black people cannot be racist. Other staff members raised their voices at her. The trainers didn't step in. Lumley described the next breakout session as very hostile and stopped talking.

Four staff members from another school told their principal they worried about having a target on their backs if they spoke up. When the equity officer heard about their concerns, she wrote back that the training wasn't an invitation but a requirement.

Henderson also had to complete online modules on her own time. The modules only let her move forward if she selected the pre-programmed correct answers. One question asked whether equity and diversity guidance was suggested or required policy. When she picked suggested, a message popped up: ""Incorrect! This is not suggested guidance. It is required policy and job responsibility.""

Another module asked how to respond when witnessing racism in the classroom. Henderson thought the answer depended on the situation and student, based on her twenty years in special education. But the module only accepted one answer: address it immediately. The system told her being an anti-racist requires immediate action.

Henderson believed the district might review her module responses, so she tailored some answers to get a higher score even though they didn't match her actual views.

The women sued in August 2021. A district court threw out their case, saying they hadn't been harmed and ordered them to pay the school district $312,869.50 in legal fees for bringing frivolous claims.

But the appeals court saw things differently. Writing for the majority, Circuit Judge Erickson said the employees showed a real threat of consequences if they disagreed with the district's views. Being kicked out of training and losing pay was enough to make a reasonable person keep quiet, the court found.

The majority pointed out that the harm isn't in actually getting punished. The harm is in the silencing itself. No one needs to suffer consequences before bringing a claim if the threat is credible enough.

Six judges disagreed strongly. Chief Judge Colloton wrote that sitting through a two-hour training you disagree with isn't a constitutional injury. Both women got paid, got their professional development credits, and kept their jobs. Lumley even got promoted.

The dissent warned the ruling opens the floodgates. Any employee who disagrees with any workplace training and stays quiet could now sue, they argued. If the next equity training takes a colorblind approach and tells people to be professional, employees who favor diversity and inclusion could sue too.

The case goes back to the lower court, where a judge will need to sort through whether the speech at issue was part of the women's job duties. That question could determine whether their claims ultimately succeed or fail.

For human resources professionals, the decision creates uncertainty around a common workplace practice. The ruling suggests that requiring agreement with specific viewpoints, threatening consequences for dissent, or using training formats that compel adoption of organizational positions could trigger legal exposure.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0343_639039237010366494.png,N,,2026-01-13 17:59:00.759950

The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending beyond their allotted funding and simultaneously restricts federal employees from working on a volunteer basis. The Act provides, in relevant part:

An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not accept voluntary services for either government or employ personal services exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.

31 U.S.C. § 1342 (emphasis added).

During lapses in federal funding, voluntary services are only authorized in very limited circumstances, but the parameters of the “safety of human life” or “protection of property” exceptions have not been uniformly defined nor applied across the courts.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s 2026 Contingency Plan anticipated civil litigation would be curtailed or delayed, absent cases that would substantially affect the protection of human life or property interests. Indeed, the Contingency Plan instructed federal civil litigators to “approach the courts and request that active cases, except for those in which a delay would compromise to a significant degree the safety of human life or the protection of property, be postponed until funding is available.” Nevertheless, the Contingency Plan also seemingly deferred to federal courts whether to stay proceedings, providing:

If a court denies such a request and orders a case to continue, the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue. The Department will limit its civil litigation staffing to the minimum level needed to comply with the court’s order and to protect life and property. Receipt of summonses, pleadings and motions by mail may be delayed.

A natural tension arises between the Anti-Deficiency Act, which aims to postpone cases, and Article III of the United States Constitution, which vests federal courts with the power to decide cases and controversies within its jurisdiction. See U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, cl. 1. As the cases discussed below illustrate, courts over time have endeavored to strike a balance between complying with the federal law and their constitutional authority during federal shutdowns.

In 2013, the D.C. Circuit court in United States, et al. v. US Airways Group, Inc. et al., contemplated whether a stay of proceedings due to a lapse in appropriations was warranted in a time-sensitive civil proceeding. 979 F.Supp.2d 33 (D.C. Cir. 2013). There, the federal government initiated the suit and sought injunctive relief to block a merger between two airline corporations. Although the government argued that the Anti-Deficiency Act only allowed employees to work in limited emergency circumstances, the court noted the time-sensitive nature of the matter, the substantial amount of money at issue, and the impact of a stay on swift resolution of the matter. Accordingly, the court denied the government’s motion to stay and allowed the matter to proceed during the federal shutdown.

During the 2019 federal shutdown, the D.C. Circuit also denied a request to stay oral argument in a civil proceeding. See Kornitzky Grp., LLC v. Elwell, 912 F.3d 637 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The concurring judges noted that the DOJ’s FY 2019 Contingency Plan, similar to the 2026 Contingency Plan, provided that if a court denies a stay, “the Government will comply with the court’s order, which would constitute express legal authorization for the activity to continue.” Specifically, the concurrence observed that the federal courts uniformly denied the government’s request to stay oral arguments during the 2013 federal shutdown and the government attorneys still appeared for oral argument.

Most recently, during the 2025 federal shutdown, a federal court denied the Department of Labor’s motion to stay proceedings and suggested that the DOL carried a burden to show “good grounds for either a stay or an extension of the deadlines previously established,” which was not met. Lehman v. Dep’t of Labor, 2025 WL 2808472, *2 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 2, 2025). While the court acknowledged the limitations set forth in the Anti-Deficiency Act, it recognized a circuit split on how strictly courts adhere to the general rule that government attorneys are not authorized to work during federal shutdowns—even on a volunteer basis—absent exceptional circumstances. Whereas the Sixth Circuit has traditionally taken a more literal interpretation of the Anti-Deficiency Act—finding government attorneys may exclusively work on “emergency” matters during a federal shutdown—the D.C. Circuit has taken a “less sanguine view” and has denied stays on the grounds that government attorneys must comply with federal court litigation timelines. Id. at *1 (comparing United States v. Trevino, 7 F.4th 424, 421 n.6 (6th Cir. 2021) (“The prosecution cannot continue without expenditures[,] [and] The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits any government official from carrying out the prosecution on an unpaid, volunteer basis.”) with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. USDA, 912 F.3d 641 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (declining to stay scheduling deadlines during the 2019 federal shutdown)).

The Lehman court further explained that the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct apply to federal government attorneys who appear before the state’s courts and provide that “[w]hen ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.” Id. at *2 (quoting Mich. Rule of Prof. Conduct 1.16(c)). While non-attorney government staff are not bound by the ethical rules, the court noted the DOL publicly announced that it has staff available to meet court-imposed deadlines. Unlike in US Airways Group and Kornitzky, which focused on the type of litigation and the stage of the proceedings to warrant postponement, here, the court appeared to focus on the government’s failure to show “good grounds” for a stay or deadline extension.

The Lehman approach was subsequently followed in New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget, 2025 WL 3089495 (D. Ma. Nov. 5, 2025), wherein the court echoed that federal courts retain the power to stay litigation and the Anti-Deficiency Act “does not require that non-emergency litigation cease.” There, the substantive issue was whether the federal government defendants could properly terminate funding for a federal grant that was formerly awarded to plaintiffs. After the federal shutdown took effect, defendants requested a stay to file a reply brief while plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment was pending. The court rejected defendants’ request, weighing the parties’ competing interests and finding a stay “could allow [d]efendants to continue to terminate funding but close off [p]laintiffs’ opportunity to resolve this matter pursuant to the parties’ agreed-upon schedule.” Stated differently, the court acknowledged that a stay could lead to a procedural advantage for the federal defendants by effectively preserving a status quo that is under scrutiny.

Conversely, in Dash Markets, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 3502097 (W.D. N.Y. Oct. 21, 2025) the court deviated from Lehman and New Jersey v. U.S. Office of Management & Budget by deferring to the Anti-Deficiency Act. There, the plaintiff sued the United States, seeking remission of $3 million in Employee Retention Credits and the government requested a stay due to the 2025 federal shutdown. While the court recognized that stays are “subject to the sound discretion of the court,” the court stated that it was “disinclined to subject [d]efendant’s counsel to the risk of violating the [Anti-Deficiency] Act” and does not find plaintiff’s “alleged financial plight to constitute a potential emergency exception to the Act.” Id. Accordingly, the government’s requested stay was granted. Id.

As illustrated by the courts’ differing approaches to the Anti-Deficiency Act, federal shutdowns create significant uncertainty for clients involved in civil litigation with federal agencies or personnel. While the current shutdown has ended, this moment demonstrates the need for practitioners and clients alike to remain vigilant in anticipating delays for future lapses in federal appropriations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.11535_5738.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:58:01.590685

Trainings and Resources

Thousands of people have either already completed or signed up for the Monarca network’s legal observer trainings—so many, in fact, that all upcoming trainings through the month of January are already at capacity. However, Monarca has valuable resources for community members on its website: signage to print for your business or private property and know-your-rights posters, legal observer basics, and both a hotline (to report ICE sightings) and a non-emergency line (for legal questions) on their contact page. It’s possible that more trainings will be announced for February, so keep an eye on the website.

Unidos MN has a thorough “know your rights” resource walking through a number of situations, i.e. if ICE shows up at your home or workplace, if you’re detained by the police, what documents to carry, etc.

The Star Tribune has compiled a great resource detailing what, exactly, ICE agents can and can’t do, and what rights legal observers have during encounters.

If you are trying to find someone who has been detained by ICE, here’s a link to the Online Detainee Locator System.

Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC) of Minnesota is offering a workplace know-your-rights training for restaurant workers on January 13 at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. In their words: “The restaurant and service industry is no exception when it comes to ICE enforcement and workplace targeting. Across the country, food service workers are facing fear and uncertainty due to raids and ICE activity. Knowledge is one of our strongest tools, and being prepared can make the difference between panic and protection for ourselves and our coworkers.” Here’s the link to register.

Food Drives and Fundraisers

Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee has continued its food card fundraiser to help get groceries and necessities to families forced into hiding, parents kept away from work and kids from school. You can donate here.

Pow Wow Grounds is currently open and accepting donations to meet community needs; you can find a list of desired items here.

Joyce Uptown Foodshelf is hosting its second emergency food drive on January 14 to meet “skyrocketing demand for emergency bags” for families who aren’t able to leave their homes. You can find details via their Facebook, but there are a number of local restaurants lending a hand. You can drop off donations at Picnic Linden Hills (which is holding a charity meat raffle on January 13 for MN Moms Demand Action and Immigrant Law Center of MN), Nightingale is a drop-off site through January 13, and Moona Moono is collaborating with local independent food critic Kirstie Kimball of Beyond Beurre Blanc to support Joyce Uptown, though it seems that . BBB’s Instagram page is also an excellent resource for information on how to continue supporting local families as 1) ICE operations continue to unfold and 2) food stamps and other hunger relief programs are yet again frozen in Minnesota.

Over in St. Paul, Zion Community Commons, Open Market MN, and the Twin Cities Vegan Chef Collective are working together to assemble “Shelter in Place” packs for families unable to leave their homes. You can find more information via Instagram.

Restaurants and Businesses to Support

One of the most-asked questions I’ve seen circulating on social media is: What businesses have been hit hardest by ICE’s presence, so we can support them? In short, the answer is: immigrant-owned restaurants who have large immigrant customer bases. I can’t draft up an exact and comprehensive list, much as I wish I could, but I can give you some places to start based on some of my favorites: Go for lunch at Mercado Central and get pupusas at Rincón Salvadoreño and apple turnovers from ground-floor bakery Panaderia El Mexicana; pick up a pressure cooker that’ll likely knock the socks off your Instant Pot. For sweets: My favorites are rice pudding-filled doughnuts from Panaderia San Miguel; conchas and apricot-glazed hilos from Papá Chuy’s; halwo and vanilla cake from Albi Kitchen (also the sambusas here are great); malawax (sweet crepes) from Karmel Mall (yes, Hamdi is excellent, but if you wander around the ground floor you’ll find a number of other stalls selling their own equally delicious versions). For dinner: salmon and spaghetti at Mama Safia’s; smoky pozole from Habanero Tacos Street on Lake Street; Homi Restaurant’s entire caldos menu over in St. Paul; 18-inch, pastor-filled machetes from Taco Libre; fried tilapia and pilaf rice at Wiilo Restaurant & Bakery in Karmel Mall; pork belly gorditas at El Taco Torro in Midtown Global Market. For tacos: True Jalisco-style quesabirria at Taco Taxi; tacos de canasta at Las Charolas on the ground floor of Plaza Mexico and barbacoa de chivo at El Chivo Crazy just upstairs; tacos al pastor at Taqueria La Hacienda. If you’re feeding a crowd, Tacos El Primo does amazing catering-sized meals.

A key note, though. As you’re visiting and eating, please don’t take photos—given the very scary and inflammatory nature of the moment, doing so could potentially make staff or customers feel unsafe.

Restaurant Closures

Unfortunately, ICE’s presence throughout the metro has caused a number of restaurants and businesses to temporarily close to prioritize the safety and well-being of their employees. We’re keeping track of them here, but things change fast, so it’s wise to check your favorite spot’s socials before you head out for a meal or a cup of coffee. The MOST important takeaway is that even a few days of lost business can be a significant hit for a restaurant. The best way to support these places is to show up and eat there as soon as they reopen.

La Loma Tamales is closed until further notice.

Both the Hopkins and Savage locations of Casa Deli are closed until further notice.

El Sazon Tacos & More in Eagan is closed until further notice.

El Burrito Mercado in West St. Paul is closed Monday, January 12, but hopes to reopen on Tuesday, January 13.

Boca Chica, also in West St. Paul, is closed Monday, January 12, and Tuesday, January 13.

Valerie’s Carniceria and Alborada Market are now open after closing for several days.

Grocery Stores Offering Free Food Delivery

A number of grocery stores around the metro are offering free food delivery given that many of their immigrant customers—including those who are citizens or are documented—are afraid to venture out in public due to ICE’s presence throughout the Cities. Their customer bases have also taken a hit, so they’re great businesses to support if you’re able.

All three locations of Colonial Market—in Minneapolis, North Minneapolis, and Bloomington—are offering home delivery. Call 651-508-0256.

Home delivery from Valerie’s Carniceria is suspended for the moment, but you can place an order ahead of time for pick-up. Call 613-823-4400.

Bymore Mercado in St. Paul continues to offer free food delivery.

Restaurant Specials

As of January 9, 10 percent of all sales at Mothership Pizza Paradise will go toward a fund supporting restaurant staff, and the restaurant has created a Venmo account where you can donate directly toward staff who are unable to work right now due to ICE’s presence in their neighborhood.

The Gnome is serving free barbecue, no questions asked, on January 14 from noon to 4 p.m.

There's never been a better time to order a cold brew (no ice) from Workhorse Coffee Bar. A portion of proceeds will be donated to Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.

State officials thus far have backed the demonstrators and their defense of Macklin Good’s intentions

Their latest move — a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security — aims to stop the surge of immigration officers into the state and remove thousands already there.

Prosecutors resign

Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota, including the top prosecutor involved in fraud investigations, have resigned over the Department of Justice’s attempts to investigate the wife of Renee Good. Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week.

Four prosecutors in the DOJ’s civil rights division also reportedly resigned following a decision by the DOJ not to investigate the shooting.

Trump, Vance blame Democrats for ‘chaos’ in Minnesota

In separate social media posts, President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday pointed to Democratic leadership in Minnesota for the unrest.

“This is an extremely important point: you’re only seeing chaotic ICE raids in blue sanctuary cities where local officials are fighting against federal law enforcement,” Vance wrote. “The chaos is created by ‘leaders’ who would rather promote rioting in their streets than follow the law.

Trump took aim at leaders in Minnesota and Illinois, defending federal immigration operations by saying agents — whom he called “patriots of ICE” — only want to remove “convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners,” among others, from the streets.

Official social media accounts for DHS and ICE echoed similar sentiments.

Menin did not share many identifying details about the man, who she said is from Venezuela and has worked for the council for about a year. The Department of Homeland Security, however, identified the man as Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez. DHS claimed that he had overstayed a tourist visa, which expired in 2017, and said he had been arrested for assault, though DHS did not say whether he had been convicted.

“He had no legal right to be in the United States,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Under Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. If you come to our country illegally and break our law, we will find you and we will arrest you.

The City Council disputed those claims. “Contrary to claims by DHS, the City Council employee provided documentation showing he was authorized to remain and work in the country. He fully cleared all background checks. Any suggestion to the contrary is false,” a council spokesperson wrote in a statement, adding that the employee was authorized to work under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, and then was able to extend his work authorization even after President Donald Trump ended TPS for Venezuelans. City & State could not independently verify the employee’s legal status or alleged arrest record.

The Council added that this employee had gone through the standard vetting process. After he was detained, the staffer was granted one phone call, Menin said, which he used to contact the council’s human resources department late Monday afternoon. Menin said there was no indication the man had done anything illegal, and he was permitted to work for the City Council until October, 2026.

“This is an untenable situation. The fact that as the speaker of the City Council, I cannot get any information from ICE and had to call the Department of Homeland Security to get some information is unacceptable,” Menin said. She said she spoke to a deputy field office director from the Department of Homeland Security, who told her that the man was being detained at the federal facility on Varick Street in Manhattan.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani said in a statement he was “outraged” and monitoring the situation. Gov. Kathy Hochul said “detaining people during routine court appearances erodes trust, spreads fear, and violates basic principles of fairness.” The City Council staffers’ union planned a protest to demand the release of their colleague on Tuesday.

Within hours of receiving notice of the man’s detention, Menin convened an emergency press conference with New York Immigration Coalition President Murad Awawdeh, Council Members Alexa Avilés, Harvey Epstein and Shaun Abreu and Rep. Dan Goldman. Goldman has made support for immigrants a central focus of his congressional office in recent months as ICE activity has ramped up in New York City under the Trump administration.

“This is the immigration dragnet that we are living in where secret masked police are killing Americans, are yanking anyone they can find out of cars out of homes out of courtrooms… and now targeting those who are trying to serve the public as employees of the New York City Council,” Goldman said. The arrest comes amid heightened tension between the Trump administration and liberal Democrats after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in her car in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Wednesday.

While Menin said “We are doing everything in our power to secure his immediate release,” Goldman sounded more pessimistic, saying the man was “likely on a path to removal unless it can be stopped.”",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/12/55037515377_7807cd12b3_k/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:57:49.545535

Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade.","US Senator Mark Kelly has sued Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, arguing that the Pentagon illegally tried to demote him in retaliation for criticising the Trump administration.

Kelly, a former Navy captain, drew the ire of Hegseth and President Donald Trump after he filmed a video that told military personnel they could refuse unlawful orders.

Trump accused Kelly of ""sedition"", and Hegseth said he would open proceedings to lower Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a reduction in his pay.

The actions violated Kelly's right to free speech and due process, and did not follow military procedure, his case alleges. The defence department was ""aware of the litigation,"" a spokesperson said.

""As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation,"" the spokesperson said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kelly had a prominent career as an astronaut before being elected to the US Senate for Arizona in 2020.

He also founded a gun safety group along with his wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at an event in 2011 and survived.

He staked out a position as a centrist Democrat focused on defence, and has criticised Trump's use of National Guard troops to patrol US cities.

Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere has sparked major court battles. The Trump administration argues that the forces are necessary to suppress crime, and to protect federal immigration agents as they conduct sweeps in major US cities.

In November, Kelly, along with five other Democrats, filmed a video that told military personnel: ""Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.""

The video irked Trump, who posted ""LOCK THEM UP???"" on Truth Social. The president's account also reshared another user's post, that read, ""HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!""

Trump later clarified to Fox News: ""I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.""

Hegseth then announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as ""seditious in nature"" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The case filed by Kelly argues that Hegseth ""is disciplining Senator Kelly solely for the content and viewpoint of his political speech"".

Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade.

How it works: DPD would be responsible for enforcement, including arresting officers who violate the law, deputy legislative counsel Jon Griffin said.

WASHINGTON – Today, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA) voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration following the government’s restoration of all Title X family planning grants that were the subject of NFPRHA’s litigation. The lawsuit, filed in April 2025 by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of D.C. on behalf of NFPRHA and its members, challenged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) illegal withholding of 22 federal Title X grants, which left approximately 865 family planning service sites unable to provide Title X-funded services to an estimated 842,000 patients across nearly two dozen states.

“The Trump administration illegally withheld vital family planning funds that federal grantees were relying on to provide time-sensitive, critical care to hundreds of thousands of people in need,” said Clare Coleman, president & CEO, National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA). “Our lawsuit succeeded in holding the administration accountable for its unlawful acts, and today, NFPRHA members’ grants have been restored. We are relieved all of our members now have access to their promised funds, but we know the fight for contraceptive access in this country goes on. We will continue to stand up for our members and the essential care they provide to millions of individuals.”

“When the Trump administration withheld critical Title X family planning funding, it blatantly violated federal law and left hundreds of sites unable to provide Title X-funded services,” said Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the Reproductive Freedom Project at the ACLU. “Fortunately, those Title X grants have been restored to NFPRHA’s members. But we know that the Trump administration will continue to attack reproductive freedom, and the ACLU will be ready to use every lever we have to fight those attacks and defend the Title X program.”

“We should never have had to sue to protect essential health care like cancer screenings, STI tests, and birth control,” said Arthur Spitzer, senior counsel at ACLU-D.C. “Restoring funding is a victory, but the larger fight to protect everyone's reproductive freedom continues.""

The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association (NFPRHA), the lead national advocacy organization for the Title X family planning program, and the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration over its unlawful withholding of $65.8 million in Title X federal family planning grants. Title X is the country’s only dedicated federally funded family planning program that provides access to preventive care like birth control, cancer screening, and STI screening and treatment, with priority given to patients with low incomes. As a result of the Trump administration’s unlawful actions, at least seven states — California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, and Utah — have been left without any Title X-funded family planning services, and approximately 842,000 people have lost access to Title X-funded care.

The news comes as Trump administration officials continue to lend credence to a YouTube video, published by internet creator Nick Shirley, alleging with little evidence that Somali migrants in Minnesota are committing fraud through child care centers. State officials have said the centers were operating normally.

The administration has cited the fraud claims as part of the justification for sending thousands of federal officers into the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in an immigration enforcement surge.

Temporary Protected Status was established by Congress in 1990. It does not grant permanent residency in the U.S. but does shield those who have it from deportation and allows them to work and travel.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services grants the status to groups of people who cannot return to their countries safely due to instability, such as an ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or an epidemic.

Recommended

The U.S. has designated Somalis eligible for the status since 1991 because of an ongoing civil war between government forces, militia fighters, African Union troops and others against the paramilitary group al-Shabaab, as well as widespread food insecurity and hunger. Last May, the U.S. State Department flagged Somalia as “Level 4,” its highest advisory level, urging Americans not to travel there.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said in a statement that conditions in the east African country had improved sufficiently and that Somalis no longer qualified for the designation under federal law.

“Temporary means temporary,” Noem wrote, adding that allowing Somali nationals to remain was “contrary to our national interests”.

“We are putting Americans first,” she added.

Donald Trump had first announced his intentions to end protection for Somali nationals in November, writing on Truth Social about Minnesota, which is home to a large Somali community: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”

The Trump administration has used Minnesota’s issues with fraud as a pretext to send a surge of immigration officers into the state. Trump has called Somalis “garbage” and referenced unverified reports, amplified by Republican lawmakers, suggesting the militant group al-Shabaab in Somalia benefited from fraud committed in Minnesota, though these claims still have not been substantiated.

Yesterday, Minneapolis and St Paul filed a lawsuit against the administration, alleging the state was being targeted for its diversity and political differences with the federal government. “[Department of Homeland Security] agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area,” said Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general. Last week, the American citizen Renee Good was fatally shot in the head by a federal immigration agent in south Minneapolis during an enforcement operation, sparking tens of thousands to march in protest across the US.

The decision to withdraw TPS for Somalis in the US, first reported by Fox News Digital, affects 705 Somali nationals currently holding TPS, according to official US Citizenship and Immigration Services data as of August 2025. They have until 17 March before their status expires. Anonymous immigration sources cited higher figures to Fox News of about 2,471 current beneficiaries and another 1,383 applications.

TPS is granted by the Department of Homeland Security to foreign nationals who cannot safely return to their home countries due to armed conflict, natural disasters or other extraordinary circumstances. The protection allows individuals to live and work legally in the US until conditions improve in their homeland.

IMMIGRATION WORRIES HAVE COST GOVERNMENT IN POLLS

The effort to portray a hardline stance on immigration is one of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's moves to win back public support after 18 months in power which have seen his Labour Party fall far behind Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party.

A spokesperson for Starmer said the channel would help reach a wider audience, tackle false narratives online and directly reach migrants considering coming to Britain.

Many European governments are also taking a tougher line on migration.

Polling consistently puts immigration as a top concern for British voters, and Ipsos polling from 2025 showed Reform was ranked as the most trusted party on the issue.

The government said since it took power in July 2024, arrests of illegal workers and raids have reached the highest level in British history, with raids up 77% and arrests up 83%, at businesses such as nail bars, car washes and barbers.

The black economy is frequently cited as one of the pull factors drawing tens of thousands of migrants to enter Britain illegally in small boats from France.

ILLEGAL MIGRATION A KEY BATTLEGROUND

Set against a backdrop of public service cuts and higher taxes that is squeezing many voters, illegal arrivals by boat have become a focal point. More than 40,000 arrived in 2025.

Illegal arrivals accounted for only a small portion of overall net immigration to Britain, which is falling sharply as tighter visa rules take effect.

Tuesday's TikTok video attracted criticism from both sides, such as that the government should do more, or that it was insensitive to the people depicted.

""This government is clearly hooked on the cheap political points it can score by turning the brutality of enforcement raids into click-bait online entertainment,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at charity Freedom from Torture.

The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”

Local officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.

On Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.

“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”

The increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.

The Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.

The administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”

The Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.

The Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/12/multimedia/12dc-border-minnesota-chvk/12dc-border-minnesota-chvk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:12:43.727327

11:30 a.m. — Minneapolis City Council President shoved by ICE agent

A video captured Minneapolis City Council President Elliott Payne being pushed by an ICE agent during an interaction at a bus stop.

Payne explained the incident on Monday, stating he was legally observing as ICE agents stopped a citizen in front of the co-op.

""If this is how they treat the President of the Minneapolis City Council who is legally observing, just think of what they’re doing to everyone else in our City,"" Payne wrote of the encounter.

11:20 a.m. — ‘ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom’

During a press conference on Tuesday, Minnesota community groups are calling for ""ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom"" to take place on Jan. 23, with plans for a large-scale march in Minneapolis and a day of ""no work, no school, no shopping,"" according to a press release.

Organizers say the response follows ongoing ICE enforcement that’s impacting local families and communities, and also resulted in the death of Renee Nicole Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.

11 a.m. - Lawmakers moving to impeach Kristi Noem

Illinois congresswoman Robin Kelly on the House floor said she is planning to impeach Kristi Noem. This comes as U.S. Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minnesota) and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) have also called on her to resign or be impeached in the wake of ICE's operations in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States.

10 a.m. - Student walk-outs

Students at several metro area schools are planning walkouts to protest ICE operations in Minnesota.

Several dozen students walked out of Park Central High School in Brooklyn Park on Tuesday morning as a way to express concern about the impact ICE is having on families and communities.

9 a.m. - Temporary protected status ending for Somalis

FOX News reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration will not extend temporary protected status for Somalis, which is set to expire on March 17. The ending of temporary protected status affects only about 500 to 600 of the approximately 37,000 Somali-born people living in Minnesota.

Temporary protected status was first granted to Somalis in 1991 and was last extended under the Biden administration in September 2024. President Trump announced the termination in November, with Homeland Security still reviewing the decision.

Lawsuit over ICE operations in Minnesota

The backstory:

Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with the mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis, filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the Trump administration in attempt to end the surge of ICE agents. The lawsuit alleges the federal government is targeting Minnesota as a way to punish political opponents in Democratic-led states.

Ellison says the number of ICE agents currently operating in the Twin Cities is estimated to be over 2,000, surpassing the combined number of police officers in Minneapolis and St. Paul.

State and city leaders say the scope of the enforcement activities are having a negative impact on local businesses and schools. Several Twin Cities restaurants have temporarily closed or kept their doors locked due to immigration enforcement raids, citing employee fears and customer safety concerns. Some schools have also canceled classes, while others are providing e-learning options for students.

The other side:

In response, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem calls the lawsuit an ""illegal action"" by corrupt and activist politicians.

The case will make its way through the courts, but there’s no clear timeline on how long it could take a judge to issue a ruling.

President Trump also defended the ICE operations on social media Tuesday, writing in part, ""Fear not great people of Minnesota, the day of reckoning and retribution is coming.""

More ICE agents coming to MN amid protests

Local perspective:

Despite the legal challenge, local leaders say even more federal agents may be headed to Minnesota. Last week, FOX News reported an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents were coming to the state. Then, over the weekend, Sec. Kristi Noem said hundreds more officers were headed to Minnesota to keep federal law enforcement officers safe.

Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez urged residents to remain cautious while running errands and seek community help if needed.

The Whipple Federal Building, which serves as the base for ICE operations, has become a focal point for anti-ICE protests. Over the past 24 hours, the complex has been surrounded by barricades.

A subsidiary of Oneida ESC Group, a corporation owned by the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, cancelled a US $3.8 million contract with ICE for engineering and inspection of federal facilities after the Oneida government became aware of and condemned the contract. The Oneida government also replaced the subsidiary's board of managers.

Oneida Nation of Wisconsin’s Chairman Tahassi Hill, in an email to CBC Indigenous, wrote that every nation should have the power to determine its own vision and values.

""When issues arise that conflict with our laws, policies and core values, we must remain steadfast in acting immediately,"" the statement said.

Last month, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas announced it had cancelled a US $29.9 million contract for planning, research and concept designs for secure structures that its corporation had with ICE, and had fired senior members of the corporation's leadership.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centres. We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war,” said Prairie Band Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick, in a statement on YouTube.

“We must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

Becky Webster, an enrolled citizen of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and former senior staff attorney for the tribe, said tribal corporations operate independently from nations, so they can more nimbly expand into different economic ventures. It also protects the nation from certain legal liabilities.

Corporate boards provide oversight of daily operations rather than the nation, though there is regular reporting.

Webster said she was shocked when she learned her nation held a contract with ICE.

“The nature of the contracts runs counter to who I thought we were as a people and the values that we hold,” she said.

Matthew L. M. Fletcher, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians and a professor of law and American culture at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Mich., said the contracts are examples of affirmative action programs dating back to the 1960s and 1970s that favoured historically disadvantaged, minority-owned businesses.

Tribally owned corporations, Alaska Native corporations (created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971), Native Hawaiian organizations and businesses that are 51 per cent tribally owned are eligible for preferences in contracting under the federal section 8(a) program.

8(a) is a contracting and business development program for small business owners who are socially and economically disadvantaged.

“Congress created what they called set asides to make sure that at least a portion of defence contracting and other federal government contracting went to minority-owned businesses,” Fletcher said.

He said around the 2000s provisions were expanded, removing a cap for Indigenous-owned businesses, eliminating some paperwork still required by other minorities and authorizing no-bid awards to tribally owned or Alaska Native corporations.

While other affirmative action programs have been ended by the current administration, 8(a) was not affected.

“The weird thing is that the Trump people would never go in with Indigenous peoples as a matter of principle given their political stance against what they call DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion],” Fletcher said in an email.

“But the legal position these tribes are in makes this kind of contracting very attractive to them.”

Fletcher said tribes are not publicly traded corporations, so they don't have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and ""generally don't have to share information in terms of public accountability to anybody.""

And for matters of national security, public requests for information can be ignored, he said.

Pass-through entities

Akima, a business portfolio of NANA Regional Corporation, which is owned by 11 Iñupiaq villages in Northwest Alaska, holds multi-million dollar contracts with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, including in relation to detention services at the Guantanamo Bay naval base.

NANA and Akima did not respond to requests for comment by time of publishing.

An April 10, 2025 statement on NANA's website said "" Since 2013, NANA and our affiliated companies have secured federal contracts in support of U.S. government-owned detention facilities. We have robust internal policies and compliance programs in place to ensure operations align with legal and ethical expectations.""

In the statement, board chair Piquk Linda Lee was quoted, “NANA does not deviate from our Iñupiat Iḷitqusiat values in the pursuit of contracts. Our values are fundamental to who we are as people and as professionals. They guide everything we do at NANA – upholding the dignity and wellbeing of every person.

“While we are limited in what we can share publicly about specific customers and contracts, we remain committed to transparency for our shareholders and accountability in all that we do.”

Fletcher said other Alaska Native corporations, the Mississippi Choctaw, Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, Cherokee Nation, Chickasaw and some tribes in Oklahoma also do logistics work for the federal government, Fletcher said.

He said often these tribal corporations operate as pass-through or ""strawman"" entities.

“They will never do any of the work. They just happen to have that legal advantage of being eligible for no-bid contracting with no monetary cap on it,” Fletcher said.

Writer and environmentalist Winona LaDuke from White Earth Reservation in Minnesota said the situation today reminds her of the early '80s.

""They were trying to peddle nuclear waste and like 16 of the 20 recipients of the initial grants were Indian tribes,” she said.

“That was because there was a lot of money involved — no-strings money — and poor people with a lot of pressure on them.”

She said turning Indigenous people into corporations is a colonization process.

""Then you make them dependent upon the destruction of the world that they value,"" she said.

LaDuke said she thinks some of the contracts taken by some Alaska Native corporations are ""morally reprehensible.”

She said tribes like the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation and Oneida Nation of Wisconsin should pay more attention to their business operations in the future because if their citizens had not ""sparked an outrage,"" they might still have the ICE contracts.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/1.7583196,1768246754613/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%2834%2C0%2C1210%2C680%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-13 12:58:47.635219

It’s deep in her roots and where she came from.” President Trump remains far less popular than Hochul in his home state.
He’s tried to kill Manhattan’s congestion pricing toll program, withheld funding for infrastructure projects like the Gateway tunnel and cut off billions of dollars in child care reimbursement funds to blue states.
Yet she’s publicly expressed exasperation with his administration and cheered lawsuits meant to claw back money, including the child care funds.
“If you ask me, ‘Is he going to come after New York state because we’re a progressive state that tries to do all the right things?’” said influential Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger.","The governor will propose protecting student loan borrowers — a reaction to Trump’s effort to overhaul repayment rules. She wants to bolster farmers whose businesses have been disrupted by Trump’s tariffs and plans to propose $30 million in direct payments to agricultural producers.

Hochul is also pushing a muscular proposal to boost free child care statewide, a signature policy for her and New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Some Democrats see her agenda of countering Trump, framed around protecting New Yorker’s bottomline, as a replicable strategy for blue states nationally as the party struggles to adapt to the Republican president’s whipsaw policies.

“We have an obligation to set the pace and the tone for what the rest of the country is doing,” said Brooklyn Assemblymember Brian Cunningham, a Democrat and potential Hochul running mate. “Given New York’s reputation, we’re the Empire State, we’re the natural cultural setter. Just having that kind of bravado in film, Broadway and sports, we apply that to our politics.”

Hochul holds large polling advantages over her Democratic primary rival, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, as well as likely Republican nominee, Trump-endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman. But the stakes for the governor go beyond her own reelection bid. Democrats are counting on her to mount a robust campaign at the top of the ticket this year to support down-ballot candidates running in crucial House races that may determine control of the chamber next year — and the course of Trump’s presidency.

“Unfortunately for New Yorkers, Gov. Hochul wants illegal criminals on the streets, unreliable and unaffordable green energy sources to drive up prices for families and businesses, and hard-earned taxpayer dollars wasted on fraud,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “It’s a shame that governors in blue states refuse to implement President Trump’s commonsense agenda that is making America safer and more affordable.”

The governor’s policies will also set the tone for the next four years in New York City, a financial powerhouse for the country where voters elected Mamdani, an inexperienced democratic socialist who ran a campaign focused on bringing down the cost of living.

At the federal level, the temperamental Trump’s maximalist view of power underscores his desire to control Democratic-led states — withholding cash for child care and infrastructure projects while dramatically reducing health care funding.

As she rolls out her agenda and campaigns for reelection, Hochul is walking a narrow line between two polarizing figures who command zealous support. She must navigate the tricky politics of Trump’s immigration enforcement as Empire State Democrats push to broaden so-called sanctuary protections for undocumented residents. At the same time, the governor is also resisting a push to boost taxes on rich people — a red line that’s angered Mamdani supporters. Hiking taxes would open her up to criticism from the right, and Blakeman has already knocked her for presiding over a high-tax state.

Taken together, Hochul has little room for error when it comes to alienating the untested mayor, an unpredictable president and her own state’s voters — especially among suburbanites, with whom she’s struggled to gain traction.

“If she goes too far to the left on ICE, or anything really, there will be two people cheering her on, Zohran Mamdani and Bruce Blakeman,” said Republican former city Councilmember Joe Borelli. “But for vastly different reasons.”

Hochul, a reserved 67-year-old Democrat, has tried a menu of affordability measures — suspending state gasoline taxes, reducing a controversial Manhattan toll from $15 to $9, and sending rebate checks to taxpayers. Her favorability rating among New Yorkers has risen slightly over the last year and stands at 43 percent. A similar slice of voters, 44 percent, believe the state is heading in the right direction, a Siena University poll found last month.

Few voters appear to link Hochul with some of her more popular policies, like middle-income tax cuts and a push to expand home building in order to drive down stubbornly high housing costs.

“Affordability is certainly at the forefront right now, but that has been what she’s focused on since she first took office,” New York Democratic Chair Jay Jacobs said. “There are budget policies and initiatives that back that up, this isn’t new to her. She didn’t read a poll and decide to do this. It’s deep in her roots and where she came from.”

President Trump remains far less popular than Hochul in his home state. The same voter survey in December found Trump is viewed unfavorably by 62 percent of voters. Since then, Trump has conducted a risky seizure of Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, withheld child care funds to New York citing a Minnesota fraud scandal and offered his full-throated support to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot and killed a 37-year-old woman.

The events of the last several weeks have emboldened New York Democrats to take a more assertive approach with the federal government, even as they pledge to address the cost-of-living problems facing New Yorkers.

The top Democrat in the state Senate, Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, kicked off the legislative session in Albany last week with a call to approve a bill that would prevent local and state law enforcement officials from working with federal immigration agents. Lawmakers are also weighing bills intended to guarantee legal representation for people facing deportation proceedings and prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks while on duty.

Hochul has typically walked a cautious line around immigration, which is seen as a third rail for Democrats. As a local official in western New York, she opposed allowing undocumented immigrants to access driver’s licenses — a position she later reversed. Yet in the wake of Renee Good’s shooting in Minneapolis, the governor is embracing a measure that would enable New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court when they’re accused of violating their constitutional rights.

Hochul also signaled that she’s arm-in-arm with Mamdani on opposing ICE expanding its efforts in New York.

“The mayor and I will stand together and reject any efforts to try and militarize our streets, but they never should have been in Minneapolis in the first place,” Hochul told MSNOW last week. “That’s the catalyst for this.”

Underscoring the multi-dimensional challenge for Hochul is Trump’s predilection for punishing Democratic-led states. He’s tried to kill Manhattan’s congestion pricing toll program, withheld funding for infrastructure projects like the Gateway tunnel and cut off billions of dollars in child care reimbursement funds to blue states.

Hochul has managed up with the often difficult president and frequently speaks with him on the phone. She’s met twice with him in the Oval Office to discuss energy projects and the Manhattan tolls. Yet she’s publicly expressed exasperation with his administration and cheered lawsuits meant to claw back money, including the child care funds.

The governor this month rallied with construction union members to blast the Trump administration’s decision to yank approval for offshore wind projects around the country, including one off the Long Island coast. Hochul struck a populist note with the workers — playing up her own blue collar roots in a historically hardscrabble part of the state.

“My uncles are longshoremen, carpenters, plumbers,” she said. “They help build the economy where I come from, a steel town, a tough, gritty place. That actually prepares you very well for the rough and tumble of politics.”

New York Democrats, though, will likely pressure Hochul to go further against Trump in the courts and in their own legislation — testing the governor’s mettle against a powerful political foe.

Hours after the murder of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, ICE agents unleashed tear gas and violence at a public school two blocks from the shooting, detaining two school staff who were following protocols to protect students.

The raids have incited fear and panic about the condition of loved ones who have been detained and attacked; lives and routines have been disrupted and thrown into turmoil. Educators have been horrified to see their students being “disappeared” from school grounds and see the negative impact of these injustices every day in the classroom.

DHS agents have sown chaos and terror across the metropolitan area and in cities across the state of Minnesota.”

The lawsuit was filed Monday, five days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, sparking nationwide protests. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried the actions of the federal agents.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement. We are not asking ICE not to do ICE things. We are asking this federal government to stop the unconstitutional conduct that is invading our streets each and every day. You’ve seen the videos. At times, there are as many as 50 agents arresting one person. The scale is wildly disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe.”

The state of Illinois has also sued the Trump administration over use of federal forces in the state.

On Monday, residents of the Twin Cities continued to protest the deployment of ICE agents in their neighborhoods. Agents responded by firing tear gas, pepper spray and other chemical agents. In one incident, agents rammed the car of a Latino man in south Minneapolis and then questioned his immigration status. Christian Molina said he was pulled over and only let go after he told agents he was a U.S. citizen.

Christian Molina: “It’s not safe out here. It’s not safe, you know? People aren’t safe. So, just, I mean, I’m glad they didn’t shoot me or something, because, you know, what if they start shooting me? You know what I mean? They have guns.”

In another incident, masked, armed federal immigration agents broke down the door of a home in north Minneapolis on Sunday without a warrant. The agents used a battering ram to get inside the house in an attempt to arrest a Liberian man. Occupants inside the home included the man’s wife and 9-year-old daughter.

Iran says it is prepared for war but ready to negotiate, as the Trump administration considers attacking Iran over Tehran’s crackdown on the recent mass protests. Trump is expected to be briefed today on options including launching strikes inside Iran and offensive cyberattacks. On Monday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries that conduct business with Iran, including China, India, Turkey and Pakistan.

The Norway-based group Iran Human Rights says at least 648 protesters have been killed over the past two weeks. An Iranian official also reported today the number of dead could be as high as 2,000. We will have more on Iran later in the show.

In other news from Gaza, a headstone has finally been placed on the grave of Palestinian poet Refaat Alareer, more than two years after he was killed in an Israeli airstrike on December 6, 2023. His body wasn’t recovered until 10 months ago. Inscribed on the headstone are the closing lines of his most famous poem: “If I must die, / Let it bring hope; / Let it be a tale.”

A bipartisan group of former Treasury secretaries and other top economic officials has blasted the Trump administration for launching a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The probe was set in motion after Powell refused Trump’s demands to lower interest rates. The former officials described the investigation as an “unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine” the independence of the Federal Reserve. Signatories to the letter include former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan. The Wall Street Journal reports Trump’s own Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has privately warned Trump the move to investigate Powell could backfire.

The House Oversight Committee is facing growing criticism for voting to subpoena the prominent investigative journalist Seth Harp after he posted publicly available information about a Delta Force commander who reportedly played a role in the recent U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Harp is the author of the book “The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces.” On Monday, 20 press freedom and First Amendment groups, including the ACLU and Reporters Without Borders, called on the House committee to rescind the subpoena, saying Harp’s reporting is “fully and squarely within the protections of the First Amendment.” This is Chip Gibbons of Defending Rights and Dissent.

Chip Gibbons: “The subpoena against Seth Harp has few parallels in recent memory. We have to remember Seth Harp has done some of the most important investigative reporting on U.S. foreign policy. It’s been critical reporting. The House knows full well the dangers to press freedom that subpoenaing a journalist poses. That’s why in 2024 they actually passed legislation to prevent executive branch subpoenas against journalists about their news gathering.”

The New York Times is reporting the Pentagon may have committed a war crime by using a secret aircraft painted to look like a civilian plane to attack a boat in the Caribbean in September. Eleven people died in the attack. The Trump administration claimed, without offering proof, that the boat was carrying drugs. Under international law, it is a war crime to commit what’s known as “perfidy” — disguising military equipment as civilian.

Russia launched another massive drone and missile attack on Ukraine overnight, launching nearly 300 drones, as well as 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles. The attack targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure, leaving thousands more without heat. Four people were killed in Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, a U.N. monitoring group says about 2,500 Ukrainian civilians were killed last year, making it the deadliest year yet for civilians since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.

In Sudan, the UAE-backed paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a drone strike on a Sudanese army base in the southeastern city of Sinjah on Monday. Twenty-seven people were reportedly killed. The attack came a day after Sudan’s military-led government returned to the country’s capital Khartoum after operating in the eastern city of Port Sudan for nearly three years. The government’s return comes nearly a year after the military recaptured Khartoum from the RSF.

In labor news, nearly 15,000 nurses have launched the largest nursing strike in New York City history. Striking nurses have accused management at six private New York hospitals of refusing to negotiate fair contracts that improve safe staffing, fully fund health benefits and protect them from workplace violence. Striking nurses picketed outside NewYork-Presbyterian and other hospitals on Monday.

Striking NYC Nurse: “I am fighting for my healthcare insurance. I don’t know how I can be here working at a hospital that will not give me health insurance. It is so important for me to have health insurance. It’s so important to take care of the community. I love being a nurse. I want to take care of patients. I want to be at bedside. And it’s so important for us to strike, because we are fighting for patient safety.”

“The time has come to get this done,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. “Sometimes, when things are the worst, you find an opening, and we’ve got to find that opening now.”

Klobuchar said she was recently able to find “common ground” on the issue during a meeting with several “very conservative House members,” as there are strong economic incentives to change immigration law.

“That is the case to make, about how we want to feed the world. We want to have strong businesses, and to do that, we need a smart immigration system that allows for workers. We cannot equate all the time border policy — which must be secure — with the economic needs of our farmers and ranchers.”

To that end, Republican lawmakers speaking on the Jan.11 panel in Anaheim, Calf., said the Trump administration is successfully halting the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S., making a conversation about reform possible.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, border crossings were down 93% during the first year of the Trump administration’s return to office.

The border had long been controlled by “the cartels,” but “today, it’s under control of the United States of America, and so that excuse is gone,” said Sen. GT Thompson, R-Penn.

Thompson said that he recently heard from a farmer who credited the H-2A foreign guest worker program with saving his operation a decade ago — but now, it’s threatening to put him out of business.

“It’s just not working,” he said.

Thompson didn’t delve into specific problems with H-2A, but the Farm Bureau has complained the required wages under the program are unreasonably high and other regulations are too onerous.

Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., said the Trump administration’s stance on immigration enforcement has exacerbated labor shortages, citing the example of employees who were deterred from showing up at a dairy farm due to the presence of federal agents nearby.

“Whether they were legal immigrants or not, they don’t want to come to work because they fear in this environment right now,” she said.

Though border security is a necessity, the U.S. is a “nation of immigrants,” with newcomers who want to contribute to the country economically, Craig said.

“My concern is that this administration, at times, does not act like they actually want immigrant labor here in the United States of America, and we all know that we need them in this sector of the economy and many, many others,” she said.

President is on board

However, Zippy Duvall, the Farm Bureau’s president, said he’s confident that President Donald Trump is on board with increasing the availability of immigrant workers for agriculture.

Duvall said he was “surprised” by Trump’s extensive knowledge about the issue and believes the president recognizes the impact that labor shortages have on the economy.

“I really do think this president, unlike any other president, really, in my lifetime — well, other than maybe Reagan — really wants to fix that problem,” Duvall said. “He realizes how much labor is needed not just for agriculture, but small businesses and the jobs he’s bringing back to America.”

Given the “level of undocumented workers that are out there in agriculture,” Duvall said that “farmers want to do the right thing,” but that they ultimately need a workforce to avoid the type of food shortages seen in the COVID era.

“There’s crops and animals that have to be taken care of, and we got to have the people to help us do that,” he said. “Americans have proved it over and over and over again, by not answering the call and advertisements, that they are not going to do that work regardless of what you’re willing to pay them.”

Duvall said he also broached he subject of the Trump administration’s increased tariffs on foreign imports, which has raised the price of crop inputs while provoking retaliatory trade measures that have lowered crop values domestically.

Farmers are appreciative of the federal government’s recent $12 billion “bridge payment” to farmers suffering from trade disruptions, but that amount “does not go anywhere near fulfilling the need that our farmers have,” he said.

“I made it clear that Farm Bureau policy supports trade, not tariffs,” Duvall said.

While it’s “not very comfortable to sit across the Resolute Desk with the President United States and tell you don’t agree with him,” Duvall said it’s “my job to do that.”

Trump responded with assurances that current trade measures are necessary to “bring people to the table” and fix problems for agriculture, he said. “My comment him was, we pray to God that you’re right.”

In light of low commodity crop prices and high costs for fertilizer, labor and other farm expenses, farmers need a “modernized” safety net that reflects current agricultural economics and technology, Duvall said.

“Truly, this is the most expensive crop we’ve ever put in the ground and it’s been a difficult time,” he said.

The necessity of a new Farm Bill was repeatedly emphasized during the convention, as the previous version was passed in 2018 and has repeatedly been extended since it was originally set to expire in 2023.

Rollins blames Democrats

At the convention, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins lay the blame on “Congressional Democrats” and the Biden administration for focusing too much on “other things like DEI and Green New Deals and climate change hoaxes” instead of nuts-and-bolts agricultural legislation.

“Because of this, you, our farmers were left with heavier debt loads and fewer tools to mitigate those risks,” she said.

Rollins also attributed rising expenses for fuel, fertilizer and labor to “Bidenomics,” which added to the burdens caused by the previous administration’s “crushing” regulations.

However, she assured farmers the Trump administration had already put “serious points on the board” and would make further progress in reducing the agricultural trade deficit and improving conditions for growers.

“We want to give your children every opportunity to thrive in rural America,” Rollins said.

The Trump administration is also fighting against harmful state regulations, such as California’s confinement regulations for egg-laying hens, which is an example of a “rogue” policy that has raised prices for consumers while making life difficult for farmers, she said.

Last year, the federal government challenged the constitutionality of those rules in a lawsuit, which California has asked a judge to dismiss, arguing the state regulation is not pre-empted by federal law. The litigation was suspended during the government shutdown but has since resumed, with a hearing on the matter scheduled for Feb. 23.

“It is one thing if California passes laws that affect only its own state, but it is another when those laws affect other states in violation of our United States Constitution,” Rollins said. “Thankfully, the Trump administration is standing up against this overreach.”

Rollins also vowed to oppose “anti-competitive behavior,” especially by “foreign-controlled corporations” that jeopardize agriculture through price-fixing and other practices affecting “meat processing, seed, fertilizer, and equipment.”

“If we don’t have an affordable and secure food supply, then we do not have national security,” she said.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2026/01/amy-klobuchar-copy.jpg?w=640,N,,2026-01-13 16:58:18.268835

In some states, lawmakers are pushing anti-ICE bills in response to the violence.

The number of “ICE Out” protests had been slowly growing in the run-up to the weekend of Jan. 10-11 but skyrocketed after agents fired into the Honda SUV driven by Good. She was hit in the head and killed. In her honor, the demonstrations were rebranded “ICE Out for Good.”

One group sponsoring the protests, United We Dream, put the death toll from ICE agents and their raids at 32 nationally since the Trump administration unleashed ICE agents nationwide.

ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is conducting mass roundups, many of them violent, of people they profile as Latino, Somali in the case of Minnesota, along with whomever else they wish, according to groups opposing their actions. U.S. citizens have reportedly been among those detained in some cases and are now, with the shooting of Good, on the list of those killed.

In the course of their operations, ICE agents have also targeted bystanders, observers, business owners, and journalists, going beyond those they racially profile. Good, for instance, was white, as was her spouse, who was on the scene but uninjured. The family dog was in the back seat, and the glove compartment was full of stuffed animals they intended for local children.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also complained that when ICE grabs people out of cars, it has left them sometimes still running but in park, in the middle of the street, endangering everyone around. He reported that at least one pet dog left in a car necessitated a call to Animal Control by police to take care of the animal.

ICE’s “Operation Metro Surge” flooded the Twin Cities with 2,000 agents, and Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, said in the wake of protests that she’d send many more. The government has added as many as 1,000 agents since last week and has stepped up the raids since the killing of Good. Besides Minneapolis, big roundups and, concurrently, demonstrations, have taken place in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, New York City, Memphis, and even in small towns and on rural farms.

Speakers at many of the protests labelled Good’s killing “murder,” while Trump administration officials hit back accusing Good of being “a domestic terrorist.”

Two prominent workers’ groups, the National Day Laborers Organizing Network (NDLON) and Workers Circle, were part of the sponsoring coalition for the protests held this weekend. Other sponsors included Democracy Forward, Indivisible, MoveOn, the ACLU, Public Citizen, United We Dream, Voto Latino, and 50501. The number of demonstrations may even be well above the reported 1,000 because even in a small state like Connecticut, there are reported to have been at least 24 demonstrations.

In Minneapolis, Somalia residents have begun attending the demonstrations in force and taking action to defend one another from ICE agents, including one group who surrounded two agents trying to detain someone and chased them away, shouting “Out!” Fear of ICE agents has been particularly high in those communities with the barrage of Trump attacks on them recently. Some told MS-NOW reporters that they felt a particular responsibility to show solidarity with everyone else in their city.

“We honor the memory of Renee Nicole Good,” said NDLON co-Executive Director Pablo Alvaradi. “We stand in solidarity with her family and the people of Minneapolis who are mourning her senseless and tragic death. She was shot by ICE agents who should never have been there – killed by masked gunmen who continually are disturbing the peace in that beautiful, peaceful city with acts of aggression, hostility, and violence.

“As we honor Renee Nicole Good, we call upon others to do the same by recommitting ourselves to peace, nonviolence, and justice. And as we grieve for Renee, we grieve for the countless others this administration has attacked and injured, chased and tormented in custody. And we say to ICE: Get out. Leave our cities. Put away your weapons. Leave us in peace.

“The White House is working to inflame outrage and provoke more violence with lies and false accusations. We must not take their bait.”

The ICE agent killed Good, “a U.S. citizen exercising her fundamental rights,” said Workers Circle CEO Ann Toback. “It is a stark warning to all of us about where unchecked power leads. This administration’s expanding use of force against our neighbors erodes the very rights and safety that define who we are as a nation.”

“As a Jewish organization, we know what unchecked power has done in the past,” said Toback, whose group was founded to help refugees who fled Czarist-sponsored Russian pogroms (massacres) more than a century ago, before the Russian Revolution in 1917. “We must not let that take root here, today.

“Now, more than ever, we must demand transparency, accountability, and policies that protect human life, human dignity, and civil liberties for everyone. Allowing federal forces to act without independent oversight undermines justice and threatens the safety of us all.”

Cameron Kritikos, a Minneapolis grocery worker, told National Public Radio he’s worried ICE will increase its violence. “If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there’s very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I’m nervous that there’s going to be more violence,” he said. “I’m nervous there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day, I think that’s not what anyone wants.”

ICE complained that “noisy people” were demonstrating, chanting, and banging pots and pans outside Twin Cities hotels that housed its agents. It also claimed one agent was hit by a thrown snowball. That prompted Mayor Frey, who had denounced Trump’s characterizations of the murder of Good as “b—s—,” to respond on social media that the city would arrest anyone who causes property damage or endangers others. “Except,” he said, “they aren’t. We are standing up to Donald Trump’s chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,” Frey wrote on social media.

The street protests weren’t the only reaction against ICE. State legislators are drafting measures to ban or evict ICE. Illinois State Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, who is running for an open congressional seat in Illinois, filed legislation that would bar anyone hired by ICE under Trump from obtaining employment in state or local law enforcement.

Chicago, a city Fine hopes to represent, was the site of ICE’s enormous “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has been shut down, though possibly only for the winter. The suffering in Chicago continues, nevertheless. There are reports that people, rather than face harassment and danger, have self-deported, leaving behind friends, neighbors, and family in deep shock about their fate and saddened about the holes left in their own lives now.

“Praying for them is good but not enough,” a pastor of a church attended by one such family said. “We must do everything we can to stop this attack on the people of God,” he said. “The demonstrations must continue to grow across this country.” In one case, a husband and wife with two young children, one of whom was born in the U.S. and therefore a U.S. citizen, left the country and returned to the home country of their parents.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signaled she’ll support legislation to allow residents to bring civil lawsuits against federal immigration officials for constitutional violations. And sources told People’s World that Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, D-Yonkers, is considering legislation to ban local law enforcement officials from cooperating.

New Jersey State Sen. Britney Timberlake, D-East Orange, wants to write state restrictions on cooperation with ICE into law. Gubernatorial orders “now limit state and local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, bar the government and hospitals from collecting immigration information and set up guidelines on how health care facilities, schools and other institutions should respond to federal immigration authorities,” Politico reports.

“Anyone who is a descendant of a Holocaust survivor will tell you this is how it starts,” Timberlake said in a committee hearing the day after ICE killed Good. “If you don’t believe me, just ask the children of Good.” A Trump regime Homeland Security spokeswoman objected. Timberlake shot back, “If you want to stop comparisons to the Gestapo and Nazi Germany, stop behaving that way.”

It’s not only in blue states that legislators are taking action. Tennessee State Rep. Gabby Salinas, D-Memphis, filed legislation to ban ICE enforcement on school and church property. Memphis is the scene of another big ICE operation, which the red state’s governor and legislature welcome—and it impacts a city with a majority of people of color. Salinas, however, admits it may not get far in the heavily Republican and heavily gerrymandered state legislature.

The Department of Homeland Security is claiming that its attacks on the streets of Minneapolis are its “biggest ever immigration enforcement operation” and brushes off the murder of Good as an “act of self-defense” by a driver who “weaponized her vehicle to attack officers.” With multiple videos possibly disputing that narrative, the Trump administration has declared that only the FBI control is allowed to investigate, with all local authorities frozen out of the probe.

People on the streets in Minneapolis see things as being vastly different from what the Trump administration is claiming. Protester Connor Maloney told AP that he was demonstrating to support his community because he is angry about what ICE is doing. “Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that this is happening all around us.”

The protesters in Minneapolis are contending with subfreezing temperatures, accumulated snow and ice, and some were seen some carrying signs saying “De-ICE Minnesota” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

The huge protests in Minnesota did not stop ICE from continuing its harassment of people in the city, however. An AP photographer witnessed, a few miles from where protests were going on, a group of heavily armed ICE agents approach a person they said was following them. Two agents pulled out long guns and pointed them at him and ordered him to stop following them. They said, “This is your first and final warning.” They drove off after that.

At another location in the area, the AP reported that agents pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away, as they detained someone coming out of a home improvement store.

Elected officials are also not left off the list of people mistreated by ICE. Three House members from the state of Minnesota made an attempt to tour the ICE headquarters in the state’s federal building. Ten minutes after entering, they were forced to leave, they told viewers on MS-NOW Sunday.

Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kell Morrison, and Angie Craig were the three denied their right to inspect the facility. They were told there is a “new policy” requiring lawmakers to give seven-day notice if they wish to inspect an immigration facility. That “policy” is a violation of the law that allows members of Congress to conduct their oversight responsibility at any time.

In a Cabinet meeting in December, Mr. Trump referred to people from Somalia as ""garbage,"" claiming they ""contribute nothing.""
Mr. Trump and his aides have focused particularly on Minnesota, home to the largest community of Somali immigrants and Somali-Americans.
The second Trump administration has sought to end most TPS programs, which were dramatically expanded under former President Joe Biden.
But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature.","The U.S. government is revoking the legal status of several thousand immigrants from Somalia, raising the specter of deportation for a community often assailed by President Trump.

A Department of Homeland Security official said the Trump administration had decided to terminate Somalia's Temporary Protected Status program, which allows beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation.

Nationals of Somalia enrolled in the TPS program are now set to lose their legal status and work permits on March 17. The DHS official said roughly 2,500 Somali immigrants with TPS are expected to be affected by the termination.

The Trump administration has urged TPS holders whose status will lapse to self-deport, warning that they will be found, arrested and deported if they fail to do so.

""Temporary means temporary. Country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law's requirement for Temporary Protected Status,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. ""Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.""

The move had been previewed last year by Mr. Trump, who has focused intensely on members of the Somali community, often describing them in derogatory terms. In a Cabinet meeting in December, Mr. Trump referred to people from Somalia as ""garbage,"" claiming they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

Mr. Trump and his aides have focused particularly on Minnesota, home to the largest community of Somali immigrants and Somali-Americans. Citing a massive fraud scandal in the state implicating members of the Somali community, the administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis area.

The federal deployment has sparked clashes and protests, especially after the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

TPS dates back to 1990, when Congress created the policy to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from countries facing an armed conflict, environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.

The second Trump administration has sought to end most TPS programs, which were dramatically expanded under former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump's administration has moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.

Pro-immigrant advocates have strongly denounced the administration's actions, saying they punish people from crisis-stricken countries who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and, in some cases, decades.

But Trump administration officials have said the Democratic administration extended TPS policies too often, despite the policy's temporary nature. It has also argued conditions in some of the affected countries have improved or that it's not in the national interest to renew protections for their nationals, criticizing TPS as a magnet for illegal immigration.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/13/a1c570e0-658e-48c0-9d4b-02116d491e1a/thumbnail/1200x630g2/019d0d6383ff5feffedddb1d32f6f7fd/gettyimages-2254503618.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:59:27.784141

She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.
In downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration’s mass deportations.
Protesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.
Atwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City jail to provide more details about Friday’s incident.","A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.

Jeri Rees said her 21-year-old nephew underwent six hours of surgery and that doctors found shards of plastic, glass and metal embedded in his eyes and around his face, including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from a carotid artery.

“That could have cost him his life,” Rees said.

“But now, for the next six weeks, he can’t sneeze or cough because it could do a lot of damage.”

She said doctors did not want to remove the shrapnel near the artery out of fear that it could kill him. She said her nephew, who is transitioning and goes by the pronoun he, also suffered a fractured skull around his eyes and nose and that doctors said he had permanently lost the vision in his left eye. She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.

Several videos of Friday’s incident were shared on social media. One video shows demonstrators, who were protesting the fatal shooting in Minnesota of Renee Good, throwing orange safety cones at the agents, who were standing guard outside the Santa Ana federal building.

The video cuts to three agents approaching the group before one agent tries to take a young person into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. The person taken into custody was identified by friends as Skye Jones.

In the video, at least one agent appears to fire nonlethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg before aiming and striking a protester in the face.

The video shows that person dropping to the ground after being shot, holding their face as the crowd retreats. The same agent then drags the protester by the hood of their jacket; they appear to be choking, grasping at the jacket binding their neck as blood pours from their left eye.

Another video shows the protester inside the building, lying on the ground bleeding while agents fire what appear to be pepper balls at the back of the head and neck of a man trying to record the incident with his cellphone.

Rees said her nephew told her that the agents pressed his face against the pool of blood and did not immediately call paramedics.

“The other officers were mocking him, saying, ‘You’re going to lose your eye,’” she said, recalling what her nephew told her.

Friday’s violent clash occurred just two days after a federal immigration agent fatally shot Good, a Minnesota mother of three. The slaying sparked public outcry, nationwide protests and scrutiny of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who said the agent was acting in self-defense.

Friday’s incident is the latest in a number of confrontations around the country in which agents have used deadly or what experts say is excessive force.

“This constitutes as deadly force as far as the law is concerned,” said Ed Obayashi of the video. The Modoc County sheriff’s deputy and legal advisor to police agencies, who has testified in similar cases, said that “all the training manuals and [legal] cases say you don’t aim at the face because these projectiles can cause serious injury [or] death.”

Obayashi said, based on law enforcement use-of-force standards, an officer can deploy deadly force if they feel their life is in imminent danger, or that they are in danger of great bodily harm.

“I just don’t see that here,” he said.

In downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration’s mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality as well. Protesters marched around the downtown area, chanting “ICE out of O.C.” and holding signs that read “No more raids, keep families together.”

An earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, said member Connor Atwood. Some members reconvened just before 6:30 p.m. for a demonstration outside the federal building put together by another organization, he said.

Atwood, who was present during the incident, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled. A group of protesters are seen in a video standing near a staircase away from the building’s entrance.

Homeland Security agents stepped out of the building various times throughout the night, firing nonlethal rounds toward protesters, Atwood said.

Protesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.

A portion of the crowd eventually dispersed, but leaders of Dare to Struggle encouraged some protesters to stand their ground to “say we’re not going to be intimidated away from expressing what we feel right now and delivering our message,” Atwood said.

Some protesters then began burning an American flag. At some point after 8:30 p.m., Jones, a leader of Dare to Struggle’s Orange County chapter, was arrested, Atwood said. The other protester was then hit in the eye.

“It wasn’t just completely out of nowhere, but it was very sudden,” Atwood said, adding that agents “had come out of the building several times before that, but they had not tried to arrest anyone or grab anyone.”

In an email response to The Times, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said a “mob of 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers outside of the federal building.”

“Two officers were injured. Two violent rioters were arrested and were charged with assault on federal officers and disorderly conduct,” she wrote. “This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields.”

McLaughlin did not respond to questions about protocols agents must follow when using less-lethal devices.

A spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only violence they were aware of that night were demonstrators tossing orange cones at the agents.

Atwood said he didn’t witness bottles or rocks being thrown toward agents. Some firecrackers were set off near the sidewalk but away from the building entrance, he said.

Both Homeland Security agents and Santa Ana police were seen standing outside the federal building just after 10:30 p.m., according to video footage reviewed by The Times. Fire paramedics can be seen taking Rees’ nephew in a gurney.

Atwood said Jones had an initial hearing Monday. Rees said Jones had been released and was at the hospital with her nephew as of Monday night.

Atwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City jail to provide more details about Friday’s incident.

Raskin is seeking information about any hiring of people pardoned by Mr. Trump by Jan. 26.","Nearly one year after the mass pardon of more than 1,500 Trump-supporting Capitol riot defendants, members of a House committee are investigating whether any of the pardoned rioters are now working for President Trump's administration in the fast-growing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

In a three-page letter sent Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi and obtained by CBS News, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee has requested all ""records, documents, memos, and internal communications regarding the solicitation and hiring of anyone charged or investigated for actions in connection to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.""

The committee's Democrats also said it remains unclear how many January 6 defendants ""have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security agents and officers.""

It's also not clear if ICE has hired any Jan. 6 defendants. But the agency is engaging in a rapid hiring spree, funded by a $75 billion funding boost passed by Congress last year that could allow ICE to add thousands of agents.

And the Democrats' letter noted that other pardoned riot defendants or members of the crowd on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 have already joined the administration.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and the judiciary panel's ranking member, said it is possible riot defendants would go unrecognized while serving as immigration agents.

""Unique among all law enforcement agencies and all branches of the armed services, ICE agents conceal their identities, wearing masks and removing names from their uniforms,"" wrote Raskin, who previously served on the House's Jan. 6 select committee.

Raskin's inquiry said, ""Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6th and were convicted of their offenses?""

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News.

Mr. Trump's pardons of more than 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters have triggered an outcry among victims of the Capitol insurrection and Democratic members of Congress, who argue Mr. Trump has incentivized violence in his name by giving clemency to supporters who committed violence.

Mr. Trump has defended the pardons, claiming many of the defendants were ""absolutely innocent,"" were guilty of ""minor"" infractions or were given unfairly harsh sentences.

In testimony at a congressional hearing last week, Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who also served on the House's Jan. 6 committee, said the mass clemency has emboldened the rioters.

""The greatest threat to democracy comes from those in positions of power who are willing to subvert the rule of law. That is exactly what this Administration is trying to engineer,"" he said.

The inquiry into ICE hiring comes amid a roiling controversy over the deployment of federal agents into U.S. communities and confrontations between agents and protesters.

Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who helped repel the rioting mob at the Capitol, told CBS News: ""Given the pardons and appointments of people into this administration, lawlessness is not frowned upon but rewarded.""

At least one Capitol riot defendant has secured a high-ranking post in the Justice Department: Jared Wise, who is serving as an agency adviser.

Raskin's letter to the Justice Department alleged that Wise now has contributed to the administration's efforts ""to fire, demote, and harass the dedicated career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support personnel who did their professional and civic duty holding to account the persons who committed crimes on January 6th.""

Wise, a former FBI employee, was pardoned on charges of civil disorder and assaulting or resisting law enforcement. The Justice Department alleged in 2023 that Wise told D.C. police officers, ""You guys are disgusting. I'm former—I'm former law enforcement. You're disgusting. You are the Nazi. You are the Gestapo. You can't see it.""

Wise's trial was underway when Mr. Trump issued the January 20, 2025 pardons. His case was dismissed hours later.

'Domestic terrorism' The Trump administration has framed groups that monitor and track ICE as improperly keeping the agency from completing immigration removals.
Not everyone is comfortable filming ICE agents or pleading with people being arrested to provide contact information for their families.","At 5 a.m. most days, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement watch group fires up its Signal chat for another day of tracking arrests and raids in south Minneapolis.

A homemade checkpoint made of blue recycling bins is already in place near Powderhorn Park. Residents check license plates and flag vehicles they don't recognize or think might carry ICE agents. Those vehicles are the ones that usually blow right past the volunteers waving at them to slow down, said Andrew Fahlstrom, 44, one of the organizers.

At school drop-offs, parents and neighbors arm themselves with whistles, ready to blow if they see immigration authorities. Later, they'll drop groceries off for neighbors who are afraid to leave their homes and take others to doctor's appointments.

This is the neighborhood where Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot and killed by an ICE agent Jan. 7.

It has been the target of some of the heaviest immigration enforcement actions in the past six weeks and, like many of Minneapolis' communities, is home to a coalition of people who decided they needed to stand up for their neighbors when ICE arrived.

Good, like others in her community, stopped at the scene of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement action near her Minneapolis home. Videos suggest she was pulling away from the scene as she was shot, though Vice President JD Vance and Department of Homeland Security officials accused her of using her vehicle as a weapon, leading the agent to fire in self-defense. Vance reposted a video taken by the agent to further the administration's position.

Her death sparked protests and vigils in large and small cities across the country that drew tens of thousands of Americans and reignited arguments over tactics used by community groups to monitor ICE's enforcement actions.

In recent days, Trump administration officials have called Good and others who track ICE and warn neighbors ""domestic terrorists.""

They call themselves neighbors, and they aren't backing down, Fahlstrom said.

""I don't see anyone deterred. What I see is more people clear-eyed,"" Fahlstrom told USA TODAY. ""The murder of Renee Good made it clear to everyone in the city just how dangerous and unhinged this group of armed agents actually is.""

He lives six blocks from where Good was killed. He was manning the checkpoint when he heard the sirens and the Signal chat lit up.

For weeks now, people have walked up and down Lake Street before work and on lunch breaks, educating neighbors at grocery stores and bus stops about what their rights are if ICE stops them, Fahlstrom said. The morning after Good's death, he watched four arrests and spotted 12 ICE vehicles in two hours on Lake Street alone, he added.

When suspected ICE vehicles arrive, a cacophony of car horns and whistle shrieks follows them wherever they go, and a mad-dash text chain sends word of their location. A crowd quickly gathers, filming and at times jeering at the agents.

When ICE makes an arrest, neighbors call out asking for the arrestee's name and a number they should call. They comb through the cars left behind for identifying information that helps them contact the family of the person taken.

ICE Watch trains neighbors to monitor and record

Since the first year of Trump's first term, immigration advocates have braced for a time when communities would need an alert and support system. They have embraced nonviolent ""cop watch"" tactics popularized during the Civil Rights Movement that include monitoring and recording police activity, generating multiple accounts of events, to supplement the official one, said Jill Garvey, codirector of States at the Core, which holds virtual “ICE Watch and Community Defense” training programs.

A year ago, before enforcement tactics ramped up, local organizers asked for some kind of training on what to do when the moment came, and ICE Watch began, she said.

The States at the Core training focuses on monitoring ICE activity and helping the arrested person by getting their name and contact information. The training also provides information about the rights an observer has and what can get them into trouble, such as interfering with an arrest and touching officers, and how to deescalate a confrontation.

It is legal to monitor or film federal agents in the course of their duty.

Garvey said more than 10,000 Americans spanning big cities to rural communities have taken the ICE Watch training since Trump was inaugurated last year, but how they implement it looks different in each community.

And communities have learned from one another. When ICE arrived in force last year in other Democrat-controlled cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, whistles quickly became the soundtrack of ICE arrest videos. Then honking while following agents' vehicles became popular.

More than 1,000 Minneapolis residents signed up for Community Defense and ICE Watch training the day after Good died, according to States at the Core.

'Domestic terrorism'

The Trump administration has framed groups that monitor and track ICE as improperly keeping the agency from completing immigration removals.

Good’s spouse was part of the Powderhorn/Phillips neighborhood chat, Fahlstrom disclosed, adding that he didn't know how involved the two were.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in several interviews Jan. 11, accused Good of ""domestic terrorism.""

On Jan. 12, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Good was a ""lunatic who was a part of an organized group to interject into and impede law enforcement operations.""

Days earlier, Leavitt said President Donald Trump stands behind ICE, and the ""deadly incident … occurred as a result of a larger, sinister left-wing movement that has spread across our country where our brave men and women of federal law enforcement are under organized attack.""

Texas Republican Rep. Roger Williams told the conservative station NewsMax that clashes would continue as long as protesters keep challenging immigration officials.

""We need to see some improvement in the fact that people need to quit demonstrating, quit yelling at law enforcement, challenging law enforcement, and begin to get civil,"" he said. ""And until we do that, I guess we’re going to have it this way, and the people that are staying in their homes are doing the right thing, need to be protected.""

But University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said the heavy-handed tactics being used, including plans to send hundreds more ICE agents into Minneapolis, are eroding the support the president had from people who wanted increased immigration enforcement and tighter borders.

""It kind of seems to confirm what the protesters are saying to the point where you have Middle America Minnesota saying, 'Wait, this is not right,'"" he said.

'I see my neighbors coming together in ways they have never done before'

Fahlstrom said there are as many neighbors delivering meals, helping with shopping and getting kids to school as there are recording ICE.

He works with Defend the 612, which helps connect people in the Minneapolis area code with the hundreds of small neighborhood groups involved in rapid response, school protection patrols and community aid planning.

""I see my neighbors coming together in ways that they have never done before,"" Fahlstrom said. ""I can't tell you how many people have responded to these raids after the moment and took on work that they never would have imagined themselves doing; like figuring out where kids should go, going through someone's car after they've been abducted … and trying to find the next point of contact and closest relatives.""

What involvement looks like differs by person, he said. Not everyone is comfortable filming ICE agents or pleading with people being arrested to provide contact information for their families.

Flannery Clark, 42, a parent in Powderhorn, said there are parents and community members outside pretty much every school in the Twin Cities at drop-off and pickup to watch for ICE and contact the administration inside.

They even stand guard at schools their children don't attend. Clark, who has an elementary schooler, said she was pepper-sprayed at Roosevelt High School when ICE arrived hours after Good's death.

Parents and community members coordinate rides to school, dropping off groceries and raising rent money for people too afraid to go to work, she said.

""It's amazing that thousands of ordinary people are doing this organizing. There's not some magic outside group doing it. It's just Minnesotans saying: 'These are our neighbors. We're going to take care of them,'"" she said.

Good's death hasn't changed her willingness to be involved.

""We all are extremely aware of the risks, but this is one of those moments where I really believe you have to do what's right and go into that knowing what the risk is.""

On the streets

Venus de Mars and her wife, Lynette Reini-Grandell, are ICE observers who live on the same Minneapolis block where Good died. They recorded the aftermath.

The couple frequently walk around the surrounding areas with their phones and 3D-printed pink whistles. Their neighborhood's group chat on Signal, which has buzzed constantly since ICE arrived six weeks ago, is busier than ever.

The couple said they are more anxious than scared, respectfully acknowledging that ""our immigrant neighbors are terrified,"" de Mars said.

""We might feel a bit more protected because we’re White,"" Reini-Grandell said.

""That’s not even guaranteed,"" de Mars countered, shaking her head no. ""Especially after they killed her.""

The Trump administration has described the legal action as ""baseless"".
The administration has said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and that further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.
""The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,"" Ellison said.
He accused the Trump administration of ""persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views"".","The US state of Minnesota has sued the Trump administration in an attempt to block a surge of federal immigration agents into the state.

The lawsuit argues the deployment amounts to an unconstitutional ""federal invasion"". Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said immigration operations had upended life for millions and caused ""chaos and violence"".

It comes after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.

The lawsuit asks a federal court to declare the deployment illegal. The Trump administration has described the legal action as ""baseless"". It has also pledged to significantly increase its deployment in the area.

The administration has said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and that further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.

In a news conference announcing the legal challenge on Monday, Ellison said the deployment violated the state's ""sovereign authority to protect the health and wellbeing of every single person who lives within our borders"".

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey alleged that agents were illegally targeting people who they assumed to be immigrants based on racial profiling. He said their actions had led to an increase in calls to 911, and forced city police to work overtime to investigate incidents involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,"" Ellison said.

He accused the Trump administration of ""persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views"". Democrats currently hold the governorship and control the state legislature.

""Keith Ellison made it abundantly clear today he is prioritising politics over public safety,"" Tricia McLaughlin from the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

""This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.""

During the news conference, prosecutors said they would attempt to get a court to issue a temporary restraining order to block the deployment as early as Tuesday.

It comes as the US Department of Homeland Security says it plans to send more agents into the state as part of its Operation Metro Surge.

The department says the deployment is necessary to combat illegal immigration and crime. According to recent estimates, around 2,000 agents have been deployed to Minnesota.

Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that ""hundreds more"" immigration agents would be sent to the area ""in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely"".

CNN reported that as many as about 1,000 agents from US Customs and Border Protection agents were being deployed to Minneapolis, citing two federal law enforcement sources.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3b89/live/f8f57460-efff-11f0-85ce-21b695a729bd.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 09:57:23.566534

“Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN’s Laura Coates last night.
Federal officials, including Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly accused Good of trying to use her vehicle to kill or harm ICE agents.
Protesters continued to take to the streets Sunday, demanding federal immigration officers be removed from their communities following the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good.","President Donald Trump just defended ICE agents on the ground in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” whose only motivation is to remove criminal undocumented immigrants from the community.

In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump attacked familiar political rivals and said Minnesota Democrats “love the unrest that anarchists and professional agitators are causing because it gets the spotlight off of the 19 Billion Dollars that was stolen by really bad and deranged people,” referring to fraud allegations in the state. He also said a “reckoning” was coming, as around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week’s shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead.

Remember: Minnesota and Illinois are suing the Trump administration over the immigration tactics used their states, which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said have “terrorized our communities” and violated the Constitution.

“Every place we go, crime comes down. In Chicago, despite a weak and incompetent Governor and Mayor fighting us all the way, a big improvement was made. Thousands of Criminals were removed!” Trump said.

Trump did not mention in his post Renee Good, the US citizen and mother of three who was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. On Air Force One Sunday, Trump called Good a “very violent” and “radical” person.

The Department of Homeland Security said today it is ending a form of humanitarian relief for Somali nationals living in the United States.

The Trump administration has stripped deportation protections from multiple nationalities in the US that were allowed to temporarily live in the country, arguing that conditions at home no longer justified those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, has prompted legal challenges nationwide and has been blocked by federal judges in some instances.

Tuesday’s announcement comes as protections for Somalis were set to expire on March 17. During the Biden administration, then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas extended the program for the community. The department is required to decide whether to extend or terminate TPS at least 60 days prior to the designation’s expiration.

In November, President Donald Trump indicated that he intended to terminate protections for Somali immigrants residing in the US, claiming, “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER!”

Somalis, particularly in Minnesota, have faced harassment and threats amid a welfare-fraud scandal that ensnared the community. Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority – 87% – are naturalized US citizens.

TPS applies to people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict or natural disasters, therefore so the protections are limited to people already in the United States.

Past Republican and Democratic administrations have designated the protections, though some Republicans have argued the relief shouldn’t have been extended multiple times.

Although Minnesota’s new lawsuit asking a judge to declare the latest surge of immigration enforcement in the state “unconstitutional and unlawful,” Attorney General Keith Ellison says the purpose is not to kick agents out entirely.

“We’re not saying that ICE cannot have a presence in Minnesota,” Ellison told CNN’s Sara Sidner on Tuesday morning. “We’re saying the dramatic escalation, which is unwarranted and politically motivated, is harming our state and our cities.”

The morning after the lawsuit was filed, President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

“Well, if he’s threatening retribution, I believe that he means that,” Ellison told CNN. “He’s known for vengeance.”

The lawsuit by Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul that argues the Trump administration’s widespread immigration enforcement operation is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities” is not meant to stop federal agents from working within their legal limits, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her told CNN on Tuesday.

“This is to hold them accountable. They are terrorizing our neighborhoods and our communities, and (for) that they have to be held accountable,” Her told Kate Bolduan, adding the plaintiffs believe the Trump administration is neither complying with the Constitution and federal policies nor respecting states’ rights.

This “will be the precedent-setting case,” the Democratic mayor said when asked how this suit might align with prior legal claims.

“This is unprecedented time. There wouldn’t be any kind of case that exists already because this is the first this is happening,” Her said. “Never in any other administration has any president had this type of overreach into local jurisdictions.”

While they may contain strong claims, the lawsuits filed by Illinois and Minnesota are “really political diatribes masquerading as lawsuits,” CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said.

“If you look at what both states are asking the courts to do, it’s to kick ICE out of those states and cities and to bar ICE from carrying on federal law enforcement in Illinois and Minnesota,” he told Kate Bolduan on CNN News Central Tuesday morning.

But “there is zero precedent for that,” Honig said. “There is no way a judge can say, ‘You, federal law enforcement agency: You are not allowed to execute federal law in a certain state or city.’”

The most that Illinois and Minnesota could get out of their efforts – if they get sympathetic judges – “is a judge who’s going to ask questions of ICE, who’s going to hold hearings, who’s going to demand questions about how they’re training, how they’re carrying out their policy,” Honig said.

“But I don’t give them much of a chance of achieving the legal thing that they’re asking for in the courts.”

In its new lawsuit seeking an order to effectively shut down enhanced Customs and Border Protection activity in Illinois, the state is asking for the case to be heard by a familiar face.

The plaintiffs say the new case should be heard by Illinois federal judge Sara Ellis – an Obama appointee – who was previously assigned to a case challenging immigration agents’ response to protesters and journalists in the Chicago area last year.

In that case, Ellis ordered agents to avoid using pepper balls and tear gas unless directly engaged by protesters and only after giving a clear verbal warning.

Ellis expressed frustration with Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino – the leader of Operation Midway Blitz – in her order, saying he “admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.”

That case is still technically pending, but the plaintiffs have asked for it to be dismissed because Operation Midway Blitz ended in November.

Cases are typically assigned to judges within a federal district at random, but Illinois argues their new lawsuit is “related” to the previous suit on protesters, giving Ellis authority to take it. Ellis has not yet decided whether the case should be moved to her court.

Around 1,000 more US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis in the wake of last week’s shooting involving an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that left a mother of three dead, according to two federal law enforcement sources.

The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, one of the sources said, coming on top of the deployment of about 2,000 federal agents to the area that CNN reported early last week.

CBP Commander Gregory Bovino has already been on the ground with hundreds of agents and has been conducting targeted operations, including door knocks, one of the sources said. Documents provided to those who receive door knocks are either administrative warrants – signed by an immigration officer but without the same legal weight as a judicial warrant – or copies of their final orders of removal.

Minnesota’s lawsuit against the Trump administration, asking a federal judge to end Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities, is not intended to cripple the ability of ICE to carry out its duties, Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday.

“Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN’s Laura Coates last night. “They’re doing far more than that … by harassing people, by using excessive force on a routine basis.”

Administration officials initially cited investigations of fraud connected to billions of dollars of federal funds centered on the area’s Somali community in announcing the surge, but Ellison argues the issues aren’t connected.

“What we need is accountants, you know. We don’t need armed paramiltaries harassing students at Roosevelt High School,” he said. “We don’t need them going to grocery stores, Target stores, and throwing people to the ground.”

Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was killed when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot into her vehicle during an encounter last week.

Good crossed paths with a 10-year ICE officer and Iraq War veteran named Jonathan Ross, who was dragged about 100 yards six months prior by a driver during an immigration operation in a Minneapolis suburb.

Good and Ross — whose brief confrontation ended with him firing his weapon at least three times as she attempted to drive away — are now at the center of furious debate over President Donald Trump’s administration’s building immigration crackdown, each side angrily assigning blame to the other.

Videos of the incident are still emerging, and there’s more to be learned.

Federal officials, including Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, quickly accused Good of trying to use her vehicle to kill or harm ICE agents. She called it an “act of domestic terrorism.”

But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and state officials pushed back, blasting the actions of the officers. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting “totally predictable” and “totally avoidable.”

The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities are suing the Trump administration, arguing the widespread federal immigration operation in the state is “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities,” according to a lawsuit filed yesterday.

The suit is seeking a court order halting the operations, arguing the federal government is unlawfully commandeering state resources and violating Minnesota law and city ordinances.

The lawsuit also claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but rather a retaliation effort against Democratic-led Minnesota, citing the president’s disparaging comments toward local officials.

It is the latest development in the monthslong spat between Minnesota officials and the federal government after President Donald Trump first ramped up immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area in December.

More on the immigration operation: The federal government initially launched Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown in the Twin Cities, to target undocumented Somali immigrants but it has also led to the arrests of immigrants from other nations.

“DHS law enforcement have made over 2,000 arrests since Operation Metro Surge began,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.

Nationwide outcry over the killing of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week spilled into the streets of cities across the US over the weekend, with protesters demanding the removal of federal immigration authorities from their communities and justice for the slain Renee Good.

In Minneapolis, snow flurries drifted down as thousands of people gathered in parks, along residential streets and outside federal buildings, chanting Good’s name, whose death has become a focal point of national outrage over federal authorities’ tactics in US cities while carrying out President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Similar protests unfolded across the US — from Los Angeles and New York to Washington, DC, El Paso and Boston. More than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the country this weekend by the “ICE out for good” national coalition of advocacy groups.

“The response to ICE’s horrific killing of Renee Nicole Good is loud, peaceful, and inescapable,” coalition member group Indivisible said in a Saturday Facebook post accompanied by images of protests in multiple cities.

Protesters continued to take to the streets Sunday, demanding federal immigration officers be removed from their communities following the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

The event promised on-the-spot hiring for would-be deportation officers: Walk in unemployed, walk out with a sweet $50k signing bonus, a retirement account, and a license to brutalize the country’s most vulnerable residents without consequence—all while wrapped in the warm glow of patriotism.

At first glance, my résumé has enough to tantalize a recruiter for America’s Gestapo-in-waiting: I enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and deployed to Afghanistan twice with the 82nd Airborne Division. After I got out, I spent a few years doing civilian analyst work. With a carefully arranged, skills-based résumé—one which omitted my current occupation—I figured I could maybe get through an initial interview.

The catch, however, is that there’s only one “Laura Jedeed” with an internet presence, and it takes about five seconds of Googling to figure out how I feel about ICE, the Trump administration, and the country’s general right-wing project. My social media pops up immediately, usually with a preview of my latest posts condemning Trump’s unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab. Scroll down and you’ll find articles with titles like “What I Saw in LA Wasn’t an Insurrection; It Was a Police Riot” and “Inside Mike Johnson’s Ties to a Far-Right Movement to Gut the Constitution.” Keep going for long enough and you might even find my dossier on AntifaWatch, a right-wing website that lists alleged members of the supposed domestic terror organization. I am, to put it mildly, a less-than-ideal recruit.

In short, I figured—at least back then—that my military background would be enough to get me in the door for a good look around ICE’s application process, and then even the most cursory background check would get me shown that same door with great haste.

The ICE Expo in Dallas, where my application journey began, required attendees to register for a specific time slot, presumably to prevent throngs of eager patriots from flooding the event and overwhelming the recruiters. But when I showed up at 9 a.m., the flood was notably absent: there was no line to check in and no line to go through security. I walked down nearly empty hallways, past a nearly empty drug testing station, and into the event proper, where a man directed me to a line to wait in for an interview. I took my spot at the end; there were only six people ahead of me.

While I waited, I looked around the ESports Stadium Arlington—an enormous blacked-out event space optimized for video game tournaments that has a capacity of 2,500. During my visit, there couldn’t have been more than 150 people there.

Hopeful hires stood in tiny groups or found seats in the endless rows of cheap folding chairs that faced a stage ripped straight from Tron. Everything was bright-blue and lit-up and sci-fi-future angular. Above the monolithic platform hung three large monitors. The side monitors displayed static propaganda posters that urged the viewer to DEFEND THE HOMELAND and JOIN ICE TODAY, while the large central monitor played two short videos on loop: about 10 minutes of propaganda footage, again and again and again.

After about 15 minutes of waiting, an extraordinarily normal-looking middle-aged woman waved me forward. I sat across the black folding table from her on one of the uncomfortable black chairs. She asked for my name and date of birth, then whether I am over 40 (I am 38). Did I have law enforcement experience? No. Military experience? Yes. Did I retire from the military at 20+ years, or leave once my enlistment was up? The latter, I told her, then repeated my carefully rehearsed, completely true explanation for why the résumé I’d submitted had a large gap. “I had a little bit of a quarter-life crisis. Ended up going to college for part of that time, and since then I’ve been kind of—gig economy stuff.”

She was spectacularly uninterested: “OK. And what location is your preference?”

After some dithering, I settled on my home state of New York. That was the last question; the entire process took less than six minutes. The woman took my résumé and placed the form she’d been filling out on top. “They are prioritizing current law enforcement first. They’re going to adjudicate your résumé,” she told me. If my application passed muster, I’d receive an email about next steps, which could arrive in the next few hours but would likely take a few days. I left, thanked her for her time, and prepared to hear back never.

The Expo event was part of ICE’s massive recruitment campaign for the foot soldiers it needs to execute the administration’s dream of a deportation campaign large enough to shift America’s demographic balance back whiteward. You’ve probably seen evidence of it yourself: ICE’s “Defend the homeland” propaganda is ubiquitous enough to be the Uncle Sam “I Want You” poster of our day, though somewhere in there our nation lost the plot about the correct posture toward Nazis.

When Donald Trump took office, ICE numbered approximately 10,000. Despite this event’s lackluster attendance, their recruitment push is reportedly going well; the agency reported 12,000 new recruits in 2025, which means the agency has more new recruits than old hands. That’s the kind of growth that changes the culture of an agency.

Many of ICE’s critics worry that the agency is hoovering up pro-Trump thugs—Jan. 6 insurrections, white nationalists, etc.—for a domestic security force loyal to the president. The truth, my experience suggests, is perhaps even scarier: ICE’s recruitment push is so sloppy that the administration effectively has no idea who’s joining the agency’s ranks. We’re all, collectively, in the dark about whom the state is arming, tasking with the most sensitive of law enforcement work, and then sending into America’s streets.

And we are all, collectively, discovering just how deadly of an arrangement that really is.

At the end of my brief interview, the recruiter mentioned I could talk to a current deportation officer about what the job would be like. There was no line to talk to a deportation officer (did I mention how empty the place was?) and so I walked up, introduced myself to one of them, and asked about day-to-day duties.

I shouldn’t expect to hit the streets right away, the agent told me. Odds were good I’d get a support position first—something like the Criminal Alien Program office. “Let’s say a local police officer arrests someone out in the field for a DUI. Extremely common. Or beating their wife or whatever—all the typical crimes they commit,” he said. (The “they” here being “undocumented immigrants,” and while it’s extremely difficult to measure, evidence suggests that “they” actually commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S.-born citizens.)

If the cops suspect they’re dealing with an immigrant who doesn’t have permanent legal status, they alert ICE, whose agents conduct interviews and run record checks.

If this preliminary investigation suggests that status, the person ends up in the Criminal Alien Program office for processing—which is where I would come in. “What you see on TV, with us arresting people and doing all kinds of crazy things, that’s maybe 10 percent. The other 90 percent is essentially doing a bunch of paperwork,” the agent said. “It takes a lot to remove somebody from the United States. Some people are subject to due process.”

The officer ran down other departments I might end up in: Prosecutions, Removal Coordination Unit, or Detention. The point being that I should not expect to be a badass street officer on Day 1. “I have so many guys that come over to me, they’re like, ‘I’m gonna put cuffs on somebody. I’m gonna arrest somebody.’ Well, you need to master this first and then we’ll see about getting you on the field.”

I told him that I was fine with office work—with my analyst background, it seemed like a better fit for my skill set anyway. His attitude shift was subtle, but instant and unmistakable; this was the wrong attitude and the wrong answer. “Just to be upfront, the goal is to put as many guns and badges out in the field as possible,” he said.

The agent then told me a bit about his own background. Like me, he enlisted straight out of high school, then got out and vowed to get as far away from the violence of the military as possible. Like a lot of veterans, he had trouble assimilating into the civilian world. “After about six months, I was like, ‘These people aren’t like me. I want to be around like-minded people.’ ” He found his way into law enforcement. That was well over a decade ago—he’s on his way to a very comfortable retirement, and he enjoys the work. “I like that instant gratification of Hey, that guy committed this crime, these X, Y, and Z, he’s not even supposed to be here,” he said.

I do not agree with his framing, but have no trouble understanding the appeal. Hell, it’s why I enlisted in the first place. Thankfully, Afghanistan beat it out of me. If I believed what he believed, I would surely do the same thing he’s doing.

I thanked him for the information and time, shook his hand, and took a seat on one of those uncomfortable folding chairs. I had a few hours before my flight back to New York City, and it made more sense to hang out than to flee the building and get good and airport drunk, regardless of how desperately I would have preferred the latter. Instead, I settled in to do what everyone does at the DMV: check my phone and people-watch. The aspiring officers fall broadly into three categories: thick-necked law enforcement types who look like they do steroids but don’t know how to work out, bearded spec-ops wannabes who look like they take steroids and do know how to work out, and dorks. Pencil-necked misfits. I couldn’t tell whether there were more white or Hispanic people waiting for their email, but it was close. A few Black applicants rounded out the overwhelmingly male group.

I’d been sitting around for about an hour when the video suddenly stopped and a bearded man in a black suit stepped onto the stage. He did not introduce himself—we were, I gathered, supposed to already know who he was—but it became clear he’s a senior agent of some sort. “I figured it would be best if I break up the same video you’ve been watching for the last four hours,” he said, and offered to answer any questions we might have.

One person asked about work/life balance, which the agent said is possible but not the route he’s chosen. Someone else wanted to know about travel opportunities and he talked about the many places he’s gone as part of the job.

Every other question during the 45 minutes the agent stood onstage pertained to the hiring process or what we could expect in training. Law enforcement types seemed especially concerned about the painful parts: Would they have to get pepper sprayed again? Would they have to get shot with a taser if they’d already qualified? Yes and probably not, respectively. The agent took the opportunity to gush about ICE’s new state-of-the-art semi-automatic tasers and brand-new pepper-ball guns. “It’s mostly very liberal cities—San Francisco, Los Angeles—where groups will come and try to stop ICE officers from arresting somebody. They’re like, ‘We’re going to form a human wall against you,’ ” he said. “When they do that, you can just pop ‘em up. Let them disperse and cry about it.”

When, during a moment of protracted silence, the agent threatened to put the video back on if no one had questions, I asked about harassment and doxing. “We will prosecute people to the fullest extent of the law,” he assured me, “and then people like myself will go on TV and publicly talk about how that person is now in prison to dissuade other people from doing it.”

As empty as the place had been when I’d arrived, it was even emptier by the time the senior agent ended the Q&A. Somebody vastly overestimated the number of Americans willing to take a job brutalizing and disappearing hard-working men and women—even with a potential $50K bonus, even in this economy.

That may have something to do with what happened to me next.

I completely missed the email when it came. I’d kept an eye on my inbox for the next few days, but I’d grown lax when nothing came through. But then, on Sept. 3, it popped up.

“Please note that this is a TENTATIVE offer only, therefore do not end your current employment,” the email instructed me. It then listed a series of steps I’d need to quickly take. I had 48 hours to log onto USAJobs and fill out my Declaration for Federal Employment, then five additional days to return the forms attached to the email. Among these forms: driver’s license information, an affidavit that I’ve never received a domestic violence conviction, and consent for a background check. And it said: “If you are declining the position, it is not necessary to complete the action items listed below.”

As I mentioned, I’d missed the email, so I did exactly none of these things.

And that might have been where this all ended—an unread message sinking to the bottom of my inbox—if not for an email LabCorp sent three weeks later. “Thank you for confirming that you wish to continue with the hiring process,” it read. (To be clear, I had confirmed no such thing.) “Please complete your required pre-employment drug test.”

The timing was unfortunate. Cannabis is legal in the state of New York, and I had partaken six days before my scheduled test. Then again, I hadn’t smoked much; perhaps with hydration I could get to the next stage. Worst-case scenario, I’d waste a small piece of ICE’s gargantuan budget. I traveled to my local LabCorp, peed in a cup, and waited for a call telling me I’d failed.

Nine days later, impatience got the best of me. For the first time, I logged into USAJobs and checked my application to see if my drug test had come through. What I actually saw was so implausible, so impossible, that at first I did not understand what I was looking at.

Somehow, despite never submitting any of the paperwork they sent me—not the background check or identification info, not the domestic violence affidavit, none of it—ICE had apparently offered me a job.

According to the application portal, my pre-employment activities remained pending. And yet, it also showed that I had accepted a final job offer and that my onboarding status was “EOD”—Entered On Duty, the start of an enlistment period. I moused over the exclamation mark next to “Onboarding” and a helpful pop-up appeared. “Your EOD has occurred. Welcome to ICE!”

I clicked through to my application tracking page. They’d sent my final offer on Sept. 30, it said, and I had allegedly accepted. “Welcome to Ice. … Your duty location is New York, New York. Your EOD was on Tuesday, September 30th, 2025.”

By all appearances, I was a deportation officer. Without a single signature on agency paperwork, ICE had officially hired me.

Perhaps, if I’d accepted, they would have demanded my pre-employment paperwork, done a basic screening, realized their mistake, and fired me immediately. And yet, the pending and upcoming tasks list suggested a very different outcome. My physical fitness test had been initiated on Oct. 6, it said: three days in the future. My medical check had apparently been completed on Oct. 6.

The portal also listed my background check as completed on Oct. 6. Had I preemptively passed? Was ICE seriously going to let me start training without finding out the first thing about me? I reached out to ICE for an explanation, but never heard back.

The only thing left for me to do was press the green “Accept” button on the home page. And maybe I should have. Maybe no one would have ever checked my name and I could have written the story of a lifetime. Or maybe the agency infamous for brutalizing and disappearing people with no regard for the law or basic human rights would have figured out exactly who I am while I was in one of their facilities with no way to escape. I’m not actually a domestic terrorist sent straight from Antifa headquarters, but to a paranoid fascist regime increasingly high on their own supply, I sure look like one on paper. Self-preservation won out.

I hit “Decline,” closed my browser, and took a long, deep breath.

What are we to make of all this? To be clear, I barely applied to ICE. I skipped the steps of the application process that would have clued the agency in on my lack of fitness for the position. I made no effort to hide my public loathing of the agency, what it stands for, and the administration that runs it. And they offered me the job anyway.

It’s possible that I’m an aberration—perhaps I experienced some kind of computer glitch that affected my application and no one else’s. But given all of the above, it seems far more likely that ICE is running an extremely leaky ship when it comes to recruitment.

With no oversight and with ICE concealing its agents’ identities, it’ll be extremely difficult for us to know.

There’s a temptation to take some comfort in ICE’s sloppiness. There’s a real argument here that an agency so inept in its recruitment will also be inept at training people and carrying out its mission. We’re seeing some very sloppy police work from ICE, including an inability to do basic things like throw someone down and cuff them. On some level, all of this is a reminder that their takeover is neither total nor inevitable.

But if they missed the fact that I was an anti-ICE journalist who didn’t fill out her paperwork, what else might they be missing? How many convicted domestic abusers are being given guns and sent into other people’s homes? How many people with ties to white supremacist organizations are indiscriminately targeting minorities on principle, regardless of immigration status? How many rapists and pedophiles are working in ICE detention centers with direct and unsupervised access to a population that will be neither believed nor missed? How are we to trust ICE’s allegedly thorough investigations of the people they detain and deport when they can’t even keep their HR paperwork straight?

And if they’re not going to screen me out, what hope is there of figuring out which recruit might one day turn into a trigger-happy agent who would forget that law enforcement officers are trained not to stand in front of vehicles, get jumpy, and shoot a 37-year-old woman to death on the streets of Minneapolis?

That’s exactly what happened last week, and why Renee Good will never have a 38th birthday, and why her children will never again be hugged by their mother.

By all appearances, the only thing ICE is screening for is a desire to work for ICE: a very specific kind of person perfectly suited for the kind of mission creep we are currently seeing. Good’s murder is not an isolated incident; the American Civil Liberties Union reports a nationwide trend of ICE pointing guns at, brutalizing, and even detaining citizens who stop to film them. A Minneapolis pastor who protested ICE by chanting “We are not afraid” was detained at gunpoint by an agent who reportedly asked him: “Are you afraid now?”

ICE

WASHINGTON — Twelve Members of Congress have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The Members filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order affirmed all Members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

The lawsuit, Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

The employee, a data analyst whom Ms. Menin did not publicly identify, is the first City Council staff member to be detained by Trump immigration officials, Ms. Menin said during a hastily convened news conference at City Hall on Monday evening.

Ms. Menin said that the employee, who had worked for the Council for about a year, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials during a routine immigration appointment on Long Island.

Ms. Menin and ICE officials offered conflicting information about the staff member’s immigration status and criminal history.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, identified the employee as Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, whom she said had entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2017 that required him to leave by October 2017.

Ms. McLaughlin said Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had “an arrest for assault,” though it was not clear if he had been charged or arrested. “He had no legal right to be in the United States,” Ms. McLaughlin said in a statement issued late Monday.

Ms. Menin said that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to work and remain in the United States until October 2026. Her office later specified that he had work authorization because he had qualified for Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian program that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. extended to Venezuelans but President Trump has since revoked.

Ms. Menin also said that he did not appear to have a criminal record.

“He, in fact, signed an attestation in January at the City Council that he’s never been arrested,” said Ms. Menin, a Democrat elected to lead the Council last week. “This man chose to work for the Council on behalf of the public, on behalf of New Yorkers, and despite every indication that he was doing everything the right way, he still found himself a victim of egregious government overreach.”

Ms. Menin said that she spoke with the deputy director of the ICE field office in New York, who she said confirmed that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez had been arrested without providing a reason.

Ms. Menin said that Mr. Rubio Bohorquez was being held at a Lower Manhattan facility on Varick Street, the site of an immigration courthouse.

Are you a federal worker? We want to hear from you.

The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second Trump administration. We may reach out about your submission, but we will not publish any part of your response without contacting you first.

Democratic officials in New York City, including Mayor Zohran Mamdani, joined Ms. Menin in denouncing the detention.

“This is an assault on our democracy, on our city and our values,” Mr. Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, said. “I am calling for his immediate release and will continue to monitor the situation.”

The Trump administration has arrested thousands of immigrants showing up for check-ins at ICE offices and routine hearings at immigration courthouses. The tactic has been used heavily in New York, where masked ICE agents have arrested migrants at courthouses on a nearly daily basis, turning the courts into flash points.

Many of the migrants being detained were allowed into the United States by the Biden administration, under legal pathways and humanitarian programs that the Trump administration has sought to revoke.

In recent weeks, immigration lawyers said that they had noticed an uptick in the arrest of migrants showing up at ICE offices for check-ins in New York.

Immigrants summoned for check-ins are typically undocumented, have tenuous legal status or are facing deportation but have been allowed to remain in the United States at the federal government’s discretion, so long as they regularly appear at an ICE office.

“They are going after the easiest prey they can find, and that is the people who are going to court and going to their check-ins,” Representative Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, said during the City Hall news conference.

Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana over whether oil and gas companies can move a lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for damage to the Louisiana coast to federal court.
They contend that the oil and gas companies, whose predecessors produced crude oil along the coast during World War II, violated the law and damaged the coast, and the parishes sought to have the companies pay damages.
Monday’s proceedings centered on the companies’ efforts to transfer the case from state to federal court under the federal officer removal statute.
It concluded that the parishes’ lawsuits focus on the companies’ exploration for, and production of, crude oil, while the companies entered into contracts with the government during the war to produce aviation gasoline, known as avgas, which required them to refine crude oil.
“By assisting the federal government in obtaining a critical wartime product under federal supervision,” Roper said, the companies “acted under a federal officer in refining avgas.","The Supreme Court on Monday morning grappled with a dispute in Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana over whether oil and gas companies can move a lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for damage to the Louisiana coast to federal court. A lawyer for the companies told the justices that they should be allowed to do so under a federal law, known as the federal officer removal statute, that gives federal courts the power to hear state court cases filed against “any officer (or any person acting under that officer) or the United States or of an agency thereof, in an official or individual capacity, for or relating to any act under color of such office.” Paul Clement argued that the conduct at the center of the case “effectively amounted to a joint venture during World War II to get as much oil out of the ground, transport it to the refineries that the government was helping to finance to expand, all in an effort to get petroleum products and in particular” aviation gasoline “onto the war front.”

Several justices, however, expressed concern about the potential reach of the companies’ position. That concern, combined with the dearth of questions for Louisiana Solicitor General J. Benjamin Aguiñaga, who represented the challengers, and the absence of Justice Samuel Alito (who did not participate in the case because he has a financial interest in a parent company of one of the defendants), made it difficult to predict who will ultimately prevail.

The dispute before the court on Monday is one of 42 that a group of Louisiana coastal parishes (along with state officials) filed under state law more than a decade ago. They contend that the oil and gas companies, whose predecessors produced crude oil along the coast during World War II, violated the law and damaged the coast, and the parishes sought to have the companies pay damages.

Monday’s proceedings centered on the companies’ efforts to transfer the case from state to federal court under the federal officer removal statute. A federal appeals court in New Orleans rejected the companies’ plea. It concluded that the parishes’ lawsuits focus on the companies’ exploration for, and production of, crude oil, while the companies entered into contracts with the government during the war to produce aviation gasoline, known as avgas, which required them to refine crude oil. And in particular, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit emphasized, the companies’ contracts with the government did not require them to produce crude oil at all; instead, they could have bought it on the open market.

The companies then came to the Supreme Court, which agreed last year to weigh in.

Representing the companies on Monday, Clement emphasized that the phrase “relating to” in the federal officer removal statute was a “capacious” one, intended to have “substantial breadth.” Indeed, he suggested, the parishes effectively do not defend the lower court’s conclusion but instead shift their focus to a different part of the statute, dealing with who can move a case to federal court. “That effort to change the subject does not work,” Clement argued.

There is little doubt, Clement said, “that the refining of avgas under federal contract satisfies” the removal statute’s “acting under” requirement; the only question, he indicated, is whether the companies’ refining activities are “connected to or associated with the production activities assailed in these lawsuits.” And the answer is “yes,” he insisted, because crude oil was an “indispensable component” of avgas.

Aaron Roper, an assistant to the U.S. solicitor general who argued on behalf of the federal government in support of the companies, echoed Clement’s argument. “By assisting the federal government in obtaining a critical wartime product under federal supervision,” Roper said, the companies “acted under a federal officer in refining avgas. That refining is an act under color of federal office that can support removal. And these suits relate to that act because they target the production of the crude oil that was the key ingredient in avgas and that the federal government linked to that refining by both contract and regulation.”

But some justices were skeptical. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson countered that the addition of the phrase “relating to” was intended to be merely a “conforming amendment” that did not substantively change the statute’s meaning.

For his part, Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Clement and later Roper about the scope of the companies’ proposed rule. Roberts asked Clement “how far upstream” a company could go and still have a product “relate to” the subject of a federal contract. For example, Roberts asked, if a vertically integrated company sells products to the government, would products “10 steps above that, where they’re buying the materials,” “relat[e] to” a government act?

Later Roberts told Roper that the phrase “relating to” is “very broad.” Where, he asked, do you draw the line? Roberts worried aloud that adopting a broad interpretation of the phrase would have a “butterfly effect.” “You know,” Roberts said, “the butterfly flaps its wings and it has the end result halfway around the world?”

Justice Neil Gorsuch also indicated that the phrase “relating to” was expansive. He quipped to Roper, “The Big Bang is related to you being here today, counsel.”

Clement argued that this case was “relatively straightforward” because of the central role for crude oil in producing avgas. And he offered a possible test to provide guidance for courts interpreting the rule: the key question, he said, is whether stopping the activity in which the defendants engaged “would have a direct negative effect on the government” – which, in this case, he said, it would.

Clement later offered another possible limit on his rule, telling the justices that “if you recognize that the kind of regulation here is distinct in the World War II context,” the court could reverse the lower court’s decision and rule for the companies without opening the floodgates to a mass movement of cases from state to federal court under the law at the center of the case.

Roper also sought to quell the chief justice’s concerns, telling him that the court didn’t necessarily need to resolve all of the line-drawing issues in this case.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett wondered aloud how the court should dispose of the case if it agreed with Clement that the lower court had applied the wrong rule. Should it send the case back to the 5th Circuit for it to take another look under the new rule, she queried, or should it go ahead and hold that the case can be moved?

Clement urged the justices to apply the new test themselves, rather than returning the case to the lower court.

Justice Elena Kagan asked Clement to address what she characterized as an “apparent anomaly” created by the companies’ position: a vertically integrated company that had the capacity to both produce crude oil and refine it could rely on the removal law and end up in federal court, while a non-integrated company without a refining capacity could not. “Why isn’t that just a bizarre outcome?,” she asked.

Clement conceded that there was a “surface anomaly.” But he urged the court to think about this question in terms of the “acting under” prong of the removal law. When you do that, he suggested, “it makes sense that” companies that had contracts directly with the federal government – the vertically integrated companies that had refining contracts with the government but also produced crude oil – “get to remove and those that are not don’t get to remove.”

During his time at the lectern, Aguiñaga called the dispute before the justices an “easy case,” as he emphasized that the oil companies “do not dispute that they dumped billions of gallons of” waste water “from oil wells directly into our marsh.” And in particular, he added, the companies had “abandoned below any argument that they were acting under a federal officer in committing the acts charged in our complaints” – which would mean that they could not transfer their case to federal court.

Aguiñaga also emphasized what he characterized as a “fundamental disconnect between this refinery theory” – the companies’ reliance on their contracts to produce avgas, which required them to refine crude oil – and the conduct that the parishes and state were targeting in their complaints, which was based on the exploration for and production of crude oil. “I think this Court has never seen and” the oil companies “have not identified for you any case where this Court has basically mixed and matched the ‘acting under’ conduct that satisfies prong 1 with whatever the conduct is that satisfies prong 2 [‘for or relating to any act under color of such office’].”

Aguiñaga spoke at length without interruption – whether this was because the justices largely agreed with him or instead because they had already made up their minds remains to be seen.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2199126048.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 13:58:04.544576

Why it matters: Unlike during Trump's first term, it's not just progressives taking up the ""defund ICE"" banner.
""We've got a level of funding that makes ICE bigger than a lot of militaries around the world.""
""We need funding reductions ... policy is not enough,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), who stressed that ""'defund' and 'abolish' are two different things.""
The other side: Some centrist Democrats — while signaling they would support policy changes — drew a clear line in the sand against defunding ICE.","Last week's shootings in Minneapolis and Portland has supercharged a push by Democrats in Congress to use an upcoming government funding deadline to try to slash funding to ICE.

Why it matters: Unlike during Trump's first term, it's not just progressives taking up the ""defund ICE"" banner. The idea is proliferating even among the more moderate and establishment wings of the party.

""What we've seen in Minneapolis and in Portland is what happens when we militarize against our own people,"" said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.). ""We've got a level of funding that makes ICE bigger than a lot of militaries around the world.""

Peters, a leading member of the center-left New Democrat Coalition, said he is ""totally open"" to trying to reduce ICE's funding and quipped: ""Consider me a progressive.""

Rep. John Mannion (D-N.Y.), a swing-district centrist, noted that the Big, Beautiful Bill nearly tripled ICE's funding: ""I would support reducing that funding back to fiscal year 2024 levels if I could.""

State of play: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) is proposing a set of reforms to the agency that he wants to tie to the Jan. 31 fiscal cliff, but some progressives say policy riders are insufficient.

""We need funding reductions ... policy is not enough,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), who stressed that ""'defund' and 'abolish' are two different things.""

""Some of us are at the 'abolish 'place, proudly. And I think moderates can start thinking about what does 'defund' mean,"" Ramirez told Axios.

Ramirez said she will ""have legislation very soon that will have language people can live with"" which would ""reprioritize funding that should have never have gone to kill people into housing and health care.""

Said Progressive Caucus chair Greg Casar (D-Texas): ""There has been a huge increase in money that has provided no increase in safety. ... [Trump] is burning taxpayer money only to make people less safe.""

The other side: Some centrist Democrats — while signaling they would support policy changes — drew a clear line in the sand against defunding ICE.

""I don't know if we need to defund ICE,"" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), who said the agency has been ""overly funded"" but that ""we don't have the votes for that anyway.""

Said Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine): ""I think it is not politically viable and I don't believe in it substantively ... I don't believe in defunding an entire law enforcement agency over the actions of a few of them.""

Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) said there ""are mechanisms in which we should be able to get the administration's attention where our powers can't be ignored,"" but that he is ""not interested in going anywhere near"" defunding ICE.

Between the lines: After a week of indicating that extending Affordable Care Act tax credits were his priority in the government funding fight, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) waded into the ICE funding debate during a press conference on Monday.

""It's important to understand that a lot of the funding for ICE that is currently being unleashed on the American people ... was provided not through the traditional appropriations process, but in connection with the one big, ugly bill,"" he said.

Beyond that, the Democratic leader was characteristically cryptic, telling reporters: ""That's something we will collectively be working on as our discussions continue.""

The bottom line: Republicans control Congress, and even progressives on the House Appropriations Committee acknowledged to Axios that any bill funding the Department of Homeland Security likely won't contain cuts for ICE.

Some lawmakers are also reticent to take up Murphy's threat to oppose a government funding bill if it fails to contain sufficient policy riders to rein in ICE.

Mannion said he tries ""not to let one thing in a budget"" keep him from voting for it, telling us, ""I've got to be thoughtful about that.""

Said Golden: ""It's on Chris Murphy to decide what he wants to do in the Senate, but I'm not for shutting down the government.""",https://images.axios.com/_w-H1WT0hDeF-oy7vzCFGQatcn4=/1366x768/smart/2025/03/13/201402-1741896842756.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:58:39.294749

A system once strained by volume is now destabilized by design – and that is a far greater public safety risk.","Immigration enforcement in the United States has drifted away from its core purpose. What began as a public safety function – focused on serious threats and guided by professional judgment – has become something far more volatile: politicized, disconnected from local realities and increasingly dangerous for everyone involved.

The recent tragedy in Minnesota should force a reckoning. Not because it is unique, but because it is the inevitable outcome of where we are – and where we are headed – if we refuse to change course.

I’ve spent two decades inside the national security and homeland security system. I’ve worked alongside agents who take their oath seriously and understand the weight of the authority they carry. We also all know how fragile public trust is, and how quickly it can be shattered when enforcement loses its grounding in common sense and accountability.

What we are witnessing now is not enforcement designed to protect Americans. It is enforcement untethered from public safety, driven by optics, speed, daily arrest quotas and political pressure rather than judgment. And that makes everyone less safe.

ICE's tactics are dangerous for public safety – and law enforcement

First, this approach is dangerous for law enforcement officers themselves.

When federal agents are pushed into fast-moving, high-visibility operations without clear prioritization or coordination with local partners, risk skyrockets, and officers are placed in volatile encounters with little margin for error. Split-second decisions carry life-or-death consequences – for both civilians and for agents.

Second, this model undermines public safety instead of advancing it.

Public safety is not measured by arrest numbers or viral footage. It is measured by whether communities are safer tomorrow than they were yesterday. When immigration enforcement prioritizes volume over threat, resources are diverted away from the work that actually protects people – investigating violent crime, dismantling trafficking networks and disrupting transnational criminal organizations.

Every hour spent arresting noncriminal students, workers, parents, older people and decade-long leaders in our communities – people chosen for visibility, not threat – is an hour stolen from real public safety work. That tradeoff is rarely acknowledged, but it is real. And it compounds quickly. Investigations stall. Intelligence dries up. The system grows weaker even as it looks tougher.

Third, this approach destroys trust – the most critical currency in law enforcement. Trust between federal agencies and local law enforcement. Trust between officers and the communities they serve. Trust that the law is being enforced fairly, rationally and with common sense.

You cannot police effectively in an environment of fear

When federal enforcement operates without transparency or coordination, local partners pull back. When communities see enforcement as arbitrary or performative, cooperation evaporates. Witnesses stop coming forward. Tips disappear. Fear replaces dialogue.

You cannot police effectively in an environment of fear. You cannot protect communities that do not trust you. And once that trust is broken, rebuilding it takes years – if it can be rebuilt at all.

Fourth, this moment exposes the cost of leadership failure.

America’s immigration system is broken. That is not a controversial statement. What is controversial is pretending that aggressive enforcement alone can fix it.

For decades, leaders have avoided the hard work of reform – updating laws, creating legal pathways that reflect economic reality, investing in immigration judges and other adjudication capacity and legislating clear enforcement priorities rooted in public safety. Instead, they’ve leaned on executive action and enforcement surges as a substitute for governance.

That long-standing avoidance has real consequences. When enforcement becomes a blunt tool for political frustration, agents are left to execute missions that policy never clearly defined. They are placed in situations that stretch beyond their training, authority and resources, increasing risk for officers, agencies and the communities they serve.

That is how we arrive at moments like Minnesota – not as anomalies, but as symptoms.

If this trajectory continues, the damage will not be linear. It will be exponential.

More dangerous encounters. More mistrust. More disengagement from local partners. More pressure on officers caught between their oath and political demands. More communities are convinced that federal law enforcement is something to fear rather than rely upon.

What we are seeing now is not a tougher or smarter phase of immigration enforcement. It is a failure of focus. The system has shifted away from identifying and neutralizing real criminal threats and toward producing images, metrics and moments that play well on cable news and social media. Enforcement decisions are increasingly shaped by what can be filmed, posted and amplified – not by what actually reduces harm or encourages compliance with our law.

This is enforcement optimized for narrative, not safety.

This is political signaling, not dealing with real risks

This moment is being framed as a correction to past failures at the border. But the problems created by a system under strain are not solved by shifting enforcement inward toward people who pose little or no public safety threat. Border breakdowns reflect failures of capacity, coordination and policy. Redirecting enforcement power away from real risks and toward political signaling does not fix those failures – it creates new ones, increasing danger for officers, communities and the integrity of the system itself.

For years, the administration claimed it needed sweeping enforcement powers to protect Americans from criminal migrants. That narrative justified extreme rhetoric and broad promises. But it was never supported by the facts. There were not enough serious noncitizen criminals to sustain it. What existed then – and still exists now – is a broken immigration system.

Instead of fixing it, today’s strategy relies on quotas and optics to manufacture threat. The result is more dangerous: enforcement untethered from purpose, increased risk on city streets and harm to Americans as well as migrants. A system once strained by volume is now destabilized by design – and that is a far greater public safety risk.

Minnesota should be understood in that context – not as a single failure, but as a warning about what path we are on as a nation. When enforcement is driven by messaging instead of mission, when optics outweigh judgment and when leadership substitutes spectacle for strategy, the risk to officers, civilians and public safety increases exponentially.

This is not inevitable. But reversing it requires leadership willing to reject the performance model and recommit to targeted, disciplined and grounded enforcement. It requires acknowledging that immigration enforcement cannot substitute for a functioning immigration system – and that no amount of theater can compensate for the absence of law, accountability and reform.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/10/USAT/88119995007-20260110-t-185135-z-1-lwd-578710012026-rp-1-rtrwnev-d-5787-usatrumpminneapolisiceconfrontationmp-400-00-39-17-still-001.jpg?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-13 08:57:30.602189

In a statement on the withdrawal, the agencies said they believe withdrawal is “appropriate to avoid any unnecessary burdens” from new or increased compliance efforts.

Russell Vought, the acting director at the CFPB, said: “For decades, ECOA regulations have permitted lenders to consider a borrower’s lawful residence status and other information necessary to protect their rights and remedies with respect to repayment.

President Trump said yesterday that he is imposing a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran. This is the president's latest move to turn up the pressure on the country as it deals with growing unrest. Trump says he continues to receive hourly reports of violence against protesters. According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, over 600 Iranians have died in the violence. Trump previously warned that the U.S. was ""locked and loaded"" and would rescue the protesters if the killings continued.

🎧 Trump isn't known for human rights initiatives, NPR's Franco Ordoñez tells Up First. During Trump's first administration, he ordered military strikes on Syrian targets in response to chemical attacks by the Assad regime. However, the president really wants a deal that permanently prevents Iran from getting nuclear weapons. Matthew Kroenig, who worked on the Iranian file at the Pentagon, says the Iranian supreme leader may agree to a zero enrichment deal if he thinks it helps the regime to survive.

Minnesota officials are suing the Trump administration in an attempt to end its immigration crackdown across the state. The lawsuit comes less than a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good, who was in her car. Protests across the U.S. have grown over the past week. NPR station photographers and freelance photographer Evan Frost documented the action on the ground.

🎧 State officials are accusing federal agents of arresting peaceful bystanders, detaining U.S. citizens and firing irritants at protesters. The lawsuit also claims agents have racially profiled people — an allegation the administration denies. Joel Keleekai, a permanent U.S. resident, tells NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán that he had to show agents proof that he was a resident while charging his electric vehicle in a parking lot. Martínez-Beltrán says it is unclear why agents decided to question Keleekai and others in that lot. They are all people of color and showed documentation that they are in the U.S. legally.

The Supreme Court hears arguments today in two cases that test laws banning transgender girls and women from participating in women's sports at publicly funded schools. To date, 27 states have enacted laws barring transgender athletes from participating in sports.

🎧 Transgender issues now play a large role in public debate, likely fueled by Trump's rhetoric around the topic in his 2024 presidential campaign, NPR's Nina Totenberg says. Supporters of the bans say the laws ensure fair competition by preventing those assigned male at birth from gaining an advantage in women's sports. Opponents of the laws say they discriminate based on sex, violating federal statutes and the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.

The massive deployment of federal officers to both cities has roiled the Midwest in recent weeks, following a series of high-profile and violent incidents involving immigration agents. The lawsuits come just days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis.

“This has to stop,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a press conference Monday announcing the state’s lawsuit. “We allege that the obvious targeting of Minnesota for our diversity, for our democracy and our differences of opinion with the federal government is a violation of the Constitution and of federal law.”

“This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities,” Ellison continued, arguing that DHS’ presence in Minnesota has “done our state serious harm.”

Illinois also announced Monday evening that it had filed a similar lawsuit, along with the city of Chicago, against the Trump administration and DHS for its “organized bombardment” that has created “a climate of fear” for residents of the Windy City.

In the more than 100-page lawsuit, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul said the administration’s deployment of federal law enforcement to the state “is intended to coerce Plaintiffs to abandon their policies, which value and respect the State’s immigrants, and devote their resources to further the immigration policies of the current administration. Illinois and Chicago have refused to do so.”

Since the start of what the administration has dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” last fall, federal immigration officials in the state have arrested more than 3,000 individuals, many lacking a criminal record.

“Border Patrol’s incursion into Illinois and its unlawful, unauthorized, violent, and arbitrary conduct is intended to intimidate and frighten Plaintiffs’ residents by disregarding their privacy, ignoring the security of their homes and property, and threatening their freedom and physical well-being,” the lawsuit stated.

Both Illinois’ and Minnesota’s lawsuits claim that the federal deployments violated state sovereignty under the Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

DHS has reportedly dispatched 2,000 federal agents to Minnesota, one of the largest mobilizations in DHS history.

The state has attracted scrutiny from the Trump administration following a welfare fraud scandal in which more than 50 individuals, many of them Somali nationals, are accused of stealing $1 billion in taxpayer funds distributed during the COVID-19 pandemic for social programs.

President Donald Trump has latched onto the scandal, calling Somalis “garbage” and increasing attacks against the state’s lone Somali lawmaker, Rep. Ilhan Omar.

Minnesota officials, however, said the deployment of federal officers, called “Operation Metro Surge” by the administration, has done nothing to stop similar cases of fraud and instead inflamed tensions and created fear.

“We work with the federal government all the time, and if the federal government wants to help us with forensic accountants, we’re open to that conversation, but these ICE agents, who are engaging in the behavior they are engaged in, are not helping public safety at all,” Ellison said in response to the fraud allegations.

The attorney general said since DHS began its presence in the state, local law enforcement has responded to at least 20 reports detailing controversial and potentially illegal tactics, including the use of unmarked vehicles and masked agents apprehending people off the street.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Monday’s lawsuit is necessary considering the extreme tactics being utilized by DHS.

“The scale is widely disproportionate and has nothing to do with keeping people safe,” Frey said at the press conference.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/5cf04b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1969+0+182/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2F87%2F8423e82942d683a1829187d688ea%2Fap25240137541120.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:13:00.456535

The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities filed a lawsuit Monday against the Trump administration over Operation Metro Surge, calling the expanded immigration crackdown a “federal invasion.”

It comes after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed while driving her SUV toward an ICE officer working enforcement in Minnesota. Her death has prompted protests, vigils, and demonstrations across the country condemning the Trump administration’s immigration tactics.

While defending the lawsuit, Frey questioned why Minnesota was targeted, saying, “If the goal was immigration enforcement, if the goal was to look for people who are undocumented, there are countless other people who are undocumented in Florida and in Texas and Utah.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded on X, saying it has a presence in every state but does not need to surge resources to Florida, Texas, or Utah. ICE said those states work with federal authorities to detain and deport what it described as criminal illegal aliens, unlike Minnesota.

Under the federal 287(g) program, multiple Utah county sheriff’s offices partner with ICE, including Beaver, Kane, Sanpete, Tooele, Utah, Washington, and Weber counties. The Utah Department of Corrections also participates, along with Riverton Police.

The program allows trained local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions in cooperation with ICE, a point federal officials have cited when responding to questions about where enforcement resources are deployed.

Frey’s mention of Utah comes as new data shows the state has become a major destination for migrants. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Associated Press in October 2025, Salt Lake City ranked third in the nation per capita for migrant arrivals during a recent 20-month period.

Between May 2023 and January 2025, nearly 2.5 million people who crossed the border and were released with humanitarian protections or notices to appear in immigration court reported where they planned to live. Salt Lake City recorded about 1,685 arrivals per 100,000 residents, trailing only Miami and Fort Myers, Florida, and edging out Denver and New York.

The data reflects intended destinations rather than permanent settlement but highlights a shift in migration patterns, with cities like Salt Lake City absorbing more newcomers as traditional gateways see slower growth.

Last year, Governor Cox said it was possible the Utah National Guard could assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by providing federally funded administrative and clerical support, not arrests, freeing up ICE agents for field work, with troops handling tasks like processing paperwork and transporting individuals.

Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.
Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans.
Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester.
Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.","In late December, The Washington Post reported that Merrimack is one of 23 sites across the United States where the Trump administration plans to build a new ICE detention facility as part of its aggressive deportation campaign, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security. The local response over the ensuing weeks has been intense.

“I’m almost 70 years old,” Mike Tranchemontagne, of nearby Nashua, said. “I never thought I’d be living in a police state, and that’s what we’re turning into.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, is seeking contractors to help convert industrial warehouses into a network of detention centers across the country to hold immigrants the federal government wants to deport, the Post reported. Under the plan, seven new facilities would hold 5,000 to 10,000 people each and 16 new smaller feeder facilities would hold up to 1,500 people each. Detainees would be booked and held at the smaller facilities for a few weeks before being transferred to one of the large facilities. The administration plans to put one of the smaller facilities in Merrimack, according to the newspaper’s reporting.

Gov. Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters last week, said her administration has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential ICE facility in New Hampshire.

“This whole discussion about it, to me, is, at this point, a speculative discussion,” Ayotte said. “I would expect, if this were a real plan, which I don’t know yet because it’s been media speculation at this point, that there would be a process in which members of the local community would have an opportunity to weigh in, as, I would think, at some point the state would be consulted. But none of that’s happened yet.”

Ayotte also questioned who would staff a Merrimack facility given the fact there is already an ongoing staffing shortage in New Hampshire state prisons.

Tranchemontagne was one of hundreds who gathered outside Merrimack Town Hall Thursday protesting the plans. While the demonstration began as a reaction to the news of a potential detention center in Merrimack, it grew to become a protest about ICE action across the country and the Trump administration’s actions writ large. The protest came one day after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, and many protesters held signs referencing the shooting or wore stickers bearing Good’s name.

“I love my country and I disagree with just about everything that’s happened in the last year,” Tranchemontagne said. “Just total lack of concern about law and order, the Constitution, due process, on and on and on. I mean, it’s unfathomable.”

State Rep. Wendy Thomas, a Merrimack Democrat, believes such a facility would be both a moral and practical issue.

“ICE is a lawless, thug-ridden agency that is not following procedure,” Thomas told the Bulletin. “They’re not following laws. They’re terrorizing people around the United States. We don’t need people like that in our town. They violate human rights on a regular basis.”

Thomas argued “building this facility would make Merrimack complicit in those abuses.”

However, she also pointed to planning and zoning concerns.

“Even if you set aside the moral crisis, and we shouldn’t, this proposal is still a terrible deal for our town,” she said. “Detention centers are often exempt from local property taxes or generate far less revenue than traditional commercial development. That means lost property-tax income for Merrimack, while the costs fall squarely on our residents, our fire department, police and emergency medical services would be expected to respond to a high-risk facility.”

She also worries about the traffic a facility could add to the Daniel Webster Highway, Merrimack’s main artery.

Max Goddard grew up in Merrimack. He worries the former Anheuser-Busch plant — which the multinational beer company announced would close sometime in early 2026 — would be the chosen site for a detention center. (The Trump administration has not publicly specified where any detention center might be located or publicly confirmed or denied the Post’s reporting.)

“I took prom pictures at the Anheuser-Busch plant,” Goddard said during the protest, “which might be the site of this future concentration camp. And I think it would be a tragedy to take what is formerly an icon of this town, and a thing that everyone goes to, and to turn it into something so sickeningly horrible.”

Merrimack Town Hall closed early Thursday in anticipation that more people would show up than it could handle, and Merrimack Police Department officers and Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputies were on scene. Protests against ICE activity in general and the Merrimack plans specifically also took place in Concord and Manchester. Other towns identified in the Post’s reporting, such as Roxbury, New Jersey, and Jefferson, Georgia, also saw resistance and demonstrations.

Erin Walthour, who travelled from Grantham to the Merrimack protest Thursday, said she was horrified reading the federal government’s plans to create a network of detainment centers.

Top Republicans marked the start of the new legislative session with the announcement during an early morning news conference, brandishing bright red posters with “We support ICE” printed on them in capital letters and bracketing Pinal County Attorney Brad Miller — who came up with the proposal — as he praised federal immigration officials and criticized “agitators.”

Miller has sought to build a reputation as a border hawk and Trump loyalist, entering his office into a federal partnership with ICE last year without permission from the county’s board of supervisors, volunteering to prosecute a Phoenix Democratic senator who shared alerts about ICE activity on her social media, and most recently speaking out in defense of the agent who shot Good in the face and called her a “f*cking b*tch” immediately after he killed her.

But just as the news conference was about to begin, a crowd of outraged protestors descended on Miller and the handful of GOP lawmakers preparing to give remarks about the new legislation just outside of the state Senate. One man played a tuba, another played a trombone and still another shook a plastic container filled with coins in accompaniment. Protestors waved signs reading “ICE OUT OF AZ” and “say her name: Renee Good,” while chanting “ICE kills moms!” and “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here!”

The shouting drowned out Miller as he attempted to speak to reporters, prompting the news conference to come to an abrupt halt. The group eventually retreated to a Senate hearing room, followed closely by protestors, who continued chanting and held their signs up against the glass doors of the chamber’s lobby.

Inside the Senate building, Miller touted his proposal as a solution for what supporters of federal immigration officials claim is an increasingly hostile working environment.

“ICE face escalating dangers from doing their jobs,” he said. “Assaults on federal officers have skyrocketed.”

The Trump administration has routinely inflated assault statistics and failed to provide any evidence. An investigation by the Los Angeles Times into thousands of pages of court records found the claims from the federal government to be misleading, with the majority of alleged attacks against ICE agents resulting in no injuries.

Miller pointed to the December raid of Taco Giro restaurants in Tucson as proof that protests have gotten out of control and endangered federal agents. At least two agents were hurt by activists, he claimed, suffering a bicep rupture and an injured knee. That same raid prompted criticism after U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was pepper-sprayed by federal agents and nearly struck with a pepper-ball. A Tucson Sentinel reporter who was also pepper sprayed wrote that he witnessed at least one federal agent trip and fall down.

The proposal, which has yet to be introduced as legislation, would expand the legal definition of obstructing governmental operations to include threatening or intimidating a law enforcement officer while making an arrest. Currently, a person obstructs governmental operations when they knowingly hinder the activity of a public servant acting under their official role or impede the enforcement of a law being implemented by a police officer. Doing either could result in a class 1 misdemeanor, which carries with it thousands of dollars in fines and up to six months in jail.

Miller said the change in state law wouldn’t infringe on the First Amendment right to protest, but instead act as a buffer for law enforcement officials attempting to take people into custody — including ICE agents, whose arrest methods have recently faced rising public disapproval.

“This bill draws a constitutional line,” Miller said. “Observe, record, question but do not physically obstruct (or) threaten in ways to heighten danger or interfere with a lawful arrest.”

Senate President Warren Petersen lauded the proposal, saying he would work to support it. The Republican from Gilbert has spent his political career pushing for stricter immigration legislation, and with the 2026 midterms on the horizon that’s likely to be the case again, especially as he works to convince voters to make him the state attorney general.

Petersen, who is running for attorney general in this year’s election, obliquely mentioned the shooting of Good in Minneapolis by framing the legislation as a way to prevent similar incidents in the future.

“We’ve seen some tragedies recently — tragedies that could be avoided if people would simply just follow the law,” he said.

“ICE are sworn law enforcement officers and you shall not resist. Follow the law — comply, don’t die,” echoed Rep. John Gillette, R-Kingman, who said he would be sponsoring the bill.

Gillette is a former sheriff’s deputy in Illinois who resigned after amassing 42 complaints in his 13-year career, a number of which were for using excessive force. He was also the subject of multiple lawsuits stemming from his treatment of suspects and victims.

Last year, he made national news when he said that a Democratic congresswoman from Washington state should be executed for encouraging protests against Trump. That happened a few weeks after he called American Muslims “f*cking savages” who should be deported to the “sh*t hole” places they came from.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brad-miller-ice-protest-presser-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2026-01-13 08:57:42.988849

Ron DeSantis and the Republican-dominated state House and Senate.

Here are some of the bills to keep an eye on.

SB 1380/HB 1307

Sponsored by Sen. Jonathan Martin and Rep. Berny Jacques, these bills represent the largest immigration package filed so far for this session.

The provisions include:

Fines for employers who ignore their workers’ documentation status.

Criminal charges for hiring more than 50 undocumented immigrants.

Rebuttable presumption that undocumented out-of-state drivers are at-fault in car accidents.

Denying undocumented immigrants bank loans.

Requires law enforcement investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.

Bans translators or interpreters in licensing procedures.

Creates penalties for failing to use E-Verify ahead of submitting worker compensation claims.

SB 1542

Very similar to Martin’s and Jacques’ legislation, this bill was filed Friday by Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent. His bill would create fines for employers who fail to use E-Verify at all — not just those who don’t do so in filing workers’ compensation claims.

It would also require law enforcement to use E-Verify to investigate a detained person’s immigration status, and bans businesses that have violated the bill from ever receiving any public contract in the future with any public agency in this state.

SB 1052

Filed by Sen. Erin Grall, this bill instructs public colleges and universities to exclusively admit students who are “citizen[s] of the United States” or “lawfully present therein.”

It would prevent migrants illegally in the country from participating in state-funded adult general education programs, which include classes for GED and English as a second language that help “adult learners gain the knowledge and skills they need to enter and succeed in postsecondary education.”

HB 197/SB 1278

Proposed by Rep. Berny Jacques and Sen. Jonathan Martin, these bills require every business to use E-Verify, a federal database verifying a worker’s immigration status.

This expands a 2023 law that mandated E-Verify for public employers and businesses with at least 25 employees. Now, all businesses regardless of private/public status or number of employees must use the database, the bill says.

HB 991

Sponsored by Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka and Rep. Dana Trabulsy, this bill would require new Florida voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship.

The measure also:

Requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote.

Mandates that the Florida Department of State review existing voter registrations for citizenship status and forward names to supervisors of elections to request proof of eligibility from voters.

Requires driver’s licenses and state ID cards to display citizenship status.

Expands information-sharing on citizenship status between the Department of State, the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (DHSMV), and jury coordinators.

Creates a new post-election audit process.

Makes changes to the recount process.

Makes new restrictions on campaign contributions from foreign nationals

HB 985

Filed by Rep. Berny Jacques, this bill is very similar to Persons-Mulicka’s bill.

The measure:

Requires election supervisors to verify citizenship status by using the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements or “SAVE” program administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Mandates election supervisors “who have determined that false affirmations have been made on a voter registration application” to refer the application to the Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security.

Information received by the DHSMV indicating that a registered voter has received a driver’s license in another state “shall be considered a written request from the voter to have his or her name removed from the statewide voter registration system.”

Narrows the list of IDs that can be used at the polls.

Adds new requirements for voters who registered using a Florida ID.

Expands the use of provisional ballots for voters whose citizenship can’t be verified.

Creates additional steps for vote-by-mail requests.

Florida IDs and driver licenses issued to non-citizens must be marked “NC” on the front.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5753-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 06:58:19.374966

There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.The legal challengesAmerica First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida.

The next U.S. census is four years away, but two lawsuits playing out this year could affect how it will be done and who will be counted.

Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states.

The challenges align with parts of Trump's agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants' privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit's intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

""This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,"" Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees' association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of ""a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process"" if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump's agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump's agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Joe Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president's social media post.

Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to exclude noncitizens from the apportionment process. That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution's 14th Amendment says ""the whole number of persons in each state"" should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, health care and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau's defense in both cases, despite the intervenors' concerns.

No end in sight for immigration enforcement The states say more harm to their residents is sure to come as there is no end in sight for immigration enforcement.","Minnesota and Illinois separately filed lawsuits Monday against the Trump administration, arguing the president’s immigration crackdown is terrorizing their communities and violating the Constitution.

“We have watched in horror as unchecked federal agents have aggressively assaulted and terrorized our communities and neighborhoods in Illinois, undermining Constitutional rights and threatening public safety,” said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

Chicago, as well as Minneapolis and Saint Paul, were also part of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

The federal government has stepped up operations in Chicago and the Twin Cities, both Democratic strongholds, during the fall and local officials have criticized them for sowing chaos and confusion. An ICE-involved shooting last week in Minneapolis left a mother of three dead and kickstarted a series of nationwide protests.

Both Minnesota and Illinois are asking for an injunction to halt the immigration operations in their states.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said that the state’s lawsuit aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.

“Quite honestly, we need ICE to just do what ICE is supposed to do, which is immigration enforcement,” Ellison told CNN’s Laura Coates Monday night. “They’re doing far more than that … by harassing people, by using excessive force on a routine basis.”

The suits were filed against the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as reporting agencies, including ICE, US Customs and Border Protection and US Border Patrol.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Constitution was on the administration’s side. The surge of federal officers, she said in a statement Monday in response to the lawsuits, was needed because “sanctuary politicians” in Illinois and Minnesota were not protecting their citizens.

Here are the key claims from both lawsuits:

Suits claim unprecedented immigration operations violated 10th Amendment

Both lawsuits invoke the 10th Amendment to defend their states’ rights, alleging the Trump administration has commandeered local resources for its crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and Illinois.

The “unlawful and violent tactics, have disrupted the lives and undermined the liberties and property rights of the people,” and have prevented Illinois and Chicago from enacting the policy their citizens want, their lawsuit said.

Minnesota’s suit specifically emphasized strains on local police resources. The complaint asserts that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

The deployment of “armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents” is a federal invasion, Ellison said Monday.

CNN reported early last week about 2,000 federal agents were being deployed to Minneapolis. That number, Minnesota’s lawsuit said, “greatly exceeds the number of sworn police officers that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have, combined.”

Minneapolis police officers have worked thousands of combined overtime hours as a direct result of federal agents’ presence, the suit said, costing the city over $2 million in overtime pay.

Political retaliation by Trump motivated immigration crackdown, states say

Minnesota’s lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge, the immigration crackdown effort in the Twin Cities, is not a legitimate law enforcement action, but the result of a desire to “retaliate” against the Democratic-led state.

The complaint details disparaging statements about the state that President Donald Trump has made, saying it shows a clear intention to punish political opponents and jurisdictions with sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the federal government during immigration efforts.

Illinois’s lawsuit made a similar claim, saying Trump and his administration “have long directed threatening and derogatory statements towards jurisdictions that do not invest in enforcing federal immigration law.”

“President Trump’s job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,” McLaughlin said Monday in response to the lawsuits.

Both states said they have had funds, such as those for social services programs, withheld because the administration says they haven’t complied with immigration policies.

“Defendants have repeatedly made statements that reflect their true intent—to punish Minnesota’s elected officials and residents for their perceived political leanings, to target so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, to create false political narratives of lawlessness in Minnesota, and to incite flashpoints between Minnesota residents and immigration agents,” the Minnesota lawsuit says.

Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon previously told CNN the funding was revoked because “Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch” and they were ensuring “these states are following the law.”

Federal agents ‘unlawfully terrorized’ communities, Minnesota suit says

Both lawsuits allege tactics used by federal agents during their operations are detrimental to the community and terrorizing everyone who lives there.

Illinois and Chicago said in their lawsuit DHS had “cast aside longstanding policies” which they argued was not only illegal but “arbitrary and capricious.”

The lawsuit is asking the court to stop the agencies from using tactics like “roving patrol, biometric scanning, warrantless arrest,” among other methods. The suit also alleges agents regularly trespassed on private property and used riot weapons, like tear gas, on people who weren’t resisting.

The tactics have left residents fearing for their safety as “uniformed, military-trained personnel, carrying semi-automatic firearms and military-grade weaponry, armed with semi-automatic rifles” roam the city, they said.

The complaint from Minnesota says DHS agents would “unlawfully terrorize” communities in the Twin Cities with continued aggression just hours after Renee Good, a 37-year-old US citizen, was shot and killed by an ICE agent.

“DHS agents were met with unsurprising protests after the fatal shooting two hours earlier but used pepper spray and rammed vehicles when leaving,” it says.

Minnesota’s suit also asserts that federal agents have engaged in widespread racial profiling, particularly against Somali and Hispanic communities, as they conduct immigration operations in the Twin Cities.

“On December 10, 2025, two masked DHS agents tackled and arrested Mubashir, a Somali American man … despite Mubashir repeatedly asking that he be allowed to show them his legal identification,” the complaint says. “DHS agents then detained Mubashir for two hours for no apparent reason other than his perceived national origin.”

The complaint offered several other incidents of citizens being detained or questioned – including young workers at Target, Minneapolis Public Works employees or people on their way to work – it says, because of their perceived ethnicity.

The states have experienced immigration enforcement for decades – but this is different

Illinois and Minnesota have long complied with immigration enforcement under different administrations, they said in their respective lawsuits. But the tactics and intensity now make these specific operations more like a war zone, they said.

“For decades, federal immigration agents enforced immigration laws in the Chicago area by targeting and arresting individuals subject to removal without significant impact on public order and safety in Illinois or Chicago,” the Illinois lawsuit said. But now, the way agents conduct themselves is acting more like “occupiers rather than officers of the law.”

“This has left many Illinois and Chicago residents, regardless of immigration status, frightened to avail themselves of public services, or even venture outside to engage in normal daily activity,” the suit said.

Aside from the unprecedented size and force of the operation, Minnesota and Illinois’ lawsuits allege DHS has also abandoned its longstanding practice of avoiding conducting immigration operations in “sensitive” public places.

The policy, the complaints claim, was revoked to make way for the operations.

“Thousands of armed and masked DHS agents have stormed the Twin Cities to conduct militarized raids and carry out dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional stops and arrests in sensitive public places, including schools and hospitals—all under the guise of lawful immigration enforcement,” Minnesota’s complaint says.

No end in sight for immigration enforcement

The states say more harm to their residents is sure to come as there is no end in sight for immigration enforcement.

Illinois has had an increased federal law enforcement presence since September, and officials have repeatedly said they aren’t planning on leaving.

“If you think we’re done with Chicago, you’d better check yourself before you wreck yourself. Don’t call it a comeback; we’re going to be here for years,” CBP Commander Gregory Bovino said last month.

Minnesota’s complaint also says the federal government appears poised to continue operations in the state, despite weeks of escalation and public outcry.

In a social media post last week cited in Minnesota’s suit, DHS wrote: “We’re not leaving until the problem is solved.”

As CNN has reported, around 1,000 additional Border Patrol agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis, according to two federal law enforcement sources, in addition to the previous deployment of federal agents.

Announcing the legal action, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the Department of Homeland Security's surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers into the northern state in recent days has ""made us less safe.""

What do we know about the Minnesota lawsuit?

Ellison told a press conference that ""thousands of poorly trained, aggressive and armed agents of the state, of the federal government, have rolled into our communities.""

""The deployment of thousands of armed, masked DHS ⁠agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is, in essence, a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota and it must stop,"" Ellison said.

He added that Democratic-led Minnesota was being targeted for ""our democracy and our differences of opinion with the federal government"" in what he said was a ""violation of the Constitution and federal law.""

Last week, a federal immigration officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three whom US authorities accused of driving her car toward the officer. Local officials have strongly disputed the narrative, pointing to video footage from the scene which shows Good's vehicle turning away from the agent.

""If the goal were simply to look for people who are undocumented, Minneapolis would not be the place you would go,"" said city mayor Jacob Frey.

""There are countless more people that are undocumented in Florida and Texas and Utah,"" he added, noting that those states are Republican-controlled.

Trump's immigration crackdown

President Trump's Republican administration has deployed federal law enforcement officers into several cities and states largely governed by Democrats in what Trump says is a crackdown on irregular immigration and corruption.

""For years, these corrupt, activist politicians have refused to protect Minnesotans and are now proposing illegal actions to keep their stranglehold on control and continue stealing from American citizens,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X.

""We will root out this rampant fraud, we will arrest the criminal illegal aliens hurting Americans with impunity, and we will hold those who aid and abetted this criminality accountable.""

Ellison's lawsuit against the Trump administration named Noem and several other US administration officials. It calls on the court to declare the surge of immigration-enforcement officers into the state of Minnesota unconstitutional.

The Illinois lawsuit is also putting forth similar demands.

NINA MOINI: OK. KEITH ELLISON: We're going to announce how we're going to take action to protect people.
NINA MOINI: OK. Who is responsible, Attorney General Ellison, for holding ICE agents accountable for any sort of illegal activity?
I understand we have Attorney General Keith Ellison back on the line.
KEITH ELLISON: Well, certainly, people can sue the federal government for violation of their civil rights.","Audio transcript

NINA MOINI: You heard us talking to our Ben Hovland just now. A lot of people have questions about what ICE has been up to recently. Like, who holds ICE accountable for any illegal activity, racial profiling, or use of force incidents? And though Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Governor Tim Walz have stated that federal immigration agents are clearly not welcome here, to them, it's not clear what action they're following up those statements with. So here to provide some insight on that is Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Thank you for your time this morning, or this afternoon.

KEITH ELLISON: Thanks for having me. Thank you very much.

NINA MOINI: I want to get right to asking you about a news conference that we are told that you'll be having later today. It says to talk about DHS future in Minnesota, saying you're going to be joined by some local area mayors. Can you tell us more about that?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, what I can tell you is that you're referring to a press conference that we're having a little bit later this afternoon. It wouldn't be right for me to tell you what I'm going to announce then, OK? But I will set the stage for you this way, that we are contemplating action, legal action, to protect and preserve the people of the state of Minnesota. We are going to announce how we are going to move forward to safeguard civil rights, human rights, the Constitution itself, the proper balance between the state government and the federal government.

We are going to talk about how overreaching federal government action is inappropriate and not contemplated by the Constitution. We're going to talk about-- and we're going to talk about what we're going to do about it.

So, you've been a reporter for a long time. What it means when people are going to do a press conference at a certain time. And I hope that you'll allow me-- I hope that, one, you'll come-- you're personally invited-- and that you'll allow us to make the announcement at the right and proper time.

NINA MOINI: I appreciate that.

KEITH ELLISON: Which is this afternoon.

NINA MOINI: And I understand where you're coming from, but I'm on the air, and I have this information that this is coming up, and that every minute has just been so critical for folks. So even 3 and 1/2 more hours, Minnesotans really want know, what is being done on their behalf? So, if there's nothing else you--

KEITH ELLISON: OK, I can answer that.

NINA MOINI: OK.

KEITH ELLISON: We're going to announce how we're going to take action to protect people.

NINA MOINI: OK. Who is responsible, Attorney General Ellison, for holding ICE agents accountable for any sort of illegal activity?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, Kristi Noem is. And the president of the United States is responsible for them. That's who is responsible. And in conversations often, you'll see somebody acting badly, breaking the law, violating people's human rights, breaking norms and common custom, and you'll see this bad conduct. And then the question is, how come somebody who is not doing it is responsible for stopping it?

Well, we are going to take action. We're going to talk about that today. But please, let's make sure the focus and the blame and the responsibility stay where it belongs, which is firmly and squarely with Donald J. Trump and the people who he has hired to carry out Homeland Security activities, which is Kristi Noem. That is who is responsible.

You ask me, who's responsible? That's who's responsible. But if they don't do their job, then it's our job to make them do their job. So that's what we're going to be talking about later today.

NINA MOINI: President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Noem have, of course, said that they feel their agents are just doing their job and that people should essentially stay out of their way and let them do their job, and then there won't be an issue. Obviously, a lot of people in the state of Minnesota feel that they need to be there observing what's going on. And obviously, we've been getting a lot of reports like we just heard from our own photojournalist, Ben Hovland, of just blatant racial profiling that people are telling us is going on against, oftentimes, US citizens, against anyone that is illegal. Correct?

So what should people do if they're in a situation like that? What kind of recourse do if they were just sitting in their car and somebody came up and asked them, are you a United States citizen?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, you have the right to remain silent. You have the right to legal counsel. And I think you should exercise those rights. Absolutely-- absolutely, you should. You should if you get a chance to go to Know Your Rights-- [AUDIO OUT].

NINA MOINI: I think we've lost him. We're going to call him back because we want to get as much information for our listeners as we can.

I understand we have Attorney General Keith Ellison back on the line. Thank you for joining us again.

KEITH ELLISON: Sure. Sorry about that fall off. Anyway, where were we?

NINA MOINI: That's OK. The two things I really want to make sure that we're able to talk about is just the many complaints and different videos and things that are surfacing regarding use of force at different incidents or instances where people are encountering ICE agents, whether they be in an observer role or the person who's at the center of the questions being asked. So what can people do about that, realistically, if they feel that heavy use of force or things were way beyond the scope of what was necessary or reasonable?

KEITH ELLISON: Well, certainly, people can sue the federal government for violation of their civil rights. That absolutely is an opportunity people have. There are a lot of-- we have a good civil rights bar in Minnesota and around the country, who want to help people, very concerned. And so that's why I was urging folks before to make sure they take documentation, videotape, things like that. These will be very helpful.

If you don't have video, then make sure you write your recollections down quickly. Note your time, date, location, and what you saw. And make sure that you gather any evidence that could help prove your case. Because the civil-- the system of civil redress, meaning file a lawsuit. A civil rights case is still part of how we protect our rights in the United States and in Minnesota.

The other thing is that, look, as your state attorney general, I am watching this situation very carefully, and I am ready and prepared to take action. I'm hoping that you, Nina, will join us at 3:30 at the press conference. And I want everybody to pay attention to the announcement that we're about to make, because it is important. And it has everything to do with defending and protecting our rights as Minnesotans and as Americans. And so between the state government, between individual citizens taking note and seeking out legal counsel to file their own cases, there are things we can do, and we should do them all.

I also-- let me make a note, that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution says that people have the right to peacefully assemble. They have the right to redress grievances of their government. They have the right to freedom of the press. They have the right to freedom of faith. They have the right to freedom of expression. People have these rights and they should exercise them. They should exercise them peacefully, of course, but I think they should exercise them. Because I think that unless we do exercise them, we might send the Trump administration the signal that we're fine with the bad things that they're doing to our neighbors, and we're not.

And so I would say exercise your rights, seek legal redress in a private civil rights lawsuit, and continue to call on me to do what I can do to help. And we're going to be making some announcements in a very short period of time.

NINA MOINI: Just lastly, Attorney General, what you were talking about in your lane is that lane of judicial action and the court of law. I think people are-- a lot of people are really afraid. A lot of Minnesotans are driving around with their passports on them. I believe, Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her said she's carrying hers. If I come to the press conference this afternoon, I'm also carrying my passport with me now.

So I do wonder, in those moments, people want to be able to call their local police agency. We've heard from Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that he feels they're outnumbered. Mayor Jacob Frey said they are outnumbered and unable really to respond to these instances, which leaves people not knowing where to turn in the moment. What is your message to Minnesotans who are in fear right now? A fear that they may have not felt in their entire lives.

KEITH ELLISON: Well, they may have felt the same fear if they were living under a repressive government at one point in their life. I think that people, anybody who might have lived-- we do have some elderly people who may have some experience with totalitarian governments in places like Germany, Italy, and Spain, and Chile and Argentina and maybe even Venezuela. Those neighbors who know what it's like, they can tell us a lot.

But what I would say is don't let fear take over, because fear is of no assistance. What we need is action. What we need is-- we need people to not be fearful, but be thoughtful and think through what we're going to do, think through what you're going to do.

I personally am not bringing my passport, and I'm going to tell you why. I am a 10 generations in this country, and I'm just not doing that. Because even though I have a passport and I used it as late as last week, or-- I'm just not giving into that. Now, I don't recommend people do what I'm doing. I have my own reasons. But I think people, carrying your passport is a wise idea, is a smart idea.

But don't be fearful. Think of what we can do to counter this outrageous, unprecedented behavior by the federal government. And just remember, you're not alone. You're absolutely not alone.

On Monday, the final day of the current New Jersey legislative session, lawmakers in the General Assembly and state Senate passed three bills designed to strengthen public trust and safety in immigrant communities across the Garden State, and to protect them from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and roundups.

To become law, the legislation must be signed by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy before he leaves office Jan. 20. New Jersey has the second-largest immigrant population in the country after California.

The Safe Communities Act requires the state attorney general to develop a plan for how sensitive locations such as public schools, health care facilities and houses of worship would interact with federal immigration authorities without deterring community members from seeking services or engaging with them.

The act mandates that the commissioners of Community Affairs, Children and Families, Health, Human Services, Education and Corrections, as well as the administrative director of the courts, adopt the attorney general’s model policies, or policies to provide greater protection for community members, and to prominently display them in public-facing areas.

The Privacy Protection Act limits the collection and sharing of data by federal government and health care entities to ensure that Jersey residents are not discouraged from seeking necessary services.

The third measure codifies the attorney general’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which draws a clear distinction between state, county and local law enforcement officers — who are responsible for enforcing state criminal law — and federal immigration authorities, including ICE, who enforce federal civil immigration law. The bill limits the voluntary assistance that state law enforcement officers may provide to federal authorities. The directive, which is designed to foster trust between police and community members, has withstood legal challenges by state and federal courts since it was issued in 2018.

All three bills were championed by state Sens. Pat Diegnan, Gordon Johnson, John McKeon, Raj Mukherji, Teresa Ruiz, Britnee Timberlake and Andrew Zwicker, and state Reps. Joe Danielsen, Verlina Reynolds-Jackson, Ellen Park, Eliana Pintor Marin and Gabriel Rodriguez.

Immigrants rights groups and organizations cheered passage of the legislation on Monday.

Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, in a statement called the trio of bills “a hard-earned victory for efforts to free ourselves from the tyranny of mass detention and deportation.” She said as the legislation moves to the governor’s desk, “New Jersey is one step closer to becoming a place where fear no longer dictates people’s lives.”

“These bills strengthen limits on local cooperation with ICE, including a major improvement: ending collaboration based solely on a final order of removal,” said Katy Sastre, executive director of First Friends of New Jersey and New York, in a statement. “That will help keep families together.”

Nedia Morsy, director of Make the Road New Jersey, said in a statement that communities no longer can trust the federal government to keep them safe.

“The murder of Renee Nicole Good is all the proof we need that ICE is a threat to all of us,” she said. “That’s why legislation like this is so important.”

Hazel Applewhite, CEO of the Ironbound Community Corporation, said in a statement that the fear of ICE raids keeps many families in Newark’s Ironbound neighborhood from accessing the services they rely on.

“From children missing school to seniors and survivors avoiding essential support,” she said, “this legislation allows families to safely get the help they need and ensures our neighborhoods can rebuild and remain connected.”

“We are Jersey brave, and we chose to love our neighbors, because that’s what faithful people do when fear is loud,” said Charlene Walker, executive director of Faith in New Jersey. “We grieve what this victory cannot repair: the lives already shattered, and the loss of Jean Wilson Brutus, whose name we will not let be forgotten.”

During legislative debate, several Republicans voiced opposition to the three bills, saying they protected criminals and ignored the rights of New Jersey residents.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/police-ice-agent-file.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 01:57:07.234812

The raids and protests continue across the country, including in Southern California.

Social media posts on Monday alerted residents to ICE activity around Los Angeles, including near the Eagle Rock Plaza.

Residents in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood said an immigration arrest occurred on Friday. Video of the incident shows a person on the ground being placed in handcuffs.

A woman who asked that her face and name not be shared said the man seen being taken away by immigration agents is her godfather, Rafael.

She and other neighbors say Rafael has been a fixture in the neighborhood for about 40 years, collecting recyclables and doing handyman work.

She noted that family and neighbors have hope that Rafael will be OK as they try to secure an attorney for him.

The goddaughter said Rafael saw immigration agents chasing two other men, became scared and ran. Rafael was the one who was caught and taken into custody.

Over the weekend in Downey, immigration agents detained nearly a dozen people. In a written statement to Eyewitness News, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, ""On January 10, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) conducted a targeted immigration operation in Downey, California, resulting in the arrest of 11 illegal aliens from Mexico and El Salvador that have all broken the immigration laws of the nation.""

In another incident in Downey, video shows the attempted detention of two landscapers.

Witnesses say two landscapers were confronted and grabbed by what appears to be immigration agents as they tried to take them into custody. As neighbors began to come outside, the landscapers were released, and the agents drove away.

In the video, an agent inside a car was seen pointing a gas canister at people on the street who were filming.

Neighbors say one of the landscapers has a green card and has lived in the U.S. for 40 years. The other has a valid work permit that he was carrying with him at the time.

Eyewitness News spoke with Victor Correa, who shot cellphone video of the Downey arrests.

""Stay active. Be vigilant. Be an active witness. Create awareness. Don't be afraid to get up close. Now obviously, don't interfere, but make sure that you're trying to see why they're detaining them, if they have a warrant, ask the people what their name is. Because if they are detained, we want to get their information so we can pass it along to their families. We don't want this happening anymore in our city,"" Correa said.

In a statement, Downey councilmember Mario Trujillo said the city was not given any warning that immigration agents were coming in this weekend, and he noted that city police are not helping immigration agents.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18393368_011226-kabc-local-ice-arrests-tn-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-12 23:57:22.951951

That push – accentuated by the outrage over a Minnesota woman being killed by an ICE officer this week – will probably mean more protests and potentially more violence against journalists.

Gabe Rottman, vice-president of policy for the Reporters Committee, said the confrontations also occur because DHS officers do not receive enough training on how to interact with journalists.
“Should disputes arise over ICE treatment of journalists … it will behoove us to have tried.”","After a year in which US journalists faced a dramatic increase in violence from law enforcement, news organizations and advocacy groups have recently tried to better protect reporters through outreach to the Department of Homeland Security.

Over the last four months, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a collection of New York news outlets have sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security attempting to open dialogue to reduce confrontations between law enforcement officers and journalists at protests, especially over efforts to deport alleged undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration recently announced that it hired thousands of new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and will escalate operations this year as part of its deportation efforts that DHS is coordinating.

That push – accentuated by the outrage over a Minnesota woman being killed by an ICE officer this week – will probably mean more protests and potentially more violence against journalists. It’s unclear if the messages to the DHS will help keep journalists safe.

“We don’t know if ICE is going to step up its immigration efforts in New York – that depends on a lot of political factors – but we certainly have seen it happen [elsewhere], and the way ICE has conducted itself in those cities gives some cause for concern that not having those channels of communication is bad for everybody,” said Carroll Bogert, CEO of the City, a New York news outlet, who wrote a letter in December to DHS officials.

The Freedom of the Press Foundation tracks arrests and assaults against journalists and found that last year there were 172 alleged assaults against journalists, most from law enforcement at protests concerning the administration’s immigration policies. From 2022 to 2024, there were 175 alleged assaults.

The foundation states that it only reports “incidents that can be verified by first-person accounts or cross-referenced by multiple news sources”.

Part of that increase is, of course, because there have simply been more protests.

Gabe Rottman, vice-president of policy for the Reporters Committee, said the confrontations also occur because DHS officers do not receive enough training on how to interact with journalists.

That includes instructions on enforcing a dispersal order, Rottman said.

“It’s crucial that officers be trained to permit journalists to remain on the scene even when they are issuing a dispersal order,” Rottman said. “The law enforcement response needs to be tailored to the unlawful activity that’s occurring, and if journalists are on the side not obstructing police operations, then as a first amendment matter, they may have a right to remain.”

Also, whereas the Department of Justice has news media guidelines, the DHS does not, Rottman said.

In 2024 the justice department worked with the Reporters Committee to establish recommendations on police and media interactions at mass demonstrations. These include directives that journalists wear credentials and that law enforcement allow the media to “position themselves in a safe location” and only clear the area when necessary for public safety.

“Even if there is cause for the detention, when the journalist says, ‘I’m press, I’m press,’ the officer [should be] trained to give the journalist a chance to establish that they are, in fact, journalists and then let them go,” Rottman said.

Ryanne Mena, a Southern California News Group reporter, was struck with a pepper-ball bullet allegedly fired by a DHS agent while covering a protest in Los Angeles. A day later at a protest, another DHS officer allegedly fired a rubber bullet that struck her in the head and caused a concussion.

Both times, Mena wore press credentials.

She and others filed a lawsuit against DHS to prevent officers from “using unnecessary and excessive violence to prevent them from exercising their first amendment rights”.

A federal judge issued a temporary injunction in September, ruling that DHS officers cannot legally disperse anyone “they know or reasonably should know is a journalist” without probable cause to believe that the person committed a crime “unrelated to failing to obey a dispersal order”.

“Under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protesters, legal observers and journalists,” the judge stated.

The DHS appealed, claiming that the measure to protect journalists from dispersals could “expose officers to someone who wishes to harm them or damage federal property just by wearing fraudulent press credentials”.

In October, the Reporters Committee sent the letter to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, seeking a meeting and asking the agency to adopt an “arrest avoidance” policy like the justice department.

“By making supervisory officials in the field immediately available to review the detention of individuals who present evidence of their identity as a journalist, law enforcement agencies avoid unnecessary conflict,” the letter states.

Last month, the City and seven other news organizations also sent a letter to the DHS. Questions included: “What are the agencies’ current training protocols regarding interactions with the press when enforcement activity is ongoing?”

The DHS did not respond to either letter, according to the senders.

When the Guardian asked the DHS about the letters, assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in an email, focused on dangers ICE officers face and claimed that there had been a 1,150% increase in assaults against them. The Los Angeles Times and National Public Radio both found that the increase was actually about 25%.

“We remind members of the media to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots and remind journalists that covering unlawful activities in the field does come with risks – though our officers take every reasonable precaution to mitigate those dangers to those exercising protected first amendment rights,” McLaughlin stated.

Immigration reporters will probably be busy this year.

“We’ve got 10,000 new ICE agents coming on board” and “morale is high”, Gregory Bovino, a border patrol official, told Fox News. “2026 is going to be huge.”

As such, will the outreach make any difference?

“I don’t want to sound naive, but I think it’s important to have made the effort,” Bogert, of the City, said. “Should disputes arise over ICE treatment of journalists … it will behoove us to have tried.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c61ddfac411162780af71f9bb47e602faea9c0/197_0_3879_3104/master/3879.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=495a7ed3768d1dd4d7384520387e1e50",N,,2026-01-12 23:57:26.292140

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says she's sending additional federal law enforcement agents to Minnesota.

LEILA FADEL, HOST:

Coming up, we'll speak with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey about his response to the move, which comes after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in his city last week. First, though, let's get the latest information on the deployment and on the protests this Minneapolis killing has sparked in the city and across the nation.

MARTÍNEZ: Joining us from Minneapolis is NPR's Jason DeRose. Jason, so OK - additional forces. What do we know about these forces that Noem is sending?

JASON DEROSE, BYLINE: Well, Noem says she's moving many more Homeland Security agents into Minnesota. Here she is speaking on Fox News Sunday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KRISTI NOEM: There'll be hundreds more, and in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely.

DEROSE: She says some have already arrived. Others will arrive today. But some elected officials here are pushing back against DHS actions, including U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar. She's demanding a full investigation into Renee Good's killing. Also, A, U.S. representatives had normally been allowed to visit ICE detention centers unannounced, but Omar says she was turned away over the weekend. Now, Homeland Security, according to a memo obtained by NPR, now says it requires elected officials to give seven days' notice to enter a detention center. So overall, as someone who knows the area and has been here for a few days, tensions are pretty high. You hear sirens and helicopters throughout the day and night, and people are really on edge.

MARTÍNEZ: That neighborhood where the shooting took place - I mean, how are people feeling there?

DEROSE: Well, there is a lot of fear there, but there's also a lot of care for neighbors. I want to play this piece of tape for you from a singing and walking vigil from Sunday afternoon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Singing) I am not afraid. I will stand for liberation 'cause I know...

DEROSE: Several hundred people gathered at a church not far from last week's killing and then walked about a mile loop around the neighborhood, singing to their neighbors to bring some comfort and encouragement. And as they walked, A, they stopped from time to time in places where ICE agents had detained people recently, and they kept a moment of silence at each of those places.

MARTÍNEZ: You know, there is a lot coming at Minneapolis right now - the killing of Renee Good, the larger immigration actions there. So tell us - I mean, you cover religion, Jason. What has been the response from communities of faith?

DEROSE: Well, you know, A, here in Minneapolis, people of faith have really taken the lead in working to counter what they believe to be unjust actions by the Trump administration around immigration enforcement. In a statement over the weekend, Renee Good's wife said that Renee was a Christian whose faith motivated her work. That's also true of Minneapolis resident Carol Hornbeck, a family therapist. She says she's been thinking a lot about a verse from the hymn ""How Firm A Foundation.""

CAROL HORNBECK: I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, and sanctify to thee thy deepest distress so that the hardest thing becomes holy.

DEROSE: Hornbeck says the idea that her resistance work is hard but holy is what's giving her strength and resolve right now.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, what are you going to be looking for in the next few days?

DEROSE: Well, as those additional federal agents arrive, I'll be looking to see what they're actually doing on the ground, and I'll be watching how community members who oppose ICE's presence respond to these increased federal forces. They've been patrolling neighborhoods and alerting people with whistles and chat groups about where ICE agents are. Will they continue to think that kind of work is enough, especially since ICE is now responding so aggressively, using pepper spray and, as of last week, deadly force?

MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Jason DeRose in Minneapolis. Jason, thanks.

DEROSE: You're welcome.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.
Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau.
Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration.
In the Louisiana case, Justice Department lawyers argued against lifting the hold, saying the Census Bureau was in the middle of planning for the 2030 census: “At this stage of such preparations, lifting the stay is not appropriate.”","The next U.S. census is four years away, but two lawsuits playing out this year could affect how it will be done and who will be counted.

Allies of President Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is used to determine congressional representation and how much federal aid flows to the states.

The challenges align with parts of Trump’s agenda even as the Republican administration must defend the agency in court.

A Democratic law firm is representing efforts to intervene in both cases because of concerns over whether the U.S. Justice Department will defend the bureau vigorously. There have been no indications so far that government attorneys are doing otherwise, and department lawyers have asked that one of the cases be dismissed.

As the challenges work their way through the courts, the Census Bureau is pushing ahead with its planning for the 2030 count and intends to conduct practice runs in six locations this year.

The legal challenges

America First Legal, co-founded by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, is leading one of the lawsuits, filed in Florida. It contests methods the bureau has used to protect participants’ privacy and to ensure that people in group-living facilities such as dorms and nursing homes will be counted.

The lawsuit’s intent is to prevent those methods from being used in the 2030 census and to have 2020 figures revised.

“This case is about stopping illegal methods that undermine equal representation and ensuring the next census complies with the Constitution,” Gene Hamilton, president of America First Legal, said in a statement.

The other lawsuit was filed in federal court in Louisiana by four Republican state attorneys general and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes illegal immigration and supports reduced legal immigration. The lawsuit seeks to exclude people who are in the United States illegally from being counted in the numbers for redrawing congressional districts.

In both cases, outside groups represented by the Democratic-aligned Elias Law Group have sought to intervene over concerns that the Justice Department would reach friendly settlements with the challengers.

In the Florida case, a judge allowed a retirees’ association and two university students to join the defense as intervenors. Justice Department lawyers have asked that the case be dismissed.

In the Louisiana lawsuit, government lawyers said three League of Women Voters chapters and Santa Clara County in California had not shown any proof that department attorneys would do anything other than robustly defend the Census Bureau. A judge has yet to rule on their request to join the case.

A spokesman for the Elias Law Group, Blake McCarren, referred in an email to its motion to dismiss the Florida case, warning of “a needlessly chaotic and disruptive effect upon the electoral process” if the conservative legal group were to prevail and all 50 states had to redraw their political districts.

Aligning with Trump’s agenda

The goals of the lawsuits, particularly the Louisiana case, align with core parts of Trump’s agenda, although the 2030 census will be conducted under a different president because his second term will end in January 2029.

During his first term, for the 2020 census, Trump tried to prevent those who are in the U.S. illegally from being used in the apportionment numbers, which determine how many congressional representatives and Electoral College votes each state receives. He also sought to have citizenship data collected through administrative records.

A Republican redistricting expert had written that using only the citizen voting-age population, rather than the total population, for the purpose of redrawing congressional and state legislative districts could be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Both Trump orders were rescinded when Democratic President Biden arrived at the White House in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released by the Census Bureau. The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In August, Trump instructed the U.S. Commerce Department to change the way the Census Bureau collects data, seeking to exclude immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Neither officials at the White House nor the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, explained what actions were being taken in response to the president’s social media post.

Congressional Republicans have introduced legislation to exclude noncitizens from the apportionment process. That could shrink the head count in both red and blue states because the states with the most people in the U.S. illegally include California, Texas, Florida and New York, according to the Pew Research Center.

The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment. The numbers also guide the distribution of $2.8 trillion in federal dollars to the states for roads, healthcare and other programs.

Defending the Census Bureau

The Louisiana lawsuit was filed at the end of the Biden administration and put on hold in March at the request of the Commerce Department. Justice Department lawyers representing the Cabinet agency said they needed time to consider the position of the new leadership in the second Trump administration. The state attorneys general in December asked for that hold to be lifted.

So far, in the court record, there is nothing to suggest that those government attorneys have done anything to undermine the Census Bureau’s defense in both cases, despite the intervenors’ concerns.

In the Louisiana case, Justice Department lawyers argued against lifting the hold, saying the Census Bureau was in the middle of planning for the 2030 census: “At this stage of such preparations, lifting the stay is not appropriate.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5e57d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4007x2104+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd8%2Fba%2F44a3757443bbba17c25f561849ee%2Fc9d0c9f94b1147e397eb973bcabab65e.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 21:11:46.701410

Jason Crow’s staff show the immigration detention center in Aurora is close to hitting its newly increased population capacity.

About 1,200 people were in custody at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility at the end of September. The facility recently increased its capacity from 1,360 to 1,530 detainees, and while Crow’s office did not get an exact number, ICE staff on Jan. 5 told Crow staff the facility was “slightly below capacity.”

Federal law gives members of Congress the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits of immigration detention facilities. Crow, an Aurora Democrat, attempted to visit the facility in July but was denied entry, prompting a lawsuit brought by Crow, Rep. Joe Neguse of Lafayette and other members of Congress.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s policy that requires at least a week’s notice for members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to Department of Homeland Security facilities. But after Minnesota lawmakers were denied access to an ICE facility in Minneapolis Saturday, Democrats asked the judge for an emergency hearing.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem implemented a new policy that requires seven days notice for lawmakers to conduct oversight visits, saying facilities funded through last year’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act do not need to comply with a 2019 appropriations law that allows for unannounced visits at facilities that hold immigrants.

The Jan. 5 report from Crow’s office says the Aurora facility’s segregated transgender pods were consolidated into one pod, which holds “a few transgender detainees.” Other transgender individuals were moved to the general population, the report says. It also says “grandfathered” transgender detainees continue to receive gender-affirming medical care at the facility.

Much of the information Crow’s office asked of ICE was not made available, and facility staff redirected his team to the ICE Office of Congressional Relations.

ICE did not respond to a request for information on the Aurora facility’s population, including the care available for transgender individuals.

The Aurora facility, privately run by The GEO Group for ICE, is the only ICE detention center in Colorado. Documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado show that the Trump administration contracted with The GEO Group in December to run another ICE detention center out of a dormant prison in Hudson.

Federal ‘occupation’ Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region.","SPRINGFIELD — Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration Monday, seeking to severely limit immigration agents’ authority in the state after accusing the feds of unleashing an “organized bombardment” to coerce state and local officials to change their immigration policies.

State and city leaders want to end the feds’ “roving patrol” policy of interrogating people they encounter on the street about their citizenship and immigration status without any probable cause. They’re also seeking to limit crowd control tactics such as using tear gas to disperse nonviolent crowds and to prevent the feds from scanning the biometric information of state residents.

“Border Patrol agents and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers.”

Raoul, along with the city of Chicago, filed the 103-page lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. It accused the federal government of applying pressure over policy differences through means such as withholding federal funds, attempting to deploy the National Guard and, most disruptively, executing an immigration enforcement operation described by state officials as “causing turmoil and imposing a climate of fear.”

It also seeks to prevent immigration enforcement at “sensitive locations” without “appropriate reasoning,” including courthouses, schools, social service organizations and medical facilities. And it seeks to bar immigration agents from “trespassing” on private property to make arrests, in violation of the 4th Amendment. The suit argues immigration agents only have the authority to do so within 25 miles of a U.S. Border to prevent illegal entry to the country.

The state is asking the court to find that the federal government’s “menacing, violent, and unlawful incursion” violates the 10th Amendment, and to order federal agents to stop using tactics that exceed their statutory authority.

‘Unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations’

Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement in support of the lawsuit, writing that “in the face of the Trump Administration’s cruelty and intimidation, Illinois is standing up against the attacks on our people.”

“Today, Illinois is once again taking Donald Trump to court to hold his administration accountable for their unlawful tactics, unnecessary escalations, and flagrant abuses of power,” Pritzker said.

The lawsuit names, among others, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino — the public face of DHS’ Operation Midway Blitz immigration enforcement campaign — as defendants.

Much of the lawsuit pulls from claims brought in an earlier suit by media organizations and protestors who challenged the feds’ use-of-force tactics. The plaintiffs motioned for the case to be reassigned to the same judge in that challenge, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, according to reporting by the Chicago Tribune and Sun-Times. Previously, she issued an injunction against use of force in that case, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals later stayed it.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois in a statement the latest suit was “baseless.”

“The fact is that sanctuary politicians in Illinois and Chicago released violent criminals including murderers, rapists, drug dealers, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists, onto its streets and their dereliction of duty cost lives—just ask Katie Abraham’s father,” McLaughlin said, referring to a 20-year-old Glenview woman who was killed in a hit-and-run crash last year allegedly by a Guatemalan in the country without legal authorization. “This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.”

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a similar lawsuit Monday seeking to block a surge of immigration enforcement in that state. It comes less than a week after an ICE agent shot 37-year-old American citizen Renee Nicole Good at close range while she was apparently attempting to flee a traffic stop.

‘Campaign of coercion’

The Illinois lawsuit claims that Midway Blitz is part of a “campaign of coercion” by the Trump administration attempting to force state and local governments, including Illinois and the city of Chicago, to change their sanctuary immigration policies.

The state’s TRUST Act, signed by then-Gov. Bruce Rauner in 2017, generally prohibits state and local law enforcement from assisting the federal government with immigration enforcement unless a federal criminal warrant is presented.

Chicago has had “sanctuary city” status since 1985.

The state and federal policies are meant to foster trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by ensuring that interactions do not result in immigration detention or deportation. But these policies, which predominate in the nation’s blue states and blue cities, have been the target of ire from the Trump administration, which has accused state and local jurisdictions of impeding their mass deportation goals.

Trump sued Illinois, Chicago and Cook County last year seeking to invalidate the state and local policies, but the challenge was dismissed by a federal judge in July, who found that they were protected under the 10th Amendment.

Federal ‘occupation’

Just six weeks after losing in court, DHS began its sweeping immigration enforcement campaign targeting the Chicago region. The department claims that it has resulted in the arrests of more than 4,500 immigrants in the country without legal authorization.

But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview.

Confrontations initiated by immigration officers resulted in two shootings, including one with deadly consequences, during the height of Midway Blitz. An ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park in September after he attempted to flee a traffic stop. In October, a federal agent shot Marimar Martinez five times in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood. She survived and the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago has dropped all charges against her.

Characterizing it as a federal “occupation” of a sovereign state, the suit accuses the feds of sending armed immigration agents to roam city streets to question people about their citizenship status, capture and retain biometric data without consent, arrest people without a warrant or probable cause and deploy tear gas and other chemical agents in residential neighborhoods and trespass on private property — all while concealing their identities with face masks and covering up license plates.

The suit includes a laundry list of documentation, alleging, for instance that federal agents deployed tear gas and other chemicals without warning at least 49 times in 18 separate incidents in Chicago over a 90-day period in 2025.

And following the launch of a “plate watch” hotline in late October, at least thirty-five distinct license plates were reported being swapped or used on more than one federal vehicle operated by Border Patrol or ICE, according to the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, which sent a “cease and desist” letter to DHS in October over the practice.

Return of Midway blitz?

While Midway Blitz has wound down in recent weeks, federal officials have been teasing a return with even larger numbers of agents in March. The filing includes Bovino stating, “Don’t call it a comeback; we’re gonna be here for years.”

The state is asking the court to bar Border Patrol agents from conducting civil immigration enforcement in Illinois, arguing that they are “not authorized or trained for large-scale removal enforcement in the interior of the United States.”

It’s also asking a judge to declare that tactics such as roving patrols, warrantless arrests, deploying tear gas and swapping plates, at least in this context, are in violation of federal law. The plaintiffs want those tactics barred in the future.

The lawsuit is just the latest in a litany of litigation between the state and federal government. Raoul has filed or joined in more than four-dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration over the past year, challenging everything from cuts to congressionally appropriated state funding to Trump’s now-aborted push to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago over the strenuous objections of Illinois’ elected leaders.

Actions like those, Raoul alleged in the latest lawsuit, are part of the Trump administration’s “coercion” campaign.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court preventing the deployment of troops in Illinois. The underlying case Is still working through the courts, though Trump late last month dropped plans to deploy troops to American cities.

The federal government filed a lawsuit earlier this month challenging a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated. Like the latest lawsuit, the case largely rests on the 10th Amendment.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7c0da8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1140x599+0+81/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F17%2F6a%2Fe9bad3274999b773cad48a12ef41%2Fcni-lawsuit-1-12-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 21:11:56.663333

“DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas.
“My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said.","The Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, announced a lawsuit on Monday against the federal government, seeking to end the surge of ICE agents in the state.

The lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials comes in the aftermath of an ICE agent fatally shooting resident Renee Nicole Good behind the wheel of her vehicle last week, leading to protests across the city, and country.

“We allege that DHS’ use of excessive and lethal force, their warrantless, racist arrests, their targeting of our courts, our churches, houses of worship and schools, our violation of the administrative procedures act on arbitrary and capricious federal actions. And we ask that the courts will end the surge of thousands of DHS agents in Minnesota.”

“The deployment of thousands of armed DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm. This is in essence a federal invasion of the Twin Cities and Minnesota, and it must stop,” Ellison said during a press conference, noting the shutdown of schools and the closure of local businesses. “This surge has made us less safe.”

A motion for a temporary restraining order will be filed today ahead of the lawsuit, said assistant attorney general Brian Carter.

Ellison described the federal agents as poorly trained, and contrasted them with the training of Minneapolis police, noting that local police have had to respond to 20 instances of ICE agents’ apparent abduction of Minneapolis residents.

“They’re making unconstitutional arrests and using excessive force,” Ellison said. “DHS agents have barged into restaurants, asking to access secure areas. And when asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they respond, ‘We don’t need one.’ This has to stop. Let’s be clear; this should have never started.”

In the press conference, AC Thompson of PBS Frontline asked if the lawsuit aimed at restraining the use of crowd control weapons. “My whole crew got pepper sprayed today by federal agents,” Thompson said. “Are you aiming to do anything about them?”

Ellison encouraged Thompson to file a complaint and “make sure people know what happened to you and your crew … The press is protected by the first amendment and is vitally important in this moment when freedom of the press and every first amendment right is under a threat.”

Ellison noted that Minnesota’s noncitizen immigrant population is just 1½ percent, “which is half the national average. Our state’s percentage is lower than Utah, Texas, and Florida’s,” he said, suggesting that the Trump administration has targeted Minnesota out of political bias.

Ellison also alluded to Minnesota and its Somali immigrant population coming under vitriolic attacks from the White House and rightwing media after a series of social services fraud cases drew conservative attention in recent weeks.

“Donald Trump doesn’t seem to like our state very much,” Ellison added.

The Twin Cities’ response to a surge of thousands of federal agents has taxed the law enforcement capacity of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, each of which has about 600 police officers, said Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis.

“We don’t use the word invasion lightly,” he said. “The stated reason of this federal government for bringing in this full invasion of ice and border control is not safety. If it were safety, there would be other mechanisms to achieve safety.

“If this were about fraud, then you’d see an invasion perhaps of accountants. But that’s not what you see. What you see is people being indiscriminately taken off our streets.”

Kaohly Her, mayor of Saint Paul and a Hmong-American immigrant, also spoke at the conference and said she was now carrying her passport card and ID with her all the time.

“Because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained,” she said. “When I’m going to be approached, the fact is that the tactics don’t even at this point really matter right? It’s the fact that we are being attacked as American citizens right now.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7bc3582438a7018ee6707c3f4b655dd67290f4/83_0_4472_3577/master/4472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=418d3fe6e0a494a5f4126a455a043eee",N,,2026-01-12 21:56:51.763365

In December, those members of Congress won their lawsuit challenging a Department of Homeland Security policy from June that required a week’s notice from lawmakers before an oversight visit. Now they’re accusing Homeland Security of having “secretly reimposed” the requirement last week.

In a Jan. 8 memorandum, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote that “Facility visit requests must be made a minimum of seven (7) calendar days in advance. Any requests to shorten that time must be approved by me.”

The lawmakers who challenged the policies are led by Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) and include five members from California: Reps. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles), Raul Ruiz (D-Indio) and Norma Torres (D-Pomona).

Last summer, as immigration raids spread through Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California, many Democrats including those named in the lawsuit were denied entry to local detention facilities. Before then, unannounced inspections had been a common, long-standing practice under congressional oversight powers.

“The duplicate notice policy is a transparent attempt by DHS to again subvert Congress’s will...and this Court’s stay of DHS’s oversight visit policy,” the plaintiffs wrote in a federal court motion Monday requesting an emergency hearing.

On Saturday, three days after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, three members of Congress from Minnesota attempted to conduct an oversight visit of an ICE facility near Minneapolis. They were denied access.

Afterward, lawyers for Homeland Security notified the lawmakers and the court of the new policy, according to the court filing.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs wrote that “rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

“This is unacceptable,” they said. “Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will.”

Congress has stipulated in yearly appropriations packages since 2020 that funds may not be used to prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens.”

That language formed the basis of the decision last month by U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, who found that lawmakers cannot be denied entry for visits “unless and until” the government could show that no appropriations money was being used to operate detention facilities.

In her policy memorandum, Noem wrote that funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which supplied roughly $170 billion toward immigration and border enforcement, are not subject to the limitations of the yearly appropriations law.

“ICE must ensure that this policy is implemented and enforced exclusively with money appropriated by OBBBA,” Noem said.

Noem said the new policy is justified because unannounced visits pull ICE officers away from their normal duties. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions,” she wrote.

The lawmakers, in the court filing, argued it’s clear that the new policy violates the law.

“It is practically impossible that the development, promulgation, communication, and implementation of this policy has been, and will be, accomplished — as required — without using a single dollar of annually appropriated funds,” they wrote.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a51b352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4876x2560+0+346/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F12%2Ff1119cbb464781ce238f7421b35a%2F1509457-la-me-protest-raids-jja-0015.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 20:57:12.159838

""And creates more, seems like more of a kind of a political conflict of all the appropriations bills.""","The Senate took its first step toward averting a government shutdown, but there’s still a long way to go on an increasingly shorter path to keep the lights on in Washington, D.C.

Lawmakers advanced a $174 billion, three-bill package through its first procedural hurdle on Monday evening with an 81-14 vote, teeing up a vote to send the tranche of funding bills, known as a minibus, to President Donald Trump’s desk later this week.

The package, which easily sailed through the House last week, similarly cruised through the key test vote on a wave of bipartisan support — a sign that neither party wants to thrust the government into another shutdown just months after the longest closure in history.

HOUSE PASSES NEARLY $180B FUNDING PACKAGE AFTER CONSERVATIVE REBELLION OVER MINNESOTA FRAUD FEARS

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., noted that Senate Democrats weren’t looking for another shutdown last week and said that ""Democrats want to fund the appropriations, the spending bills, all the way through 2026.""

""We want to work in a bicameral, bipartisan way to do it and the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us,"" Schumer told ABC Sunday morning.

While the successful procedural vote acted as a good sign for final passage of the package, it doesn’t mean that lawmakers are completely out of the woods when it comes to preventing another shutdown.

They have until Jan. 30 to fund the rest of the government, and some in the Senate believe that they won’t have time to finish their work before the deadline. That means another continuing resolution (CR) will likely be in the cards.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said a short-term funding bill is inevitable.

DEMOCRATS' LAST-MINUTE MOVE TO BLOCK GOP FUNDING PLAN SENDS LAWMAKERS HOME EARLY

He noted that, so far, the Senate has only passed three funding bills. If the latest package is successful, that would put lawmakers at the halfway mark of the dozen bills needed to avert a shutdown.

""Of course there's gonna be a short-term CR,"" Kennedy said. ""There's gonna be a CR, it's just a question of how big is the CR going to be?""

There is another, smaller funding package that could soon make its way through the House. But the $77 billion two-bill bundle that includes funding legislation for Financial Services and National Security still won’t be enough to prevent a shutdown.

Notably, the package lacks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill, which was supposed to be included. That bill is a perennial headache for lawmakers and often acts as a lightning rod for political enmity.

""The DHS bill is always one of the most difficult ones,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said. ""And creates more, seems like more of a kind of a political conflict of all the appropriations bills.""

Following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minnesota last week, that political division reached another level.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, argued that what happened to Good ""has crystallized for the American people the real danger that exists out there in the way that ICE and [Customs and Border Protection] are operating.""

Ellison and the cities are also alleging that the federal agents are using unreasonable force against Minnesotans and arresting people without warrants, regardless of their immigration status and based on their perceived race — violations of the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

Illinois and the city of Chicago on Monday also filed a similar lawsuit against the Trump administration. Illinois is suing over allegedly unlawful tactics used by Customs and Border Protection and ICE agents in the state.

The Trump administration will likely fight the Minnesota and Illinois lawsuits.

Cities and states in the past have sued the Trump administration to stop the deployment of National Guard troops. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court left in place a ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that bars the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois.

But the high court has let immigration officials arrest people based on their appearance and what language they speak, with the court’s conservative super-majority consistently giving Trump wide latitude to exert executive power.

The Trump administration has said that fraud of public programs is a driving factor behind the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.

But Ellison said that stopping fraud is a pretext for the Trump administration to punish its political opponents.

“The real reason — it’s no secret. Donald Trump and his administration have been targeting people, cities and states that don’t agree with him politically,” Ellison said. “The Trump administration’s decision to target Minnesota and Twin Cities is motivated by a desire to retaliate against Trump’s perceived political opponents.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 19:57:59.478573

On Jan. 8, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a new, nearly identical policy reinstating the seven-day notice requirement for members of Congress to visit an immigration detention center.

On Jan. 8, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a new, nearly identical policy reinstating the seven-day notice requirement for members of Congress to visit an immigration detention center.

A dozen House Democrats, led by Neguse, are continuing to argue in federal court that the new policy violates federal law. Neguse and his colleagues originally filed a lawsuit in July against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arguing that they have a constitutional duty to conduct oversight on how funds appropriated by Congress are spent.

“In December, a federal court acted to restore members of Congress’s ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people,” Neguse and his colleagues said in a statement. “Now, rather than comply with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

The new policy came days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis. Media reports have identified the woman as Renée Good, a U.S. citizen and 37-year-old mother of three who was born in Colorado.

Despite the federal judge’s order temporarily blocking the earlier policy, Neguse and his colleagues said they were only notified of the new policy after three members of Congress from Minnesota attempted to conduct oversight of an immigration detention facility near Minneapolis.

“This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly,” Neguse and his colleagues said. “It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, comes days after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good in her car as she blocked the road.

State Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a press conference that federal agents during the surge have arrested peaceful bystanders, detained U.S. citizens and fired chemical irritants at demonstrators and others exercising their First Amendment rights, including outside a local high school. The lawsuit calls on the Trump administration to end its immigration crackdown in the state.

""Thousands of armed and masked DHS agents have stormed the Twin Cities to conduct militarized raids and carry out dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional stops and arrests in sensitive public places, including schools and hospitals—all under the guise of lawful immigration enforcement,"" the lawsuit says. The complaint also alleges that immigration agents have engaged in racial profiling.

In a statement, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Ellison of ""prioritizing politics over public safety,"" and called the allegations of racial profiling false, saying, ""Law enforcement uses 'reasonable suspicion' to make arrests, as protected under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.""

""President Trump's job is to protect the American people and enforce the law — no matter who your mayor, governor, or state attorney general is,"" McLaughlin said. ""That's what the Trump administration is doing; we have the Constitution on our side on this, and we look forward to proving that in court.""

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are in Minnesota, and that number is expected to increase.

On Monday, an NPR reporter witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people about their immigration status. Some took place in the parking lots of big box stores.

""Are you a green card holder? Do you have it on you?""

Those were some of the questions federal immigration agents asked Joel Keleekai as he was charging his Tesla in a parking lot.

It's unclear why U.S. Border Patrol agents chose to question Keleekai and other drivers who were also charging their vehicles. All of them were people of color. All of them were able to prove they were in the U.S. legally after showing documentation.

Keleekai, who is a permanent U.S. resident, told NPR he knew this could happen given the number of immigration agents in the state and the amount of time he spends driving every day.

""We don't want this to escalate. As you see, ICE is going around and people are getting killed,"" he said. ""We just gotta do our best out here to make sure that we live to see tomorrow.""

In a statement, DHS's McLaughlin said, ""ICE does not randomly arrest people or conduct operations without specific objectives. Nor does federal law enforcement execute operations without undergoing proper procedure, such as securing warrants when necessary.""

These tactics are highly unusual. In the past, immigration enforcement agencies had focused on targeted operations. But the Trump administration has appeared to have shifted its tactics and, in Minnesota, become even more aggressive with its immigration crackdown.

Vice President JD Vance said in a press conference recently that immigration agents were also going door to door in an attempt to find undocumented immigrants.

The Trump administration's efforts are receiving fierce backlash from local public officials, and people in Minneapolis.

Residents are organizing in group chats and trailing immigration agents, honking their horns and making noise, alerting their neighbors of ICE's presence and migrants of their rights.

In a separate incident witnessed by an NPR reporter, a man who was on his way to work was briefly detained and asked questions about his legal status.

The man asked NPR to identify him by his initials of M.A. because he fears for his safety for speaking to the media. He said he was born in Somalia, but is a U.S. citizen. He was released by immigration agents.

""I know my rights here — I'm a U.S. citizen, I'm legal here, I've been over 25 years here,"" M.A. said.

Things seemed chaotic Monday in the Minneapolis region. Immigration agents could be seen in many places driving in unmarked vehicles.

A particularly tense exchange happened Monday afternoon in South Minneapolis. Immigration officers in a vehicle rear-ended a resident's car.

An NPR reporter was on the scene shortly after the incident and could see the rear left side of the car damaged.

The driver, Christian Molina, told NPR he and his wife Lorena, both U.S. citizens, were driving separate cars on their way to drop one off with a mechanic when he saw immigration agents engaging with another person.

Molina said he stared at them before they started chasing him.

""They don't have a reason to stop me, they are not the police,"" Molina said in Spanish.

After federal agents ran into his vehicle, Molina said the agents kept asking him about his immigration status. He refused to give them an identification;Molina told the federal agents he would only give his drivers license if Minneapolis Police officers showed up.

Molina said the federal agents left after running his license plate and confirming his identity.

Lorena, the wife, said she felt scared.

""I felt like I had the need to talk to the officers and say, 'Hey, please ignore whatever he's saying, let him live!'"" she said.

Christian Molina said he is not afraid of immigration agents.

""They are abusing their power,"" Molina said.

Trump administration increases migrant detentions, aims for more deportations

DHS says death rate aligns with historic norms amid rising detentions

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Four migrants died while in custody of U.S. immigration authorities over the first 10 days of 2026, according to government press releases, a loss of life that followed record detention deaths last year under President Donald Trump.

The deaths included two migrants from Honduras, one from Cuba and another from Cambodia, and occurred from January 3-9, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Trump administration aims to ramp up deportations and has increased the number of migrants in detention. As of January 7, ICE statistics showed that the agency was detaining 69,000 people. The numbers were expected to rise following a massive ICE funding infusion passed by the U.S. Congress last year.

At least 30 people died in ICE custody in 2025, the highest level in two decades, agency figures showed.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, called the high number of deaths ""truly staggering"" and urged the administration to shutter detention centers.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the rate of deaths had remained in step with historic norms as the detention population has climbed.

“As bed space has expanded, we have maintained (a) higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens — including providing access to proper medical care,"" McLaughlin said.

The Cuban detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration on the grounds of Fort Bliss in Texas.

ICE said it was investigating the death of Lunas, adding that officials said he had become disruptive and placed him in isolation. Officials later found him in distress, and emergency medical technicians pronounced him dead, ICE said.

The two Honduran men - Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, and Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, 68 - died in area hospitals in Houston and Indio, California, on January 5 and 6, respectively, both following heart-related issues, ICE said.

Parady La, a Cambodian man, 46, died on January 9 following severe drug withdrawal symptoms at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, ICE said. The administration began using that space last year, it said.

The Trump administration has greatly reduced the number of migrants released from detention on humanitarian grounds, a move critics say has driven some to accept deportation.

In addition to the in-custody deaths, an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota mother of three last week, an incident that sparked protests in Minneapolis and cities around the country.

Reports on the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy.","WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has threatened to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over Congressional testimony he gave last summer about a Fed building project, an action Powell called a ""pretext"" to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy.

The development in the long-simmering effort by President Donald Trump for greater control over the Fed had immediate fallout, with Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee that vets Presidential nominees for the Fed, saying in a statement on X that the threatened indictment puts the Department of Justice's ""independence and credibility"" in question. Tillis said he would oppose any Trump nominees to the Fed, including the president's coming choice of a new chair, ""until this legal matter is fully resolved.""

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

Powell revealed the subpoenas and threats in a Sunday night statement.

""On Friday, the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June,"" Powell said. ""I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law.""

""But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure"" for lower interest rates and more broadly for greater say over the Fed, he said.

""This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role...Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.""

Trump told NBC News Sunday that he had no knowledge of the Justice Department's actions. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” Trump said.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the case but added: “The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.”

POWELL INQUIRY A 'LOW POINT' IN TRUMP PRESIDENCY

Trump has demanded the Fed cut rates sharply since resuming office in January, blaming its policy for holding back the economy and musing about firing Powell despite the legal protections ostensibly covering the Fed chair from removal. He is also trying to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in a case that is now pending before the Supreme Court.

The independence of central banks, at least in setting interest rates in order to control inflation, is considered a central tenet of robust economic policy, insulating monetary policymakers from short-term political considerations and allowing them to focus on longer-term efforts to keep prices relatively stable.

The inquiry into Powell “is a low point in Trump's presidency and a low point in the history of central banking in America,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “Congress did not design the Fed to reflect the president's daily fluctuations, and because the Fed has rebuffed President Trump's efforts to take the Fed down he is launching the full weight of American criminal law against its Chair.”

Financial markets reflected little change in near-term expectations for Fed policy even after Powell's term as chair ends in May, with rate-futures continuing to price in two rate cuts for the year.

The dollar fell and U.S. equity futures slid on the latest news, but the moves were relatively modest so far.

LATEST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES MARK TURNING POINT?

The subpoenas and statement by Powell mark a stark shift in the now longstanding battle between Trump and Powell. Trump elevated Powell to the chair's job during his first term, but quickly soured on him and made his opinions clear in a series of rebukes and threats.

Powell, for his part, had largely eschewed comment on the president's actions or statements, instead acknowledging that chief executives often express opinions about a variety of issues, and pledging, as he did in the Sunday statement, to ""continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do.""

However, the Trump administration's latest moves, coming within months of the end of Powell’s term as chair in May, appear to have marked a turning point, with Powell directly accusing the administration of using the legal system to try to achieve its goal of getting the Fed to lower interest rates further and faster than the central bank's body of 19 policymakers feels is appropriate.

While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he has the right to continue on the Fed board until January 31, 2028, depriving the president of an additional Fed appointment - what would be Trump's fourth on the seven-member board - until near the end of his term.

The White House began early last year criticizing the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two of its buildings in Washington, describing it as overly costly and ostentatious.

Some analysts at the time did call it a pretext for the Trump administration's pressure campaign for lower interest rates, but Powell did not. The Fed chair instead posted detailed explanations of the work on the central bank's website and sent letters to members of the Trump administration providing background.

In June, when Powell gave his usual twice-yearly testimony on monetary policy to Congress, he was asked repeatedly about the work, which he explained as being necessary updates to outdated infrastructure. In July Trump made a rare presidential visit to the site, and Powell gave him a tour.

Larson (CT-01) released the following statement after House passage of S. 269(link is external), bipartisan legislation that allows the Department of Treasury’s Do Not Pay system to use the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) death records in order to help stop erroneous payments to deceased individuals. After today’s passage, the bill goes to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

Importantly, the bill contains a provision to prevent the Social Security Administration from meddling with death records to target residents.

At the time, Ranking Member Larson decried this abuse of power and called on Congress to act. S. 269 adds explicit protections to the law to prohibit SSA from recording a death unless the individual is actually deceased.

“For months, I have sounded the alarm about threats to Americans’ private data,” said Larson. “It is not just external bad actors we have to fear. It is the Trump Administration itself. They are the ones responsible for wreaking havoc on people’s lives by cutting off their access to financial systems and housing applications.

“It really is astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law — which is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause — and then go right back to federalizing every state responsibility possible when they get back in power. Spare us,” McLaughlin said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F10%2F91%2F96a05c94457a8339558bc650e126%2Faptopix-immigration-enforcement-minnesota-75458.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 18:58:16.488208

The Boy Scouts organization, now called Scouting America, said after the court's action on Monday that it can now continue compensating abuse survivors and improving its scouting programs without the cloud of bankruptcy and litigation.

""When you're in bankruptcy, you don't do a lot of investment in anything but getting out of bankruptcy,"" Scouting America CEO Roger Krone said in an interview.

The Supreme Court turned away an appeal by 75 plaintiffs of a lower court's decision rejecting their claim that the bankruptcy deal ‌improperly prevented them from suing other organizations that were partly liable for the abuse.

The settlement already has paid about $300 million ​to abuse survivors, and work will resume on claims evaluation and payment now that the appeals are over, Krone said. Scouting America's settlement trustee, Barbara Houser, is working to add more funds to the total settlement by suing insurers and selling assets belonging to the organization that include paintings by Norman ‍Rockwell and Joseph Csatari.

""For the survivors who are worried about there being adequate funds, there are significantly more funds that will be available to the trustee than the $2.46 billion that she has today,"" Krone said.

Outside of bankruptcy, Scouting America also has worked to modernize its scouting programs and improve safety for the digital age by taking steps such as updating ⁠its training to prevent online predation and introducing more modern reporting tools such as an anonymous text hotline for abuse allegations, Krone said.

Joshua Schwartz, a ‍lawyer whose law firm Eisenberg, Rothweiler, Winkler, Eisenberg & Jeck is co-counsel to more than 9,500 Boy Scouts abuse survivors, said the Supreme Court's decision will allow the settlement trust ‌to access $1.65 ‌billion in funds that had been held in escrow during the appeal.

""Now that the appeals process is over, the plan of reorganization that was voted on and approved by survivors is no longer in jeopardy,"" Schwartz said.

An attorney representing the 75 petitioning abuse survivors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The settlement, reached in 2022 in bankruptcy court in Delaware, granted immunity from lawsuits to those organizations in exchange for contributions to the Boy Scouts bankruptcy settlement. ⁠The Supreme Court later ruled that bankruptcy ⁠courts lacked the power to ​wipe away lawsuits against organizations that contributed to settlements but did not file for bankruptcy themselves, but its decision did not apply retroactively to older cases like the Boy Scouts bankruptcy.

After a federal judge ruled against the plaintiffs, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.

Scouting America, as well as insurers and abuse survivors who ‍support the deal, had urged the Supreme Court not to take the case, arguing that upending the settlement would have devastating emotional and financial consequences.

The appeal was supported by other abuse survivors who did not join the petition to the Supreme Court. A group that said it represented 1,000 former Boy Scouts had urged the Supreme Court to take up the ​case and allow abuse survivors to have their day in court.

The Boy Scouts filed for ‍bankruptcy in 2020 after several U.S. states enacted laws allowing accusers to sue over decades-old abuse allegations, which led to a flood of new lawsuits.

The Supreme Court previously declined to halt the settlement ​in 2024, instead allowing the deal to move forward while the appeals proceeded in lower courts.

“They have carried out enforcement actions in schools, at hospitals, and in one horrific instance, shot and killed someone.","(NewsNation) — Minnesota is suing the Department of Homeland Security to stop the surge of immigration officers being sent to the state, Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Monday.

The lawsuit comes as the Department of Homeland Security is preparing to send 1,000 additional immigration officers to Minnesota, with hundreds expected to be deployed as soon as Monday, sources told NewsNation.

“We believe the Trump administration is targeting Minnesota because of our political views,” Ellison said, calling the lawsuit a First Amendment issue.

The state is filing a temporary restraining order and asking for immediate relief in court on Tuesday, officials said.

Ellison said the targeting of Minnesota is unconstitutional and a violation of federal law that has caused harm to the state. The lawsuit asks the court to end the surge of agents to the state.

“The deployment of thousands of masked agents to Minnesota has done our state harm,” he said.

Ellison noted the impact on schools and local businesses amid the surge, along with the impact on local law enforcement, who have had to deal with the aftermath of ICE operations rather than focus on other public safety concerns.

“When asked to present a warrant, which is required by law, they say we don’t need one,” Ellison said of the conduct of federal agents.

He pushed back on the Trump administration’s statements that deportations are targeting the worst of the worst, saying many of those arrested are not dangerous criminals. Ellison also pushed back on the idea that agents are there to help investigate fraud, noting that the state would accept the help of forensic accountants when it comes to combating fraud.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey joined Ellison to announce the lawsuit.

“What we are seeing right now is not normal immigration enforcement,” he said.

Frey pointed to videos he says show as many as 50 agents arresting one person, in what he called a disproportionate action. He pushed back on the administration’s justification for the agents, including public safety and fraud.

“If this were about fraud, you’d see perhaps an invasion of accountants,” Frey said.

In terms of fraud investigations, Ellison noted the fraud unit of his office was continuing to work on fraud investigations, acknowledging there is resource pressure, but said his office can “walk and chew gum” and is continuing fraud investigations along with fighting DHS actions.

Ellison and Frey called the actions political, noted that there are higher populations of people without documents in other states, including Florida, Texas and Utah, where there have not been similar actions.

“We will not stand idly by and let this happen,” said St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her. “We are fighting back in every way we can.”

She joined Ellison and Frey in condemning the actions and decrying the damage being done to Minnesota communities.

Noem rebukes Minnesota lawsuit

In a statement to X, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem rejected accusations by Minnesota’s Democratic leaders.

“For years, these corrupt, activist politicians have refused to protect Minnesotans and are now proposing illegal actions to keep their stranglehold on control and continue stealing from American citizens,” Noem wrote.

“We will root out this rampant fraud, we will arrest the criminal illegal aliens hurting Americans with impunity, and we will hold those who aid and abetted this criminality accountable.”

DHS has surged thousands of agents to Minnesota

There are already 2,000 agents in the North Star State responding to protests after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, a motorist who federal officials claim was trying to run over law enforcement.

But people contesting that narrative have taken to the streets in Minnesota — and across the nation. Lawmakers in Minnesota maintain Good was simply trying to leave the scene when Ross fatally shot her.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, barred from working alongside the FBI or accessing its evidence, was spotted at the scene of the shooting on Monday.

Local officials are helping “with the collection, cataloging and preservation of video or other evidence” related to the shooting, a bureau spokesperson said.

“What you are witnessing is part of that process and nothing more. The BCA is not conducting its own investigation,” the spokesperson continued.

Residents report ICE encounters on the street

Christian Molina told NewsNation he was taking his car to the mechanic when ICE hit his car to stop him.

“I took a left, and they turned the siren on, but I kept on going,” he said. “I took another left, and that’s when they hit my car.”

Molina, a U.S. citizen, said it didn’t feel safe in Minneapolis.

“They didn’t even run my plates. They saw me going back to the side, and they started chasing me for no reason,” he said. “That’s like an abuse of power. They can just pull up on anybody?”

After he was stopped, Molina said the officers ran his plates and released him.

Arrests ramp up as ICE presence interferes with schools

As of Monday, DHS has made more than 2,000 arrests since its “Operation Metro Surge” began in Minnesota. That’s up from 1,500 arrests three days prior, DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

Increased ICE presence has led to canceled classes and remote learning options, and Education Minnesota, a union representing K-12 teachers, has demanded that enforcement take place far away from schools.

At Roosevelt High School on Monday, roughly 700 of the 1,400 students participated in a walkout.

“Yesterday’s actions by ICE in Minnesota — including the shooting of a community member, the unjust detention of a Minnesota educator, and the use of pepper spray on students — are unconscionable in a civil society,” union president Monica Byron said last week.

Renee Good’s death sparks continued protests across US

The fallout from Good’s shooting death has expanded from Minnesota to other U.S. metros, with more than 1,000 protests in small towns and big cities over the weekend. One hotbed for demonstration — Portland, Oregon — is still reeling from its own shooting by federal agents.

A day after Good’s death, federal border agents shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland during a traffic stop. The federal government said the pair were linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, but protesters have challenged those claims and the agents’ use of force.

In Minnesota on Sunday, officers deployed several rounds of flash bangs, pepper spray bullets and tear gas canisters into a crowd of protesters after giving a final warning to disperse.

“We just got pepper-sprayed. I can feel it in the back of my throat. I know we’re saying bad words and we’re screaming insults, but we’re not here to fight, we’re not here to throw hands, we’re not here to shoot people like they are,” protester Caroline Wilson told NewsNation.

Law enforcement arrested multiple people in Minneapolis over the weekend as protesters called for ICE to leave the city.

ICE ‘never about safety’: Walz

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized ICE operations in his state following the announcement of the lawsuit against DHS.

“Over the last week, we’ve seen federal agents arresting, threatening, and using force against innocent bystanders,” he said, via X.

“They have carried out enforcement actions in schools, at hospitals, and in one horrific instance, shot and killed someone.

“Today, @AGEllison announced a lawsuit to end ICE’s aggressive and unconstitutional surge into Minnesota.

In December, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb stayed a DHS policy that required members of Congress to provide seven-days notice before visiting such a facility after the group of lawmakers filed suit, pointing to a provision of law that prohibits immigration officials from requiring advance notice for congressional tours.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Jan. 8 issued a memo reinstituting a seven-day notice requirement. Department officials provided this document to the court on Jan. 10, which was the same day that three House Democrats from Minnesota were denied entry to an immigration detention facility in Minneapolis.

The lawmakers’ attempted visit followed the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.

Noem in the memo argued that the new policy does not conflict with the judge’s order because she specified that funding for its implementation should only come from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which provided billions for ICE. The statutory requirement regarding congressional access to immigration detention facilities, on the other hand, is part of appropriations bills that annually fund agency operations.

She also criticized surprise congressional tours of ICE facilities.

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” the secretary wrote. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions.”

Attorneys from Democracy Forward and American Oversight, two nonprofits that are representing the members of Congress, however, contended that DHS hasn’t proven that it is only using One Big Beautiful Bill Act funding to implement the seven-day notice directive.

“DHS purports to be implementing this duplicate notice policy using a funding source other than annually appropriated funds, and therefore purports not to be subject to the limitations [regarding congressional oversight visits],” they wrote. “But, in light of the purposes of the relevant appropriations and the vast and varied scope of the costs that necessarily contribute to a policy like this at DHS, it is practically impossible that the development, promulgation, communication and implementation of this policy has been, and will be, accomplished — as required — without using a single dollar of annually appropriated funds.”

Dozens of agents and officers wearing tactical gear and masks covering their faces fired pepper balls and tear gas to disperse a growing crowd of protesters chanting “shame, shame, shame” and telling agents to “get the f--- out.”

The scene showed how tensions are flaring up in a community grappling with Good's death as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to deploy hundreds of additional federal officers to Minnesota this week amid nationwide outcry and protests.

“We’re sending more officers today, and tomorrow they’ll arrive. There will be hundreds more in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely,” Noem told Fox News.

The fatal shooting has aggravated tensions in Minneapolis and around the country and intensified scrutiny of federal government operations in the state.

Outside a growing makeshift memorial that sprouted on the exact spot where Good was shot, resident Mileesha Smith said, “I believe that my neighborhood is traumatized.

""We are hurting. We are mourning,” Smith said, describing fear and confusion among residents who were worried about what comes next amid an increase in immigration enforcement.

Community group chats alerted people near East 35th Street and Park Avenue of an incident involving immigration officers, Minneapolis residents at the scene told NBC News.

Crowds of observers quickly gathered at the intersection, blowing whistles and honking horns to warn others of the presence of Border Patrol agents at the intersection.

Minneapolis resident Maggie Wood was among them. She said that 20 minutes before she saw the alert on her community group chat, two immigrants approached her as she strolled around her neighborhood and thanked observers like her for the support.

“This is Minneapolis. We are here to support each other,” Wood said.

But on Monday afternoon, what initially started as an effort to monitor enforcement activity at the intersection turned into a protest, in which demonstrators were tear-gassed and pepper balls were used to break the crowds.

""I decided to not be a monitor anymore and just to be an active protester,"" Jamie Schwesmedl said.

Noem was clear that the operation in the state is now focused not just on finding immigration law breaches but also on tackling anti-ICE protesters.

“We’re going to continue to if they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that’s a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,” she said.

Separately, Noem defended her characterization of Good as a terrorist. Asked whether Good was, in fact, trying to flee, Noem said on CNN that video ""showed that this officer was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized it.""

Eyewitness videos show Good in her SUV on a suburban street in Minneapolis talking to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as her wife talks to officers outside the car. Video that appears to have been recorded on a cellphone belonging to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good, captures the moment he fires multiple rounds into the car just after it starts to move.

An eyewitness told NBC News last week that he was surprised to hear the shots and that he didn't think the car was going to hit anybody.

Minneapolis has become a key focus of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, driven by his dislike of local leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz; a years-old fraud scandal; and repeated derogatory comments about the local Somali population, which he has described as ""garbage.""

About 2,000 federal agents — more than three times the number of officers in the Minneapolis Police Department — have already deployed to the state.

Noem, Trump and other government figures have maintained that the ICE officer who shot Good was acting in self-defense and within the law.

Noem accused local leaders of corruption Sunday and said Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey were not cooperating, prompting the surge in ICE officers.

Walz said in the aftermath of the shooting that people shouldn't believe the government's ""propaganda machine,"" and Frey told NBC News on Sunday that the evidence contradicts the government's claims.

Both men have expressed doubts that the FBI investigation into the incident will have a fair outcome after local law enforcement officials were removed from the process.

Asked whether he believed deadly force was necessary, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Good was ""highly disrespectful of law enforcement"" and part of a group of ""professional agitators.""

NBC News contacted ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to request any further comment; neither agency had replied by the time of publication.

The state and cities filed a lawsuit in federal court on Monday, along with a request for a temporary restraining order to halt the enforcement action or limit the operation.

The Department of Homeland Security says it's surging more than 2,000 immigration officers into Minnesota, and that it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the city since the push began last month. ICE has called the Minnesota surge its largest enforcement operation ever.

The lawsuit alleges that Operation Metro Surge violates federal law because it's arbitrary and capricious, since it says other states aren't seeing commensurate crackdowns. And while the Trump administration says it's about fighting fraud, the lawsuit says ICE agents have no expertise in combatting fraud in government programs.

The lawsuit says the federal government is really targeting Minnesota over politics, which it says is a violation of the First Amendment.

Also, Monday federal officers fired tear gas to break up a crowd of whistle-blowing bystanders in Minneapolis who showed up to see the aftermath of a car crash involving immigration agents, just a few blocks from last week's fatal shooting.

It was another tense scene following the death of Renee Good on Jan. 7 and a weekend of more immigration enforcement sweeps in the Minneapolis area. There were dozens of protests or vigils across the U.S. to honor Good and passionately criticize the Trump administration's tactics.

Gov. Tim Walz and his wife Gwen visited the memorial to Good, 37, on the street where she was shot in the head and killed while driving her SUV.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly defended the immigration agent who shot her, saying Good and her vehicle presented a threat. But that explanation has been widely panned by Walz and others based on videos of the confrontation.

Christian Molina, a U.S. citizen who lives in Coon Rapids, said he was driving to a mechanic Monday when agents in another vehicle followed him, even turning on a siren.

Molina said his rear bumper was hit as he turned a corner. He refused to produce identification for the agents, saying he would wait for local police.

""I'm glad they didn't shoot me or something,"" Molina told reporters.

Standing near the mangled fender, he wondered aloud: ""Who's going to pay for my car?""

Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, federal authorities filed charges against a Venezuelan national who was one of two people shot there by U.S. Border Patrol on Thursday. The U.S. Justice Department said the man used his pickup truck to strike a Border Patrol vehicle and escape the scene with a woman.

They were shot and eventually arrested. Their wounds were not life-threatening. The FBI said there was no video of the incident, unlike the Good shooting.

Just 24 hours before Renee Good was shot to death inside her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, Chief O’Hara had warned that the combustible relationship between federal immigration officers and the residents of his city could end in tragedy.

He was right.

For today’s episode of “The Daily,” I spoke with Chief O’Hara about his experience with ICE in Minneapolis, which significantly changed in early December when the Trump administration began its immigration operation in the city. The presence of ICE agents, O’Hara told me, immediately complicated policing in a city where the relationship between the police and the community is notoriously difficult — the same city where, nearly six years ago, a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd, setting off a wave of national protests against police brutality. In the interview, Chief O’Hara describes how his department has tried to navigate the aggressive tactics of ICE agents — and the fallout from the shooting of Ms. Good.

This conversation was edited for clarity.

Chief O’Hara, thank you for making time for us on a Sunday.

Sure, thank you for having me.

The past 48 hours have been pretty extraordinary. There were these enormous protests. I believe you yourself ended up in the middle of one of them. What has this been like for you?

So, what happened was that we had a protest start outside a hotel where people believed federal law enforcement might be staying.

They believed ICE agents were staying there.

Right, exactly. During the course of that protest it sort of transitioned into an unlawful assembly. And a woman drove her car onto a sidewalk, and the police were called to respond. So while the police were there dealing with regular police work, suddenly they realized they had become surrounded by this crowd and were unable to drive out.

I was in the area with other police officers, and we quickly ran in to back the crowd out and make a path for the police car, and I think that may have contributed to emboldening an already unruly crowd. We quickly called more than 200 additional police officers, and then ultimately wound up placing 30 people under arrest for unlawful assembly and later releasing them.

But this is a situation that has been building up for several weeks. A lot of the disturbances and chaos that have been happening here, as a result of the manner in which some federal enforcement activity is happening, is requiring our officers to respond to situations and try and restore the peace — situations where oftentimes they themselves then become the target of people’s frustration.

The reason we’re talking to you specifically is because of what an ICE agent did in Minneapolis last week: shot and killed a Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. At this point, millions of people have watched the video of that shooting. But there was a lead up to it that a lot of us didn’t watch, and that was the arrival of a large number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents starting in early December.

So that’s where I want to begin. Take me back to that period for you as police chief. What was your understanding of why the president decided to send these agents to your city?

At the time, in early December, it seemed like the public messaging was largely political. And it was a result of a real problem that does exist in the state, and that is a problem with fraud. Dozens of people have been prosecuted by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney’s office here in Minnesota.

You’re referring to the fraud that had been specifically highlighted in the Somali community in Minneapolis, and I do want to talk about the president’s message when he decided to send specifically immigration officers to Minneapolis. He was pretty explicit about his thinking. In his mind, the Somali population in the city, which is sizable and well known — he said it was a community of troublemakers who should be deported. And I wonder what you made of that, and if it felt like that had been your experience as chief.

Well, I grew up in New York, and I was a police officer for over 20 years in Newark, New Jersey. But I had not known any Somali Americans until I moved to Minnesota.

And the Somali Americans that I have met here, including many of whom are police officers in this city, have been incredibly welcoming of me. So from a personal perspective it was just bizarre, because the overwhelming majority of people from that community are American citizens.

From a crime perspective, was anything the president was saying true?

Well, there is a real problem with fraud in this state, and unfortunately that is sort of lost now in all of this political rhetoric and extreme reactions that occur.

You’re drawing a distinction between fraud and traditional street crime.

Yeah. Those cases of fraud that were brought about led to dozens and dozens of prosecutions, which were led by the U.S. attorney’s office here in Minnesota, as well as the F.B.I.

Got it. So in your mind, was this planned deployment, specifically of the ICE agents that the president asked for — was it warranted?

I mean, there has been immigration enforcement conducted in Minnesota as long as there has been ICE. I think the problem is what gets lost in this is — it’s not necessarily about which laws are being enforced, it’s about how that enforcement is happening.

To the extent that there are well planned, preplanned, targeted enforcement against people who are violating the law — I think all of law enforcement can very clearly get behind that. But to the extent that things are being conducted that may not be well planned — using tactics that generally are not viewed as sound — that may unnecessarily endanger the lives of both law enforcement officers and the community.

So it sounds like for you, it’s not the fact of ICE coming, it’s the way that ICE came.

Correct.

Let’s talk about that. After the president deployed immigration agents to Minneapolis, how did their operations start to affect the police department that you run?

So we’ve just gotten a pretty dramatic increase in 911 calls from people in the community related to a lot of the street enforcement that’s happening. And it’s things like: People are being arrested, and their cars are left — sometimes left in the roadway, sometimes blocking the street, and in one case left when it wasn’t even placed in park and was rolling down the road. We had another time where there was a dog in the car, and they left the dog in car.

Wow.

Even this morning, we’ve gotten calls for individuals who were pepper-sprayed by ICE. It’s just a variety of calls that we then have to manage and triage that were not happening before.

And how does that sudden influx of 911 calls complicate your policing?

It complicates things because we remain significantly understaffed. This is the Minneapolis Police Department. The majority of the cops that worked here in 2020 have left. We remain one-third below what had been typical of staffing for the police department here today, while at the same time dealing with a much higher level of serious street crime than what had been normal in the past.

I mean, you’ve been talking around this, and I think we should just make this extremely explicit: that you become police chief in Minneapolis just two years after a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd — a moment of extremely low morale for the department and really high levels of distrust of the police department by the community,

Yes.

And when you took this job, you called Minneapolis “ground zero for a global reckoning on policing,” and put in place sweeping reforms to try to rebuild trust, to try to repair relationships between the police and residents. Give us a couple of examples of the reforms that you put in place and that are presumably being challenged by ICE’s presence.

So, we have placed an emphasis on use-of-force, on employing de-escalation and on the use of critical decision-making practices. We have held dozens of community meetings to get input as we revise our policies. And I think it all boils down to trying to fight crime in a way that earns community trust, as opposed to alienating people.

And from what you’re saying, suddenly all of that work is confronted with an outside group of federal law enforcement officials complicating this entire project that you have overtaken as police chief.

Absolutely. And we’re trying to heal this community, we’re trying to heal the men and women officers who remain here. It’s already the most scrutinized police department in the nation. And I can tell you, the cops here? We’re human beings. And I worry that we might hit a breaking point.

It feels as if the residents of Minnesota are taking it upon themselves to monitor ICE agents and their activity; they’re shadowing ICE agents, they’re texting each other, they’re blowing whistles. And it’s amounting to a pretty meaningful effort to counter these enforcement operations. Do you find yourself wishing that the residents were not doing that? Do you try to discourage it?

Well, I can tell you — the role of the police and law enforcement in the United States is first off to protect life, but it’s also to ensure people’s human rights and their constitutional rights. And people in this country have a First Amendment right to observe, record and object to government activity, and that includes the activity that Minneapolis police officers do. So it is a challenge, but it’s a challenge that policing in America has been dealing with and trying to improve upon. It does add a level of complication to our work.

I want be clear though: I’m not asking for federal law enforcement to do anything differently than what I expect the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department to do.

What you’re describing clearly sounds like a pretty combustible combination. There are ICE agents who are operating with their own systems and set of rules, and then there are residents, in your words, operating under the First Amendment. It’s a very delicate situation.

Absolutely.

There’s a moment that I want to ask you about, because it felt oddly prescient. In the last week or so, you stood up at a news conference and said, I am worried. You told ICE agents: You have your job to do, but please do it lawfully. You told residents: You can protest, but please do it peacefully. And you said that somebody could get seriously hurt or killed. You seemed to kind of know that something awful was coming.

This was predictable and preventable. I had been saying it for weeks. I literally said it at a press conference the day before.

When you found out that there was a shooting involving an ICE agent, what was your first thought?

I mean — I’m having a hard time describing it. I just thought, [expletive], this is it. You know? This is potentially 2020 all over again.

George Floyd all over again?

The destruction of the city.

I understand that an investigation is still underway of what happened in this shooting. But I want to focus for a minute on the shooting itself. Have you watched the videos?

Yes, I’ve seen the videos that are available online.

What is your understanding of how this unfolded?

My understanding is that there was a woman who was in her car and was blocking the street, likely because immigration agents were present. She was likely protesting immigration officials being present. And ultimately, some confrontation occurred where federal law enforcement shot into the vehicle, killing her.

Having watched the videos and spoken, perhaps, to responding officers, does this strike you as a lawful interaction between the ICE officer and the resident?

Well, I can tell you — as a police officer for 25 years — that any time you hear of a situation where a cop shoots an unarmed motorist, it’s very concerning. Our policies and training are to try to do everything possible to prevent those situations from occurring in the first place. But there are times, unfortunately, where law enforcement cannot avoid those situations from occurring.

You mentioned training. My sense is that there are some pretty universal rules around policing.

The No. 1 is you don’t place yourself in the path of the vehicle. That’s like Traffic Stop 101. You don’t do that.

So in your mind, that’s a flag for the ICE agent who ended up shooting Renee Good.

Absolutely. And then the other flag is, what exactly is the mission here? Because if this person isn’t the target of a preplanned enforcement action, then what are we doing? Are we trying to de-escalate and resolve the situation? What exactly is the goal?

I want to ask you about the driver’s decision-making at this moment, and her refusal to get out of the car even after ICE agents demanded that she get out of the car. She appears to disobey spoken orders from these officers. As somebody who thinks about this stuff, was she in the wrong?

I can only speak to conducting the traffic stop from my perspective as a police officer. What is our policy, what is our training? No. 1, you approach the driver, you introduce yourself by rank, by name, by what agency you work for, and you tell the person why they’re being stopped.

You do these sorts of things to try to ensure a level of professionalism, and to try to de-escalate. If the person asks you a question that’s reasonable, you respond to it reasonably. That is the expectation.

And did the ICE agent do any of that?

I didn’t see any of that. It just seems like there’s confusion, and it’s not clear to me whether the officers in the video were working together and understood what each other was trying to accomplish.

Do you feel that this would have ended differently had this been handled entirely by the M.P.D., not ICE?

No question.

Do you have any empathy for the ICE officer?

Yes, absolutely.

Law enforcement leaders have an obligation to their people. We have an obligation to ensure that our people have sufficient policies, training and experiences for the challenges that we are placing them into. And considering that this agent was seriously injured in a stop somewhat recently, it certainly raises questions as to what the agency did to protect their person.

You’re referring to the fact that this officer was involved in an incident where he was dragged by a car.

Yes. He sustained significant bodily injury. What did the agency do to ensure that officer would not be unsafe in similar situations?

You’re basically raising questions about whether ICE agents are sufficiently trained to handle these kinds of encounters.

Yes.

Do you think they are?

I don’t have specific information about that. But I do think they are being forced into situations in which they are not well prepared to deal with.

I want to ask you about the investigation of this shooting. Local officials have been blocked from participating in the investigation by the federal government, which argues that local officials can’t be objective based on comments from the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey. You’ve also got the Trump administration saying that Renee Goode is entirely at fault and the ICE officer did nothing wrong here. How are you making sense of what has become an incredibly messy and contentious situation?

I think the loss here is the loss of any trust that the investigation would be legitimate. I know a lot of the F.B.I. agents here, and I believe the F.B.I. will still do a thorough investigation, because that’s what they do. That’s what they do every day.

But will Minneapolis residents believe that it’s a serious investigation?

That’s the problem. The way this has played out has taken all sense of legitimacy away from many people, and that’s very unfortunate.

What happens next in Minneapolis? Because in the wake of this shooting and these protests, your governor has dispatched the National Guard — at the same time the president is dispatching more federal agents. Is that just going to magnify all the challenges that we have been talking about here?

I had asked the mayor to have the National Guard on standby as this was initially unfolding because it was so unpredictable. Going forward, it’s my understanding that there is additional federal law enforcement being added to conduct more of these operations. That is concerning.

If this escalates, are you worried, Chief O’Hara, that all of this will erase the work you’ve done over the years to rebuild and repair the community’s trust in the Minneapolis Police Department?

The No. 1 priority that I worry about is erasing the gains that we have made rebuilding the department and being able to reduce crime in the city.

In June of 2020 — immediately after the destruction of the city — Minneapolis had about as many shootings in that one month as the city used to have in half a year, and that level of crime stayed very high. That has started to come down, despite not having enough officers. But I’m just afraid if we have another large-scale unrest that we are both going to have a dramatic increase in crime and another mass exodus of the department. We just cannot sustain that.

I mean, is there any part of you that feels that this moment could strengthen the relationship between the community and the police, and test this work you’ve done and reveal that you all have made progress — that people will see a distinction between the M.P.D. and the federal government?

I know that is true. I’ve had many people reach out, and activists reach out who typically have nothing good to say about the Minneapolis police, and they have been incredibly complimentary.

But it’s not universal. We haven’t accomplished winning trust with all levels of the community. That was obvious with all the hate and vitriol that was directed toward our officers. But there’s certainly been progress.

How do you think you get back to a simpler time in your policing? And in your mind, do all these federal agents need to leave the city for you to do that?

I think everybody wants to get back to some sense of normalcy, and I think that does involve some level of returning to some basic things that we accepted as normal. You know, that obviously isn’t, federal law enforcement stops enforcing federal law. That’s not the answer. But it does have to do with having an honest conversation about reality. We’ve had many instances of people being stopped, family members of police officers being stopped that are American citizens. And they’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish. That’s not happening.

Just to return to that question, can your work at its best coexist with the work of an organization like ICE?

We are doing it right now, and we are proving to the world that this is possible, that this is not the same police it used to be. But it is an unbelievable stress on everyone involved. Everybody needs to turn the heat down in order to get some sense of normalcy, for some basic things to return.

Chief O’Hara, thank you very much for your time. We really appreciate it.

Thank you, Michael.

DOJ says withdrawal aligns with federal civil rights law

Critics say move motivated by anti-immigration sentiment

Change may freeze out credit-worthy immigrant applicants

WASHINGTON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ​the Department of Justice withdrew, opens new tab guidance expressly prohibiting lenders from discriminating against immigrants and ‌non-citizens on Monday, potentially denting immigrants' legal ability to access loans.

Democratic former President Joe Biden issued the guidance in 2023 to clarify that lenders could use immigration or citizenship status when deciding loan applications, as long as it was not the only factor nor lead to bias or discrimination.

Although the underlying ‌law already bars lenders from discriminatory practices, the guidance sought to expressly ​clarify and enforce it to avoid discrimination.

Withdrawing the guidance further whittles away the remnants of any and all Biden-era regulations and fulfills President Donald Trump's immigration policies, two key priorities of the ‍administration, according to Lori Sommerfield, a partner at Troutman Pepper Locke in the law firm's consumer financial services practice.

""The withdrawal of this joint guidance really underscores the Trump administration's two key priorities: A harder line on immigration and ⁠a continued effort to scale back enforcement of the federal fair lending laws,"" Sommerfield said.

Assistant ‍Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, said in a joint statement with the CFPB ‌announcing ‌the policy that the Biden-era guidance had been ""ideologically-driven,"" adding that the withdrawal restored alignment with established federal civil rights law.

ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT

The withdrawal has an anti-immigration subtext in line with the broader Trump administration's goals of a more aggressive immigration crackdown in the new year, according to former CFPB ⁠officials and consumer finance ⁠lawyers like Kris Kully, ​a partner at law firm Mayer Brown.

It could be interpreted as a wink and a nod to lenders, Kully said.

Last April, the administration began deploying tactics to encourage immigrants without legal status to self-deport. One such ‍tactic voided Social Security numbers issued while under temporary protected status.

A lender may simply implement a blanket policy requiring an active Social Security number to apply for credit that's in line with the Trump administration's policy, but could ​run afoul of the law as a pretext to ‍reject immigrants.

""That may be all part of the same thrust to just make it unpalatable and unaffordable, and in other ways ​just difficult to stay,"" Kully said.

The immediate challenge facing Congress is once again funding the government, with only three of the dozen regular fiscal 2026 appropriations bills — Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs enacted. Stopgap funding for everything else expires on Jan. 30.

As the calendar flipped to 2026, there have been no immediate signs of another looming partial government shutdown. The House on Thursday passed the next three measures — Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water and Interior-Environment — and the Senate is taking up that legislation this week.

House and Senate appropriators on Sunday unveiled compromise versions of the fiscal 2026 Financial Services and National Security-State bills but had to punt on releasing a Homeland Security measure as they sought time to resolve differences.

Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, said the bill was affected by the fatal Jan. 7 shooting of a woman in Minnesota by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

Even before that shooting, many acknowledged that finding agreement on Homeland Security spending would be a heavy lift.

“Some of these bills are going to be very, very challenging,” a senior administration official said before Christmas. “It’s hard to see how you get a full-year appropriations bill for DHS at this point.”

Venezuela

Meanwhile, international affairs have drawn a renewed focus after the Trump administration opted to oust and capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during the first week of the year, with the president hinting at possible moves to gain control over Greenland and Cuba as well.

On Thursday, the Senate advanced a joint resolution aiming to bar Trump from further military action against Venezuela, setting up a potential flashpoint between the president and the handful of Republican senators who backed the move to take up the measure as the year begins.

Trump, meanwhile, also continues to push the Senate GOP to get rid of the legislative filibuster, though there’s been no sign of any groundswell of support for such a move. That means the path to getting any additional partisan agenda items into law in 2026 would likely run through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires simple majority support.

Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Senate Budget Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and House Budget Chairman Jodey C. Arrington of Texas are among those wanting the Republican majorities to take another bite at the reconciliation apple.

Graham said he wants to offer a package that includes “affordability” measures, for example. He also said he wants to target fraud in schemes such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as food stamps.

Despite the push to end the legislative filibuster, there are opportunities for bipartisanship. One of the big outstanding items is a potential deal on cryptocurrency market structure legislation, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune is also talking about wanting to move a housing package.

“There are a number of bills that I’d like the Senate to take up, including ROAD to Housing — legislation that addresses housing affordability and availability — and market structure legislation that builds on the success of the GENIUS Act and provides long-overdue clarity on digital asset regulation,” the South Dakota Republican said on the Senate floor to open 2026.

The Senate housing package was included in the chamber’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act, but it was not included in the final bill agreed upon by the House and Senate, which became law last month.

Sen. Tim Scott, the chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, announced last week that the panel would mark up a crypto market structure bill on Jan. 15. Advancing the measure would help ensure that 2026 is “the year of affordability,” the South Carolina Republican said.

The Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which shares jurisdiction with the Banking panel, also plans to hold its markup during the last week of January.

Republicans on the Banking Committee initially wanted to mark up a crypto market structure bill in September. But negotiations with Democrats on bipartisan legislation to become the foundation for a markup continued through the fall and into December.

Health care priorities

Another looming issue is how or whether to extend expired Affordable Health Care Act health insurance subsidies, and for how long to do so. The House on Thursday passed a Democrat-led bill to extend lapsed tax credits for three years. Seventeen Republicans backed the measure. The Senate tried but fell short of mustering the 60 votes necessary to advance similar legislation last month.

Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both chambers hopes to reach a deal next week to extend the subsidies for a more modest two years. The enhanced credits expired Dec. 31, meaning roughly one-third of individuals who get coverage through the ACA marketplace face significantly higher costs for 2026. Open enrollment for these plans closes Jan. 15.

Democrats have signaled that the fight over the health care subsidies, as with the affordability issue, will factor heavily in their midterm messaging as Republicans defend their razor-thin House majority.

A week ago, House GOP lawmakers huddled for their policy retreat at Washington’s Kennedy Center, whose building now also bears Trump’s name. They heard from the president, who discussed the 2026 agenda ahead of the November elections. Trump cited immigration, health care and paring down energy prices among his priorities, but paramount was maintaining GOP control of the House.

“You got to win the midterms, because if we don’t win the midterms,” he said, “they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”

But the House vote-counting became more difficult for Republicans last week with the resignation of Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene becoming official just before the passing of California Republican Doug LaMalfa.

Other matters

There’s plenty of other work to look ahead to in 2026 — including some recurring classics.

For instance, lawmakers are expected to grapple again this year over the reauthorization of a powerful but contentious surveillance authority, an issue that bitterly divided privacy hawks and intelligence-focused members last Congress.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the U.S. government to collect digital communications of foreigners located outside the country, is set to expire in April. This time, that will likely not align with a funding deadline.

One debate that will line up with a big funding deadline? The highway bill. The 2021 surface transportation law expires on Sept. 30, giving lawmakers until the end of fiscal 2026 to pass a new reauthorization or extend the current one.

House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves plans to introduce a surface transportation reauthorization bill in the first few months of 2026, the Missouri Republican said in a December interview.

Graves and Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., have both indicated a willingness to move some discretionary funds in the 2021 law to formula grants for states. And it’s not clear whether they will keep the funding levels. Graves voted against the 2021 law; Capito voted for it but criticized the Biden administration’s implementation.

The expiration of farm programs will also align with the end of the fiscal year, though funding for many of the programs won’t dry up until the end of December.

Migrants and sex workers share a sphere of legal vulnerability, and for many New Yorkers, particularly Asian and Latino undocumented workers, the policing of immigration and sex work operates as a single apparatus.
Sex work and its decriminalization were a hot-button point of debate during the course of the mayoral election.
Importantly, this framing also suggests that all sex workers are victimized, ignoring the fact that sex trafficking and consensual sex work are profoundly distinct.
Arrests disproportionately affect sex workers of effectively excluding undocumented and other at-risk workers from the protections it aims to establish.","“I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” New York City’s new mayor Zohran Mamdani announced to vigorous applause at his inaugural speech on January 1, 2026. “I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical.”

The Mayor’s speech touched on the primary question at play in New York City, a familiar one for progressives nationwide: Will this elected leader be able to translate campaign rhetoric into material changes after entering the court of real-world politics?

When it was reported in December that Jessica Tisch would be retained aspolice commissioner, some speculated that Mamdani was making, as many New York City mayors have made before him, significant concessions to the political concrete wall of the NYPD. But maintaining a decarceral ethic is crucial to defending those most at risk in New York City, particularly amid Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. Mamdani has repeatedly stated that he is “ready for any consequence” in resistance to the president’s deportation regime. In the leadup to his inauguration and following anattempted ICE raid on Canal Street in December, Mamdani posted a brief “know your rights” video toYouTube, a brief primer addressing the basic tools of citizen resistance. Mamdani’s posting of the video also came on the heels of the detention and separation of aChinese father and his son after a scheduled immigration hearing at 26 Federal Plaza, the site of a substantial number ofrecent deportations just around the corner from Manhattan’s City Hall. In the video, Mamdani walks through the minimum standard of legal paperwork required for ICE to gain entry into a private residence, listing what can be done in the case of an interaction with agents (filming is permitted; resisting arrest is not), and expresses unequivocal support for the city’s immigrant community. “I’ll protect the rights of every single New Yorker,” he says, “and that includes the more than 3 million immigrants who call this city their home.”

Mamdani’s vocal resistance to Trump’s immigration policy is admirable. What his messaging does not address, however, is another community whose criminalization is deeply entangled with immigration enforcement: sex workers. Migrants and sex workers share a sphere of legal vulnerability, and for many New Yorkers, particularly Asian and Latino undocumented workers, the policing of immigration and sex work operates as a single apparatus. Groups likeRed Canary Song,Make the Road New York, and the coalition I organize with,Decrim NY, see the issue of sex work criminalization as, in part, a question of immigration policy. In some contexts, the continued criminalization of sex work is a tool of the state that is used to target workers whose immigration status may limit their access to legal employment. Mamdani cannot meaningfully protect migrants while enforcing the criminalization of work that some rely on to survive.

Sex work and its decriminalization were a hot-button point of debate during the course of the mayoral election. Mayoral candidate and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo held a press conference in August 2025 to assert that if Mamdani were elected, New York would become the “prostitution capital of the country.” As the local news outlet Hell Gate explained at the time, Cuomo based this assertion on Mamdani’s past “support for state-level legislation that would decriminalize sex work in New York … a bill supported by over a dozen other state legislators in the city.”

A couple of months later, scaremongering about the possible decriminalization of sex work also featured prominently in theAI-generated anti-Mamdani ad that Cuomo’s campaign released and then rapidly removed from its official X feed on October 22. The ad deployed a slew of racist and sexist tropes, including an AI-generated simulation of Mamdani throwing rice into the air and consuming it with his hands, and AI-generated characters concocted to raise fears that Mamdani’s platform could unleash violence and crime in the city, including a Black man in a keffiyeh shoplifting, a white man terrorizing a woman in a rundown apartment, and a caricatured pimp wearing a cartoonish fur jacket, purple silk shirt, and black fedora. In one scene, the AI-generated pimp – a Black man who appears to be a mish-mash of tropes from 1970s crime films and racist tabloid fantasies — says, “Sure, [Mamdani] said multiple times we need to defund the police, but that was just a metaphor.” Later, the pimp flings open the door of an unmarked white van to reveal a group of slumped, light-skinned women, mascara running down their faces, red lipstick smeared, covered in bruises, one with a cigarette drooping from her fingertips.

This scene directly employs the centuries-old stereotype of “white slavery,” the myth that men of color (in the U.S., particularly Black men) threaten the sexual purity of white women, and further, that they enable and perpetrate sex trafficking. The trope and its variants – for example, the hypersexualization of Asian women – have been utilized for political purpose since at least the late 19th century, directly leading to the passage of the Page Act in 1875, the first legislation to restrict immigration in United States history. As a result of its implementation, Chinese women were nearly unilaterally barred from entry into the U.S. on the presumption that they were sex workers and, in the minds of legislators, carriers of disease. Cuomo’s usage of this specific stereotype, not to mention the bald bigotry of the rest of the ad, showed a campaign comfortable embracing the racist political strategies that have repeatedly been used in this country since its inception. Importantly, this framing also suggests that all sex workers are victimized, ignoring the fact that sex trafficking and consensual sex work are profoundly distinct.

In response to Cuomo’s scaremongering, Mamdani softened his rhetoric on sex work rather than doubling down on his earlier support for decriminalization. In an interview with Urdu News on October 11, Mamdani reiterated that he has never supported legalization of sex work, but declined to endorse its decriminalization. “What I have spoken about,” he clarified, “is the need for us to focus on tackling sex trafficking across the city and ensuring that there is no tolerance for violence against women.” While these are commendable goals, they are misdirections that fail to acknowledge that consensual sex workers deserve adequate labor conditions and protections, which are primary goals of decriminalization legislation.

Mamdani has historically been an outspoken endorser of one of the decriminalization movement’s main rallying cries, asserting in a 2021 video from his tenure as councilmember thatsex work is work. In the same video, in which he cast his vote for the repeal of theWalking While Trans law, he stated with conviction: “Our streets are not dirty because of sex workers,” clarifying instead that “our streets are dirty because our city and state has systematically been cutting the budget of our brothers, sisters, and family beyond the binary in the sanitation department.”

In the lead-up to the election, however, Mamdani’s record on sex work was patchwork regarding his position on the decriminalization of sex work, despite the fact that he had previously been a sponsor ofCecilia’s Act. Though he appeared to support decriminalization in a September GoodDay New York interview, he has skirted overt endorsement in later statements. In response to a direct question about decriminalization during the second mayoral debate, Mamdani declined to affirm that he would support a legislative shift regarding sex work. He answered more ambiguously that he “[does] not think that we should be prosecuting women who are struggling who are currently being thrown in jail, and then being offered job opportunities. I think we should be actually providing those kinds of opportunities at the first point of interaction.”

Though in generalarrests of sex workers have declined over the past decade, those workers who have remained the most visible, street-based and undocumented workers, particularly those in Queens, have been repeatedly targeted by “public safety” campaigns. In October 2024, former Mayor Eric Adams and Councilmember Francisco Moya launched “Operation Restore Roosevelt” as part of the Adams administration’s “Community Link” initiatives. Though the stated goal of Operation Restore Roosevelt is improved “quality-of-life” along the Roosevelt corridor, it has primarily targeted consensual sex workers, nearly 400 of whom were arrested and stripped of income between the launch of the initiative in October 2024 and June 2025. Though the administration claims to provide, as Adams has suggested, “the resources [sex workers] need as they move from a life of [sic] on the street,” in reality, many are simply cast into the city’s underfunded shelter system. Arrests disproportionately affect sex workers of effectively excluding undocumented and other at-risk workers from the protections it aims to establish.

Mamdani, like Hochul, sits at a crossroads regarding policing of sex work. It is an open question whether or not he will avoid the trap into which many progressive politicians have previously fallen: the abandonment of the vulnerable constituencies when faced with the task of governance. What history makes clear is that progressive platforms often struggle to convert to policy for their voters on the margins. But Mamdani’s election was an obvious marvel, a sign that the political imagination of New Yorkers is alive and well.

Though the mayor cannot rewrite state law, his forthcoming administration has an opening to demonstrate that when he says he speaks for the city’s 3 million immigrants, he means migrants of all professions – an opening to protect those at the ledge of precarity, workers whose human rights are assailed along multiple vectors. In practice, Mamdani can discontinue policies like Operation Restore Roosevelt, and he can make good on promises to follow the direction of Brooklyn and Manhattan District Attorneys in minimizing sex worker arrests. He can hold firm to rhetoric that unequivocally supports the need for rights, not rescue, and he can unambiguously endorse the decriminalization movement.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254291564.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:58:34.806595

Renee Nicole Good should still be alive today. Last Wednesday, she was shot and killed by a federal ICE agent in Minneapolis, one day after the federal government deployed over 2,000 federal agents to Minneapolis – building on our president’s obsession with our state and political retribution.

That same day, ICE agents came onto school property at Roosevelt High School, also in Minneapolis, tackling people, handcuffing two staff members, and releasing chemical weapons on bystanders. MPS had to close schools for the rest of the week to protect kids from the dangerous actions of ICE in our communities. Think about that – public schools being closed because of fear from our federal government.

Regardless of how you feel about ICE’s deportation goals, I hope everyone can recognize that ICE’s approach is just bad public safety. It doesn’t appear they have proper training to de-escalate situations, their racial profiling sweeps up many who are not their targets and creates fear and distrust in law enforcement, and wearing masks is just chilling and further erodes trust.

And now, in a highly unusual move, the federal government has shut out Minnesota from the investigation into Renee’s killing. This is such a tense situation. And it is absolutely critical that there be a fair and impartial investigation. Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has experience in dealing fairly with difficult and emotionally-charged investigations involving law enforcement. How can we trust the federal government to be unbiased, when the President and the head of the Department of Homeland Security have already made false statements pre-judging what happened? How will any result be viewed as legitimate?

ICE needs to leave our state. None of this is about public safety — in fact, ICE is destabilizing our communities and making us all less safe. Masked men are coming in, arresting people without cause, racially profiling our neighbors, and wreaking havoc. We have seen residents kidnapped, a pregnant woman dragged across the pavement, and a baby pepper-sprayed.

Please stay safe and look out for one another. I am so thankful for the Minnesotans who have shown up, peacefully protested, and lifted up Renee’s legacy. We should not have to fear exercising our first amendment rights.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly violated the law and undermined public trust,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson.
“We will pursue every remedy available to safeguard the public.” Federal immigration operations have forced the City to divert resources to address problems created by federal immigration authorities, damaged the City’s ability to protect residents who fear immigration enforcement, undermined trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, and reduced use of vital City services.
“We have taken a multi-faceted approach to pushing back against the reckless federal immigration enforcement in our city,” said Deputy Mayor of Immigrant, Migrant, and Refugee Rights Beatriz Ponce de Leon.
To date, the City’s Law Department has filed more than 40 legal actions against the Trump administration, including 10 lawsuits and more than 30 amicus briefs rebuking harmful federal action.","CHICAGO — Today, the City of Chicago joined Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul to file a federal lawsuit alleging the Trump administration has overseen unlawful actions, abusive enforcement tactics, and repeated rights violations committed by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during their militarized immigration campaign in Chicago. In partnership with the Attorney General’s office, the Johnson administration is moving swiftly to hold the federal government accountable for its reckless overreach which has put families at risk, undermined public safety efforts, and sparked chaos and fear within communities across the city.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly violated the law and undermined public trust,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson. “These actions weren’t just unlawful; they were cruel, needlessly inflicting fear and harm on our communities. My administration will forcefully protect our residents’ rights and hold anyone accountable who abuses their power. Nobody is above the law. This lawsuit is about ensuring there is accountability for the lawless actions of the Trump administration and justice for the Chicagoans who have been wronged.”

“Border Patrol agents and ICE officers have acted as occupiers rather than officers of the law,” said Attorney General Raoul. “They randomly, and often violently, question residents. Without warrants or probable cause, they brutally detain citizens and non-citizens alike. They use tear gas and other chemical weapons against bystanders, injuring dozens, including children, the elderly and local police officers. I filed this lawsuit to stand up for the safety of the people of Illinois and the sovereignty of our state.”

Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois – Eastern Division, the lawsuit challenges policies under which federal immigration agents have interrogated residents about their citizenship status without any basis to believe they are in the U.S. unlawfully, make civil immigration arrests without a warrant and without probable cause, and deploy tear gas and other noxious chemicals without warning against persons who are not resisting.

The lawsuit also challenges the defendants’ arbitrary enforcement actions at or near sensitive locations such as schools and shelters as well as the defendants’ trespass on private and government-owned property, among other unlawful actions. The lawsuit alleges that the Trump Administration has implemented these policies to coerce the plaintiffs to abandon their policies, which value and respect immigrants, and devote their resources to further the immigration policies of the current administration.

The City is seeking, among other remedies, to prohibit the defendants from engaging in the challenged practices.

“Our legal team has compiled substantial evidence of these unlawful actions,” said Corporation Counsel Mary B. Richardson-Lowry. “We will pursue every remedy available to safeguard the public.”

Federal immigration operations have forced the City to divert resources to address problems created by federal immigration authorities, damaged the City’s ability to protect residents who fear immigration enforcement, undermined trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement, and reduced use of vital City services.

“We have taken a multi-faceted approach to pushing back against the reckless federal immigration enforcement in our city,” said Deputy Mayor of Immigrant, Migrant, and Refugee Rights Beatriz Ponce de Leon. “These actions have caused real harm in communities across Chicago and this lawsuit is another important step towards accountability and justice.”

Today’s filing presses forward the Johnson administration’s fight to protect Chicagoans from the worst excesses of the Trump administration.

Since being deployed to Chicago, CPB and ICE agents shot and killed one resident, shot another five times, and carried out a militarized raid of an apartment building in South Shore, detaining all its residents, including children. Agents have arrested hundreds without warrants, randomly questioned hundreds more, and unleashed chemical weapons outside schools and in residential communities.

To date, the City’s Law Department has filed more than 40 legal actions against the Trump administration, including 10 lawsuits and more than 30 amicus briefs rebuking harmful federal action. These legal actions have pushed back against the withholding of SNAP benefits, attempts to end birthright citizenship and DEI programs, restrictions on transgender rights, and more.

We are witnessing something remarkable: neighbors standing up—not just for migrants, but for themselves and for the places they call home.
These were not bureaucrats or smugglers deciding who arrived—it was neighbors expressing their willingness and capacity.
The communities mobilizing across this country right now understand something essential: defending their immigrant neighbors means defending themselves.","I am the son of two Greek immigrants who came to the United States to study and ended up staying when a military dictatorship seized power in their homeland. They were able to remain here thanks to a compassionate senator and a country that was open and welcoming to newcomers. I grew up as a beneficiary of that generosity. So when I see what is happening across America today—masked agents smashing car windows and racially profiling people on our streets, families separated without due process, and entire communities living in fear—I feel it not as an abstraction but as an assault on the very idea that shaped my life.

This past year, the administration has transformed immigration enforcement into something unrecognizable. Hundreds of thousands have been deported or pressured to leave. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents now operate in places that were once considered off-limits—courthouses, hospitals, churches, and schools. A new law has poured $170 billion into detention and deportation infrastructure. In cities across the country, from Los Angeles to Chicago, people are afraid to go to work, to take their children to school, to seek medical care, or to report a crime. The cruelty is not incidental; it is the point—to drive immigrants out of our country.

Migrants are being blamed for problems they did not cause. The housing crisis is not a function of immigration—it is a result of decades of underinvestment and undersupply. Overcrowded schools are not the fault of newcomers—they reflect policy choices made long before any migrant arrived. Yet because the immigration system appears chaotic and uncontrolled, it becomes easy for politicians to point fingers and stoke fear. When people come across borders in disorderly ways, it scares communities. And authoritarians exploit that fear, scapegoating the vulnerable to seize power. This dynamic is not unique to America—we see it across Europe, Latin America, and beyond.

But here is what the headlines often miss. Even in this darkness, extraordinary acts of solidarity are happening every day. Parents in Washington, D.C. are escorting their neighbors’ children to school. Priests and ordinary people are showing up to support their neighbors in immigration courts, their presence changing how judges and ICE agents behave. Veterans are passionately defending the Afghan interpreters who once fought alongside them. Faith communities of every denomination are coming together to accompany people facing deportation—to sit with them, walk with them, and witness what is being done in our name.

When you attack migrants, you attack entire communities. You cannot simply separate out ten or a hundred people without damaging everyone around them. We are witnessing something remarkable: neighbors standing up—not just for migrants, but for themselves and for the places they call home.

At Open Society, we believe one critical answer to chaotic immigration is not cruelty—it is giving communities control. This means giving communities real power over who comes and how they are welcomed: through sponsorship programs, through local labor partnerships, and through civic integration systems that treat newcomers as neighbors rather than numbers. The research is unambiguous: when migration happens in an orderly way, when communities are invested in the process, public support increases dramatically. In the weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, over 200,000 British citizens volunteered to sponsor Ukrainians into their communities. In the United States, Americans submitted more than 3 million applications to sponsor migrants from Ukraine, Cuba, Haiti, and other countries. These were not bureaucrats or smugglers deciding who arrived—it was neighbors expressing their willingness and capacity.

Community control transforms the politics of immigration because it transforms who holds power. Instead of top-down systems where distant officials or criminal networks determine who enters a country, it gives that authority to the people who will actually live alongside newcomers. It works across faiths and across political divides. It creates what isolation and fear destroy: human connection, purpose, community. Through the Global Refugee Sponsorship Initiative, which Open Society helped launch with the Government of Canada and the United Nations Refugee Agency, this model is now taking root in more than 20 countries—from Brazil to Spain to Australia. What works in Texas can work in São Paulo. What works in rural Connecticut can work in rural Ireland. We are committed to expanding this model as the foundation for a more humane and sustainable approach to migration.

These are hard times. The institutions we have built to protect the vulnerable are under sustained attack. But courage and compassion are contagious. When one person stands up, others follow. The communities mobilizing across this country right now understand something essential: defending their immigrant neighbors means defending themselves. It means defending the schools their children attend, the businesses where they work, the fabric of places they love. This fight is not only about immigration. It is about what kind of country we want to be.

The willingness of a country to welcome newcomers is a test of its humanity—and a test of its ability to succeed in the future. We live in an interconnected world. If we shut ourselves off, we lose access to the talent, energy, and ideas that will shape the century ahead. I was the beneficiary of an America that believed in that promise. I still believe in it. And I see, in communities standing together from Texas to Georgia to Maine, that millions of others believe in it too.",https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32.png,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:43.442260

Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly.
Defenders of the ICE agent say he acted in self-defense, while critics say the level of force was unjustified.
Noem said the basis for the policy is that advanced notice is necessary to “ensure adequate protection” for members of Congress, their staff, detainees and ICE employees.
“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” Noem wrote.","House Democrats renewed their legal challenge Monday to the Trump administration’s restrictions on congressional oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, after the Department of Homeland Security released new guidance requiring a seven-day wait period.

In a court filing Monday, attorneys representing the lawmakers called on Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to seek clarity from DHS on why the newest guidance does not violate Section 527 of the appropriations law for the department, which spells out the authority for members of Congress to make unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities.

Cobb sided with Democratic lawmakers last month, in an opinion that found a previous Trump administration policy first announced in June is likely contrary to Section 527 because it effectively required members of Congress to give a seven-day notice before making a visit.

The lawmakers in the Monday filing point out that DHS says the newest guidance uses a different funding source and “therefore purports not to be subject to the limitations of section 527,” but adds that argument doesn’t hold up.

“[I]t is practically impossible that the development, promulgation, communication, and implementation of this policy has been, and will be, accomplished — as required — without using a single dollar of annually appropriated funds subject to section 527,” the lawmaker filing states.

In a group statement, Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado and the other lawmakers said they are going back to court because DHS is attempting to get around the prior order “by re-imposing the same unlawful policy.”

“This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will,” the group said.

The Justice Department notified the court Saturday about the new guidance, which was dated Jan. 8 and signed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

That notification came the same day members of a Minnesota congressional delegation, consisting of Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison, said they were denied access to the Whipple federal building in Minneapolis, an immigration detention facility.

Morrison, in an interview on MS NOW on Saturday, said local officials initially granted lawmakers access to the facility, but their visits were ended “very abruptly.”

“We were told to leave,” Morrison said. “We met with two of the commanding officers, and they told us the reason we were not able to stay and meet with any detainees is because the funding for ICE came from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill.'”

The incident comes on the heels of outcry over an ICE agent fatally shooting Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis after a highly disputed interaction that resulted in calls for an independent investigation. Defenders of the ICE agent say he acted in self-defense, while critics say the level of force was unjustified.

Noem in the new guidance bases DHS authority for a new seven-day wait period for lawmakers to gain access to immigration facilities on funding for the facilities coming from the reconciliation law President Donald Trump signed on July 4, which she refers to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The guidance cites a line from the Cobb’s order that those funds “are not subject to Section 527’s limitations.”

“Given the extent of the funding made available to ICE through the OBBBA, I anticipate that there is more than sufficient funding available for the limited expenses associated with implementing and enforcing these policies,” Noem said.

Noem said the basis for the policy is that advanced notice is necessary to “ensure adequate protection” for members of Congress, their staff, detainees and ICE employees.

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties,” Noem wrote. “Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions.”

Attorneys with the Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight, who are representing House Democrats, say the Trump administration “secretly” imposed the new guidance and it came to light after ICE denied lawmakers access to the facility in Minnesota.

“Only after this denial, and following outreach from Plaintiffs’ counsel to Defendants’ counsel, did Defendants notify Plaintiffs and the Court of the duplicate notice policy,” the filing states.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes.","WASHINGTON(AP) — The Trump administration secretly reimposed a policy limiting Congress members' access to immigration detention facilities a day after a federal immigration officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, attorneys for several congressional Democrats said Monday in asking a federal judge to intervene.

Three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near Minneapolis on Saturday, three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in the city.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked ICE from enforcing policies limiting Congress members’ access to immigration detention facilities. In a court filing on Monday, plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to hold an emergency hearing and decide if the duplicate notice policy violates her order.

Cobb ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities. The judge said the seven-day notice requirement likely exceeds the Department of Homeland Security’s statutory authority.

The attorneys asking Cobb for an emergency hearing say the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire on Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Cobb didn't immediately rule on the plaintiffs' hearing request. Government attorneys also didn’t immediately respond in writing to it.

On Saturday, U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building. They initially were allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

Officials who turned them away cited a newly imposed seven-day-notice policy for congressional oversight visits. Last Thursday, a day after Good's death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement, according to the plaintiffs’ lawyers.

Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden, ruled last month in favor of 12 other members of Congress who sued to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

Government attorneys had argued that the plaintiffs didn't have legal standing to bring their claims. They also said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” Cobb wrote.

The motion asks the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain “how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities.” The lawsuit comes nearly a month after a federal judge sided with the group of Democratic lawmakers, including Congressmen Neguse and Jason Crow, ruling members of Congress could resume unannounced visits and tours of detention centers and field officers run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including the ICE facility in Aurora.

That previous lawsuit was brought on by Rep. Crow last summer, who claimed he was denied entry into the GEO facility in Aurora during an unannounced congressional visit in July, and told he needed to give a seven-day notice to the Department of Homeland Security before conducting an oversight visit.

In an interview with Denver7's Shannon Ogden shortly after that lawsuit had been filed, Crow said that unannounced visits at ICE detention facilities by members of Congress are not only legal but necessary because scheduled visits are ""dog and pony shows.""

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration secretly reimposed a policy limiting Congress members' access to immigration detention facilities a day after a federal immigration officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, attorneys for several congressional Democrats said Monday in asking a federal judge to intervene.

Three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near Minneapolis on Saturday, three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in the city.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked ICE from enforcing policies limiting Congress members’ access to immigration detention facilities. In a court filing on Monday, plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to hold an emergency hearing and decide if the duplicate notice policy violates her order.

Cobb ruled on Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities. The judge said the seven-day notice requirement likely exceeds the Department of Homeland Security’s statutory authority.

The attorneys asking Cobb for an emergency hearing say the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire on Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

Cobb didn't immediately rule on the plaintiffs' hearing request. Government attorneys also didn’t immediately respond in writing to it.

On Saturday, U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building. They initially were allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

Officials who turned them away cited a newly imposed seven-day-notice policy for congressional oversight visits. Last Thursday, a day after Good's death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement, according to the plaintiffs’ lawyers.

Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden, ruled last month in favor of 12 other members of Congress who sued to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

Government attorneys had argued that the plaintiffs didn't have legal standing to bring their claims. They also said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” Cobb wrote.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs' attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn't shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.

It was only the latest in a long series of high-dollar legal challenges Trump has brought against prominent media organizations, including ABC, CBS, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, among others.

Trump has won some sizable settlements in cases legal scholars had dismissed as largely lacking in merit. But as media scholars, we believe prevailing in court is not necessarily his primary goal. Instead, Trump appears to use lawsuits as a strategic weapon designed to silence his enemies and critics – who sometimes seem to be one and the same in his eyes.

Trump has always been litigious. Over the course of his life, he has been involved in more than 4,000 lawsuits. Many of these involved Trump suing for defamation over perceived threats to his reputation. Relatively few, however, have been successful, if success is defined as prevailing in courts of law.

But using litigation as a tool for intimidation can produce other results that can count as victory. We are concerned that the president may be using the courts as a tool not to correct the record but to muzzle potential watchdogs and deprive the public of the facts they need to hold him accountable.

Winning Major Settlements

Trump claims the BBC attempted to interfere with the 2024 election by misrepresenting statements he’d made. As with Trump’s other defamation suits, the odds appear long against the president winning his case against the British broadcaster in court.

Just after Trump’s election in 2024, ABC, whose parent company is Disney, promised to make a $15 million contribution to the Trump presidential library to settle a defamation suit many experts said had dubious merit.

CBS and its parent company Paramount Global settled an arguably weaker defamation suit involving editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris that Trump said was done “to make her look better.” Paramount contributed $16 million to Trump’s presidential library and his legal fees in order, the company said, to avoid the “uncertainty and distraction” of litigation. That same month, the Federal Communications Commission approved the $8 billion acquisition of Paramount by Skydance Media.

Those two defamation suits were filed while Trump was still a presidential candidate. Weeks after winning reelection, Trump sued The Des Moines Register for publishing a preelection poll that suggested he might lose the swing state of Iowa. Instead, he carried the state by 13 percentage points.

Trump could have just gloated over his victory, as President Harry Truman did when he famously posed holding the Chicago Tribune’s “Dewey Beats Truman” headline the day after his reelection. Instead, Trump went to court, accusing The Des Moines Register and its pollster, J. Ann Selzer, of violating Iowa’s consumer protection laws by fraudulently deceiving consumers and campaign donors.

Even if Trump loses this suit, he has inflicted expensive litigation costs on a news organization.

The Considerable Costs of Defense

From the 1960s until the late 1990s, leading media outlets, rich from advertising dollars, could afford to hire lawyers to defend against governmental overreach and protect their role in the U.S.’s democratic order. Those fights led to Supreme Court decisions shielding media outlets from most libel complaints and government censorship prior to publication.

But the rise of the internet and then social media led to the collapse of the economic model supporting traditional news production. As audiences and advertisers have fled traditional media outlets, including newspapers and broadcasters, the money to hire lawyers to defend against expensive defamation suits or fight for access to government information is much harder to find.

If even media giants such as ABC and CBS are settling rather than fighting, what local news editor is going to assign a story that might trigger a presidential lawsuit? That’s why Trump’s suit against The Des Moines Register is such an ominous development.

Giving Up Without a Fight

What’s disheartening about the media giants’ capitulation is that they are at risk of squandering the protections afforded by the Constitution and the courts.

In medieval England, criticizing the king or peers of the realm was a crime. But early in U.S. history, attempts to enforce seditious libel laws by the British government and later by President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress generated public outcry and rebuke. This was based in part on the understanding that in a democracy the people must be free to criticize those who govern them, a principle enshrined in the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court ratified this understanding of press freedom in its 1964 decision New York Times v. Sullivan. In a resounding victory for free expression, the justices held that government officials cannot prevail in defamation cases unless there is clear and convincing proof that their critics knowingly or recklessly disregarded the truth. Careless errors are not enough.

Under these protections, even Trump’s case against the BBC – where the network has admitted an ethical lapse – is not a certain winner, especially since the contested content didn’t air in Florida, where the lawsuit was filed.

Although Trump claims the BBC’s misleading edits implied that he directly incited protesters to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the network can argue in court that the inaccuracy is only technical, given that Trump truly did give a firebrand speech that was widely criticized as at least indirectly leading to the violence that followed . If the edited version of Trump’s speech is not appreciably more harmful to Trump’s reputation than his actual speech, Trump’s defamation claim would likely fail.

Trump is the first U.S. president to use the weight of his office to extract private settlements from news outlets tasked with holding him accountable. Ostensibly, these suits are to recover monetary damages for harm to his reputation, but they are part of a broader attack on what Trump perceives as hostile media coverage.

New Limits from States

Some of Trump’s targets are fighting back.

One is the Pulitzer Prize Board, the defendant in yet another Trump defamation suit – in this case, over the awards the board gave for reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In December 2025, the Pulitzer Prize Board asked the judge in the case to force the president to hand over tax and medical records to prove that he had suffered the financial and emotional harm he is claiming.

Another key development: Most states have enacted anti-SLAPP laws. SLAPP stands for “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” referring to cases filed to intimidate and discourage public criticism. Thirty-eight states, plus the District of Columbia, now have anti-SLAPP laws in place. It’s probably not a coincidence that Trump filed the latest iteration of his suit against The Des Moines Register on June 30, which happened to be one day before Iowa’s anti-SLAPP law took effect.

These state laws allow targets of SLAPPs to get early resolutions of meritless suits and can force people found to have filed such suits to pick up their targets’ legal bills.

Without such tools protecting First Amendment rights – and media organizations taking steps themselves to defend such rights – dissent might be characterized as a “deceptive trade practice,” and speech is no longer truly free.",https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Muzzle-Media-RECO.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 14:58:26.718549

The US revoked the visas of more than 100,000 foreign nationals last year, the State Department said on Monday, as the Trump administration continues to enforce stricter immigration curbs.

“In less than one year, the State Department revoked over 100,000 visas from foreign nationals, marking a new record and more than a 150% increase in revocations since 2024,” deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said in an emailed statement to Anadolu.

“The State Department's recently launched Continuous Vetting Center works to ensure that all foreign nationals on American soil comply with our laws — and that the visas of those who pose a threat to American citizens are swiftly revoked,” Pigott said, “The Trump administration will continue to put America first and protect our nation from foreign nationals who pose a risk to public safety or national security.”

The statement came amid the administration’s broader crackdown on immigrants, which has extended to international students and activists critical of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Legal challenges have pushed back against these actions.

“A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped.
We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.” ###","Washington, D.C. — Today, Colorado Congressman and Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, alongside twelve of his colleagues, have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The Representatives filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing Members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order(link is external) affirmed all Members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

The lawsuit, Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring Members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of Members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum(link is external) reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

The plaintiffs include Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

In a joint statement, Assistant Leader Neguse and his fellow plaintiffs said: “In December, a federal court acted to restore Members of Congress's ability to conduct essential congressional oversight on behalf of the American people. Now, rather than complying with the law, the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to get around this order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. This is unacceptable. Oversight is a core responsibility of Members of Congress, and a constitutional duty we do not take lightly. It is not something the executive branch can turn on or off at will. Today, we are going back to court to defend the rule of law, protect transparency, and ensure that no administration can hide behind closed doors.”

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration's attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

“And now carved into the same, sorrowful stone is the name of Renee Nicole Good,” Mitchell said.
The Trump administration is using this newly empowered militarized police force to target civilians the administration characterizes as enemies.","At a vigil outside the Wisconsin State Capitol Friday evening, a few days after a federal agent shot and killed Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good, hundreds of people held candles and raised their voices in a call and response song led by Madison Community Singing leader Julia Coehlo: “This is way too big for you to carry it on your own … you do not carry this all alone.”

Tiny lights flickered in the darkness. “This is not a rally centered on chants or speeches,” an organizer from the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera told the crowd. Instead, it was a moment to acknowledge our collective shock and grief, to support each other as we face the sickening and disorienting shift in the world around us, and to try to hold onto a protective sense of community.

It was a needed respite from watching the video, obtained by the Minnesota Reformer, of the shooting of Good in broad daylight as she sat at the wheel of her minivan on a Midwestern residential street, apparently trying to move away from the agent who shot her. The horror of that scene was compounded by the propaganda from the Trump administration that followed, immediately blaming Good for her own death and calling her a “domestic terrorist,” while claiming that the real victim was the ICE agent who, after he shot her, walked away unhurt.

Stoking political division and hate, justifying murder, treating people’s real lives like a video game — our poisonous political atmosphere is overwhelming. We need to put down the screens and restore our sense of human connection if we are going to overcome it.

Dane County Judge and Pastor Everett Mitchell, speaking at the vigil, quoted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s eulogy for the three little girls killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Their deaths, King said, “have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained-glass windows. They have something to say to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism,” as well as to those who “stood on the sidelines in a mighty struggle for justice.”

“Madison,” Mitchell said, “we can no longer stand on the sideline and feel like we are protected. We must substitute courage for caution.”

Here in Wisconsin, the Minneapolis shooting hits close to home. Minnesota is our near neighbor. My daughter, who lives in the Twin Cities, was driving past the area of the ICE surge when Good was shot. She texted us about the unfolding chaos in real time, as ICE vehicles sped past her — putting our whole family on edge.

Maybe we have had the false sense, as Mitchell said, that we were protected.

The “Midwest nice” culture of Minnesota and Wisconsin — whether that describes taciturn conflict avoidance or genuine warmth — doesn’t fit with political violence.

It’s impossible to see ourselves in Trump’s heated rhetoric about the “Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate.” Nicole Good, whose last words were, “I’m not mad at you,” certainly doesn’t fit that profile.

The killing of a U.S. citizen by federal agents, justified after the fact by the president, vice president, and secretary of Homeland Security, is a turning point for all of us. As investigative reporter Ken Klipperstein points out, Trump’s national security order targeting so-called leftwing domestic terrorist groups, and Attorney General Pam Bondi’s tag-along directive, “Ending Political Violence Against ICE” broadly justify the targeting of Americans who protest Trump’s immigration crackdown or attempt to help their immigrant neighbors who are being terrorized.

In a video filmed by the agent who shot Renee Good, released by a right-wing news outlet that tried to spin it as exonerating him, you can hear a man’s voice, immediately after the shooting, cursing Good, calling her a “f-ing bitch.”

A Customs and Border Patrol Agent who shot Chicago resident Marimar Martinez five times and bragged about it in text messages, also allegedly used the word “bitch” as he rammed into her car, according to Martinez’s attorney. The Justice Department initially claimed Martinez, who survived. was the aggressor, saying she used her car to try to harm the agents — the same dubious claim made against Good — but then dropped all charges after Martinez challenged the government’s evidence.

Turning hyped-up, poorly trained agents onto the streets to pursue civilians is, contrary to Trump administration propaganda, making America much less safe. And pouring fuel on the fire with hateful rhetoric about “the radical Left” and the need to round up immigrant “criminals” — a majority of whom have committed no crimes — is exacerbating this disaster.

The Trace puts the number of ICE shootings at 16, four of them fatal, since the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown began — including Silverio Villegas González, a father from Mexico who worked as a cook, killed just after he dropped off his children at school, while reportedly trying to flee from ICE officers during the Midway Blitz in Chicago. At the vigil Friday night, Mitchell connected those killings to racist violence from the Civil Rights era to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. “And now carved into the same, sorrowful stone is the name of Renee Nicole Good,” Mitchell said.

People are struggling to figure out what to make of our frightening new reality. At the Madison vigil, one activist declared that the escalating ICE crackdown “is not because they are inevitably powerful. It is because we are powerful.” But the escalation, which is targeting people who are decidedly not powerful, is coming directly out of the more than $170 billion allocated to immigration enforcement in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — more than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. combined, according to the Brennan Center. The Trump administration is using this newly empowered militarized police force to target civilians the administration characterizes as enemies.

Most of the people I know are aghast at this scary turn of events. But one Wisconsinite I spoke with waved away the shooting, saying, “Minneapolis has a lot of problems.” There’s that false sense of being protected Mitchell called out. It’s really just denial — a powerful wish to believe that bad things only happen to other people, that violence is far away and somehow the fault of people who are different from us and who bring it on themselves.

But this touches all of us. And it won’t go away unless we get to the root of the problem — the unAmerican national security directives, the insane ICE budget, the lack of accountability — what Vice President JD Vance, astoundingly, asserted was “total immunity” for the rogue, masked agents targeting people in a political crackdown that has nothing to do with keeping us safe.

We have to see this for what it is. We need members of Congress to demand a rollback of the massive funding for Trump’s unaccountable police force. We need leaders who will state clearly, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have done, that political violence against civilians waged by the Trump administration is immoral, illegal and has to stop.

Most of all, we need each other. This is too heavy for one person to carry. We need to connect, to combine all of our efforts and to build a massive popular movement to take care of each other and reject the hateful forces that are trying to tear us apart.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0635-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 13:58:35.718738

Minnesota leaders urged demonstrators to remain peaceful.

The protest was one of hundreds planned for towns and cities across the country over the weekend. It came in a city on edge since the killing of Renee Good on Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“We’re all living in fear right now,” said Meghan Moore, a mother of two from Minneapolis who joined the protest. “ICE is creating an environment where nobody feels safe and that’s unacceptable.”

On Friday night, a protest outside a Minneapolis hotel that attracted about 1,000 people turned violent as demonstrators threw ice, snow and rocks at officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One officer suffered minor injuries after being struck with a piece of ice, O’Hara said. Twenty-nine people were cited and released, he said.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey stressed that while most protests have been peaceful, those who cause damage to property or put others in danger will be arrested. He faulted “agitators that are trying to rile up large crowds.”

“This is what Donald Trump wants,” Frey said of the president who has demanded massive immigration enforcement efforts in several U.S. cities. “He wants us to take the bait.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz echoed the call for peace.

“Trump sent thousands of armed federal officers into our state, and it took just one day for them to kill someone,” Walz said on social media. “Now he wants nothing more than to see chaos distract from that horrific action. Don’t give him what he wants.”

“We will fight with peaceful expression, in court, through public debate, and at the ballot box. Keep the peace. And keep the faith,” Walz said later in another post.

Communities unite in frustration

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says its deployment of immigration officers in the Twin Cities is its biggest ever immigration enforcement operation. Trump’s administration has said both shootings were acts of self-defense against drivers who “weaponized” their vehicles to attack officers.

Connor Maloney said he was attending the Minneapolis protest to support his community and because he’s frustrated with the immigration crackdown.

“Almost daily I see them harassing people,” he said. “It’s just sickening that it’s happening in our community around us.”

He and other protesters, including children, braved subfreezing temperatures and a light dusting of snow, carrying handmade signs saying declaring, “De-ICE Minnesota!” and “ICE melts in Minnesota.”

They marched down a street that is home to restaurants and stores where various nationalities and cultures are celebrated in colorful murals.

Steven Eubanks, 51, said he felt compelled to attend a protest in Durham, North Carolina, because of the “horrifying” killing in Minneapolis.

“We can’t allow it,” Eubanks said. “We have to stand up.”

Indivisible, a social movement organization that formed to resist the Trump administration, said hundreds of protests were scheduled in Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida and other states.

ICE activity across Minneapolis

In Minneapolis, a coalition of migrant rights groups organized the demonstration that began in a park about half a mile from the residential neighborhood where the 37-year-old Good was shot on Wednesday.

But the large protest apparently did not deter federal officers from operating in the city.

A couple of miles away, just as the demonstration began, an Associated Press photographer witnessed heavily armed officers — at least one in Border Patrol uniform — approach a person who had been following them. Two of the agents had long guns out when they ordered the person to stop following them, telling him it was his “first and final warning.”

The agents eventually drove onto the interstate without detaining the driver.

In Richfield, a suburb of Minneapolis, federal agents with their faces covered pointed their fingers at journalists and warned them to stay away as they detained a man outside a home improvement store.

Protests held in the neighborhood have been largely peaceful, and in general there has been minimal law enforcement presence, in contrast to the violence that hit Minneapolis in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Near the airport, some confrontations erupted on Thursday and Friday between smaller groups of protesters and officers guarding the federal building used as a base for the Twin Cities crackdown.

O’Hara said city police officers have responded to calls about cars abandoned because their drivers have been apprehended by immigration enforcement. In one case, a car was left in park and a dog was left inside another.

He said immigration enforcement activities are happening “all over the city” and that 911 callers have been alerting authorities to ICE activity, arrests and abandoned vehicles.

The Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal officers to Minnesota under a sweeping new crackdown tied in part to allegations of fraud involving Somali residents. More than 2,000 officers were taking part.

Lawmakers snubbed

Three congresswomen from Minnesota attempted to tour the ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building on in the morning and were initially allowed to enter but then told they had to leave about 10 minutes later.

U.S, Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig accused ICE agents of obstructing members of Congress from fulfilling their duty to oversee operations there.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing policies that limit congressional visits to immigration facilities. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 12 members of Congress who sued in Washington, D.C. to challenge ICE’s amended visit",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.timesrepublican.com/images/2026/01/11201453/AP26010792551030-1100x733.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 13:58:30.224579

The Fourth Amendment generally requires the government to get a warrant before searching your private information, but government agencies are circumventing the intent of the Constitution by simply buying sensitive, personal data from private companies. Today, the ACLU published documents obtained from the Department of Homeland Security shedding light on how ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and other parts of DHS have bought access to huge amounts of highly sensitive location data harvested from people’s cell phones that enables government tracking of our movements over time.

We filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against DHS in 2020 for records about its practice of purchasing bulk access to cell phone location information gathered from smartphone apps. In 2022, we posted thousands of pages of previously unreleased documents, but our litigation continued, and today we are publishing the additional records we’ve obtained over the last several years. Although DHS announced in 2024 that it was ending its contracts with data brokers for access to bulk cell phone location data, recent reporting indicates that the agency is getting back in the business of mass tracking of Americans’ phones, giving these records renewed relevance.

In fact, just last week, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to a social media and phone surveillance system that is “designed to monitor a city neighborhood or block for mobile phones, track the movements of those devices and their owners over time, and follow them from their places of work to home or other locations.”

When we published the first set of records we obtained from DHS, we highlighted some major revelations from the documents, including the huge volumes of location data at issue, how revealing that data can be about individuals’ lives, and the self-serving attempts of government contractors and DHS itself to minimize the quite obvious privacy implications of this surveillance. The new batch of documents further underscores the privacy concerns and legal questions raised by this practice, and reinforces the pressing need for strong legal protection, like the bipartisan Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would end the government’s pattern of circumventing constitutional protections by purchasing the data instead of obtaining a warrant from a judge.

Among the new documents is a two-page legal memo from ICE, providing our most detailed look yet into the agency’s attempt to craft a legal justification for purchasing access to highly sensitive location information without a warrant. The memo claims that the purchased location information is different from the cell phone location data at issue in Carpenter v. United States, an ACLU case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the government needs a warrant to obtain cell phone location history directly from cellular service providers because of the “privacies of life” those records can reveal. The ICE memo, which is heavily redacted, appears to attempt to distinguish the purchased location data from the cell phone location data at issue in Carpenter on a ridiculous technicality: that this newer data is tied to phones’ Mobile Advertising IDs (known as MAIDs or AdIDs) instead of to phone numbers or names. But that is a distinction without a difference.

AdIDs are unique alphanumeric codes assigned to each device. Although some have described these identifiers as a way to target advertisements without identifying individuals, that promise of privacy is illusory. An entire industry now exists to “enrich” the AdID-linked location data with personal and historical information. The combined data reveals highly sensitive information about users’ lifestyles, their routines, and the people they meet. And the companies selling this location data to the government know this—they plainly say so in their marketing materials: “What you do and where you do it defines who you are,” according to a Gravy Analytics solicitation that ICE received. Because our patterns of movement between home, work, school, and other frequently visited locations are unique, government agents can easily identify us by tracking our phones—indeed, that’s the entire point of this surveillance. Substituting AdIDs for phone numbers does little to prevent such tracking.

Similarly, nothing prevents federal agencies from identifying and linking this location information to PII they obtained separately. Indeed, the DHS Privacy Officer raised this exact concern: “CBP should address how AdIDs become linked to an individual during the CBP analysis process, as well as the retention of AdID in the vendor system and within CBP systems with the associated linked PII.” In another document, Secret Service personnel also voiced privacy concerns, pointing out that one of the cell phone location data tools might in fact contain PII.

Government records illustrate how invasive the tracking can be:

In one document in ICE’s possession, the data broker Venntel explains how its data aided in “tracing one device observed at multiple locations throughout the U.S. and Mexico.”

In multiple cases, Venntel provided “geofence” capabilities, which enable law enforcement agencies to identify every device in a specified area. CBP tracked phones to “locations of law enforcement interest” and monitored “travel patterns.”

A Secret Service email exchange explains how the data could be used by investigators to identify “mobile devices carried near popular border crossing points into the U.S. and pull up the historical location data for those devices, viewing where they've been in the preceding months.”

And DHS pays handsomely for all of this with taxpayer money, according to the released records. Customs and Border Protection entered into contracts with one company, Venntel, in 2019 and 2020, totaling over two million dollars. A renewal subscription with another platform, Babel Street, in 2020 came to nearly 3 million dollars. The Secret Service entered into a 12-month contract with Babel Street for over 600,000 dollars in 2019. Recent reporting indicates expenditures have continued, with ICE signing up with yet another surveillance vendor, Penlink, this year.

Nobody expects that by carrying a phone, they are somehow consenting to let the government make a record of their every move. The government’s scrabbling about for legal loopholes should not be allowed to cover for the massive privacy violation that this technology enables. Congress can end this warrantless mass surveillance now, through passage of the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would require the government to obtain a warrant from a judge before getting access to this invasive data. That commonsense protection is within reach. The legislation passed the House in 2024 with strong bipartisan support, and there’s no good reason it couldn’t advance further this year. State legislatures can also take up the fight, to ensure that state and local police can’t pay their way to pervasive location surveillance. Montana did so last year, and other states are poised to follow.

The government should not be allowed to purchase its way around bedrock constitutional protections against unreasonable searches of our private information. There should be no end run around the Fourth Amendment.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/11/apple-touch-icon.png@2x-150x150.png,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:48.671540

What Is Happening

ICE’s recent actions go far beyond ordinary immigration enforcement. Federal agents have used violence against legal observers and peaceful protesters, most shockingly in Minneapolis where ICE agents shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. Despite video evidence and expert criticism of the use of force, federal leaders have defended the agent’s actions as “self-defense,” fueling national outrage and protests demanding accountability and transparency.

Across the country, the administration has singled out Democratic-led cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and Portland for politically motivated operations, and targeted specific immigrant communities like the Somali population in Minnesota.

Tens of thousands of people have been swept up in mass enforcement actions where individuals effectively disappear into detention with no clear information for their families.

Hundreds of U.S. citizens have also been wrongfully detained, often due to racial profiling, and family separation policies have been revived. Surveillance technologies, from facial recognition to phone hacking and license-plate tracking, are being used to monitor immigrants and activists.

At the same time, the administration has paused green cards and citizenship applications for people from dozens of countries and canceled naturalization ceremonies nationwide.

Why This Matters

This is not immigration enforcement. It is authoritarian power being tested in real time.

When federal agents can detain citizens, disappear people into detention, spy on protesters, and use violence without accountability, everyone is at risk.

For Americans living abroad, the danger is deeply personal. Our international families are terrified of returning to the United States. Parents fear putting their children at risk. Spouses worry that travel could lead to detention, separation, or worse. People are being forced to choose between their country and their family’s safety.

Congress has the authority to stop this. Demand they use it now.

“I do not like what ICE is doing or what the administration is doing,” said Traci Benefield, an Auburn resident who attended the vigil. “It is not a left or right thing; it is a human decency thing. They are killing people.”

She added that, “I feel like if something doesn’t change, we are seeing the downfall of America.”

Good’s shooting sparked protests around the country.

ICE agents were conducting immigration raids in Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Prior to the raid, residents gathered on the scene and blew whistles to alert the community of their presence.

Good and her spouse were in their car on Wednesday when Jonathan Ross, an ICE agent walked toward her and tried to grab the car door as Good appeared to make an attempt to leave. Ross fired three shots into the driver side windshield, eventually killing Good.

“It was all on video, multiple videos from multiple angles,” said Rachel Turner, one of the lead organizers of the event, of the incident that led to Good’s death. “There were also multiple eyewitnesses who came forward and vigorously rejected the government’s claims about what actually had taken place.”

Those who attended the event spoke out against the administration’s efforts to dispatch hundreds of additional immigration agents to Minneapolis.

But legislating is hard, rulemaking can be a lengthy process fraught with legal pitfalls, and the midterm elections loom. Set forth below is a preview of what employers can expect from a federal policy standpoint in 2026.

The 119th Congress

Federal lawmakers returned to Washington, D.C., this week for the second session of the 119th Congress. In the U.S. Senate, Republicans have a 53–47 majority, and in the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans currently have a 218–213 majority (with four vacancies). These slim margins in both chambers mean that Republicans will need the assistance of Democrats to pass most legislation, unless the Republicans take another crack at the reconciliation process, which they used in 2025 to pass the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on a party-line basis.

To make things more complicated, the 2026 federal midterm elections will be held on November 3, 2026. The impending elections will heavily influence the Republicans’ legislative agenda in the coming months, as they look to move legislation that they believe will benefit them on Election Day. The midterm elections also create a truncated legislative calendar, as, in addition to their traditionally scheduled August recess, incumbent legislators seeking reelection are currently scheduled to spend nearly all of October campaigning in their districts. The post-election “lame-duck” session of Congress could also present an opportunity for rare moments of bipartisanship.

Here is what to watch:

As a Republican alternative to Hawley’s framework, Senate HELP Committee chair Bill Cassidy introduced a slate of bills that would enhance employees’ rights vis-à-vis their labor unions. A similar series of bills was introduced in the House. Employers may hear more about these bills in 2026, though they are not expected to pass as long as the legislative filibuster remains intact.

Other bills to watch include the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2025 (H.R. 2870) (allowing employees to choose paid time off in lieu of overtime pay), Tipped Employee Protection Act (H.R. 2312) (providing a more specific definition of “tipped employee”), the Save Local Business Act (H.R. 4366), the Employee Rights Act, as well as bills relating to independent contractors.

The politics surrounding this bill are particularly interesting. Colloquially referred to as the “Durbin/Grassley” bill, besides original co-sponsors Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), other co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)—strange political bedfellows, indeed. Grassley and Durbin have also joined together in demanding that tech companies answer questions about their hiring of H-1B visa holders. The two senators first introduced the bill nearly twenty years ago. With Durbin not seeking reelection and Grassley being ninety-one years old, 2026 might be their last opportunity to push for passage of the bill. All of these factors could provide this bill with traction in the Senate.

Other immigration bills to watch include the Halting International Relocation of Employment (HIRE) Act, the American Tech Workforce Act, “Strengthening Accountability for Employers Hiring Individuals and Reforming Enforcement Act (SAFE HIRE) Act,’’ Colleges for the American People Act (“CAP Act”), and the Pause Admissions Until Security Ensured (PAUSE) Act (prohibits issuance of visas and status adjustments until various changes are made to federal law, such as elimination of the Optional Practical Training Program and codification of President Trump’s H-1B proclamation).

Another Shutdown? At the start, Congress faces issues that carry over from 2025: how to address healthcare insurance premium subsidies and a January 30, 2026, federal government funding deadline. As of now, neither party is indicating that they have an appetite for another government shutdown, but that can always change as the deadline approaches. The deal that reopened the federal government in November 2025 after a record-breaking forty-three-day shutdown included three of the twelve spending bills. The clock is currently ticking for Congress to do something about the remaining nine bills.

Big-Ticket Items. Republicans will likely turn their attention to bills addressing surface transportation and water infrastructure projects, permitting reform, and perhaps another reconciliation bill that would include remaining fiscal goals that would be permitted under the arcane legislative process. The Senate will also focus on confirming nominees to both the executive branch and the federal bench.

Labor/Employment Legislation. In 2025, Republican Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) caused a stir with the introduction of his labor reform framework. Hawley promoted these ideas at multiple hearings of the Senate HELP Committee, and he can be expected to continue to push elements of the framework throughout 2026. The question is, will other Republicans jump on board?

Immigration Legislation. Republicans in Congress are taking their cues from the administration when it comes to scrutiny of immigration policy, as they’ve introduced dozens of bills that would dramatically reform our immigration laws. One bill in particular that employers should monitor is the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act.

Federal Agencies

Rather than appearing in June or even July of 2025, the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (“Spring Regulatory Agenda”) was not released until September 4, 2025. It is, therefore, not surprising that the issuance of the fall 2025 regulatory agenda—often released in November or December—has been delayed. Once the administration releases an updated agenda, it will provide stakeholders with notice of the expected regulatory landscape for approximately the next six months. Until then, the following regulatory forecasts are based on the existing agenda and informed political and policy analysis.

U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)—Wage and Hour Division (WHD)

In 2025, the WHD took steps to implement the administration’s new policy agenda. Examples include the resuscitation of the Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program, issuing several new Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) opinion letters, and walking back enforcement of the Biden-era independent contractor regulation. In 2026, however, the WHD can be expected to accelerate its rulemaking agenda, particularly now that Andrew Rogers has been installed as wage and hour administrator. Examples of rulemakings that WHD can be expected to pursue in 2026 include the independent contractor and joint-employer tests under the FLSA, as well as the rescission of the December 2024 dual jobs rule for tipped employees. Proposed regulations relating to exemptions from minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for certain employees are categorized as “long-term actions” in the most recent regulatory agenda.

DOL—Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, David Keeling, was not confirmed by the U.S. Senate until October 2025, and he has not had a lot of time at the helm of the workplace safety agency. However, in 2025, OSHA took steps to reduce penalties for small businesses, proposed revisions to twenty-six standards, and relaunched its opinion letter program. What is on Keeling’s agenda for 2026?

Perhaps the most significant policy question facing OSHA in 2026 concerns the fate of the Biden-era heat injury and illness prevention standard proposal. Rather than pausing the proposal or scrapping it altogether, OSHA has actually moved forward with the proposal, holding public hearings on the matter during the summer of 2025. But while OSHA pushes ahead with the proposal, the Spring Regulatory Agenda has provided no further updates on next steps. Will OSHA issue a final rule, presumably with changes based on the public feedback? If so, will it be a logical outgrowth of the proposal, or will the agency have to issue an entirely new proposal? The next regulatory agenda should provide some clues as to where the proposal is heading.

In 2026, employers can also expect OSHA to move forward with proposed modifications to the general duty clause, the lock-out/tag-out standard, walking-working surfaces, as well as a potential proposed standard relating to tree care work. There was no entry in the Spring Regulatory Agenda regarding OSHA’s controversial “walkaround rule,” which has been challenged in federal court.

Although independent of OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) plays an important role in adjudicating workplace safety disputes between OSHA and employers. Unfortunately, OSHRC still lacks a quorum and won’t be able to issue decisions until another commissioner is appointed—perhaps in 2026.

U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)

In 2025, under the leadership of now-Chair Andrea Lucas, the EEOC made it clear that it prioritizes investigations of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)–related discrimination and “anti-American” national origin discrimination, ensuring religious liberty in the workplace, and preserving women’s rights to single-sex spaces, among other areas. However, for much of the year, the Commission lacked a quorum. And it still lacks a Senate-confirmed general counsel (though President Donald Trump has nominated management attorney M. Carter Crow to fill that role). However, on October 27, 2025, Brittany Bull Panuccio was sworn in as commissioner, restoring a quorum to the EEOC. In 2026, she is likely to join Chair Lucas in revisiting regulations implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, as well as the Commission’s guidance on harassment in the workplace.

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)

Lacking a functional quorum for nearly all of 2025, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) failed to address any of the numerous Biden-era Board policies that tilted the labor-management landscape in favor of labor unions. Those policies included ambush election regulations, as well as decisions limiting employers’ abilities to communicate with employees, a lowered standard for the issuance of bargaining orders, expanded remedies, and a second-guessing of commonsense workplace rules, among others.

With Scott Mayer and James Murphy joining lone Democrat David Prouty on the Board, there is now a quorum. However, as the Buzz has discussed on multiple occasions, overturning that Biden-era precedent might not happen so quickly. That’s because the Board traditionally does not overturn existing law unless there are three affirmative votes. So, it is very likely that a third Republican member will need to be confirmed and appointed before the case rollback can really begin. That said, Mayer and Murphy have the authority to amend or address the ambush regulations or engage in other rulemaking. The Board can also begin addressing the current backlog by ruling on noncontroversial cases.

The Board also faces external legal pressures that potentially jeopardize its continued validity.

Federal district courts in New York and California have ruled that recently passed laws in each state that grant authority to state public employment boards to intervene in private-sector labor matters are preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. The lack of a Board quorum was likely a motivating factor in enacting those laws; now that there is a quorum at the Board, combined with the courts’ decisions, we are unlikely to see similar efforts in the future.

However, whether statutory removal protections for both Board members and NLRB administrative law judges are unconstitutional has been addressed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

How—and if—these issues are resolved will have a significant impact on how the Board operates and makes policy, which will clearly have an impact on employers.

Immigration (DOL, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security)

2025 was clearly a year of massive upheaval in the immigration policy arena. Among other issues, the administration sought to end birthright citizenship, instituted multiple travel bans, rescinded Temporary Protected Status from multiple countries, instituted social media vetting for tourists, H-1B holders, and foreign national students, instituted a $100,000 entry fee for H-1B visa holders, and at the very end of 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) finalized its H-1B weighted selection rule. In 2026, the administration is expected to continue to scrutinize lawful immigration, and employers should monitor the following developments:",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14838_2817.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:58:19.747293

Nigel Farage and Reform UK continue to blur the distinctions between “asylum seeker”, “illegal immigrant” and “foreign-born national” (a category that includes naturalised citizens like me) and have even threatened mass deportations for those with indefinite leave to remain. This “fudge”, borrowed from the playbooks of would-be authoritarians throughout history, is deliberate.

The Labour government and our hapless Tory opposition are sleepwalking our country into a future far-right takeover of British politics.

A separate poll from YouGov asking respondents to describe how they would describe ""the tactics currently used by ICE"" released Jan. 8 showed that 51% said they were ""too forceful."" The polls each surveyed 2,686 U.S. adults.

A YouGov poll taken in February 2025, just after President Donald Trump took office, showed ICE had a net favorability of 16 percentage points.

The killing of Good and the injury of two people by Customs and Border Protection agents in Portland, Oregon on Jan. 8 sparked a wave of protests across the country that started Jan. 10.

The Department of Homeland Security and Trump administration officials have claimed both shootings were done in self-defense. Analysis of video from the scene of the shooting in Minneapolis done by the New York Times shows Good's vehicle appeared to be turning away from the officer.

Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, previously told USA TODAY a full investigation into the killing of Good is needed, but said the video appears to contradict the Trump administration's description of the incident. ""It clearly looks like she was driving away,"" Alpert said. ""She turned her wheel and looked like she was trying to escape.""

Local officials in Minnesota and Oregon have called for state investigations into both shootings.

The shootings in the first full week of 2026 were the latest involving federal agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive – and often contentious approach – to immigration enforcement. Trump ran on a promise to enforce mass deportations and has deployed heavily-armed federal agents to cities to carry out his plans.

The court’s December order affirmed all members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.
“The law is crystal-clear: the Trump administration cannot block Members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities.
“A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped.
Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities?","Twelve members of Congress have returned to federal court after the Trump-Vance administration secretly re-imposed a policy that blocks unannounced congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. The members filed a motion urgently asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law guaranteeing members of Congress the ability to conduct oversight of ICE facilities. The court’s December order affirmed all members’ rights under federal law to conduct this oversight.

Joe Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al. was filed in July 2025 after the Trump-Vance administration unlawfully imposed a policy requiring members of Congress to give advance notice before conducting oversight visits at immigration detention facilities, interfering with Congress’s constitutional oversight authority, and preventing lawmakers from examining conditions and government conduct as incidents of violence against detainees was on the rise.

Last month, the court preliminarily stopped DHS’s policy, affirming the rights of members to conduct unannounced visits. However, after an ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen last week, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem quietly signed a new memorandum reinstating the same seven-day notice requirement. The existence of the memo, which had not been shared with plaintiffs or the court, only came to light after three members of the Minnesota congressional delegation were subsequently denied access to an ICE facility in Minnesota, despite having the court order in hand.

Democracy Forward and American Oversight represent plaintiffs in this case, including Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Dan Goldman; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

“The law is crystal-clear: the Trump administration cannot block Members of Congress from conducting real-time oversight of immigration detention facilities. Instead of complying with the law, DHS is abrogating the court’s order by re-imposing the same unlawful policy. Their actions are outrageous and subverting the law, which is why we are going back to court to challenge it — immediately,” said Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse, lead plaintiff.

“The Trump administration has now made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” said our Executive Director Chioma Chukwu. “A federal court affirmed that members of Congress have a clear legal right to conduct unannounced oversight visits, yet DHS appears to have quietly resurrected the very policy the court stopped. That kind of end-run around the law undermines transparency, accountability, and the constitutional system of checks and balances. We are proud to stand with members of Congress as they demand that the administration explain their latest secrecy and obstruction.”

“What are they hiding? Why does the Trump-Vance administration continue to implement policies to block members of Congress – who represent the people and have legal obligations to conduct oversight – from accessing ICE facilities? The answer has become more and more clear: what ICE is doing is harmful and indefensible, and this administration does not want checks and balances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “A federal court issued an order in December preventing the Trump-Vance administration’s attempts to prevent individual members of Congress from conducting oversight, and yet Secretary Noem and DHS appear to be seeking to circumvent the court’s order. This threat to the rule of law and our system of checks and balances should concern every single American. We look forward to seeking answers in court about what the government has done here.”",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/AODF-Neguse-press-release-image-1.12.26.png,N,,2026-01-12 14:57:17.589621

Residents pushed back, led by a growing network of rapid responders hounding U.S. ICE and Border Patrol vehicles and agents across the metro area.

Thousands marched peacefully in Minneapolis Saturday to remember Good and protest the Trump administration’s expanding immigration crackdown. Many marchers stopped to pay their respects as the procession moved from Powderhorn Park past the intersection where the fatal shooting occurred.

Saturday’s protest, the largest since Good’s killing, was more subdued than a Friday evening gathering outside downtown Minneapolis hotels where ICE agents were said to be staying.

Protesters blew whistles, banged drums and shouted taunts outside the hotels for hours before some tried to force their way into the Canopy by Hilton at 700 Third Street South, causing about $6,000 in damage, the Star Tribune reported. City and state police ordered protesters to disperse around midnight and arrested about 30 people without incident, officials said Saturday.

Near Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, a smaller group braved chilly winds to maintain a near-permanent presence outside an ICE operations hub and detention center.

U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building shortly after arriving for what they called an oversight visit on Saturday morning.

Later in the day, Politico reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — who oversees ICE and said this weekend she’d ordered hundreds more agents to join at least 2,000 already in the Twin Cities — signed an order on Thursday requiring a week’s notice for Congressional visits to immigrant detention centers.

Multiple people released from Whipple told independent journalists that they’d been verbally or physically abused in or en route to detention there. Two said agents used demeaning language to describe Good and suggested she’d deserved her fate.

The Reformer has not independently verified the Whipple detainees’ claims. In a separate video posted on Sunday by a Minneapolis Reddit user, an ICE agent tells a driver to “[g]o home to your children…have you not learned from what just happened?”

Sunday saw more reports of federal law enforcement activity in St. Paul. One bystander video purported to show agents going “door to door” on Thomas Avenue near Victoria Street, possibly making good on Vice President JD Vance’s promise earlier this week of house-by-house immigration operations. Armed personnel questioned shoppers at a nearby Target. And a crowd heckled agents as they appeared to pull a man out of his car at a gas station on Snelling Avenue.

A multi-agency operation that at times felt like an outright occupation had many Twin Cities residents — not just hardened activists — calling for ICE to withdraw and deeper reform of federal immigration policy.

On Sunday, outgoing U.S. Sen. Tina Smith told CNN that she was listening, but stopped short of promising to lead the “abolish ICE” movement in Washington.

“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community,” she said. “I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 15:57:57.899231

Jerome Powell responds to criminal investigation into him and the Fed

01:55

Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the Federal Reserve’s $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC.

In an extraordinary video posted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, on Sunday night, he called the investigation “pretext” resulting from his ongoing struggle with the administration over interest rates, saying it was a consequence of broader “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration.

The probe sends a potentially chilling message to Powell – and to whomever might next lead the Fed. President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Fed chair have hammered on the Fed’s traditional political independence, suggesting whomever he selects to replace Powell when his term ends in May will face continuing pressure.

Video footage shows a chaotic scene as federal agents outside a Minneapolis home encounter activists before detaining someone inside the house.

In one part, agents are seen spraying what appears to be a chemical irritant from a vehicle at activists.

People are then seen asking for water after apparently being sprayed, with one person shouting, “Who has water? Somebody please get water. F**ing A. Are you okay? We need water!” video shows.

Later in the video, armed federal agents approach a home and use a ramming tool to force open the door as other agents encounter activists in the front yard.

President Donald Trump says the US is “talking to Cuba” hours after he ramped up pressure in a social media post where he said he “strongly suggests” the nation make a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

“We’re talking to Cuba and you’ll find out pretty soon,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Sunday night when asked what kind of a deal he is seeking.

“One of the things I want taken care of, and one of the groups I want taken care of are the people that came from Cuba that were forced out or left under duress and they are great citizens of the United States right now,” Trump said. “You have a lot of people forced out of Cuba unfairly.”

Trump did not answer directly when asked if there were plans to seize any oil tankers headed to Cuba.

President Donald Trump said Sunday that his administration is monitoring the deadly protests in Iran and is continuing to weigh potential military options.

“There seem to be some people killed that aren’t supposed to be killed. These are violent, if you call them leaders. I don’t know if their leaders are just they rule through violence, but we’re looking at it very seriously,” Trump told reporters. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options. We’ll make it determination.”

CNN previously reported Trump is weighing a series of potential military options in Iran and was briefed in recent days on different plans for intervention.

Trump also said that his administration may speak to Elon Musk about getting Iranians access to Starlink, the tech billionaire’s satellite internet service.

When asked how the United States would react if Iran were to strike American military bases, Trump said, “We will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before.”

CNN reported earlier Sunday that there are concerns inside the administration that military strikes could backfire and undermine the protests. The concerns, the officials said, are that strikes could have the unintended effect of rallying the Iranian people to support the government, or lead Iran to retaliate with military force of its own.

President Donald Trump said he “did not like” ExxonMobile’s response when asked by reporters Sunday night on whether any oil companies have pledged commitments to Trump’s decision to rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry. Trump’s comments come after ExxonMobil’s CEO warned that the country is “uninvestible” in its current state.

“No, I didn’t like Exxon’s response,” Trump said. “We would probably be inclined to keep Exxon out.”

ExxonMobil CEO Darren Wood stated at a White House gathering of oil executives Friday that the company would not be diving headfirst into Venezuela, saying the current situation on the ground presents an unacceptable risk to the company.

Trump said he will personally decide which US companies can enter Venezuela and rebuild its oil industry. Oil executives largely declined to commit to such a deal during Friday’s meeting.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s demand to make a deal on Sunday, saying the country is an independent and sovereign nation that won’t be bossed around.

“No one dictates what we do,” the Cuban leader said on X. “Cuba does not aggress; it is aggressed upon by the United States for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood.”

He also said those who turn everything into a business, “even human lives,” have no moral authority to point fingers at his country.

Earlier, Trump ramped up pressure on the communist island, saying he “strongly suggests” making a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the Caribbean country has an “absolute right” to import fuel from economic partners without US pressure.

He also rejected Trump’s claim that Cuba provided “security services” to Venezuela in exchange for oil and money.

“The US is behaving like a criminal and uncontrolled hegemon that threatens peace and security not only of Cuba and this hemisphere but of the entire world,” Rodriguez said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem barred lawmakers from visiting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities without a week’s notice, as political tensions mount following the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent.

Noem issued the directive on Thursday, according to a statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, due to “escalating riots and political violence targeting buildings and facilities used by ICE.”

Protests have broken out in Minneapolis and around the country after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent on Wednesday. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Saturday that most demonstrators have acted peacefully, but warned that those who damaged property or endangered others would be arrested.

McLaughlin argued that Noem is acting to “ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike.”

“Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers from their normal duties. This guidance has been issued to protect all parties and ensure that ICE and DHS are fully cooperating with lawful court orders,” the statement continues.

Though a federal court in DC ruled late last year that US lawmakers have the right to visit facilities funded by Congress, DHS said ICE detention facilities are funded by President Donald Trump’s domestic policy law, which is exempt from that mandate.

Recent ICE operations across the US have seen a “radical shift” in tactics that remove agents from their core missions and training while exposing them to greater danger, former Acting ICE Director John Sandweg said on Sunday.

“What I’m looking at generally in this is wondering, how did we get ICE officers in a position where we are today? We have seen a shift in tactics at ICE that has increased the number of assaults on the agents themselves, exposing them to greater danger,” Sandweg said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”

Sandweg’s comments come in the wake of Wednesday’s ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Sandweg, who was the acting director from 2013-2014, said in the past the majority of ICE’s arrests would be of individuals already in custody by other agencies.

“We’ve shifted ICE to where they’re doing a lot more at-large street operations. We’ve pulled these Border Patrol up off the street, outside their normal operating environment. Instead of the Southwest desert, they’re now in these urban cities. And then we’ve preannounced that we’re coming, thus giving these protesters an opportunity to get organized and forcing these agents to have to deal with this,” he added.

“All of this is a radical shift, and when you take these officers out of their core experiences, and really different than their core training, unfortunately, what happened in Minneapolis and what’s happening kind of writ large with these use of force incidents, is really what you have to expect,” Sandweg said.

President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post today ramped up the pressure on Cuba, saying he “strongly suggests” the nation make a deal with Washington and that it won’t receive any more money from Venezuela’s oil industry.

“Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided “Security Services” for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” Trump wrote.

The post continued: “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last weeks U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!”

“I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he added.

Cuba for decades has relied on massive aid packages from its ally, oil-rich Venezuela, for its survival. Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s capture during a US operation, and Trump’s announcement that Venezuela will turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, could therefore lead to economic trouble for Cuba’s communist government.

The Cuban government, in a post on Facebook, said 32 of its citizens were killed during the US operation to capture Maduro “in combat actions, performing missions on behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, at the request of counterparts of the South American country.”

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called Vice President JD Vance a “great” option for a 2028 presidential nominee, while still not ruling out his own bid for the 2028 GOP ticket, in a new interview.

“I think as people speculate on what’s going to happen down the road in 2028, I agree with President Trump and Marco Rubio,” the Republican governor said in an interview on “FOX News Sunday.” “I think JD Vance would make a great, great presidential nominee.”

Youngkin’s term as Virginia governor concludes this week as the one-term position will turnover to Democrat Gov.-elect Abigial Spanberger on Saturday. Youngkin said in November that he will not run for US Senate, but he has been rumored as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.

While supporting Vance, the governor did not rule out the possibility of his own run for president. He instead said he is focused on finishing out his term in Virginia and stressed the importance of Republicans maintaining both majorities in Congress later this year with victories in the 2026 midterm elections.

“I think the most important thing we can do, just like Vice President Vance said recently, is stay focused on the here and now.” Youngkin said when asked if he would run. When pressed again for a yes or no, he just reiterated that Vance would be a great nominee.

Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, of Minnesota, said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement should be “reformed, not abolished,” after an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in her home state, and she added that she’s willing to withhold her vote on a key funding bill in Congress over the issue.

“Clearly, I see a role in our country for strong border security, but we need to get serious about what is actually happening with this unaccountable agency that is not abiding by any of the laws or the procedures that we would expect to see from professional law enforcement,” she told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”

Smith, who is retiring after this term, left the door open to joining her progressive colleagues who have urged the party to draw a “red line” over demands to include ICE restrictions in ongoing negotiations to pass funding bills to avert a shutdown by the end of the month.

“It is hard for me to imagine how I could vote to support a budget bill for the Department of Homeland Security, given how the Department of Homeland Security is functioning right now in my community. I want to see work done that would bring some serious reforms to ICE,” she said.

Smith also cast doubt on the federal government’s ability to conduct a legitimate probe of the shooting, as administration officials blame rhetoric by Democrats for the violence.

“I don’t see how we can trust the outcome of this probe when they are blocking out state investigators and when the people that are in charge, that are in power in the Trump administration, have already said what they think has happened here,” she said. “It seems clearly that it would be a prejudiced investigation to me.”

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem today stood by the comments she made immediately after the shooting death of a Minnesota mother by an ICE officer last week, when she said Renee Good committed an act of domestic terrorism by trying to run over an ICE agent.

“If you look at what the definition of domestic terrorism is, it completely fits the situation on the ground,” Noem told Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

She added: “This individual, as you saw in the video that we released just 48 hours after this incident, showed that this officer was hit by her vehicle. She weaponized it, and he defended his life and those colleagues around him and the public.”

Pressed on how she could have asserted that there’s no ambiguity in the situation or Good’s motives before an investigation plays out, Noem said she had spoken to the officers and their supervisors and watched videos before she went to speak at the press conference after the shooting.

Noem did not acknowledge the possibility that Good could have been fleeing the scene.

“The facts of the situation are that the vehicle was weaponized, and it attacked the law enforcement officer. He defended himself, and he defended those individuals around him,” Noem said.

Context: On the day of the shooting, Noem held a press conference where she said good “refused to obey (the ICE officer’s) commands. She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run a law enforcement officer over. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to agents; an act of domestic terrorism.”

When confronted on CNN’s “State of the Union” with a video of January 6, 2021, rioters, who were pardoned by President Donald Trump, attacking law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed that laws are equally enforced under the Trump administration.

Anchor Jake Tapper asked Noem if she believes that law enforcement would have been justified in using deadly force against those attacking them on January 6, based on her assessment of the Minneapolis shooting.

“Every single situation is going to rely on the situation those officers are in,” Noem said. “But they know that when people are putting hands on them, when they are using weapons against them, when they are physically harming them, that they have the authority to arrest those individuals, and make sure they’re facing the consequences.”

Pressed on Trump pardoning people who assaulted police officers that day, Noem said Trump is focused on equally enforcing laws.

“Every single one of these investigations comes in the full context of the situation on the ground,” Noem said. “That’s one thing that President Trump has been so focused on, is making sure that when we’re out there, we don’t pick and choose which situations are and which laws are enforced and which ones aren’t. Every single one of them is being enforced under the Trump administration.”

Tapper responded, “I showed you video of people attacking law enforcement officers. Undisputed proof, undisputed evidence, and I just said, ‘President Trump pardoned all of them,’ and you said that President Trump is enforcing all the laws equally. It’s just not true.”

Noem responded: “These instances and these investigations all have to be taken and done and done correctly in context of every situation that is happening on the ground,” adding that her department is making sure it is “targeting the worst of the worst, and that we’re talking factually about each situation.”

Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said the federal government is stoking “chaos” with its heavy-handed immigration enforcement efforts in the wake of last week’s shooting death of a US citizen.

“What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they’re wearing a mask. They’re approaching, running towards cars. They’re pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens,” Omar said Sunday on CBS’ “Face The Nation.”

“What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would,” she added.

Omar’s comments come in the wake of Wednesday’s ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Omar said it is important for Americans to “create the level of accountability and transparency that we need” when it comes to ICE-involved activities.

“Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place,” Omar said.

“There is no reason to have over 2,000 people coming into our city and creating the level of terror that they have,” she added.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2254503071.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-12 15:58:02.155176

Federal courts in 2025 raised the bar on who can bring FCA cases and when, strictly enforcing government dismissal authority, the first-to-file rule, and the public disclosure/original source bar — meaning many follow-on or copycat healthcare qui tam suits are being dismissed before reaching the merits.

Heightened pleading and proof standards now dominate FCA healthcare litigation, with courts repeatedly throwing out complaints that allege broad “schemes” without tying them to specific false claims, particularized facts of falsity, scienter, and materiality, and reliable indicia that the government actually paid because of the alleged misconduct.

Substantive FCA theories are being narrowed, especially around AKS causation, reverse false claims defenses, and retaliation, as courts demand but-for causation for AKS-based FCA claims in some circuits, a clear “obligation” for reverse false claims, and concrete notice and causation for retaliation. This reinforces the need for rigorous compliance programs, careful documentation, and early case assessment in FCA risk matters.

The False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes liability on anyone who knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government. 31 U.S.C.S. § 3729 (a)(1)(A). In 2025, federal appellate courts refined how FCA claims must be properly partied, pled, and proved. This survey of key decisions underscores courts’ increasing emphasis on procedural bars, heightened pleading requirements, and rigorous proof of falsity, scienter, and materiality in healthcare cases. If you have questions about how these developments affect your compliance strategy, our team is ready to explore strategies to help you navigate the risks.

Government Dismissal

Under § 3730(c)(1), when the government intervenes, it retains primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and is not bound by the relator’s acts. The relator may continue as a party — filing motions and conducting discovery — but only “subject to the limitations set forth in [§ 3730(c)(2)].” § 3730(c)(1). In Vanderlan v. United States, 135 F.4th 257 (5th Cir. 2025), the court reasoned that the statutory scheme shows that the government retains ultimate authority over qui tam litigation and affirmed the district court’s grant of the government’s motion to dismiss the relator’s action.

First-to-File Bar

The FCA bars anyone other than the government from bringing “a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(b)(5). In United States ex rel. Rosales v. Amedisys N.C., L.L.C., 128 F.4th 548 (4th Cir. 2025), Relator Rosales’s FCA claims against multiple defendants (Amedisys Holding, a North Carolina subsidiary, and others), were barred by the first-to-file rule because they alleged the same nationwide fraudulent scheme as a different relator’s earlier complaint against Amedisys Holding and a South Carolina subsidiary. The earlier complaint alerted the government to the same alleged fraud against the North Carolina subsidiary. Rosales’s amendment adding claims against a specific medical director and his medical practice did not salvage Rosales’ claims, as the prior relator’s complaint included allegations against Amedisys Holdings’ medical directors.

Public Disclosure Bar

A court must dismiss an FCA action “if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed . . . unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A). An “original source” is “an individual who either (i) prior to a public disclosure under subsection (e)(4)(a), has voluntarily disclosed to the Government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based, or (2) [(ii)] who has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions, and who has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section.” Id. § 3730(e)(4)(B). Courts continued to apply the public disclosure bar strictly, as shown in the following cases.

United States ex rel. Winnon v. Lozano, 146 F.4th 1197 (D.C. Cir. 2025). Relator Winnon’s claims overlapped with a prior complaint that alleged that the defendants’ facility, RehabCare, ordered its program directors to assign ultra-high resource utilization group (“RUG”) levels to all new patients — without regard to clinical need — because higher Medicare reimbursements meant higher profits. Winnon’s complaint additionally claimed that the scheme spread to several SNFs where RehabCare systematically steered patients into inflated RUG levels. The court affirmed application of the public disclosure bar, finding that the central actor and scheme Winnon alleged were materially identical to the prior complaint and that Winnon’s “additional examples of an already exposed scheme [did] not breathe life into an otherwise barred claim.” Further, Winnon was not an original source because she did not allege with any specificity that she voluntarily provided the relevant information to the government before the prior action or filing her qui tam suit.

United States ex rel. Sam Jones Co., LLC v. Biotronik, Inc., 152 F.4th 946 (9th Cir. 2025). The plaintiff alleged that Biotronik had hired Brian Goodman as a sales representative because his brother, Dr. Jeffrey Goodman, was then implanting an extremely high volume of cardiac devices at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. According to the complaint, Brian recommended Biotronik devices to his brother, who implanted the devices at Cedars-Sinai, Cedars-Sinai billed federal public health insurance programs for the devices, and Biotronik paid Brian a commission on each sale. The district court dismissed the action as barred by prior New York Times’ reporting that Biotronik used various financial incentives to encourage physicians to use its cardiac rhythm management devices rather than devices sold by Biotronik’s competitors. Reversing, the appellate court found that the complaint included new, specific allegations not previously reported, such as Biotronik’s employing doctors’ family members as sales representatives and violations of the Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”). The court observed that while the news article generally suggested the practice alleged in the qui tam suit, it did not disclose the “critical mass of the underlying facts” in the plaintiff’s complaint.

United States ex rel. 3729, LLC v. Express Scripts, Inc., No. 23-55645, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 2453 (9th Cir. Feb. 4, 2025) (unpublished). The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that a whistleblower action accusing Express Scripts Inc. (“ESI”) of defrauding the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) out of billions of dollars in unnecessary medications for military personnel wasn’t barred by any public disclosures of the alleged fraud. Under the regulations that apply to ESI’s participation in Tricare (DOD’s health insurance program), “fraud” presumptively includes billings or claims that involve flagrant and persistent overutilization of services without proper regard for results, the patient’s ailments, condition, medical needs, or the physician’s orders, or that are for services that would be covered except for the frequency or duration of the services. The district court barred relator’s complaint due to a military publication’s prior report that Tricare’s pharmacy benefit was wasting money by shipping unnecessary drugs or dispensing 90-day refills instead of 30-day refills. The report also described beneficiaries with drugs piled up in medicine cabinets. But the appellate court reasoned that the practices described in the report were not substantially similar to the transactions the relator alleged, which involved systematically shipping needed refills too early. Moreover, statements in the report did not disclose facts sufficient to infer that ESI was flagrantly or persistently overfilling prescriptions, without regard to need, by deliberately using a systematic practice of shipping 90 days’ worth of refills after 60 days.

Failure to Plead With Particularity

Because FCA claims allege fraud, they must meet heightened pleading standards beyond those that apply in ordinary civil actions. Specifically, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) requires plaintiffs to state with particularity the circumstances constituting the fraud, a showing that generally requires details about the time, place, and manner of the fraud.

United States ex rel. Winnon v. Lozano, 146 F.4th 1197 (D.C. Cir. 2025). Relator Winnon alleged that the defendants schemed their way to improper reimbursement by: (1) paying off doctors and hospital discharge planners for patient referrals to skilled nursing facilities; and (2) inflating therapy patient classifications to maximize reimbursements. The court found that Winnon’s allegations regarding inducements to personnel lacked critical details necessary to state a plausible claim. She had failed to identify any specific agreements conditioning payment on referrals or connect any payments to actual claims submitted to Medicare or Medicaid. Without the missing details, the court could only “glean inferences — faintly, with squinted eyes.” Regarding Winnon’s inflated therapy billing claims, the court concluded that her reliance on statistical anomalies fell short of satisfying Rule 9(b)s heightened pleading standard, as she failed either to provide specific examples of improperly classified patients or explain how the fraudulent scheme was executed.

United States ex rel. Flanagan v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc., 142 F.4th 25 (1st Cir. 2025). Relator alleged that Fresenius contracted to provide inpatient dialysis services to hospitals below cost to help secure outpatient dialysis patients after their hospital discharge. Fresenius also engaged hospital nephrologists who were in positions to refer high numbers of patients to Fresenius to serve as medical directors at Fresenius outpatient facilities, often paying them more than twice the salary as paid by Fresenius’s primary competitor in the same localities. According to Flanagan, Medicare regulations required that medical directors “devote sufficient time” to this position. Fresenius did not require its medical directors to document their time. Flanagan argued that Fresenius made false records by falsely certifying compliance with the AKS and listing the number of hours that medical directors worked. However, the Court found that Flanagan’s Complaint did not address what Fresenius actually submitted in the reports, either as to certifications or as to hours worked by medical directors, and failed to plead with particularity that Fresenius made false statements or records with intent that the government rely on them as a condition of payment.

United States v. Bracco USA, Inc., No. 24-1668, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 10505 (3d Cir. May 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that Bracco provided free power machines to medical facilities in exchange for their agreement to purchase 90% of their imaging agents from Bracco for 30 years. The agreements required the providers to comply with the antikickback disclosure rules by accounting for the free machines in their cost reports to federal payors. The providers billed federal payors for imaging services and agents used with the free machines. The court found that though the relator had alleged in detail how the free machines could have been used to defraud the government, describing a mere opportunity for fraud would not suffice, and the relator did not plead with particularity any reliable indicia that the free machines were not disclosed to the government.

United States v. Fillmore Capital Partners, LLC, No. 24-1606, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7502 (3d Cir. Apr. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that the defendant’s nursing home schemed to overbill federal payors by admitting high-acuity residents while understaffing facilities. But his allegations (supported by expert reports, affidavits from other nurses, and personal experience) did not provide reliable indicia of fraud. The court recognized that the nursing home had a financial incentive in minimizing, to the extent permitted by law and regulation, staffing and overhead costs to maximize its profits. Thus, the existence of a legitimate business explanation for the nursing home’s low staffing decision militated against any “strong inference” of fraud as required by the the court’s precedent.

Bennett v. Bayer Corp., No. 24-1807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8423 (3d Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that pharmaceutical companies Bayer Corp. and Johnson and Johnson “had to have known” that certain antibiotics they manufactured caused serious side effects (including neurological and psychiatric damage), but misrepresented information about these side effects to the FDA. Per the relator, this fraudulently induced the FDA to approve the drugs without appropriate warning labels, leading to false claims being submitted to federal payors. The court observed that the relator failed to allege what, if anything, the defendants knew or withheld, offering only a “textbook Rule 9(b) pleading deficiency in the form of speculation.”

United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472 (4th Cir. 2025). Wheeler alleged that Acadia falsified therapy notes for group and individual sessions that were never provided. She provided multiple examples of false therapy notes that were repeatedly used to falsify patient records, identified Acadia staff who created and signed the notes, and specified the dates and descriptions of the fictitious therapy sessions. But the court only approved Wheeler’s claims regarding Acadia’s North Carolina facilities where she worked. In contrast, she failed to allege with sufficient particularity that any facilities outside of North Carolina were falsifying therapy notes­ — her mere allegation that a corporate-wide policy existed, without more, was insufficient.

United States ex rel. Gentry v. Encompass Health Rehab. Hosp. of Pearland, L.L.C., 157 F.4th 758 (5th Cir. 2025). Gentry alleged physicians admitted patients to inpatient-rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) by rubberstamping the non-clinical judgment of sales representatives, in violation of CMS’ requirement that clinicians exercise their medical judgment in making admission decisions. The court found that Gentry’s allegations were facially benign because Medicare allowed nonclinical personnel to gather data for IRF preadmission screenings, so long as a clinician evaluates the information and makes the final admission decision. Gentry’s inference that the physicians did not evaluate the screening information was based on timing alone, and was speculative at best. Also, her conclusory allegation about Medicare billing lacked the particularity required to infer submission of false claims.

United States ex rel. VIB Partners v. LHC Grp., Inc., No. 24-5393, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 9027 (6th Cir. Apr. 14, 2025) (unpublished). The relators alleged that a home healthcare provider submitted false patient data to exaggerate patient needs, thereby inflating Medicare reimbursement rates. The relators argued that their allegations described a systemic scheme of fraud. But the court reasoned that relators cannot survive a Rule 9(b) challenge by alleging a systemic scheme alone, but must also identify at least one false claim submitted to the government.

United States v. Tenet Healthcare Corp., No. 24-1785, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 9727 (6th Cir. Apr. 22, 2025) (unpublished). The relators alleged that Tenet and its subsidiary fraudulently billed the government for inpatient care that the patients did not and could not receive. The relators offered representative samples of patients who had inpatient admission orders but were instead held in emergency room facilities and therefore should have been billed as outpatients. The court concluded that each of the relators’ examples described egregious lapses in patient care, but fell short of the specificity pertaining to filing a fraudulent claim for payment required to satisfy Rule 9(b). General policies and practices, as troubling as they may be, cannot satisfy Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirements without further detail.

Childs v. SEIU, No. 23-4334, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 15352 (9th Cir. June 23, 2025) (unpublished). The relator challenged the defendants’ use of state-controlled Medicaid funding allocated to trusts intended to benefit home care workers. The court affirmed the dismissal of the relator’s case because he failed to allege that any false “claim” had been submitted to the federal government, as required under the Act. The relator had merely alleged that in certain reports, filed with the government pursuant to federal reporting laws had misrepresented how trust funding was used. Such reports, regardless of their truth or falsity, are not “claims” as they are not requests for money or property from the federal government.

Vargas ex rel. Alvarez v. Lincare, Inc., 134 F.4th 1150 (11th Cir. 2025). The relators alleged systemic upcoding of durable medical equipment, improper kickback arrangement, waiver of co-pays, and shipment of unordered supplies. The relators provided specific allegations to support the upcoding claims, identifying patients, billing codes, and reimbursement amounts. The court found that the relators alleged a scheme, identified specific claims allegedly paid by the government, and explained why the defendant’s coding was improper, therefore dismissal of the upcoding claim was error. But the relators’ remaining claims failed to meet Rule 9(b) particularity standards because they did not identify specific false claims submitted to the government or a link between the alleged schemes and actual claims.

United States ex rel. Plaintiffs v. Atlanta Primary Care Peachtree, PC, No. 23-13845, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 16311 (11th Cir. July 2, 2025) (unpublished). The relator’s allegations related to self-referral and kickback schemes involving genetic testing met Rule 9(b)’s particularity requirements because the relator provided details about a representative claim, including the “who, what, where, when, and how” of the allegedly fraudulent scheme. However, her allegations regarding the other schemes failed to meet Rule 9(b)’s requirements because she lacked sufficient details about representative false claims submitted to or paid by the government.

United States v. Quest Diagnostics Inc., No. 24-12998, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 17583 (11th Cir. July 16, 2025) (unpublished). The relator provided an exemplar sample of a false claim that she alleged supported liability under multiple theories. The court concluded that no matter which theory she pursued, her complaint rose and fell with the fact that she failed to plead with particularity that a false claim was submitted to the government. The relator had access to the defendant’s billing system and confirmed that the defendant was submitting claims to the government, but failed to provide any specific details regarding either the dates on or the frequency with which the defendants submitted false claims, the amounts of those claims, or the patients whose treatment served as the basis for the claims.

Falsity

The FCA, codified at 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-33, forbids knowingly submitting a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government.

United States ex rel. Montcrief v. Peripheral Vascular Assocs., P.A., 133 F.4th 395 (5th Cir. 2025). Peripheral Vascular Associates, P.A. (“PVA”), a vascular surgery practice, utilized technicians to perform ultrasounds, which would then be read and interpreted by a physician. PVA would bill Medicare for both services under a single code. At least some of these “globally” coded claims were submitted before the physician reviewed the ultrasounds. This was therefore a “paradigmatic case” involving “a request for reimbursement for goods or services” that had not yet been furnished, rendering the claims factually false.

United States v. Fillmore Capital Partners, LLC, No. 24-1606, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 7502 (3d Cir. Apr. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that the defendant’s nursing home schemed to overbill federal payors by admitting high-acuity residents while understaffing facilities. Nonetheless, the court affirmed that the relator’s claims failed to allege factual falsity on an “inflated claims” theory or a “worthless services” theory because he failed to allege that the nursing home submitted false claims.

Scienter

The FCA imposes liability on anyone who “knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval” to the federal government. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(A). Either actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or recklessness regarding the claim’s falsity will suffice to show scienter. 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(1)(A)(i)-(iii).

United States ex rel. Omni Healthcare Inc. v. Md. Spine Sols. LLC, No. 25-1110, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 31085 (1st Cir. Dec. 1, 2025) (unpublished). The relator ordered assistants in his seven-office medical practice to order only polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) urinary tract infection tests from the defendant, even if the ordering physician had specified a less-expensive bacterial urine culture test. The relator then alleged that the defendant knowingly submitted false claims for more expensive PCR tests that were not reasonable and necessary. As a matter of first impression, the court held that in FCA cases alleging Medicare fraud based on laboratory testing, generally a laboratory can rely on a doctor’s order to show that the test is “reasonable and necessary.” Further, the relator failed to rebut this presumption by showing that the defendant knew or should have known the PCR tests were unnecessary.

Materiality

The FCA imposes liability where a person “knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(B). The statute defines “material” as “having a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.” 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(4). A misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the government’s payment decision in order to be actionable under the FCA. Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 181 (2016).

Bennett v. Bayer Corp., No. 24-1807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8423 (3d Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that pharmaceutical companies Bayer Corp. and Johnson and Johnson “had to have known” that certain antibiotics they manufactured caused serious side effects (including neurological and psychiatric damage), but misrepresented information about these side effects to FDA. Specifically, the relator alleged that the defendants disaggregated data, allowing them to report relatively low rates of multiple side effects instead of grouping them together as manifestations of a broader condition. Per the relator, this fraudulently induced FDA to approve the drugs without appropriate warning labels, leading to false claims being submitted to federal payors. The court held that the relator failed to plausibly allege that the data presented was misleading or that the data aggregated as the relator suggested would have led FDA to disapprove the drug or take other action.

United States ex rel. O’Laughlin v. Radiation Therapy Servs., P.S.C., 148 F.4th 791 (6th Cir. 2025). The relator alleged that the defendants fraudulently billed federal programs for radiation services that were not performed by radiation oncologists or radiologists. The court found that the relator did not show that a specific type of physician must perform the radiation services as a material precondition of payment for the claims.

United States ex rel. Streck v. Eli Lilly & Co., 152 F.4th 816 (7th Cir. 2025). The court upheld a $183 million jury verdict against Lilly regarding a relator’s allegations that the company knowingly miscalculated drug rebates owed to Medicaid. Under a deferential standard of review, the court concluded that because Lilly deprived the government of over $60 million in rebates while amassing over $600 million in revenue from subsequent price increases during the relevant period, the jury reasonably concluded the false prices reported to the government were material.

United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472 (4th Cir. 2025). Wheeler alleged that Acadia falsified therapy notes for group and individual sessions that were never provided for patients of its opioid treatment program (“OTP”). The court observed that OTPs are required to provide adequate substance use disorder counseling in order to obtain authorization to participate in government healthcare programs and remain in compliance. The court concluded that “compliance with federal methadone-assisted treatment regulations is ‘so central’ to Acadia’s methadone-assisted treatment that the government would not have paid the claims had it been aware of the violations.”

Anti-Kickback Statute

The AKS states that “[w]hoever knowingly and willfully offers or pays any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to any person to induce such person . . . to purchase . . . any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, shall be guilty of a felony . . . .” Furthermore, “a claim [for payment by a federal healthcare program] that includes items or services resulting from a violation of [the AKS] constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of” the FCA.

United States v. Regeneron Pharms., Inc., 128 F.4th 324, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 3667 (1st Cir. 2025). The government alleged that, in violation of the AKS, Regeneron knowingly induced prescriptions of a drug by covering copayments for certain patients who received the payment, and therefore Medicare claims for the drug as prescribed to those patients “resulted from” an AKS violation, whether or not those claim would have been made had Regeneron not covered the co-pay. The government urged the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to adopt the causation standard espoused by the Third Circuit — that is, that “resulting from” merely requires some connection between kickbacks and claims. The First Circuit disagreed. Joining the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, the First Circuit held that the phrase “resulting from” in the AKS imposes a requirement of but-for causation to treat an AKS violation as a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA.

United States ex rel. Flanagan v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc., 142 F.4th 25 (1st Cir. 2025). Relator Martin Flanagan, a former Fresenius employee, alleged that Fresenius created a kickback scheme to wrongfully induce referrals to its dialysis services. Fresenius allegedly contracted with hospital nephrologists who were in positions to refer high numbers of patients to Fresenius to serve as medical directors at Fresenius outpatient facilities, often paying them more than twice the salary as paid by Fresenius’s primary competitor in the same localities. Flanagan argued that he adequately pled but-for causation by articulating specific compensation relationships with specific physicians that were intended to and did result in referrals. Flanagan provided details about a particular physician who held two medical director positions with Fresenius, including the number of patients the physicians referred, and an internal Fresenius report describing the physician’s dominant role in providing referrals and stating that his contract renewal was critical. But the court concluded that these allegations did not indicate that the physician’s referrals resulted from the alleged kickback scheme, or would not have been made had the physician not been given the medical director positions.

United States ex rel. Sisselman v. Zocdoc, Inc., No. 24-2807, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 8719 (2d Cir. Apr. 14, 2025) (unpublished). The relator alleged that Zocdoc’s “booking fee” for each new patient appointment booked through its platform violated the AKS, as the fee was calculated on the estimated annual reimbursement value of the referral to the provider’s medical specialty, as opposed to fair market value. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“OIG”) had issued two advisory opinions (“AOs”) to Zocdoc, concluding that Zocdoc’s practices implicated the AKS but did not violate it. The relator’s complaint failed because he did little more than apply conclusory labels to the exact practices and fees discussed by the OIG. The relator also did not plausibly allege that Zocdoc misled the OIG, implemented its fees in a manner inconsistent with either AO, or acted with the scienter required by the FCA and the AKS.

Reverse False Claims

A reverse false claim flips the typical claim under the False Claims Act: “Direct false claims cause the United States to remit money directly to claimants, whereas reverse false claims facilitate the improper withholding of money or property to which the United States is legally entitled.” United States ex rel. Wheeler v. Acadia Healthcare Co., 127 F.4th 472, 495 (4th Cir. 2025); 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(G). In its first reverse false claim case since the FCA was amended in 2009, the Wheeler court held that the relator adequately pled her reverse false claim because the stipulated penalties in Acadia’s corporate integrity agreement (“CIA”) with the government would constitute an “obligation” under the FCA. The obligation accrued automatically upon Acadia’s alleged breach of the CIA, even though the government’s enforcement of the CIA was discretionary. The relator sufficiently alleged that the CIA’s penalties had accrued and were knowingly and improperly avoided.

Retaliation

Under 31 U.S.C. §3730(h), an employer cannot retaliate against an individual in any matter “because of lawful acts done by the employee . . . in furtherance of an [FCA enforcement] action under this section or other efforts to stop 1 or more violations” of the FCA.

Morgan-Lee v. Therapy Res. Mgmt., LLC, 129 F.4th 93 (1st Cir. 2025). The court held that 2009 FCA amendments did not undercut the court’s prior precedent that “where an employee’s job responsibilities involve overseeing government billings or payments, h[er] burden of proving that h[er] employer was on notice that [s]he was engaged in protected conduct should be heightened.” In such cases, employees should clearly show that their actions “go beyond their regular duties” so employers are only held accountable for adverse actions when aware of protected conduct. The First Circuit further affirmed that FCA retaliation claims require proof that protected activity was a but-for cause of termination.

Lewis v. AbbVie Inc., 152 F.4th 807 (7th Cir. 2025). The relator alleged that AbbVie promoted a drug for off-label use, and that he had complained to supervisors and HR regarding noncompliance regarding off-label marketing. The court observed that the relator never suggested he feared AbbVie was defrauding the government, and affirmed dismissal of the relator’s FCA retaliation claim.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15541_4759.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:58:42.610325

]” The joint statement provided that this statute “has long been construed to prohibit discrimination based on alienage” and that except to the extent consideration of immigration status is permissible under ECOA and Regulation B, creditors must comply with both statutes.","As previously reported, in October 2023 the CFPB and DOJ issued a joint statement regarding “the potential civil rights implications of a creditor’s consideration of an individual’s immigration status under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA).” We were critical of the joint statement, and observed that:

“By not providing clear guidance on when the consideration of immigration status can cross the line into improper discrimination based on race or national origin, the agencies make it difficult for us to avoid the conclusion that the agencies’ primary goal in issuing the statement is to scare creditors away from using immigration status in credit decisions.”

The agencies have now withdrawn the joint statement. The withdrawal was based on concerns that the joint statement (1) “may have created the impression that either ECOA or the statement itself imposes limitations on the consideration of immigration or citizenship status when evaluating an application for credit [when] [n]o such limitation exists” and (2) was not consistent with the CFPB’s revised policy on issuing guidance documents that was announced in May 2025.

In withdrawing the joint statement, the agencies correctly observe that “[n]othing in ECOA or Regulation B prohibits the consideration of an applicant’s immigration or citizen status. To the contrary, Regulation B permits the consideration of ‘any information obtained, so long as the information is not used to discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis.’” The agencies also note that a Regulation B Commentary provision states that a “creditor may take the applicant’s immigration status into account” and another Regulation B provision states that a creditor “may consider the applicant’s immigration status or status as a permanent resident of the United States, and any additional information that may be necessary to ascertain the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment.” The agencies then state that “[t]he joint statement’s exclusive emphasis on the risks of such consideration, however, may have created the misimpression that ECOA or Regulation B prohibit or otherwise limit the consideration of immigration or citizenship status by a creditor evaluating an application for credit.”

The joint statement included the following examples of creditor practices that could risk violating ECOA and Regulation B:

A blanket policy of refusing to consider applications from certain groups of noncitizens regardless of the credit qualifications of individual borrowers within that group. Compliance risk could arise because some individuals within those groups may have sufficient credit scores or other individual circumstances that may resolve concerns about the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment.

The overbroad consideration of certain criteria, such as how long a consumer has had a Social Security Number. This could implicate or serve as a proxy for citizenship or immigration status, which in turn, can implicate a protected characteristic under ECOA like national origin or race. Any claims that such policies are necessary to preserve the creditor’s rights and remedies regarding repayment or to meet other binding legal obligations should be supported by evidence and cannot be a pretext for discrimination.

Requiring documentation, identification, or in-person applications only from certain groups of noncitizens, and this requirement is not necessary for assessing the creditor’s ability to obtain repayment or fulfilling the creditors’ legal obligations.

The agencies now criticize the first two examples. The agencies state that the first example “could be read as positing a bright-line, one-size-fits-all approach to underwriting noncitizens as necessary for ECOA compliance [when] [t]here is no such requirement in ECOA or Regulation B” and that a “credit applicant’s immigration or citizenship status may present underwriting risks that typical assessments of financial capacity alone will not fully resolve.” Addressing the second example, the agencies state that the “example may have been perceived as discouraging the collection and assessment of [Social Security Number] information when in fact it can be important to a creditor’s compliance with anti-money laundering or Know Your Customer requirements.”

The joint statement also cautioned creditors to be mindful of their obligations under 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Section 1981 provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens[.]” The joint statement provided that this statute “has long been construed to prohibit discrimination based on alienage” and that except to the extent consideration of immigration status is permissible under ECOA and Regulation B, creditors must comply with both statutes. Addressing this aspect of the joint statement, the agencies state that their “withdrawal of the joint statement serves to address any misimpression that the joint statement has interpreted section 1981 to confer any liability under the statute that has not already been recognized by courts.”

Addressing the CFPB’s revised policy on issuing guidance, the agencies note that the “revised policy is to issue guidance only where necessary and where doing so would reduce compliance burdens.” The agencies then state that “[g]iven that it is the responsibility of Congress and the President in the legislative process to define or expand the contours of civil rights protections, the agencies have determined that the joint statement is not necessary” and that “the joint statement does not meet the Bureau’s current standards for the issuance of guidance.”

While the withdrawal of the joint statement is a positive development, the agencies could have, but did not, sought to reduce compliance burdens by providing helpful guidance on how creditors may appropriately consider an applicant’s immigration status under ECOA. For example, it would be helpful to receive guidance on the consideration of an applicant’s immigration status in assessing the likelihood of continuation of income in the context of specific ability to repay determination requirements, particularly the requirements of the Regulation Z ability to repay rules for credit cards and for mortgage loans.",https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/124/347/210/nGPeXKvLJY7Dejo7zd81p93OM/f227eff55e00dd1fd2026724135fb784841f6e1c.png,N,,2026-01-12 11:58:38.748817

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month.
Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded.
There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday.
The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.","More than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in one week last month, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The arrests were made Dec. 16-21 during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched in Dec. 16.

Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people were arrested and were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. They said the actual number is likely higher.

“(ICE is) not here to make Columbus better,” Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement last month. “They are bringing violence. When Columbus leaders said ICE makes our communities less safe, that is exactly what they meant.”

An ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday. Good was a U.S. citizen who, according to reports, was operating as a “legal observer.”

“We said ICE brings violence to our communities, and this is exactly what we meant,” Tramonte said in a statement Wednesday.

ICE did not respond to questions sent by the Ohio Capital Journal, but listed ten people who had been detained in the Columbus area with criminal charges through Operation Buckeye in a news release.

The homeland security department listed eight people who had been detained with criminal backgrounds.

“We operate in Ohio every day, but we recently surged our resources there under Operation Buckeye,” ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement. “Since Jan. 20, we’ve arrested drug traffickers, spousal abusers, thieves and worse.”

However, it’s unclear how many people ICE has detained have a criminal background.

“The facts really bear out that who they’re picking up are people with no criminal records,” said Angela Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee & Immigration Services.

Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said there are typically a few ICE reports every day, but there were more than 19 reports on Dec. 16.

“ICE has always been here in Columbus, but we’ve never seen anything like that,” she said.

Legal Immigration Services in Dublin began realizing an ICE operation was underway when calls started coming in from people saying their husbands never came home or their their spouse’s car was found abandoned, Eldredge said.

One of their clients was detained in Dublin when ICE officers pulled her over, she said.

“They don’t have any probable cause to pull over someone just because you have brown skin,” said Walter Messenger, a lawyer at Legal Immigration Services. “It’s just ridiculous that people have to go through this.”

ICE took a break over Christmas and New Year’s, but have started detaining people in the Columbus area again, Eldredge said. There were three ICE reports on Monday last week and five on Tuesday, she said.

“They’re still here,” Eldredge said. “They’re still detaining people. We have clients being very afraid of going to their ICE visits and getting detained. But if they don’t go, they are considered absconder.”

Some of their clients have stopped sending their children to school, she said.

“They cannot go pick up the kids at school, or they’re afraid they’re just gonna take their kids,” Eldredge said. “It’s a tragedy. I don’t know how we’re gonna make it.”

Lack of space in detention centers became a problem for ICE last month, Plummer said.

“The practicalities became a problem because there wasn’t enough place to put people they were detaining,” she said.

There are six Ohio detention facilities that contract with ICE to hold people who have been detained: Butler County Jail in Hamilton, the Seneca County Jail in Tiffin, the Geauga County Safety Center in Chardon, the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio in Stryker, the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center in Youngstown, and the Mahoning County Justice Center in Youngstown.

Of those who were detained in Operation Buckeye, 137 were taken to the Butler County Jail, 61 went to the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio, 10 went to the Seneca County Jail, three went to the Mahoning County Justice Center, one went to the Calhoun County Jail in Michigan, one went to the Hamilton County Jail, and one went to the Miami Valley Jail, according to an analysis by the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Eldredge said their clients who are being detained at Butler County Jail say it’s overcrowded.

“They cry,” she said. “They say there’s no food, too many people in the same cell.”

A few Ohio Democratic lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Director Annette Chambers-Smith asking the department to make sure there are safe conditions for people detained by ICE at Butler County Jail.

There were 1,044 people in Butler County Jail as of Thursday. The general housing capacity for Butler County Jail is 844, even though ODRC recommends 756 as the housing capacity, according to a July ODRC inspection report.

“This continued practice of exceeding safe capacity limits represents a fundamental failure to meet the state’s duty of care to those held in its facilities,” according to the letter, which was written by Ohio state Reps. Christine Cockley and Mark Sigrist, and Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora.

Chen told DW that he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling on Monday ""unless the authority dropped the case.""
Arriving in the US 'at the wrong time' The Xinjiang video also burned Guan's bridges back home.
She told DW that relatives in China had been questioned by authorities and have since cut off contact with Guan.
""I'm not disappointed,"" Guan told DW.","Heng Guan, a Chinese national who documented a network of detention facilities in China's northwestern Xinjiang province, has spent months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody as the Trump administration's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attempted to deport him.

Guan's second court hearing is set for Monday after a DHS prosecutor asked a court in December to deport him to Uganda under a third-country migrant deal.

That request was later withdrawn amid concerns raised in Washington, D.C., but ICE continued to push for Guan's deportation to China, according to his attorney, Chuangchuang Chen.

""I would jump off the plane if deported,"" Guan told DW in an exclusive interview from an ICE detention facility. ""I would rather die than face imprisonment in China.""

The 38-year-old amateur photographer from China's central Henan province entered the United States in 2021 by boat from Freeport in The Bahamas after producing a 20-minute vlog from Xinjiang, accusing the Chinese government of mass incarceration of Muslim Uyghurs.

Guan said he would face imprisonment if returned to China.

""I'm not disappointed with the US,"" he said, yet he believed remaining in America was his only protection against any retribution from Beijing.

Chen told DW that he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling on Monday ""unless the authority dropped the case.""

Asylum-seeker caught in legal limbo

Before the ICE raid on his apartment building in August 2025, Guan had been working as an Uber and truck driver in New York state.

""I thought I was legal before I was arrested. At least I was legal while waiting for my asylum,"" Guan said.

Guan was authorized to work while his asylum case was pending. Asylum interviews typically take years to schedule, on top of other legal procedures.

""I didn't expect to be arrested,"" Guan said. ""It's a change under this administration.""

Guan said he presented his Employment Authorization Document and driver's license to ICE agents, but he was still handcuffed and moved through several detention facilities.

He said that following his arrest, ICE served him with an administrative warrant stating that he was inadmissible to the US.

Guan has been detained ever since. An immigration judge denied his request for bail in December.

The case raised alarm in Washington about the high risk of persecution if Guan is deported.

Public support for Guan, including in Congress, escalated after Human Rights in China, an NGO, publicized his case.

Chen said the political support is helpful, but Guan's fate ultimately lies with the immigration judge.

DW requested a comment from ICE but received no response.

Filming Xinjiang's detention network

Guan was a factory and oil field laborer born and raised in Central China. He developed a hobby in photography in college and started producing travel vlogs in 2018.

A motorcycle ride through Xinjiang in 2019 shifted his focus.

""I didn't know about the ... camps against Uyghurs then, but I sensed an abnormal social climate, seeing the tight regulations and control there,"" Guan said.

After reading a 2020 investigation by US news outlet BuzzFeed News that used satellite images to geolocate the mass internment of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, Guan decided to revisit there.

He filmed a 20-minute video of several detention sites by following the American outlet's information.

""When I realized that foreign journalists are not allowed to freely enter places like Xinjiang, I felt a very strong sense of civic responsibility and wanted to go there to document and bear witness,"" he said.

To release the footage, Guan concluded he had to leave China.

The US was not his first stop. Guan flew to Ecuador and then The Bahamas, countries that allowed Chinese passport holders to enter without visas.

""Because not all countries can guarantee freedom of expression or offer protection to dissidents, and some even have precedents for deporting dissidents back to China, I weighed my options,"" he said.

""In the end, out of sheer necessity, with no other choices and nowhere else to go, I had no option but to find an unconventional way to come to the United States.""

He bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor in the Bahamas before setting off for Florida, according to the NGO Human Rights in China.

After stepping onto US soil in 2021, Guan released his Xinjiang footage online.

The video quickly drew the attention of researchers specializing in China's alleged human rights abuses.

Alison Killing, one of the authors of the BuzzFeed News investigation, told DW in 2021 that Guan's on-the-ground video helped confirm whether many of the facilities were prisons or detention centers.

Arriving in the US 'at the wrong time'

The Xinjiang video also burned Guan's bridges back home.

Yun Luo, Guan's mother, moved to Taiwan years ago and recently traveled to the US for her son's hearings. She told DW that relatives in China had been questioned by authorities and have since cut off contact with Guan.

""It was heartbreaking. We used to catch up on the phone every week,"" Luo said. ""Now they don't reply to my messages.""

Guan's personal information was also leaked online after he uploaded the Xinjiang video to YouTube.

Luo said that they ""won't stop going after him after the video was released.""

""He came to the US at the wrong time,"" Luo said. ""This wouldn't be the case if he had come decades earlier.""

Even so, Guan said he cherished the freedom he has experienced in the United States, even if he had not fully ""exercised"" it. ""It's not something I had in China,"" he said.

""It's just that, right now, we happen to be going through the president's radical anti-immigration policies.""

""I'm not disappointed,"" Guan told DW. ""I see it as a natural fluctuation within the way the political system works. It's just that I happened to experience it at an unlucky time.""

REICHARD:And that’s this week’s Legal Docket.","Editor's note: The following text is a transcript of a podcast story. To listen to the story, click on the arrow beneath the headline above.

NICK EICHER, HOST: It’s The World and Everything in It for this 12th day of January, 2026. We’re so glad you’ve joined us today. Good morning! I’m Nick Eicher.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: And I’m Mary Reichard. It’s time for Legal Docket.

Today, two cases that go to the heart of immigration and civil justice—and they matter well beyond the courtroom. What the court decides will shape asylum claims, affect the work of advocacy groups, and test the authority of a government elected on promises of tighter borders and enforcement.

We begin with oral arguments.

EICHER: Case one is Urias-Orellana v. Bondi.

It’s about asylum—and about how much power federal judges should have to second-guess immigration courts.

Here’s how the attorney for the asylum seeker framed the case. Nicholas Rosellini.

ROSELLINI: Deciding whether undisputed facts qualify as persecution under the law involves legal interpretation, not fact finding.

REICHARD: That distinction is the fulcrum here. We usually think of fact-finding as the job of juries or trial judges, and legal interpretation as the work of higher courts.

But in this case, the asylum seeker wants federal judges to step in and decide whether the facts already found by immigration courts rise to the legal level of “persecution.” If they do, he stays.

EICHER: Here’s the background. Douglas Urias-Orellana left El Salvador with his wife and child and entered the United States illegally in 2021.

Back home, a hitman for a drug trafficker had shot two of his half-brothers and threatened to kill the rest of the family. Urias-Orellana moved within El Salvador for a time, but eventually fled north and applied for asylum.

REICHARD: The immigration judge believed his account—but still denied asylum, ruling that the threats did not meet the legal standard for persecution.

That standard is high. Courts have said persecution must be severe—more than threats alone—and tied to membership in a protected group, with the home government unable or unwilling to stop it.

EICHER: The Justice Department says that judgment call belongs to the immigration system. It argues courts should defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which heard the case and weighed the evidence firsthand.

But Urias-Orellana’s lawyer says this is not just about facts—it is about how the law defines persecution, and who gets to apply that definition.

Here’s Rosellini again:

ROSELLINI: And courts have repeatedly established auxiliary legal principles on things like sexual violence, religious persecution, economic deprivation, and beyond. But courts did not establish those principles by pondering the term ""persecution"" in the abstract. They interpreted the law by applying the persecution standard to particular sets of undisputed facts.

Rosellini pointing out there’s no way to draw a principled line between fact and law here.

REICHARD: The government disagrees. Here’s Assistant to the Solicitor General Joshua Dos Santos. (You’ll hear him use the term “sicario.” He means the hitman.)

DOS SANTOS: Petitioner appears to have been fine when he moved away from the hometown and he lived for years in peace in other parts of El Salvador. Then --then Petitioner talks about the threats, but, on the other hand, the threats demanded money. So whether you infer from that was it just intimidation, were they even connected with the sicario, I mean, these are all questions of the kind that go to juries. The juries draw inferences that can cut in different directions.

EICHER: Justice Sonia Sotomayor pushed back on that, referencing another case:

SOTOMAYOR: …the question was whether those undisputed facts met the standard of persecution ‘because of’ political opinion. So I don't see how that's not a mixed question of law and fact …

Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to favor the opposite view.

ROBERTS: The sort of finding that we typically leave to a district court or another fact finder involving credibility, weighing of facts, and all that sort of thing, to — to reach a particular determination it seems to me a prototypical case for the B-I-A.

And Justice Elena Kagan seemed to agree with the Chief while bemoaning the work load involved should the asylum seeker here win the case:

KAGAN: What’s going to happen in this case is we're going to have to look at all this evidence, all these facts, and decide whether these threats were indeed that level of menacing, and that sounds like really weighing evidence to me. That sounds really factual.

EICHER: The asylum seeker’s lawyer summed it up this way, essentially sending up an SOS to please clarify the path:

ROSELLINI: The case law as it is now is a muddle, so I'm not going to pretend that there is some consensus going in our favor, but we don’t need to show that.

So the question for the justices isn’t whether this man and his family can remain in the US. It’s how much authority federal judges have to second-guess immigration courts.

And make no mistake, there’s a political angle here, too:

Half-a-dozen advocacy groups filed friend of the court briefs on this one, and each one of them is actively involved in pushing the courts to override the executive branch on immigration.

REICHARD: This last case today also turns on who gets the last word, but this time it’s not immigration courts and federal judges. It is state legislatures versus the rules that govern federal courts—and the answer will shape who gets into court at all.

EICHER: For patients who believe they were harmed by medical negligence, the stakes are obvious. For doctors and hospitals, it’s the cost of defending lawsuits. And for the states that have tort reform to limit malpractice claims … this case is a test of how far tort reform can reach.

REICHARD: The case is Berk v Choy.

Harold Berk is a Florida man who was staying in his second home in Delaware when he suffered a foot and ankle injury.

He went to the emergency room and says he received negligent medical treatment that made matters worse. He filed a medical malpractice suit in federal court under what is called “diversity jurisdiction.” That’s a federal rule that lets you file a case in federal court when the parties are from different states and enough money is at stake.

EICHER: But Delaware requires something extra in medical malpractice cases: an affidavit of merit. That’s a sworn statement from a medical expert that certifies the claim is reasonable. More than half the states have that rule.

REICHARD: Berk’s orthopedist declined to make the affidavit. So Berk just submitted his medical records instead.

But in Delaware? No affidavit, no case.

So the federal district court dismissed Berk’s lawsuit.

EICHER: And it did so on the basis that the affidavit rule is considered substantive law. That’s different from procedural law, things like how to file a lawsuit and when. Substantive law is about what you’re legally entitled to, like the standard of medical care.

And that difference matters here, because substantive state law applies in federal court.

REICHARD: Berk wants that affidavit requirement gone. Delaware insists on it. Berk’s lawyer, Andrew Tutt:

TUTT: That requirement conflicts with more than a half dozen Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It conflicts with Rules 8 and 9, which set forth what a plaintiff must do to state a claim in federal court, and it conflicts with Rule 11, which bars verification and affidavit requirements unless a federal rule or statute provides otherwise.

Tutt went even further. The doctors call Delaware’s rule substantive …

TUTT: But Delaware's law is procedural from tip to tail. It designates when a complaint can be docketed, what it must say, and when the defendant must file a responsive pleading. It doesn't define malpractice or alter any substantive standard of care….This is a procedural law.

EICHER: The medical providers disagree, obviously. They want the affidavit rule to stay—because it’s an obstacle to filing a lawsuit against them. The providers’ lawyer is Frederick Yarger. He says Berk, the injured man, is taking an extreme position:

YARGER: That a federal court must ignore the entirety of a state statute if any part of it might conflict with a federal rule in some case. This court has rejected that approach which is why Petitioner in this briefing effectively concede that to prevail he has to convince the Court to overrule at least three of its decisions.

In this complex case, there was a light moment, if you can call it that: Justice Samuel Alito invoked a famous idea from physics:

ALITO: Schrodinger’s cat ……

For an explanation, we turn to a movie from 2013, the movie Coherence in which actor Hugo Armstrong plays a character who explains the concept well.

KEVIN: It's a thought experiment. There's a, there's a cat in a box that has, like a 50-50 chance of living, because there's a vial of poison that's also in the box. So regular physics would say that it's one or the other, that the cat is either alive or dead. But Brian would argue that quantum physics says that both realities exist simultaneously, and it's only when you open the box that they collapse into a single event.

So with that background, you will now understand constitutional law that much better.

ALITO:I don't know that we've ever invoked Schrödinger's cat in — (Thomas laughing) — our analysis of statutes or rules, but what are you saying? Is the affidavit of merit a pleading for purposes — we've got Rule 8 and Rule 11. Is it a pleading for one and not a pleading for the other?

REICHARD: So it’s up to the justices to open up that box and see if the cat or pleading or affidavit is alive or dead.

If the court upholds the affidavit requirement, then states can impose higher pleading requirements on federal courts, and just call them something else. That raises costs for plaintiffs, but doctors argue it smokes out meritless claims.

So here as in the asylum case, a seemingly simple question: Who decides the rules and who must defer to whom?

EICHER: Before we go, one decision—the Supreme Court’s first opinion of the term in an argued case. It’s Bowe v. United States.

Michael Bowe is serving a 24-year federal prison sentence, including ten years for using a gun in what the law calls a “crime of violence.”

Later court rulings narrowed that definition, and Bowe asked to have his sentence reduced.

REICHARD: Lower courts said no to that, pointing to a rule that generally blocks repeat challenges to prison sentences.

But that rule applies to state prisoners, not federal ones.

EICHER: In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with Bowe.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the Court’s liberals to say the state-prisoner rule does not apply to federal inmates—and if Congress wants it changed, it has to do the work itself.

REICHARD:And that’s this week’s Legal Docket.

The court is hearing oral arguments in two cases brought by trans students who challenged Republican-backed laws in West Virginia and Idaho prohibiting trans girls from participating in girls’ athletic programs.

Those bans were both previously blocked by federal courts, but the states appealed to the supreme court, which is hearing a case on trans people’s access to sports for the first time. If the court’s conservative supermajority sides with the states and upholds the bans, the rulings could have significant ripple effects, paving the way for the enforcement of a range of anti-LGBTQ+ policies.

If the rulings are broad, civil rights advocates warn, the supreme court could make it easier for lawmakers and school officials to ban trans students’ access to appropriate bathrooms and facilities, restrict LGBTQ+ youth’s ability to use chosen names and pronouns, enforce strict dress codes, limit protections against anti-LGBTQ+ harassment, and further deny access to accurate identification documents.

“It’s really scary. The supreme court is poised to tell us whether dislike and moral disapproval of a specific group can be a real basis to make law,” said Cathryn Oakley, senior director of legal policy for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ rights group.

‘This isn’t just about me’

In Little v Hecox, Lindsay Hecox, a trans college student, challenged Idaho’s first-in-the-nation law categorically banning trans women and girls from women’s sports teams, which passed in 2020, blocking her from track at age 19. She has since sought to have the case dismissed, arguing she is no longer pursuing sports and doesn’t want to be subjected to ongoing harassment. But the court decided to hear the case, anyway.

In the second case, West Virginia v BPJ, 15-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson has challenged her state’s law banning her track participation, saying in a recent statement: “This case isn’t just about me, or even just about sports. It’s just one part of a plan to push transgender people like me out of public life entirely.”

In the last five years, 27 states have restricted trans children and teens’ access to school sports – most targeting trans girls, but some applying to all trans youth.

The anti-LGBTQ+ legal movement shifted its focus to trans athletes after the supreme court legalized marriage equality in 2015. Supporters of bans on trans athletes, including the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the major Christian legal group defending the state laws this week, argue they are promoting fairness and safety in women’s sports.

LGBTQ+ rights advocates counter there is no credible evidence that inclusive sports policies have endangered cis girls and women, and the controversy is manufactured by anti-trans activists; one conservative group, for example, acknowledged in 2019 that its polling suggested people could be swayed to support Republicans with ads raising fears about trans girls in sports.

The GOP’s escalating campaign against trans youth athletes is directed at a minuscule fraction of the population. The National Collegiate Athletic Association president testified in 2024 he was aware of fewer than 10 trans college athletes, and Republican legislators have at times struggled to identify any trans girls playing sports in their states.

Meanwhile, states such as California have long allowed trans youth to play on teams that match their gender with little pushback – until the issue became subject to national debate.

While there are few out trans youth on sports teams at all levels, advocates note the bans have been devastating for those directly affected and LGBTQ+ youth who may be avoiding athletics due to the climate.

Potential outcomes

Lawyers for Hecox and Pepper-Jackson argue the bans violate the equal protection clause of the constitution, and in the West Virginia case, attorneys also argue the ban violates Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in schools.

One crucial question the court will consider is whether the laws are discriminatory against trans people and merit what’s known as “heightened scrutiny” – a more rigorous review, meaning the government has a higher burden to justify the bans. The court has never issued a ruling addressing whether it considers trans people a class that deserves this protection.

If the court were to use the sports cases to rule that laws targeting trans people do not warrant heightened scrutiny, then “any type of law discriminating against trans people is going to be presumptively constitutional”, said Joshua Block, senior counsel for the LGBTQ and HIV projects at the ACLU, which is representing both students.

“These laws were passed to establish a legal principle that transgender girls and women shouldn’t be treated like other girls and women, and then to use that principle as a jumping-off point for rolling back protections for transgender people more generally,” said Block, who is presenting oral arguments.

At least one prominent campaigner for trans sports bans has made this point explicitly, saying last year: “The gender ideology movement is a house of cards, and I believe it’s lying on that sports issue. This will be the card that makes all of it crumble.”

Scott Skinner-Thompson, a Colorado law school professor, said he feared the ruling could leave trans people with “minimal constitutional protections” from laws explicitly targeting them: “That would further embolden legislators to continue to pass laws that exclude transgender people from public life.”

In addition to bolstering laws banning trans people from bathrooms, that outcome could also make it even harder for incarcerated trans people to access critical healthcare and safe housing, said Skinner-Thompson, who signed an amicus brief arguing the bans should remain blocked.

“The broad question in these cases is: are we a society that’s interested in recognizing people’s common humanity, or are we more interested in excluding people for the purpose of a particular version of what counts as ‘fair’?”

The ruling could also establish that trans people are not protected under Title IX, which could be catastrophic, said Block. A school could deny admission to or expel a student on the basis of them being trans and it wouldn’t be considered a Title IX violation, he said.

In one particularly damaging outcome, which he hoped was unlikely, Block said the court could support the Trump administration’s assertions that Title IX requires that schools ban trans girls from sports. That would potentially invalidate policies in Democratic-run states that allow or mandate trans inclusion in youth athletics.

“West Virginia’s law is not discriminatory – it treats all students equally and represents a common-sense approach to a complex issue,” a spokesperson for the state’s attorney general said in an email. “It advances Title IX’s core mission to ensure that women and girls have access to athletic and academic opportunities that were long reserved for men.” The law, the spokesperson continued, “does not ban anyone from playing sports based on gender identity” and addresses “legitimate questions about competitive fairness and safety”.

A spokesperson for Idaho’s attorney general did not respond to an inquiry.

An ADF spokesperson said in an email: “Men and women are different, and those differences matter in sports. When you let males into women’s sports, it harms women … causing women to lose their dignity, privacy, and equal opportunities.” The spokesperson said the harm was “undeniable” and it was “vital to make sure our laws can acknowledge reality and protect women”.

‘The bans endanger all girls’

Advocates are not optimistic the court will block the sports bans, but hope the decision will be narrow. Last year, the court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for trans minors. The ruling was a devastating blow for access to vital medical treatments, but was limited to healthcare and did not, as some had feared, establish a broader precedent supporting anti-trans legislation.

“BPJ is about a 15-year-old kid that the entire state of West Virginia has brought to the supreme court to continue to fight to exclude her from the track-and-field team,” said Karen Loewy, interim deputy legal director for litigation at Lambda Legal, a rights group also representing Pepper-Jackson. “The question before the court is narrow … and there are ways to answer that question narrowly.”

Shayna Medley, senior staff attorney at Advocates for Trans Equality, noted that sports bans have a record of harming both trans and cisgender girls. To enforce restrictions, some states allow invasive forms of sex testing, which invite community members to scrutinize individual girls if they have any suspicions about their identities.

“These bans endanger all girls by empowering adults, parents, politicians, coaches to investigate anyone who they suspect to be trans on the basis of how they look and subject them to invasive sex-testing procedures,” they said. “We’ve seen cis girls with short hair be accused of being trans and asked to turn over medical records. It really creates a climate of gender policing of anyone who doesn’t conform to stereotypes. These cases are part of a broader project to erode bodily autonomy principles that are supposed to be embedded in our constitution.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da6735ae6780754f634de147c54ef44b52417c3/495_0_3493_2795/master/3493.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c88e4c2f30ab53f876e6bbe997d688f3",N,,2026-01-12 11:00:02.437060

,Human Rights,2026-01-12 14:08:23+00:00,KPBS Public Media,How a SANDAG database might be aiding Trump's deportation campaign - KPBS,"Gustavo Solis, www.kpbs.org, gustavo-solis",,,,,https://www.kpbs.org/news/border-immigration/2026/01/12/how-a-sandag-database-might-be-aiding-trumps-deportation-campaign,"Local privacy advocates are raising concerns about an obscure database managed by the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) that might be allowing President Donald Trump’s deportation forces to circumvent state and local immigrant sanctuary laws.
For an annual fee of roughly $200,000 SANDAG grants immigration enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), access to the database, which is known as ARJIS.

For an annual fee of roughly $200,000 SANDAG grants immigration enforcement agencies, including Customs and Border Protection (CBP), access to the database, which is known as ARJIS.

The database contains information from every law enforcement agency in San Diego County — which includes traffic citations, arrest records, field interviews, a local jail census and some driver license records.

Local police agencies have shared data with their federal counterparts through ARJIS for decades. But now, the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics are raising new questions about what exactly is being shared with the federal government.

“It is not always great to share data because sometimes you don’t know what the motivations of those people might be,” said Seth Hall, a privacy advocate with the TRUST SD Coalition.

Advocates are particularly worried that ARJIS does not have enough independent oversight protections in place to prevent agencies like CBP from using it to go after San Diego’s immigrant population.

“We are at a time where the Trump administration is attacking all immigrants — people with status, people without status, with no criminal record,” said Homayra Yusufi, a senior policy strategist for the Partnership of the Advancement of New Americans (PANA). “CBP and HSI are literally just out there to find as many individuals to detain and deport as possible.”

Lack of protection

During the first Trump administration, CBP agents used surveillance technology to spy on U.S. citizens — immigration lawyers and human rights advocates — working with migrants from the Central American caravans.

Last year, Border Patrol agents gained backdoor access to license plate reader databases across the country, including El Cajon, which they used to track down immigrants. In Chicago, a federal judge wrote that Border Patrol leadership was “outright lying” about the agency’s use of force tactics in her injunction limiting those practices.

Yusufi argues those incidents show CBP isn’t a trustworthy law enforcement partner. She and other advocates also argue that ARJIS undermines sanctuary laws by granting access to CBP without enough oversight.

“Our local law enforcement agencies are able to say, ‘Yeah, we don’t directly share this,’” said Erin Tsurumoto-Grassi, associate director of Alliance San Diego. “But if you are sharing it through your ARJIS database and then ARJIS is selling that information — you may not be directly sharing it, but that information is still being shared, and I think that’s something we should be concerned with.”

In a recent statement to KPBS, a CBP spokesperson said agents use ARJIS in the vast majority of their criminal cases and said the database improves the agency’s cooperation with “partner agencies.”

“Without ARJIS, we would face significant delays in obtaining time-sensitive information, impacting operations and regional cooperation,” the spokesperson wrote.

But the spokesperson did not respond when asked whether CBP uses ARJIS for immigration enforcement.

SANDAG has several restrictions in place aimed at preventing federal agents from using the database for immigration enforcement. The database requires users to enter a valid reason for each search, like a case number. And ARJIS added a disclaimer on the login screen telling users not to use it for immigration enforcement purposes.

But it’s unclear whether federal agencies are following those rules because SANDAG does not have the authority to run independent audits.

SANDAG declined to make Anthony Rey, the director of ARJIS, available for an interview. A spokesperson told KPBS that ARJIS’s user agreement prevents SANDAG from conducting independent audits. Instead, audits only happen when agencies voluntarily audit themselves or when the California Department of Justice requests one.

The spokesperson said the last time CBP requested an audit was in 2017. When KPBS asked for a copy of that audit, SANDAG said it could not release it because it didn’t have CBP’s approval.

Who will be next?

The SANDAG board consists of elected officials from each of San Diego’s 18 cities and the county. None of the board members agreed to an interview with KPBS.

Yusufi says the lack of oversight from SANDAG should be raising alarm bells in immigrant communities throughout the county.

“It’s time for us to get our heads out of the sand and recognize the reality of the threats that are facing all of our communities right now,” Yusufi said. “And we have to reconsider selling this data with agencies that we know will harm San Diegans.”

Hall, from TRUST SD, said this goes beyond immigration — that future administrations can easily use these mass data surveillance systems to target other “disfavored populations.”

“If you’re not an immigrant, then maybe this doesn’t really bother you,” he said. “But you better pay attention to who else is being disfavored.”

Other privacy advocates say it’s time for other local jurisdictions to act if SANDAG won’t.

“What accountability measures are you going to put in place? Can you get those audits? How else can you make it transparent and accountable?” Tsurumoto Grassi said.

One of the SANDAG board members is San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria.

Gloria’s office sent a statement that touted his commitment to strengthening local projections for immigrant families. And it referenced an executive order the mayor signed in July reaffirming that city resources will not be used for immigration enforcement.

“The order makes clear that City personnel, property, and resources will not be used to assist immigration enforcement unless expressly required by law, helps ensure accurate multilingual information about rights and services, and enhances coordination so that residents can live without fear while public safety is upheld for all,” Gloria’s spokesperson wrote.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/6515ff5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4458x2340+0+316/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fimg%2Fphotos%2F2015%2F11%2F06%2FAP_865917545946.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 10:59:50.600438

SCOTUS Quick Hits

The Supreme Court released an opinion on Friday, but perhaps not the one you were expecting. The 5-4 ruling was in Bowe v. United States, a case on a federal prisoner’s efforts to obtain post-conviction relief. In an opinion from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court held that a federal law instructing courts to dismiss a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application does not apply to motions filed by federal prisoners. Justice Neil Gorsuch filed a dissenting opinion, joined in full by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and in part by Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Also on Friday, the court indicated that it may announce opinions on Wednesday at 10 a.m. EST. SCOTUSblog will be live blogging any opinion announcements beginning at 9:30.

Friday afternoon, the court announced that it had granted review in five cases. For more on these disputes, see the On Site section below.

This morning, the court is expected to release an order list with denied petitions and other case updates at 9:30 a.m. EST.

The justices will hear argument today in Chevron USA Inc. v. Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on the circumstances in which a federal contractor can transfer a case from state to federal court. Justice Samuel Alito will not participate because he has a financial interest in ConocoPhillips, which is the parent company of one of the defendants.

Tomorrow, the justices will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., on laws barring transgender athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams. We will be live blogging the arguments beginning at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Morning Reads

Eyes are on Gorsuch as Supreme Court weighs rights of trans athletes (Julian Mark, The Washington Post)(Paywall) — In 2020, Justice Neil Gorsuch “wrote one of the Supreme Court’s most consequential rulings expanding legal rights for gay and transgender people” in a case on employment discrimination. Now, “Gorsuch is again in the spotlight,” according to The Washington Post, as the court considers two disputes over laws preventing transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports. The law’s opponents are drawing on that 2020 ruling as they try to persuade Gorsuch to protect transgender athletes, per the Post, while the law’s supporters argue that “sports is different from the workplace.”

Supreme Court, Swamped by Emergencies, Neglects Rest of Docket (Adam Liptak, The New York Times)(Paywall) — The court’s Friday ruling in Bowe v. United States has the distinction of being the first opinion in an argued case to be released this term. The fact that it didn’t arrive until January is notable, because “[o]ver the last 80 years, the Supreme Court has only once before waited until January to issue its first opinion in an argued case,” according to The New York Times. Experts specializing in Supreme Court advocacy told the Times that “a spike in action on the court’s other docket,” where the justices address requests for interim relief, “seems to have diverted the court from its merits docket,” slowing the pace of opinions.

These are the books families opted-out of after Supreme Court fight (Talia Richman, The Baltimore Banner) — In a June 27 ruling in Mahmoud v. Taylor, the “Supreme Court sided with a group of parents [in Montgomery County, Maryland] who sought the right to opt-out of lessons that included LGBTQ storybooks,” holding that refusing such opt-out requests violates religious freedom. Since then, according to The Baltimore Banner, “[i]n a district of more than 156,000 students, just 56 families asked Montgomery County school leaders to excuse their child from reading books that conflict with their religious beliefs.” These requests mostly came from “the parents of elementary schoolers” and “generally centered around books with LGBTQ characters, as well as those that included themes of diversity.”

Lawsuits by Trump allies could shape how the 2030 census is done and who will be counted (Mike Schneider, Associated Press) — “The next U.S. census is four years away,” but legal battles over it have already begun, according to the Associated Press. “Allies of President Donald Trump are behind the federal lawsuits challenging various aspects of the once-a-decade count by the U.S. Census Bureau,” including the inclusion of noncitizens. “The first Trump administration also attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, a move that was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.”

Supreme Court Clerk Hiring Watch: Happy New Hires (David Lat, Original Jurisdiction) — In a post for his Substack, David Lat offered an update on Supreme Court clerk hiring and highlighted recent research on the jobs clerks typically have before and after working for a justice. He also highlighted various studies about clerkships, including investigations into what factors contribute to judges becoming feeder judges for the Supreme Court, such as the training they offer their clerks, personal relationships, and ideological compatibility.

A Closer Look: When the News Is that There’s No News

Friday was the court’s first day of opinion announcements for the 2025-26 term, and it served as a reminder that there really are no guarantees when it comes to which rulings are released on a given opinion day. After many news outlets focused their court coverage throughout the week on the tariffs case, the one ruling released on Friday was in Bowe v. United States, a dispute over a federal prisoner’s efforts to obtain post-conviction relief.

Friday was also a reminder that even top government attorneys are left in the dark as to what’s coming on an opinion day. As Mark Walsh noted in his latest View from the Court column, U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer and others from his office were in the courtroom that morning. When Chief Justice John Roberts gave Justice Sonia Sotomayor the floor to discuss her majority opinion in Bowe, she began by saying, “Seeing who’s here, it’s not the case you thought.”

Several outlets treated the lack of news on tariffs as news in its own right. A headline from Reuters read “US Supreme Court: No ruling on Trump tariffs Friday.” CNBC’s headline was “Supreme Court holds off on Trump tariff ruling for now — what’s at stake for economy.” And Bloomberg TV did a segment titled “Supreme Court Skips Trump Tariff Ruling on Friday.”

The court then sparked a new wave of speculation about the tariffs case when, about an hour after the release of the Bowe decision, it indicated that it may release opinions on Wednesday, Jan. 14. (Of course, we don’t know what rulings – if any – will come that day, just as we didn’t know what was coming on Friday.)

As we await the opinion day on Wednesday, we’ll be reflecting on these words of wisdom from Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University School of Law who contributes to SCOTUSblog’s Interim Docket Blog: “When you’re waiting for huge opinions, never, ever underestimate the Court’s ability to disappoint you.”

One of the largest local actions was planned from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday at West Hollywood Park, across from the Pacific Design Center, as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” Weekend of Action.

The demonstrations follow a tense Saturday night in downtown Los Angeles, where crowds gathered near Pershing Square, City Hall and the Metropolitan Detention Center to protest federal immigration enforcement.

LAPD said a dispersal order was issued around 6 p.m. for Alameda Street between Aliso and Temple streets after protesters refused to leave the area. A police skirmish line was later set up outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, where officers were seen pushing back crowds and several people were arrested before the streets were cleared around 10 p.m.

The protests are part of a growing national backlash following two federal officer-involved shootings — one in Minneapolis that killed 37-year-old Renee Good and another in Portland that left two people hospitalized.

According to organizers, those incidents sparked what has now become one of the largest coordinated protest efforts against ICE in years.

In a statement released Sunday, the ICE Out For Good coalition said nearly 1,200 protests were planned across the country this weekend, with about 500 expected to take place Sunday alone.

“This weekend, in nearly 1,200 cities and towns across the country, people are peacefully joining together… to honor the lives lost at the hands of ICE, demand accountability, and make visible the human cost of this administration’s actions,” the coalition said.

The group includes Indivisible, MoveOn Civic Action, the American Civil Liberties Union, Voto Latino, United We Dream and Popular Democracy, among others.

Organizers say Sunday’s actions were intended to be nonviolent and centered on public mourning, accountability and community solidarity, even as protests have increasingly drawn large crowds and law-enforcement responses in major cities.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

IRAN

President Trump said on Saturday that his administration is ready to help the anti-government protestors in Iran, saying “Iran is looking for FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” Trump also said several times over the weekend that he will use military force if the Iranian regime uses force against protestors. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Trump said yesterday that Iran proposed negotiations after his threat to strike the Islamic Republic over its crackdown targeting anti-government protestors in Iran, as the U.S.-based Human Rights Activist News Agency reports that the death toll has risen to at least 544 people. Trump added, “the meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what’s happening before the meeting.” Trump and his national security team have been weighing up a range of responses, including cyberattacks and direct strikes by the United States or Israel, according to two sources. U.S. officials said that they had to be careful to ensure that military strikes did not galvanize the Iranian public to support the government in Tehran or trigger retaliatory strikes. John Gambrell and Julia Nikhinson report for AP News; Tyler Pager, Eric Schmitt, and Edward Wong report for the New York Times.

“The communication channel between our Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and the U.S. Special envoy [Steve Witkoff] is open and messages are exchanged whenever necessary,” a spokesperson for the Iranian foreign ministry said today, adding that “contradictory messages” from the United States showed a lack of seriousness. Araqchi reiterated in a briefing to foreign ambassadors in Tehran that the Islamic Republic was ready for war but also open to dialogue. Jana Choukeir, Nayera Abdallah, and Tala Ramadan report for Reuters.

Trump is scheduled to be briefed on Tuesday on options for responding to protests in Iran, including boosting anti-government sources online, deploying secretive cyber weapons, placing more sanctions on the regime, and military strikes, according to U.S. officials. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan. Caine are expected to attend the meeting. Alexander Ward and Lara Seligman report for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

“The U.S.A. and Venezuela are working well together,” Trump said on Friday, adding “because of this cooperation, I have canceled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Reuters that additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela could be lifted as soon as this week to facilitate oil sales, and that he will meet with the heads of the IMF and World Bank to discuss their re-engagement with Venezuela.

Venezuela is exploring restoring diplomatic ties and sending a delegation to Washington to check on its long-closed embassy, according to a statement from Venezuelan Interim President Delcy Rodríguez. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said that U.S. diplomats visited Caracas on Friday to assess the potential resumption of embassy operations. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

The United States seized another oil tanker in the Caribbean early on Friday, U.S. Southern Command said on social media. The Olina was detained “without incident,” becoming the fifth Venezuelan-linked tanker seized by the Trump administration since December. Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

Trump on Friday signed an executive order aimed at blocking courts or creditors from impounding revenue tied to the sale of Venezuelan oil held in U.S. Treasury accounts, the White House said on Saturday. Several companies, such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, have longstanding claims against the country. The order declares that the revenue is the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic purposes and is not subject to private claims. Ernest Scheyder reports for Reuters.

Trump said yesterday that he is inclined to keep Exxonmobil out of Venezuela after its top executive was skeptical about oil investment efforts in the country. “If we look at the commercial constructs and framework in place today in Venezuela, today it’s uninvestable,” Exxonmobil CEO Darren Woods said. Seung Min Kim and Julia Nikhinson report for AP News.

Trump said yesterday on social media that “no more oil or money” would be going to Cuba from Venezuela, adding that the United States would be enforcing distance between the two countries. Trump urged Cuba “to make a deal, before it is too late,” though it is unclear what he meant by this. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel responded to Trump that his country was prepared to defend itself against U.S. threats, adding “no one tells us what to do.” Katie Rogers reports for the New York Times.

While U.S. intelligence shows that key sectors of the Cuban economy are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions, and other problems, recent CIA assessments were inconclusive on whether the worsening economy would destabilize the government, sources said. This is notable as Trump and other U.S. officials suggested that shutting Cuba off from Venezuelan oil could topple the Cuban government. Reuters could not determine if the CIA had produced an updated assessment since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week. Gram Slattery, Humeyra Pamuk, and Jonathan Landay report for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

A Ukrainian drone strike killed one person and wounded three others in the Russian city of Voronezh, local officials said yesterday. Meanwhile, thousands of residents in Kyiv were still without power, following the Russian bombardment overnight into Friday. AP News reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli fire yesterday killed at least three Palestinians in two separate incidents in Gaza, according to local health authorities. Medics said one Palestinian was killed in the Tuffah neighbourhood in Gaza City, in an area under Palestinian control, while two others were killed in southern Gaza in the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, an area Israel still occupies. Nidal al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

Hamas said yesterday that it will dissolve its existing government in Gaza once a Palestinian technocratic leadership committee takes over the territory, as per the U.S.-brokered peace plan, but the group gave no specifics on when the change will occur. An Egyptian official said that Hamas will meet with other Palestinian factions this week to finalise the technocratic committee’s formation. Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

More than 26 families from the Palestinian Bedouin village Ras Ein el-Auja in the West Bank have packed up and fled their homes in recent days as a result of harassment by Jewish settlers, according to rights groups. Julia Frankel reports for AP News.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

“Female-headed households [in Sudan] are now three times more likely to be food insecure. Three quarters of these households report not having enough to eat,” a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Friday. More than 21 million people are currently estimated to be acutely food insecure across the country. Some 34 million people are in need of humanitarian support, half of whom are children, according to the U.N. Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

A delegate from the Southern Transitional Council, a separatist faction in Yemen, said on Friday from Riyadh that the group was disbanding. However, a senior STC official said on social media that “the delegation was coerced, in a disgusting and farcical display, into announcing the dissolution.” Mohammed al-Sahmi, a representative for the STC in Britain, said by phone that the decision to dissolve the separatist group was not valid because it was done in Saudi Arabia without the full council’s vote. Ismaeel Naar, Saeed Al-Batati, and Vivian Nereim report for the New York Times.

The final fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have withdrawn from Aleppo, Syria, after the announcement of a ceasefire deal early yesterday morning. Buses carrying the last Kurdish-led SDF members were seen leaving the Kurdish majority neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud, according to local media reports. Tabby Wilson reports for BBC News.

Hearings on whether Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya ethnic minority began today at the International Court of Justice. The case was first filed at the ICJ in 2019 by Gambia, arguing a so-called “clearance operation” by Myanmar’s military in 2017 violated the 1948 Genocide Convention. Molly Quell reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Malaysia and Indonesia over the weekend blocked Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk’s xAI, as authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images. “The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,” Indonesia’s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement Saturday. Eileen NG and Edna Tarigan report for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States on Saturday carried out major airstrikes against the Islamic State in Syria. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command said that about 20 Air Force attack planes, including F-15Es, A-10s and AC-130J gunships, as well as MQ-9 Reaper drones and Jordanian F-16 fighter jets fired more than 90 bombs and missiles toward at least 35 targets. The targets included weapons caches, supply routes, and other infrastructure used by the Islamic State. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

A group of 15 former senior U.S. officials sent a memo to the White House, State Department, and members of Congress warning against the use of military force to take over Greenland, according to the memo shared with Axios. “The current President’s threats to use military force or other coercive measures to take Greenland away from our ally Denmark is strategically foolish in both the near and longer term,” the memo reads, warning that “our adversaries are salivating at the opportunities that such a rupture would create for them to replace us. Barak Ravid reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday quietly ordered new restrictions on congressional visits to immigration detention facilities. The restrictions, revealed in court on Saturday, force lawmakers to seek a week’s advance notice before conducting oversight of ICE facilities. They are virtually identical to a policy that a federal judge halted last month after ruling that it appeared to violate a provision of the appropriations law that funds ICE. Noem said she would bypass the ruling by using the injection of funds given to ICE through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act instead. Kyle Cheney, Ben Johansen, and Gregory Svirnovskiy report for POLITICO; Michael Gold reports for the New York Times.

The Homeland Security Department announced on Friday that it was reviewing around 5,600 refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting individuals who have already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Madeleine Ngo reports for the New York Times.

The Trump administration will send “hundreds more” federal agents to Minneapolis “today or tomorrow” to support the work of ICE agents, Noem said yesterday, citing a major welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota as the reason. Noem also said some nonprofits in Minnesota were being investigated for their funding sources, and claimed they had trained protestors in impeding law enforcement operations and “weaponizing” vehicles against ICE agents. Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened an investigation into the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Powell lied about the scope of the project, according to officials. Powell yesterday acknowledged that the Justice Department had served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas in recent days. Stock futures fell, the dollar weakened, and gold prices jumped to a record after Powell said that Trump was seeking to press the central bank into cutting interest rates with the threat of a criminal indictment. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a swing vote on the Banking Committee, said in a statement, “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,” adding “it is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.” Glenn Thrush and Colby Smith report for the New York Times; the Wall Street Journal reports.

Christopher Raia, the long-serving head of the FBI’s New York field office and a career agent, has been appointed as the bureau’s new deputy director, succeeding Dan Bongino and expected to start next week. Devlin Barrett, William K. Rashbaum, and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from enforcing part of an executive order directing the government to withhold federal election funds to states that do not alter their voting procedures in line with Trump’s demands. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing $10 billion in welfare funds planned for five Democratic-led states. Rachel Bluth reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge on Saturday paused a Trump administration policy halting an immigration program that allowed migrants from some Central and South American countries to reunite with their family members in the United States while awaiting visas. The order extends the “family reunification parole” status of immigrants who were set to see it expire on Wednesday. Adam Sella reports for the New York Times.

The black-and-white pins displayed slogans like “BE GOOD” and “ICE OUT,” introducing a political angle into the awards show after last year’s relatively apolitical ceremony.

Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne wore the pins on the red carpet, while Jean Smart and Ariana Grande donned them once inside the ballroom. Smart had the pin on her dress as she accepted the award for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy series.

Since the shooting Wednesday, protests have broken out across the country, calling for accountability for Good’s death as well as a separate shooting in Portland where Border Patrol agents wounded two people. Some protests have resulted in clashes with law enforcement, especially in Minneapolis, where ICE is carrying out its largest immigration enforcement operation to date.

“We need every part of civil society, society to speak up,” said Nelini Stamp of Working Families Power, one of the organizers for the anti-ICE pins. “We need our artists. We need our entertainers. We need the folks who reflect society.”

Congressmembers have vowed an assertive response, and an FBI investigation into Good’s killing is ongoing. The Trump administration has doubled down in defending the ICE officer’s actions, maintaining that he was acting in self-defense and thought Good would hit him with her car.

Just a week before Good was killed, an off-duty ICE officer fatally shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Porter in Los Angeles. His death sparked protests in the Los Angeles area, calling for the officer responsible to be arrested.

Organizers bring grassroots push to Golden Globes parties

The idea for the “ICE OUT” pins began with a late-night text exchange earlier this week between Stamp and Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director of a Latino advocacy group called Maremoto.

They know that high-profile cultural moments can introduce millions of viewers to social issues. This is the third year of Golden Globes activism for Morales Rocketto, who has previously rallied Hollywood to protest the Trump administration’s family separation policies. Stamp said she always thinks of the 1973 Oscars, when Sacheen Littlefeather took Marlon Brando’s place and declined his award to protest American entertainment’s portrayal of Native Americans.

So, the two organizers began calling up the celebrities and influencers they knew, who in turn brought their campaign to the more prominent figures in their circles. That initial outreach included labor activist Ai-jen Poo, who walked the Golden Globes’ red carpet in 2018 with Meryl Streep to highlight the Time’s Up movement.

“There is a longstanding tradition of people who create art taking a stand for justice in moments,” Stamp said. “We’re going to continue that tradition.”

Allies of their movement have been attending the “fancy events” that take place in the days leading up to the Golden Globes, according to Stamp. They’re passing out the pins at parties and distributing them to neighbors who will be attending tonight’s ceremony.

“They put it in their purse and they’re like, ‘Hey would you wear this?’ It’s so grassroots,” Morales Rocketto said.

The organizers pledged to continue the campaign throughout awards season to ensure the public knows the names of Good and others killed by ICE agents in shootings.

A former officer in the Marines, Zarkades said he is thinking of moving to Orange to escape the presence of so many Trump supporters in Huntington Beach.
Large protests against ICE occurred in the Bay Area as well as Sacramento and other California cities over the weekend.
In Huntington Beach, the coastal community has long had a reputation as a Southern California stronghold for Republicans, though its politics have recently been shifting.","More than 60 largely peaceful protests took place this weekend against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, including several in Southern California.

But while many protests were without incident, they were not short on anger and moments of tension. Organizers called the gatherings the “ICE Out for Good” weekend of action in response to the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.

In Huntington Beach, Ron Duplantis, 72, carried a diagram to represent the three shots fired at Good, including one through her windshield and two others that appeared to go through her side window.

“Those last two shots,” he said, “make it clear to me that this is murder.”

Huntington Beach has seen past clashes between Trump supporters and anti-racism activists, but as of mid-afternoon, Sunday’s protest was tense at times, but free of violence. About 300 people — and two dozen counterprotesters — stood outside City Hall, with protesters carrying anti-ICE signs, ringing cowbells and chanting “ICE out of O.C.”

As cars sped past them on Main Street, many motorists honked in a show of solidarity, while some rolled down their windows to shout their support for ICE, MAGA and President Trump.

“The reason why I’m here is democracy,” said Mary Artesani, a 69-year-old Costa Mesa resident carrying a sign that read “RESIST.” “They have to remember he won’t be in office forever.”

The Trump administration has largely stood behind the ICE agent, identified as Jonathan Ross, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem saying he acted in self-defense. Democratic officials and many members of the public have said the videos of the shooting circulating on social media appear to contradict at least some of the administration’s assertions.

“I’m outraged a woman was murdered by our government and our government lied to our faces about it,” said protester Tony Zarkades, 60, who has lived in the Huntington Beach area for nearly 30 years. A former officer in the Marines, Zarkades said he is thinking of moving to Orange to escape the presence of so many Trump supporters in Huntington Beach.

Large protests against ICE occurred in the Bay Area as well as Sacramento and other California cities over the weekend. In Oakland, hundreds demonstrated peacefully on Sunday, although the night before, protesters assembled at the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building and left graffiti, according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle.

In Los Angeles on Saturday night, protesters marched through the downtown area to City Hall and past the Edward Roybal Federal Building, with the L.A. Police Department issuing a dispersal order at about 6:30 p.m., according to City News Service.

While many of the protests focused on what happened to Good in Minnesota, they also recognized Keith Porter Jr., a man killed by an off-dutyICE agent in Northridge on New Year’s Eve.

In Huntington Beach, the coastal community has long had a reputation as a Southern California stronghold for Republicans, though its politics have recently been shifting. Orange County has a painful legacy of political extremism, including neo-Nazism. In 2021, a “White Lives Matter” rally in the area ended in 12 arrests.

On Sunday, a small group of about 30 counterprotesters waved Trump and MAGA flags on a corner opposite from the anti-ICE rally.

“We’re here to support our country and president and support ICE,” said Kelly Johnson, who gave his age as “old enough to be your sugar daddy.”

Wearing an “ICE Immigration: Making America Safe Again” T-shirt, Kelly said the protesters were “paid agitators” who had been lied to by the media.

“Look at the other angles of the [shooting] videos,” he said. “She ran over the officer.”

Standing with him was Jesse Huizar, 66, who said he identifies as a “Latino for Trump” and was here to “support the blue.”

The Chino resident said he came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 5, but that he has no fear of ICE because he “came here legally.”

Huizar said Good’s death was sad, but that she “if she had complied, if she got out of her car and followed orders, she’d be alive right now.”

But their voices were largely overpowered by those of the anti-ICE protesters. One of the event’s organizers, 52-year-old Huntington Beach resident Denise G., who declined to give her last name, said they’ve been gathering in front of City Hall every Sunday since March, but that this was by far one of the largest turnouts they have seen.

She felt “devastated, angry, and more determined than ever” when she saw the video of Good’s shooting, she said.

“It could be any one of us,” she said. “The people not out here today need to understand this could be their family member, their spouse, their children. The time is now. All hands on deck.”

Nearby, 27-year-old Yvonne Gonzales had gathered with about 10 of her friends. They said they were motivated to come because they were outraged by the shooting.

“I wish I was surprised by it,” Gonzales said, “but we’ve seen so much violence from ICE.”

She suspected that race was a factor in the outpouring of support, noting that Good was a white woman while many others who have been injured or killed by immigration enforcement actions have been people of color, but that it was still “great to see this turnout and visibility.”

A few feet away, 41-year-old Christie Martinez stood with her children, Elliott, 9, and Kane, 6.

Minneapolis still tense after Renee Good shooting

The Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — is bracing for what is next after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer on Wednesday.

“We’re seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighborhoods,” said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city councilmember. “They’ve definitely been out here.”

Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents an area with a growing immigrant population, said he is closely monitoring information from chat groups about where residents are seeing agents operating.

People holding whistles positioned themselves in freezing temperatures on street corners Sunday in the neighborhood where Good was killed, watching for any signs of federal agents.

More than 20,000 people have taken part in a variety of trainings to become “observers” of enforcement activities in Minnesota since the 2024 election, said Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos MN, a local human rights organization.

“It’s a role that people choose to take on voluntarily, because they choose to look out for their neighbors,” Argueta said.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but residents remained anxious. On Monday, Minneapolis public schools will start offering remote learning for the next month in response to concerns that children might feel unsafe venturing out while tensions remain high.

Many schools closed last week after Good’s shooting and the upheaval that followed.

Questions about who should handle investigation

While the enforcement activity continues, two of the state’s leading Democrats said that the investigation into Good's shooting death should not be overseen solely by the federal government.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in separate interviews Sunday that state authorities should be included in the investigation because the federal government has already made clear what it believes happened.

“How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation, without prejudice, when at the beginning of that investigation they have already announced exactly what they saw — what they think happened,"" Smith said on ABC’s ""This Week.""

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, defended the officer on Fox News Channel’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

""That law enforcement officer had milliseconds, if not short time to make a decision to save his life and his other fellow agents,” he said.

Lyons also said the administration’s enforcement operations in Minnesota wouldn't be needed “if local jurisdictions worked with us to turn over these criminally illegal aliens once they are already considered a public safety threat by the locals.”

The killing of Good by an ICE officer and the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, led to dozens of protests in cities across the country over the weekend, including New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Oakland, California.

“We’re just here to support our community, the Hispanic community to show them that they are not alone, we fight for them.
“I think many people think that will not be happening here in Clarksburg, West Virginia, but it’s happening.
“We don’t have a high percentage of Hispanic community.
I think everyone is still in shock that this can happen in such a small community,” Strauss said.","CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (WBOY) — As the Harrison County community made their voices heard on Sunday, many Hispanic West Virginians took the time to share the fear they are experiencing.

Following anti-ICE protests and rallies across the country, this small community says they have been the target of many raids and have received a lot of hate online.

12 News spoke with 3 protesters, Nury Ruble, Nina Strauss and Daisy Rivera, each belonging to the Hispanic community, about why they chose to attend the protest.

“We are in favor of human rights; we are here to support people that are scared and they don’t want to leave their houses. We are in very tough times right now, but we are here,” said Ruble.

“We’re just here to support our community, the Hispanic community to show them that they are not alone, we fight for them. Obviously, they cannot be here for being scared of the citation that we’re living here in Clarksburg right now. But we are here for them,” said Strauss.

“We just want ice to go away because our community is scared,” said Rivera.

Hispanic people living in the area believe that much of the tension comes online from many immigrants being labeled as criminal or illegal. They say these misconceptions can be harmful to those who have settled in the mountain state.

Ruble says she has been teaching here for more than eight years.

“We are adding many things to this community. I’ve been here serving as a teacher, a Hispanic teacher for 8 years. I’ve been working, I do as best as I can for this community, so we are not here, we are not criminals like many people think.”

Rivera told 12 News that her family has lived here for more than 20 years.

“Our families need us to work. We are not criminals. I myself, I went to college, Fairmont State, and my family, they have a business here,” Rivera said.

Now, those concerns about misconceptions have turned to fear. Ruble and Strauss say that it has been difficult to process ICE’s presence in north central West Virginia.

“I think many people think that will not be happening here in Clarksburg, West Virginia, but it’s happening. It’s what I know that people know. It’s happening, people are scared, and it’s a small community. There is not much diversity in this area, but we are scared,” Ruble said.

“We don’t have a high percentage of Hispanic community. There is not a lot of us here and it is shocking. I think everyone is still in shock that this can happen in such a small community,” Strauss said.

Pro-ICE protestors were also present in Clarksburg, but the gathering remained civil on both sides.",https://www.wboy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2026/01/MVI_8079.MP4.21_04_12_17.Still002.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-12 13:59:01.760016

,Policy,2026-01-12 13:04:25+00:00,POLITICO,'Brace for impact': Trump turns fraud into new weapon against blue states - POLITICO,"Blake Jones, Jeremy B. White, Nick Reisman",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/12/brace-for-impact-trump-turns-fraud-into-new-weapon-against-blue-states-00719401,"“He told us he was going to punish blue states.
While hostilities between Trump and Democratic-led states on immigration intensify following shootings in Minnesota and Oregon, he is now moving more aggressively on a separate track to cut off states’ funding.
“He’s attacking blue states out of revenge,” said Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois.
That choice drove a wedge between prominent California Democrats even before Trump moved to cut off funds.
Still, some New York Democrats wish the state were more aggressive in counteracting Trump’s efforts to mold blue states’ political destinies.","“I’ll say one thing about our president: He told us he was going to do this,” Manhattan Democrat Liz Krueger, the influential chair of the New York Senate Finance Committee, said of the administration’s funding cuts. “He told us he was going to punish blue states. We have to brace for impact, we have to use our legal skills, our amazing attorney general, and endless lawsuits to at least hold them back.”

The spending-focused line of attack from Trump marks an escalation in Trump’s already red-hot war on blue states. While hostilities between Trump and Democratic-led states on immigration intensify following shootings in Minnesota and Oregon, he is now moving more aggressively on a separate track to cut off states’ funding. And if “waste, fraud and abuse” is a familiar rallying cry for Republicans, it is now serving as fresh ammunition for Trump’s targeting of his political adversaries.

“He’s attacking blue states out of revenge,” said Democratic Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois. “If that’s in the form of sending in ICE, he sends in ICE. If it’s denying food and education to their children, which to be clear are America’s children, he’s gonna do that. What he is doing is seeking revenge at the cost of America’s most vulnerable people, putting those communities at risk.”

Trump’s offensive is already roiling politics in targeted states, where Democrats have largely chosen between two approaches to fending off the administration: casting the allegations as baseless or leaning into the risk of fraud and vowing to police it themselves.

That choice drove a wedge between prominent California Democrats even before Trump moved to cut off funds. Rep. Eric Swalwell, while saying that “Donald Trump looking for fraud is like OJ looking for the real killer,” nevertheless incorporated the issue into his campaign for governor by proposing a program rewarding state employees who identify misspending.

Meanwhile, Newsom’s office pushed back after Rep. Ro Khanna asserted, with dubious evidence, that California had lost $72 billion to fraud and called for more federal scrutiny. Khanna, also a potential presidential contender, has argued Democrats must crack down on wasteful spending if they are to build public trust.

“My view is there is mismanagement and inefficient spending that we need to account for, in California and in states across the country,” Khanna said in an interview.

From the Newsom administration’s perspective, Khanna was unhelpfully amplifying a conservative talking point underpinned by questionable math. Republicans at the highest level have hammered the $72 billion figure, which appears to be an amalgam of previously reported unemployment fraud, high-speed rail expenditures and spending programs flagged by the state’s auditor for being vulnerable to fraud or poorly tracked.

Newsom has worked to flip the script by arguing Trump squandered taxpayer money with a National Guard deployment blocked by the courts, while his office posted an AI-generated image of the governor punching a man wearing a shirt reading “FRAUD” and mocking Vice President JD Vance for labeling as fraud the state’s provision of health insurance to undocumented patients.

In New York, Democrats were alarmed by the Trump administration’s decision to yank funding and have already signaled plans to file legal challenges. But the president’s broadside is scrambling the fraught election-year politics facing New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.

A moderate Democrat who speaks frequently with the president, Hochul condemned the move and vowed to fight it in court.

“It’s this depth of cruelty,” she told MSNOW. “They think they’re going to get to me, but the kids are the political pawns in this process, and they’re not doing that calculation.”

Hochul has already tangled with Trump over his administration’s unsuccessful efforts to kill a controversial Manhattan toll plan, which is meant to generate cash for New York City area mass transit projects.

Still, some New York Democrats wish the state were more aggressive in counteracting Trump’s efforts to mold blue states’ political destinies. And Trump’s cuts are bolstering calls to hike taxes on rich people in California and New York, a move both states’ governors oppose.

“It’s going to require us to really do what we should be doing, which is sharing our prosperity here in New York,” Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, who is challenging Hochul in a June primary, said in an interview. “Obviously his decision is disgusting, immoral and deeply regrettable. That being said, New York has a responsibility to step up and do what we can. If that means raising revenue, we should.”

The development arrives at a delicate time for Hochul and newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. The two Democrats are pursuing the creation of a free child care program — a politically popular, but expensive measure that’s expected to cost $15 billion once fully phased in.

Mamdani, who had a surprisingly chummy visit with Trump after his election last year where they bonded over sharing voters in the Big Apple, called the cuts “a cruel decision.”

In Colorado, the Trump administration is threatening a $24 million cut over commercial drivers licenses it says were illegally issued to immigrants. The state’s Democratic attorney general in a court filing Thursday accused the president of waging a “revenge campaign” by withholding funding and declining to release a pardoned elections clerk from prison, according to local media reports.

The state was also targeted with the child care funding freeze, as were Illinois, New York, Minnesota and California. All five states are suing in an attempt to access the money, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the cuts on Friday in response.

For Republicans, the scandal in Minnesota served not only as fresh justification for cuts targeting blue states, but also demonstrated the effectiveness of a fraud-focused line of attack.

“There’s no bigger political target on the landscape than Gavin Newsom,” said Jon Fleischman, a former executive director of the California GOP. “So if you go into Minnesota and uncover this kind of fraud, why wouldn’t you want to look at whether or not this kind of fraud is going on in California?”

A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

In the wake of Walz dropping his reelection campaign, Democrats are laboring to contain the blast radius, fearing that even unsubstantiated allegations could resonate with voters.

“The withholding of funds, that’s a huge headache. But the other headache is that when the president says stuff like this, it undermines people’s confidence in government,” said California state Sen. Tom Umberg, a Democrat and former federal prosecutor. “It creates unnecessary turmoil based on nothing but fabricated allegations.”

In response, some Democratic operatives are warning against being drawn into a debate about public spending that focuses on potential fraud rather than on the people who benefit from a robust social safety net.

“Donald Trump is weaponizing the federal government in order to harm poor people and exert dominance over his foes,” said Mike Shimpock, a Los Angeles based consultant. “The debate isn’t: ‘Is there fraud in social services?’ The debate is: Are you creating a government that’s run for billionaires and corporations?”

Elizabeth Ashford, a consultant whose clients include California’s Assembly speaker, Robert Rivas, argued California’s extensive system of budget oversight committees and audits is effectively policing the system.

“Trump is in panic, wag-the-dog mode, and of course he is only going after Democratic governors — that’s how he operates,” Ashford said, drawing a parallel between Trump threatening childcare funding and California struggling to wring more wildfire assistance out of the federal government.

“We’ve already paid for this stuff,” Ashford said. “Now he’s going to take this money and move it around to red states? It’s disgusting.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F44%2F31%2Fd6c8060041b0ac54bb98481006ee%2Ftrump-30700.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 10:59:40.998433

As part of the deal, Northwestern agreed to pay the Department of the Treasury $75 million and “adhere to federal anti-discrimination laws.”

Bienen said at the State of the University address Thursday that there were several provisions in the deal that he disagreed with. However, he defended signing his name to it to reduce the potential for “years of uncertainty” that would come with suing the federal administration.

In addition to uncertainty around federal funding, his interim presidency has coincided with increased federal immigration enforcement in Evanston.

Bienen sat down with The Daily on Friday to talk about the deal with the federal government to restore funding and how the University would respond to immigration enforcement on campus.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

The Daily: For the federal government, who were you really dealing with? Who were you communicating with?

Bienen: Well, different people at different times. So, and I don’t know, I’m not trying to protect the federal government, particularly. I don’t know what I would want to say about the individuals. But, I would rather say we were dealing with the Justice Department, and the leading office in the Justice Department was the Office for Civil Rights, and the Justice Department was represented by an assistant attorney general … There was a representative from the White House, and then there were, at different times, the Department of Education — the secretary and the general counsel of Education. While they were involved, if you asked me who I think was making decisions about this, I think it was the Justice Department.

The Daily: How many versions (of the deal) did you see that you said you would never sign?

Bienen: More than one, a couple of versions, but they didn’t change very often. One of the problems, I think, and why I don’t like the term ‘negotiation.’ Most people would understand by negotiation, you give me a list of things you want. I reply to it. I say what I don’t like about your list, and we go back and forth. I would say that that would not characterize the dealings with the federal government. Because we would say something, then we wouldn’t hear anything … We had different sets of lawyers, and you know, that was frustrating …

And finally, we had something that I was willing to put my name on, and at the very last minute after the federal government said, ‘Okay, we have a deal,’ … And then they sent in two new provisos, which were not part of (the deal), and I said I wouldn’t sign them.

The Daily: And what was on those?

Bienen: I’m not going to say what was on them, but I will say only one general thing about it: Part of the deal which was very important to me was, you can’t look back and put something in the agreement which allows the federal government to relitigate with us all the aspects of the deal. … And the other thing that was really important to me was not to have an outside monitor, not to have somebody the federal government would appoint, or have somebody we would jointly appoint, that was outside the University, which is what they did with Columbia. … It was really important to me just to have a certainty we were done with this, not for anybody to go back and say, “Oh, well, what about that?” So, there was a new paragraph that, as I read it — I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t think you had to be a great lawyer to read this paragraph — it looked to me like it could open up everything, and I would never sign it. And I told Mr. Barris, you know, I wouldn’t sign it. Get another president. But Mr. Barris had the same view. …

It wasn’t something terrible in the other paragraph. What I found objectionable is that they were asking us to do it. It’s not up to the federal government to tell us, as I’ve said over and over again, who we can hire, who we can fire, what we teach, what organizations we affiliate with, and this proviso overstepped the line in that regard. … We said, “That’s it. I mean, we’re just not going to sign this stuff.” And then two hours later, they took all that out of the proviso.

The Daily: Some students and faculty expressed concern about the fact that the deal with the government followed the Executive Order’s definition of gender as gender assigned at birth. Why was that explicitly included in the agreement?

Bienen: The federal government was, to my view, unmovable in those conversations. As I said the other day at the State of the University, I don’t like any of the language that has to do with gender or transgender, and I think most of it is irrelevant to what we do. The federal government disagreed.

The Daily: Also in the deal, the University is supposed to review its business practices related to international students. How is the University going to do that? And if it finds an “overreliance” on international student admissions, will the University change anything?

Bienen: We are not dependent on international students. Just to speak about undergraduates for a minute — it’s good for the University to have international students. It’s good for the world that we train people in the things we’re good at, whether it’s mathematics or chemistry or history, whatever. A great university should have a diverse population in it by every way you can figure it to my mind, including people who want to come here from different countries. It’s a good thing for us, it’s a good thing for them.

The Daily: There’s particular language about treating international students, what it means to “socialize international students to the norms of a campus dedicated to inquiry and open debate.” Is that something new? Or, has that always been there?

Bienen: No, that’s new that they insisted on this. Again, I think all the training stuff, I’m on record as saying I don’t love these training programs. I think they’re silly. That’s another thing they wanted. Doesn’t mean somebody has to do something. They just have to listen to somebody say something. If that’s improved the quality of humankind, it’s news to me — that somebody was forced to go someplace, to sit and listen to something they didn’t want to listen to. And once in a while, I suppose you’ll learn something under those conditions. I doubt it’s a maximal use of time. However, that’s part of the deal.

The Daily: The University agreed not to provide permanent housing for Middle Eastern and North African students and to take away their temporary space —

Bienen: One of the things we would like is, we’re working on it now, is to try to provide different kind of housing for people, so for Islamic groups, not necessarily MENA. But I’ve met with folks, and we want to help provide housing which is off-campus, which is what we do for Chabad and what we do for Hillel.

The Daily: Does the Northwestern University Police Department have a response plan in place in case some of that enforcement activity (by ICE) does manage to happen on campus?

Bienen: Good question that I don’t know the answer to.

The Daily: What would the University’s response be if, for example, a student or faculty or staff member were to be detained or questioned by federal immigration enforcers on campus?

Bienen: I think we would try to provide help, legal assistance, to faculty or staff. If you’re asking the hypothetical, would we fight with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on campus? They’ve never asked to come to campus. The federal government can come onto your campus. It has the right to do that. I wouldn’t like it very much.

In Minnesota, federal goals include investigating people for fraudulently acquired lawful status, including some admitted as refugees.","In Minnesota, long-simmering tensions between federal and local power have spilled over. Last week’s fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer in Minneapolis turned the city into a symbol of national resistance to federal immigration enforcement. The tragedy also thrust deteriorating relations between state leaders and President Donald Trump into the spotlight.

State and federal officials say an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot Ms. Good on a residential street during a surge of immigration arrests in the city. Beyond those facts, reaction stands sharply divided: Senior Trump administration officials likened the woman killed to a domestic terrorist and claimed she attempted to kill officers with her car. Minnesota officials vehemently reject that account, arguing video footage shows the U.S. citizen and mother of three tried to leave the scene. The Minneapolis mayor has told ICE to leave, but more federal law enforcement personnel are on their way.

Under the United States’ federal system, set up by the Constitution, states and the federal government are given their own spheres of influence – and an expectation of collaboration. The friction in Minnesota highlights how, at a time of deep political division, the risks of intensifying confrontations are heightened, analysts say. And the divide is not just among political leaders. In Minneapolis and across the U.S. this weekend, thousands of protesters gathered to honor Ms. Good and decry the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics – echoing protests in 2020 after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by a local police officer.

“Certainly Minnesota and the federal government, or the Trump administration, has had some difficulties, but it really seems to have hit an inflection point and heated up,” says Amy Koch, a Republican political strategist and former Minnesota Senate majority leader. “Both sides have become so divided that they can’t even agree on things that seem obvious.”

Separate investigations into Ms. Good’s death by officials in Washington, D.C., and in Minnesota, breaking from tradition, mirror the split-screen political fissure of the broader United States. The showdown here builds on power struggles between Mr. Trump and other Democratic strongholds, like in California, Illinois, and Oregon, where the administration has sent or attempted to send National Guard troops in recent months.

On the ground in Minneapolis, the immigration enforcement surge looks disproportionate to the size of the immigrant population, says Ryan Allen, associate dean for research at the University of Minnesota. About 2% of the state’s population is made up of immigrants without legal status, according to the Pew Research Center, much lower than some other states including California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

Sanctuary policies versus federal law

Yet nationwide, the conflict between federal and local government over immigration has long roots. For decades, Congress has failed to agree on comprehensive policies to address border security and unauthorized immigrants. Some largely Democratic states and cities, Minneapolis among them, developed what are often called sanctuary policies for immigrants.

In turn, the Trump administration has targeted those states and cities, with Minnesota in its sights long before this winter. Sanctuary status lacks a firm definition, but suggests a city, county, or state that limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. In Minneapolis, one recently revised city ordinance underscores the tension. The policy says no government entity is authorized to use city-owned parking lots, vacant lots, or garages for immigration operations.

Still, ICE has law-enforcement allies in the state. Out of Minnesota’s 87 counties, seven sheriffs have cooperative agreements with the agency, which deputize state and local law enforcement for certain immigration actions. Those seven counties voted for Mr. Trump in 2024, and inked their ICE agreements after his return.

In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also pledged to target Minnesota over pandemic-era fraud in social services programs, over which several people of Somali descent have been convicted or charged. (The White House says the Department of Justice so far has charged 94 people in fraud cases tied to Minnesota, 85 of whom are of Somali descent.) A top U.S. prosecutor estimates fraud from Medicaid programs in the state could top $9 billion. After the yearslong fraud investigations resurfaced through right-wing media attention, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to send 2,000 federal agents to the state in early January.

While the state’s Somali population was impacted by a travel ban under Mr. Trump’s first term, the current crackdown in Minneapolis is a “much more focused attention that has been, if anything, ramped up over the past month,” Professor Allen says.

A divide over the shooting investigation

One sign of the breakdown in trust is the dissolution of a partnership between state and federal officials on investigating Ms. Good’s death.

Minnesota investigators initially worked on the case of Ms. Good’s shooting in collaboration with federal investigators. But that process halted, according to the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which said the FBI would take over the investigation. The state and Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, have put out calls to crowdsource evidence for their own investigation.

Data sharing is a key part of federal-state cooperation, says Paul Nolette, professor of political science at Marquette University. The absence of that sharing, in the Good case, “really is an escalation of tensions,” he says.

“Typically the baseline, regardless of the administration, usually is cooperation,” says Dr. Nolette. That means “state and federal agencies – as well as local agencies and prosecutors – working to build cases against the accused and carry out justice.”

At an anti-ICE march in Minneapolis on Saturday, where thousands faced subfreezing temperatures, a woman named Sarah called for the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to be included by the FBI in the shooting investigation. The high school teacher, like others interviewed, declined to share her full name for privacy concerns.

“When we all stand together, it feels really powerful,” Sarah says as the chanting crowd passes by.

Some Minnesotans worry about how to address fraud – and keep people safe amid the federal-state tension.

In a parking lot in Blaine, a suburb north of Minneapolis, a man named Tim says he is concerned about fraud in the state, and supports more immigrant arrests. “You want to be humanitarian. At the same time, what can we afford?” he asks.

The Minneapolis shooting last week was “tragic,” says the construction worker who also drives semitrucks, though it seems she “put herself in that situation by interfering and obstructing ICE.” He expects more people to get hurt on “both sides.”

Before thousands marched Saturday, anti-federal fervor in Minneapolis had turned aggressive late in the week. The city announced an unlawful assembly, with 30 people detained for blocking roads and damaging property downtown. Near the airport, clashes between federal agents and protesters have continued at a federal building.

Trump and Walz at odds since 2024

Disputes between President Trump and Minnesota politicians – including Gov. Tim Walz – aren’t new.

The May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer – about a mile from Ms. Good’s killing – sparked countrywide protests and a national reckoning over race. Local demonstrations at times turned violent, with arson, looting, and property damage, which Mr. Trump and fellow Republicans condemned. Governor Walz declared a “peacetime emergency” at the time and called up the Minnesota National Guard. In recent days, the governor asked those service members to prepare in case they’re tapped again.

In 2024, Mr. Trump and Governor Walz faced off on the campaign trail, with Vice President Kamala Harris picking Mr. Walz as her running mate. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the governor incompetent.

Governor Walz has taken heat for calling immigration officers “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.” The administration says such language incites violence, and affirms agents’ use of masks to hide their faces.

“The vice president candidate usually becomes the chief attack dog. And so Governor Walz started doing that job,” says Ms. Koch. “Postelection, Governor Walz continued to be a really vocal, outspoken detractor of this administration.”

In June, political violence rocked the state with the fatal shooting of Minnesota’s Democratic state representative and former state House Speaker Melissa Hortman, along with her husband. A Democratic state senator and his wife were also shot. President Trump, himself a survivor of political assassination attempts, posted a conspiracy video insinuating the governor’s involvement in Ms. Hortman’s death, which her children have asked the president to remove.

Federal action meets grassroots activism

The White House has seized before on serious but isolated incidents involving immigrant suspects to justify crackdowns on broader groups. In Minnesota, federal goals include investigating people for fraudulently acquired lawful status, including some admitted as refugees.

Meanwhile, grassroots anti-Trump activism has surged in response to more immigration enforcement in Minnesota, including information networks on federal sightings, anti-ICE signs at businesses, and meal deliveries to families who fear leaving home. While local activists have learned from other cities responding to upticks in immigrant arrests, Minneapolis also has experience building organizing networks around the protests of 2020, says Professor Allen.

“I think part of what we’re seeing is a reliance on some of that knowledge and infrastructure that has been built over a number of years,” he says.

Some efforts are more recent. The nonprofit COPAL, an advocacy group for Latino families, started training legal observers, who monitor federal law enforcement, after the 2024 election. The group trained around 400 people the night after Ms. Good’s death. Trainees are told to record arrests in public spaces while keeping several feet from officers, says Francisco Segovia, the executive director.

“We are not going to obstruct or intervene,” he says. Local documentation of Ms. Good’s killing on a residential street proves that videos are key “to make our government accountable,” he says. Activism aside, however, many immigrants live with fear of arrest.

“We know people who have documents, but they are afraid to go out or go to work,” says Mr. Segovia. “The psychological impact of this is huge.”

Nationally, beyond scenes of division, Americans may actually want compromise on immigration. Polling suggests strong support for strong border security and easier paths to citizenship for immigrants already here. Last year, concern about immigration’s effects on the U.S. also declined.

“They can’t come out”

How big a blow Mr. Trump will land in Minnesota remains to be seen. For now, a federal judge in New York has stopped his plan to freeze federal child care funding there and in four other Democrat-led states.

Still, citing fraud concerns and anti-ICE hostility, several agencies are tightening the vise. The Treasury Department has said it will ramp up fraud investigations. The Small Business Administration announced the relocation of its Minneapolis office. And the Agriculture Department pledged to pause financial awards to the city and the state.

On the ground, immigration arrests continue, with more agents on the way. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that “hundreds” more federal officers were headed to Minnesota to boost the safety of officers already present. Many lawfully present Minnesotans – and U.S. citizens – carry their passport or other paperwork in case officers stop them on the street. Others have retreated from public view.

On Saturday, a Minneapolis school bus driver named Luis marched alone on his family’s behalf. The U.S. citizen says several loved ones fear arrest.

“My mom, my dad, my nephews, my wife – they’re at home,” says Luis. “They can’t come out.”
