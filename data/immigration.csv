The new facility, located in the southwest part of the state, was dubbed “Cornhusker Clink” and will house “criminal illegal aliens” arrested by ICE, DHS said in a press release. The detention center came as a result of a partnership between the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services and ICE, expanding the capacity by up to 280 beds.

The officials are using the existing minimum security prison work camp in McCook, located around 210 miles west of Lincoln.

“Today, we’re announcing a new partnership with the state of Nebraska to expand detention bed space by 280 beds,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. “Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country. If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska’s Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self-deport now using the CBP Home App.”

The administration has continued adding detention buildings nationwide to help hold migrants whom agencies have arrested. DHS opened “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades last month and an East Montana detention facility in El Paso, Texas, this week. DHS will also hold up to 1,000 migrants in a “Speedway Slammer” detention facility in Indiana.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced Tuesday that the Nebraska National Guard will provide “administrative and logistical” support to ICE officials based in Nebraska to help enforce immigration laws. About 20 Army National Guard soldiers will be a part of the mission, with training beginning next week, according to DHS.

“I am also proud that the Nebraska State Patrol and National Guard will be assisting ICE enforcement efforts, as well,” Pillen said in a statement. “Homeland security starts at home, and, just as when I twice deployed troops to secure our southern border during the failed Biden administration, Nebraska will continue to do its part.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/hill_nation_summit_071625gn082-e1752677864106.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-19 22:56:40.739170

“Immigration benefits—including to live and work in the United States—remain a privilege, not a right.” It isn’t specified what constitutes anti-Americanism and it isn’t clear how and when the directive would be applied.
“The agency cannot tell officers that they have to deny — just to consider it as a negative discretion,” she said.
“It means you are going to just do a whole lot more work to provide evidence that you meet our standards,” Lopez said.
Experts disagree on the constitutionality of the policy involving people who are not U.S. citizens and their freedom of speech.","Immigrants seeking a legal pathway to live and work in the United States will now be subject to screening for “anti-Americanism’,” authorities said Tuesday, raising concerns among critics that it gives officers too much leeway in rejecting foreigners based on a subjective judgment.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said officers will now consider whether an applicant for benefits, such as a green card, “endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused” anti-American, terrorist or antisemitic views.

“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” Matthew Tragesser, USCIS spokesman, said in a statement. “Immigration benefits—including to live and work in the United States—remain a privilege, not a right.”

It isn’t specified what constitutes anti-Americanism and it isn’t clear how and when the directive would be applied.

“The message is that the U.S. and immigration agencies are going to be less tolerant of anti-Americanism or antisemitism when making immigration decisions,” Elizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions, said on Tuesday.

Jacobs said the government is being more explicit in the kind of behaviors and practices officers should consider, but emphasized that discretion is still in place. “The agency cannot tell officers that they have to deny — just to consider it as a negative discretion,” she said.

Critics worry the policy update will allow for more subjective views of what is considered anti-American and allow an officer’s personal bias to cloud his or her judgment.

“For me, the really big story is they are opening the door for stereotypes and prejudice and implicit bias to take the wheel in these decisions. That’s really worrisome,” said Jane Lilly Lopez, associate professor of sociology at Brigham Young University.

The policy changes follow others recently implemented since the start of the Trump administration including social media vetting and the most recent addition of assessing applicants seeking naturalization for ‘good moral character’. That will not only consider “not simply the absence of misconduct” but also factor the applicant’s positive attributes and contributions.

“It means you are going to just do a whole lot more work to provide evidence that you meet our standards,” Lopez said.

Experts disagree on the constitutionality of the policy involving people who are not U.S. citizens and their freedom of speech. Jacobs, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said First Amendment rights do not extend to people outside the U.S. or who are not U.S. citizens.

Ruby Robinson, senior managing attorney with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, believes the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution protects all people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, against government encroachment. “A lot of this administration’s activities infringe on constitutional rights and do need to be resolved, ultimately, in courts,” Robinson added.

Attorneys are advising clients to adjust their expectations.

“People need to understand that we have a different system today and a lot more things that apply to U.S. citizens are not going to apply to somebody who’s trying to enter the United States,” said Jaime Diez, an immigration attorney based in Brownsville, Texas.

Jonathan Grode, managing partner of Green and Spiegel immigration law firm, said the policy update was not unexpected considering how the Trump administration approaches immigration.

“This is what was elected. They’re allowed to interpret the rules the way they want,” Grode said. “The policy always to them is to shrink the strike zone. The law is still the same.”",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2018/09/ap_18242737991643_wide-a9d7ee18402e9856cb9c1419d92967c304ba8b38-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:57:05.863811

Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law.
Attorney general Pam Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not – in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.
And blasting the Trump administration’s “false and continuous attacks on American cities”, Wu said cities like Boston were being “targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion”.
“Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone,” she wrote.","Boston’s mayor Michelle Wu has hit back sharply at the Trump administration’s legal threats over sanctuary city immigration policies, declaring that “Boston will not back down”.

Wu told a news conference outside Boston’s city hall on Tuesday: “The US attorney general asked for a response by today, so here it is: stop attacking our cities to hide your administration’s failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law. And Boston will not back down from who we are and what we stand for.”

Last week, the US Department of Justice sent letters to 13 states, from California to Rhode Island, and 22 local governments, from Boston to Seattle, that it has deemed “sanctuary jurisdictions”, threatening their leaders with prosecution for allegedly “undermining” and “obstructing” federal immigration enforcement.

The letters warned that they could lose federal funds or face legal action if they do not assist with Donald Trump’s sweeping, aggressive and highly controversial immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts.

Attorney general Pam Bondi has warned that she intends to prosecute political leaders who are not – in her view - sufficiently supportive of immigration enforcement.

Bondi’s letter asked recipients to provide a response by 19 August that “confirms your commitment with complying with federal law and identifies the immediate initiatives you are taking to eliminate laws, policies and practices that impede federal immigration enforcement”.

On Tuesday, Wu hit back publicly. The progressive Democratic mayor was elected in 2021 to run the state capital of Massachusetts, the first woman and first person of color to do so. At her press conference, she listed some of the what she deems the administration’s failures.

“Under the Trump administration, groceries are less affordable, housing is harder to build, cures for cancer are farther away, and good news on our economy has been as hard to find as the Epstein list,” she said, essentially taunting both the US president and Bondi about an alleged list of financial clients of the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Wu’s address followed a blistering letter the mayor sent to Bondi earlier in the day, in which she asserted that Boston would not “bow down to unconstitutional threats or unlawful coercion” from the federal government.

She also addressed the Trump administration at the news conference, saying: “You are wrong on the law and you are wrong on safety. Most of all, you are wrong on cities.”

Trump has portrayed prominent, Democratic-run cities in recent days as being riddled with crime, following an extraordinary federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington DC.

Highlighting measures Boston has taken to tackle crime, often in partnership with federal authorities, Wu noted in her letter to Bondi Boston police department’s close work with state and federal law enforcement agencies “to address counterterrorism threats, protect our airport and our harbor, combat drug and human trafficking and hold perpetrators accountable for crimes”.

And blasting the Trump administration’s “false and continuous attacks on American cities”, Wu said cities like Boston were being “targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion”. “Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone,” she wrote.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec142fac6201ff2502e348192b4cdacf3909b69/0_0_3594_2877/master/3594.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=06c69a2c4fb712ab1a68a4050d22a664",N,,2025-08-19 20:56:43.745575

“The Trump Administration is conducting immigration stops of California residents based solely off the color of their skin, the language that they speak, or the job that they work in a brazen violation of the Fourth Amendment,” said Attorney General Bonta.
Federal law enforcement’s tactics in conducting these stops, which include wearing masks and concealing the law enforcement entity they work for, have impeded local law enforcement and threatened public safety.

The lawsuit comes amid the Trump Administration’s campaign of conducting aggressive, militaristic immigration raids that have terrified immigrant and non-immigrant residents alike, chilled community members’ participation in civic society, and impeded law enforcement and public safety. The District Court for the Central District of California previously granted a temporary restraining order against ICE and CBP and the Ninth Circuit declined to stay that order, both concluding that the federal government’s conduct was likely unlawful. In today’s amicus brief, the attorneys general urge the court to grant further relief in the form of a preliminary injunction to prevent ongoing harms to the states and their residents.

“The Trump Administration is conducting immigration stops of California residents based solely off the color of their skin, the language that they speak, or the job that they work in a brazen violation of the Fourth Amendment,” said Attorney General Bonta. “These immigration raids are not about detaining violent criminals – they’re about meeting arbitrary quotas, no matter the cost. It’s not just immoral, it’s unconstitutional. I urge the court to block ICE and CBP from employing these racially-motivated, unscrupulous tactics and allow our communities to return to peace.”

In 1954, California was the first of two states targeted for immigration enforcement under an immigration enforcement initiative known as “Operation Wetback” that took its name from an ethnic slur. “Operation Wetback” involved the mass arrest and deportation of 300,000 people, including U.S. citizens. Unfortunately, history appears to be again repeating itself. During his presidential campaign, President Donald Trump praised “Operation Wetback” as a model, promising an aggressive and militarized crackdown on undocumented immigration. In recent months, the President has sought to follow through on this promise. He has praised masked immigration agents conducting unannounced enforcement actions throughout California communities and, in all too many instances, stopping residents without so much as a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct, leaving people afraid to leave their homes. In carrying out these suspicionless stops, the Trump Administration has made a target out of California’s diverse communities, chilled civic and economic participation, and damaged trust between law enforcement and communities.

In today’s amicus brief, the attorneys general argue that preliminary injunctive relief is in the public interest because:

CBP and ICE engaging in unlawful stops of Californians without a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity has harmed local economies, public health, and several other core facets of daily life.

Federal law enforcement’s tactics in conducting these stops, which include wearing masks and concealing the law enforcement entity they work for, have impeded local law enforcement and threatened public safety.

Attorney General Bonta is committed to holding President Trump and his administration accountable for overreaching their authority under the law and infringing on Californians’ constitutional rights. In June, Attorney General Bonta and Governor Newsom filed a lawsuit challenging the unlawful use of federalized California National Guard troops for civilian law enforcement in Los Angeles in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. Last week, the Attorney General’s Office presented evidence of these violations during a three-day trial before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The Mexican boxer was admitted to a prison outside of the city of Hermosillo, in the northern state of Sonora, an official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Tuesday because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed the news at her daily press conference.

""I understand he was deported. I don't know if it was yesterday or this morning, but we were informed that he was arriving in Mexico,"" Ms Sheinbaum said.

Chávez, 39, had a warrant for his arrest in Mexico for alleged arms and drug trafficking and ties to the Sinaloa cartel. Alejandro Gertz Manero, Mexico's attorney-general, said the investigation into Chávez started in 2019.

The boxer, who is the son of legendary Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez, was arrested by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers for overstaying a tourist visa on which he entered the US in August 2023 and which expired in February 2024, the Department of Homeland Security said in July.

The agency also said Chávez Jr submitted a number of fraudulent statements when he applied for permanent residency on April 2, 2024, based on his marriage to a US citizen, Frida Muñoz.

Ms Sheinbaum said after the arrest that she hoped the boxer would be deported to face his charges.

Chávez's father, who was a major celebrity in the 1980s and 1990s, defended his son following his arrest. However, he has not spoken since his deportation.

The younger Chávez has battled drug addiction for much of his boxing career, failing drug tests, serving suspensions and egregiously missing weight while being widely criticised for his intermittent dedication to the sport.

Chávez won the WBC middleweight title in 2011 and defended it three times. He shared the ring with generational greats Canelo Álvarez and Sergio Martinez, losing to both.

In 2012, he was convicted of drunken driving in Los Angeles and sentenced to 13 days in jail. In January 2024, he was arrested on gun charges.

Police said he possessed two AR-style ghost rifles. He was later freed on a $US50,000 ($77,400) bond on condition that he went to a residential drug treatment facility.

The agents allowed his dog to run loose, and treated Guerrero-Cruz like a criminal and joked while arresting him, his family said in a GoFundMe.

“He is more than just a student – he is a devoted son, a caring brother, a loyal friend, and a valued member of our community,” the family wrote, adding that he helps care for his younger brothers. “He is a good student, with a kind heart, who has always stepped up for his family.”

Educators and advocates are expected to hold a rally and press conference in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday afternoon to call for Guerrero-Cruz’s release. A former teacher who recently visited the teen is expected to share an update, ABC7 reported.

The arrest comes as Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants continues to unfold across southern California, where thousands of people have been arrested this summer at workplaces, at stores and near schools.

Los Angeles Unified school district, which has nearly 800 schools across the county, has adopted new strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration status”.

“Schools are safe spaces,” Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, said in a statement. “Immigration enforcement near schools disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the school day.”

Carvalho has said he is in communication with Guerrero-Cruz’s mother, who has alleged that the boy was being held with dozens of men, receiving water only once a day and insufficient food, in a space that doesn’t have enough room for everyone to sit or lie at the same time. The teen was reportedly being held at a detention center in Adelanto, where people have reported filthy conditions and not having access to clean clothes and towels for days at a time.

His sudden arrest has sparked outrage in his community. Fellow soccer players said it was “heartbreaking to see him taken from us like this, and we’ll truly miss not just the player, but the person he was”.

The accusations, made in a 35-page filing in Federal District Court in Nashville, amounted to an effort by Mr. Abrego Garcia to call out the behavior of the administration, which has been going after him in one form or another for nearly five months.

In a reminder of the government’s many missteps in the case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers pointed out that Trump officials first removed him from the United States in violation of a court order. They added that instead of taking the traditional path and quickly returning him, the White House “began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation” that led to his indictment.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been singled out by the United States government,” the lawyers wrote. “It is obvious why. And it is not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct. Nor is it because he poses some unique threat to this country. Instead, Mr. Abrego was charged because he refused to acquiesce in the government’s violation of his due process rights.”

The sharp-edged filing was the second time that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have sought to hold the Trump administration’s feet to the fire for how it has handled his expulsion to El Salvador and its aftermath. In mid-June, the lawyers asked Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing a civil case in Maryland arising from his deportation, to sanction the administration for its “sustained and flagrant” violations of her orders.

The filing in Tennessee came as Mr. Abrego Garcia’s intertwined civil and criminal cases neared a significant inflection point. He is likely to be freed from criminal custody on Friday after a federal judge in Nashville put his original release order on hold for a month. And that will force the government to decide whether it intends to push forward with his prosecution or turn him over to immigration officials to begin the process of deporting him again.

In a separate filing on Tuesday, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court in Tennessee to allow him to return to Maryland as a free man on Friday as the administration decides what to do next. He is already protected against immediate re-expulsion under a ruling issued last month by Judge Xinis, who ordered the administration to provide him with a warning of at least three business days if officials planned to seek his removal to a country other than El Salvador.

Motions for selective and vindictive prosecution are notoriously hard to win because they require proving that the government singled out a defendant for charges in comparison with similarly situated cases and used the charges to punish them merely for trying to vindicate their rights. While Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers acknowledged as much in their own motion, they also noted, “If there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case.”

They alleged that “a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign” against their client began almost from the moment that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family sued the Trump administration, seeking his return from El Salvador. Even after the White House realized that he had been mistakenly deported to a notorious terrorism prison in that country, officials “quickly latched onto unsubstantiated claims” that he was a member of the street gang MS-13 “to justify its mistake,” the lawyers wrote.

Those claims were subsequently echoed by top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who falsely declared in early April that Mr. Abrego Garcia “was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.” Other aides to Mr. Trump soon joined in what the lawyers described as an “effort to discredit Mr. Abrego,” claiming publicly that he was “violent, a gang member and a terrorist.”

Presiding over the civil case, Judge Xinis ultimately ordered the White House to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from El Salvador in a ruling that was later upheld by both a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court.

But even afterward, Trump officials kept up their drumbeat of attacks against Mr. Abrego Garcia, his lawyers said, calling him “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “human trafficker.”

While the government waged this public smear campaign, the lawyers said, it also used its prosecutorial powers “to support its arguments against him in the court of public opinion.” In June, prosecutors in Tennessee unsealed an indictment charging Mr. Abrego Garcia with having taken part in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States.

At the heart of the case was a 2022 traffic stop during which Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over and discovered to be driving several Hispanic men, some of whom were in the country illegally. Even though the F.B.I. learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it and Mr. Abrego Garcia was released without charges.

His lawyers now contend that the federal authorities re-examined that stop and further investigated it only because Mr. Abrego Garcia embarrassed the administration by suing about his wrongful deportation.

“The facts about Mr. Abrego’s alleged criminal conduct did not change in the intervening three years,” the lawyers wrote. “What did change was that the government unlawfully renditioned Mr. Abrego to El Salvador, and he challenged that illegal conduct.”

The lawyers also pointed to several extraordinary statements made by Mr. Trump and his top aides after the charges were announced.

On the day the indictment was unsealed, they wrote, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went on television and asserted that the government had begun to investigate Mr. Abrego Garcia only after Judge Xinis had questioned the administration’s decision to deport him and accused officials of “doing something wrong.”

Soon after, Mr. Trump himself lauded the Justice Department for having charged Mr. Abrego Garcia, saying he could see the decision as a way to “show everybody how horrible this guy is.”

“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the D.O.J. and even the president of the United States,” the lawyers wrote, “make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/19/us/politics/dc-abrego/dc-abrego-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:56:48.659557

In two instances, the Trump administration preempted the judges’ votes, appointing the interim U.S. attorneys as acting U.S. attorneys before the judges could have their say. And in at least one district, the administration’s attempt to sidestep the Senate and district judges is being challenged in court.

Though the law doesn’t explicitly forbid the Trump administration’s approach of appointing people to successive temporary stints, “the intent [of the law] was always for Senate confirmation,” said Jennifer Selin, a professor at Arizona State University law school.

“The Trump administration has been very strategic in using the law in this particular way,” Selin said.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The nation’s 93 U.S. attorneys are the top federal law enforcement officials in their geographic districts. While they are nominated by the president, the Justice Department has historically sought to insulate them from political influence. And the president’s selections are expected to have the blessing of another branch of government — either the Senate or the courts.

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law school professor, said the workarounds are alarming because they eliminate the vetting process conducted by the Senate, calling it “a perversion of what the Constitution seems to require.”

Critics worry that the lack of oversight on some of Trump’s picks could create a perception — if not a reality — that those prosecutors are simply doing the White House’s bidding and using their offices for political purposes. For instance, Trump’s pick in New Jersey, Alina Habba, has been criticized for prosecuting a Democratic member of Congress who was attempting to conduct an oversight visit at an immigration detention center.

Trump’s strategy of overriding the other branches could also create tension between U.S. attorney’s offices and the district courts in which they operate.

“Senatorial influence over selection has really been a critical aspect of the U.S. attorney’s system, and so has the relationship between the U.S. attorney and local institutions like the district court bench, local governments and local communities,” said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. “And when you start ramming people down into these offices without any consideration of local communities, and in particular of the district court bench, bad things happen.”

Richman pointed to a recent ruling in Manhattan denying the DOJ’s effort to unseal secret materials in the cases of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein as an example of “judges looking askance at an effort by Washington to circumvent the district.”

“District judges really care about the integrity, and, to some extent, the autonomy of the U.S. attorney’s offices that appear before them,” he said. “They, like any actor, like to help shape the quality of justice that’s done in their courtroom, and they do that not just through their rulings, but through the influence they have on the U.S. attorney’s offices. And U.S. attorney’s offices that have any desire to be effective tend to their relationship with the local bench.”

Maintaining a loyalist in New Jersey

The most dramatic fight over a U.S. attorney post in the second Trump administration has been in New Jersey, where earlier this year Trump picked Habba, one of his former personal defense attorneys and a vocal supporter, to serve as U.S. attorney on an interim basis while also nominating her to take the job permanently.

Habba, who had never worked as a prosecutor, is a controversial figure who opened a number of politically charged cases in her first few months on the job. Her office charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) with assaulting federal agents after she clashed with immigration officials while attempting to visit an immigration detention center; she is seeking to get the case dismissed. Habba’s office also arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, but later dropped the case. And shortly after Habba took office, she opened an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, over the state’s immigration policies.

It quickly became clear that Habba could not win Senate confirmation. So when her term as interim U.S. attorney was about to expire last month, district judges in New Jersey voted to determine who should occupy the post indefinitely until the Senate could confirm someone to the job.

The judges declined to keep Habba in office, voting instead to install longtime career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace.

But Trump quickly bypassed that selection, reinstalling Habba on a longer-term but still temporary basis as acting U.S. attorney. He did so by having the Justice Department fire Grace while simultaneously withdrawing Habba’s nomination in the Senate. The withdrawal was important because nominees for a full-time U.S. attorney post generally cannot also serve in an “acting” capacity, per federal law. But once Habba was no longer a nominee before the Senate, the Trump administration argued, she could remain in the job for another 210 days, or about seven months. What will happen after that remains unclear.

Trump’s workaround to keep Habba in the job for now is contested. A defendant in a drug and gun case in New Jersey is arguing that the administration’s maneuvering was irregular and unconstitutional and is challenging Habba’s authority.

Habba’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Workarounds in New York and New Mexico

Slightly different scenarios have played out in other U.S. attorney’s offices.

In the Northern District of New York, which covers Albany and Buffalo, Trump’s interim choice for the job was John Sarcone III, a Republican lawyer who has run for office unsuccessfully several times and, like Habba, had no apparent prosecutorial experience. Sarcone had a tumultuous start to his tenure that included listing his address on a police affidavit as a location that was actually a boarded-up building.

When Sarcone’s 120-day interim period expired, the district judges in northern New York declined to appoint him to continue in the job. But unlike in New Jersey, the judges did not select a substitute — they simply didn’t appoint anyone. The Justice Department responded by giving Sarcone an appointment of “special attorney” with an “indefinite” term so that he could return to the job. The office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

A similar sequence occurred in New Mexico last week. The district judges in the state declined to extend Trump’s pick for interim U.S. attorney, Ryan Ellison. So the Justice Department converted him to the “acting” head of the office under a federal vacancies law. As with Habba, that maneuver allows Trump to chain together the 120-day interim period and the 210-day acting period — potentially allowing the non-confirmed official to remain on the job for nearly a full year.

New Mexico’s Democratic senators, Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, said the decision exemplified “this administration’s continuing willingness to trample the role of the Judiciary and Congress.”

Ellison embraced the move, saying in a statement: “I applaud New Mexico’s federal district judges for declining to appoint someone other than the Trump Administration’s choice to lead the United States Attorney’s Office as they had the discretion to do at the end of my interim appointment.” He added that “the appointment of a U.S. Attorney is a process that should be sorted out in a collaborative and professional manner between the executive and legislative branches of government.”

In one powerful district — the Southern District of New York, which is based in Manhattan — Trump’s interim U.S. attorney pick did not run into resistance from judges. On Monday, the judges there voted to retain Trump’s choice, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton. The vote allows Clayton to continue running the office indefinitely, even though Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) blocked Clayton’s confirmation in the Senate.

Getting around judges in California and Nevada

In the Central District of California, which is based in Los Angeles, Trump’s interim choice was Bill Essayli, a Republican who had been serving in the California State Assembly. In his early months on the job, Essayli drew scrutiny for reportedly pushing prosecutors to bring cases desired by the Trump administration but unsupported by sufficient evidence.

As his interim period was coming to an end, the Trump administration converted Essayli’s title from interim to acting. It’s not clear if the district’s judges ever held a vote on the post. The court didn’t provide an answer when asked about it.

A spokesperson for Essayli’s office declined to comment.

And the administration deployed the same tactic in Nevada to keep in place Sigal Chattah. In the final days of her temporary tenure as interim U.S. attorney, a group of more than 100 retired federal and state judges wrote to the chief federal district judge in Nevada to object to voting to install Chattah after her appointment expired. The group said her history of “racially charged, violence-tinged, and inflammatory public statements” disqualified her.

Instead of waiting for the judicial vote, the Trump administration simply made her the acting U.S. attorney. The office didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Future risks

While Trump may be getting his way on U.S. attorney choices for now, the strategy may ultimately come back to haunt him.

Retired U.S. District Judge John S. Martin predicted that the practical effect of the maneuvers is that a U.S. attorney who is installed over the objections of the local bench will lose credibility with the judges, not necessarily because of any actions they take, but simply by virtue of the process.

That may jeopardize cases in court for prosecutors, Martin said, because it “means that when the government comes in and asserts something a little bit unusual, it’s going to get a very skeptical view from the court.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F52%2F7b%2Fcf61dea34634b34c964cc142437c%2Ftrump-68694.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 18:57:35.191160

A WAITING GAME: The image of President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flanked by a collection of world leaders touting a “team Europe” coming together with “team America,” was a rush of relief for Ukraine — which seemingly emerged from the White House meetings with the alliance it hoped for and a plan to approach Russian President Vladimir Putin, NYT’s Kim Barker writes from Kyiv. But it’s still too early for Ukraine to stop holding its breath: Russia has shown no signs of slowing its attacks with hundreds of drones hitting Ukraine overnight, and it remains to be seen if Europe’s shining optimism will last.

Despite Trump not trumpeting his “cards” quite like last time, Ukraine is surrounded by uncertainty, POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi writes in her latest Compass column. “As the visitors made their practiced pitches while sitting around a table with the U.S. president, the whole thing felt absurd,” Nahal writes. Ukraine can’t trust Putin. But it’s also unclear how much they can trust Trump: “for Kyiv, the diplomatic field is arguably more unpredictable than the battlefield.”

The biggest piece of the puzzle is the security guarantees for Ukraine, which remain fuzzy in detail a day later. The Trump administration said Putin understands Western troops will be involved in protecting Ukraine. Yesterday, Trump personally told Zelenskyy and European leaders that Ukraine will have “Article 5-like” NATO protections, but he omitted any specifics. And this morning, Trump took the idea of U.S. troops in Ukraine firmly off the table in an interview with Fox News.

“You have my assurance, and I’m president,” Trump said on not putting American boots on the ground, a promise that likely has more to do with his MAGA base than it does with Eastern Europe, as Playbook’s Adam Wren and Dasha Burns broke down this morning. But POLITICO’s Irie Sentner writes that there’s not a firm red line on military involvement — it could instead look like air or drone support. A senior admin official even said the U.S. “could participate in a peacekeeping force if it is the last piece required for a deal.”

Though Trump touted a “warmth” in his relationship with Putin that he said Europe does not share, he still conceded on “Fox & Friends” that Putin may not make a deal, and we’re still weeks away from that answer. “I wouldn’t say [Putin and Zelenskyy] are ever going to be best friends, but they’re doing OK, and we’re just going to see,” Trump said. “You know, they’re the ones that have to call the shots.”

THE HARD WORK BEGINS: The European Council met today to debrief yesterday’s summit. U.S. and European officials are already working to build up Ukraine’s military, an inevitable part of the security guarantees Zelenskyy has been asking for, Bloomberg’s Alberto Nardelli and colleagues report. The goal is boosting their troop numbers without any restrictions, by avoiding any demands on Russia’s part of capping the Ukrainian military’s size.

The room where it happens: The logistics of what these security guarantees will look like, especially on the U.S. side, are the central focus of a new commission headed up by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Axios’ Barak Ravid reports. The timeline: One Ukrainian official said “everyone is going to be working from sunrise till dark on the security guarantees. Maybe by the end of the week we will have some clear architecture.”

This must be the place: The White House is looking at Budapest as the location for a potential trilateral between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy, Dasha scoops. The country, led by PM Viktor Orbán, is emerging as the first choice, and the U.S. Secret Service is scouting locations. That said, Switzerland announced it would grant “immunity” to Putin on his arrest charges should he visit the country for peace talks with Ukraine, POLITICO’s Seb Starcevic writes. Multiple world leaders have floated Geneva as a potential spot, and Switzerland appears open to it.

The view from Moscow: But it’s still unclear if Putin will go forward, especially as Moscow continues to pour cold water on a face-to-face bilateral. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said a summit would have to happen “step by step, gradually, starting from the expert level and then going through all the necessary stages.” As POLITICO’s Elena Giordano puts it, “Russia’s calibrated language follows a familiar pattern: agree in principle, stall in practice.”

Welcome to the hard part, as WSJ’s Alex Ward and colleagues break down. Trump’s said multiple times now this has been the most difficult diplomatic task yet. But if — and it’s not a small if — a bilateral between Putin and Zelenskyy does happen, “it would only signal that the toughest phase of negotiations had just begun — and with no guarantee of success.”

Meanwhile, there’s no doubt of the stakes — for Trump at least, and it’s not just political. It’s well known he’s jockeying for the Nobel Peace Prize, but on Fox News this morning he signaled he’s looking for a higher reward. “I want to try and get to heaven if possible. I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I didn’t really hit the bottom of the totem pole. ... But if I can get to heaven, this will be one of the reasons.”

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. TRAIL MIX: Graham Platner, an oyster farmer from Maine, is mounting a Democratic bid to unseat Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — an effort that could thwart Democrats’ plans to rally around Gov. Janet Mills, POLITICO’s Holly Otterbein reports. Platner also indicated that he would not back Chuck Schumer as leader if Democrats manage to wrest control of the Senate back from Republicans. It’s the latest race that could become a generational litmus test for the party, which has younger progressives calling for fresh faces and older moderates betting on battle-tested candidates.

The DNC prepares: The DNC is overhauling its technology to organize volunteers and voters for the first time in 20 years, NBC’s Mirna Alsharif and Jason Abbruzzese write. “The new technology includes a management system to help track interactions among the DNC, voters and volunteers; software that encourages ‘high-quality interactions with voters’; and a platform to empower Democrats to participate in online and offline events.” They’ll get a test run this year in New Jersey and Virginia’s elections.

Speaking of Virginia: VoteVets is launching a half-million-dollar ad campaign to boost Democratic nominee Abigail Spanberger in the Virginia governor’s race, which will offer one of the first major political bellwethers of the second Trump administration, CNN’s David Wright reports. Meanwhile, GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears has experienced a summer of tension with John Reid, the number two on Republicans’ ticket, National Review’s Audrey Fahlberg writes.

2. IMMIGRATION FILES: A federal judge in Miami partially dismissed a lawsuit on the legal rights of the immigrants detained at “Alligator Alcatraz,” transferring the remaining First Amendment challenge to another jurisdiction, per AP’s David Fischer and colleagues. … A new memo shows USCIS will home in on “good morale character” as a judgement for immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, which experts fear will make the application process more subjective, WaPo’s Grace Moon reports. … HUD is preparing changes to public housing rules to evict families with an undocumented family member and restrict rental vouchers, per Bloomberg’s Patrick Sisson. “The rule could affect more than 100,000 people, half of them children.”

3. CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: Half of non-immigration related arrests in Trump’s D.C. crackdown have been located in two high-crime areas, according to a new White House analysis reported by Axios’ Cuneyt Dil and Marc Caputo. Roughly 101 arrests have been made in Wards 7 and 8, which have long carried the city’s highest crime rates. Meanwhile, National Guard troops have been stationed in high-traffic areas to deter crime, per the White House.

The latest numbers: AG Pam Bondi said there were 52 arrests overnight, including nine firearms seized — for a total of 465 arrests and 68 guns seized since the crackdown started. Dose of reality: The 51st’s Martin Austermuhle notes on X that the number of guns swept up was largely par for the course for the Metropolitan Police Department before the crackdown. “From 6/16-6/22, MPD alone got 50. From 7/21-7/27, it was 60. From 6/30-7/6, it was 70 guns.”

The data divide: The Trump administration has broadly blasted statistics showing that crime in D.C., while still a problem, is on a downward trend. But the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. is now opening an investigation into whether local officials falsified crime data, NYT’s Devlin Barrett reports. “How tabulating crime data from the local police could amount to a federal crime is not immediately clear, the two people said, though the effort aims to determine if there were false statements or fraud involved in producing the data.”

4. ON RECESS: Senators are prepared to make a rules change come September to speed up the confirmation process for some of Trump’s nominees, but POLITICO’s Hailey Fuchs reports they’re not going to give up the so-called blue slips, which allow members to effectively veto nominees that would serve their areas. It’s a rare break from Trump, with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) telling Hailey: “[My] appeal to the president is: please reconsider. Why do we want to have this fight for nothing?”

Personality politics: Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) has the votes to be the next Senate Democratic whip, but Hill Democrats say he’s basically already been doing the job since Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) announced his retirement, Punchbowl’s Andrew Desiderio reports. Schatz has the ability to build relationships with both the more progressive and moderate factions of the party, and is a favorite to eventually replace Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

September preview: “Trump budget officials claim sweeping spending power from Congress, records show,” by WaPo’s Riley Beggin and Jacob Bogage: “The Trump administration is asserting authority to withhold billions of dollars from low-income housing services, education assistance, medical research grants and other programs approved by Congress … The new practices are likely to reignite a clash over the administration’s power to freeze dollars approved by Congress, usurping authority that the legislative branch has under the Constitution.”

5. THE ECONOMY, STUPID: Warning signs have emerged on inflation and the labor market, but the economy isn’t necessarily headed for disaster, NYT’s Lydia DePillis writes. “Economists have been waiting for that multifaceted storm system to start showing up in the economic data. The signs are now unmistakable, but the severity of the impact remains unclear.” But we’re two days away from the Fed symposium at Jackson Hole in Wyoming, which kicks off Thursday, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday will provide more insight on what’s to come on interest rates.

Taking business elsewhere: China is looking to deepen its trade relations with India after their foreign ministers met in India this week, which WSJ’s Shan Li and Chun Han Wong report is a “a sign that [Trump’s] trade war could accelerate a thaw in the frosty relationship between Beijing and New Delhi.” Apple is also expanding its iPhone production at five factories in India, part of its larger effort to decrease reliance on China, Bloomberg’s Sankalp Phartiyal and Mark Gurman write. … And Lesotho, which was dealt the highest tariff rate back in April and is now under a 15 percent levy, is looking to Asia for its textile exports, per Bloomberg’s Ray Ndlovu.

6. CUTTING DEEP: The cuts to Medicaid in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will disproportionately hit Black children and women, who already carry some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, POLITICO’s Cheyenne Daniels writes. “Although Black people represent about 14 percent of the U.S. population, they account for more than 20 percent of Medicaid enrollees, according to Pew Research Center — and almost 60 percent of all Black children are enrolled in Medicaid, according to a recent analysis from the NAACP and other advocacy organizations.”

Protecting public media: Philanthropists are putting together an emergency $26.5 million cash injection to fund the local NPR and PBS stations most at risk of shutting down after Congress greenlit sweeping cuts to public media. NYT’s Ben Mullin reports that the Knight Foundation and others are focused on stations that got 30 percent of their funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is set to shut down next year.

7. VAX ON: “Defying RFK Jr., pediatric group urges covid shots for young kids,” by WaPo’s Lena Sun: “The American Academy of Pediatrics on Tuesday urged parents to get their youngest children vaccinated for covid, part of a broader effort by medical organizations to bypass Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his criticism of broadly administering coronavirus vaccines. … The AAP is recommending that all children ages 6 months through 23 months receive a coronavirus vaccine to help protect against serious illness.”

Ruiz, a Donald Trump appointee, also agreed with federal and state officials’ contention that the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction and moved the federal case from the Southern District of Florida to the Middle District of Florida.

After weeks of federal immigration judges not willing to take cases from the detention center due to questions of jurisdiction, state officials designated the Krone Immigration Processing Center in Miami as the prevailing facility to hear immigrants contesting their detention.

That prompted the judge to dismiss the accusations of undue process in the decision issued late Monday night.

""Several developments have occurred since plaintiffs filed this case, requiring the court to consider whether some or all of Plaintiffs’ claims may be moot,"" Ruiz wrote. ""First, many of the detained plaintiffs have been transferred out of Alligator Alcatraz. Second, many of the detained plaintiffs (including those who have since been transferred out of Alligator Alcatraz) have received access to counsel, and all the attorney plaintiffs have received access to Alligator Alcatraz detainees.""

The American Civil Liberties Union and immigration advocacy groups brought the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DeSantis and other state officials in July, contending that those detained at the facility have not been able to contact their attorneys by phone or email.

Ruiz said that there was nothing more he could do about the plaintiff's Fifth Amendment due process claims.

The plaintiffs had also claimed the few detainees who can use collect call pay phones only have a maximum of five minutes to speak on the recorded lines, violating attorney-client confidentiality. In addition, they say attorneys who travel to the detention center to meet with clients encountered hours-long wait times at an armed checkpoint, only to be turned away.

In an earlier court filing, and remarks to the judge at a Monday hearing, attorneys for the state acknowledged “initial delays” but said they were resolved.

“More meetings are taking place every day and there have been no complaints,"" state counsel wrote. ""In fact, since the meetings began on July 15, the state defendants have granted every single request for a detainee to meet with legal counsel.”

However, Ruiz determined that the First Amendment claim of lack of confidential attorney-client communications can still continue, though he noted the fluid nature of the case.

“Alligator Alcatraz is a temporary detention facility, a waystation to federal immigration detention centers or to deportation,” Ruiz said. “Moreover, there is ample evidence in the record that certain plaintiffs’ claims have expired during the pendency of this litigation.”

But those claims will move to another judge, in the Middle District of Florida, he said.

“Plaintiffs have consistently maintained that the alleged barriers to counsel and inability to engage in confidential communications have taken place at Alligator Alcatraz, which is not in this district,” Ruiz wrote of the Southern District.

Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, who is named in the suit, has maintained that the detention facility lies in Collier County, which falls under the Middle District.

“Within the site, only a tiny sliver of unpaved runway is situated in Miami-Dade County,” he said in a recent court filing. “No portion of the detention facility lies on that sliver of extended runway.”

In a statement, ACLU attorney Eunice Cho said “It should not take a lawsuit to force the government to abide by the law and the Constitution. We look forward to continuing the fight.”

Two months ago, in response to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier proposed the idea of a detention center in the Everglades and used emergency powers to acquire the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, a small runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve and Everglades National Park.

Within days, trucks carrying prefabricated housing, generators, security lighting and fill dirt entered the area and workers hastily set up tents and trailers to house those arrested by immigration authorities and state law enforcement.

Trump visited the facility on July 1 — the day before the first detainees arrived — and told reporters, “We’re going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.”

Since then, environmental activists, indigenous tribes, Democratic state lawmakers and members of Congress have decried the detention center as inhumane and detrimental to the ecosystem, pointing to reports of flooding, pest infestations, sewage backups and light pollution.

The detention center faces another lawsuit accusing the government of violating federal environmental law. Another Miami federal judge granted a request to halt construction on the grounds last week. But U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams has yet to rule on a venue change for that lawsuit.

Should we be concerned about this, and are there other problems we should be aware of?

Jonathan Metzer, a barrister who specialises in human rights law, from Jewish Human Rights organisation René Cassin, spoke to Gilly Hope on BBC Radio Newcastle last Sunday to discuss this very topic. His words may come as a revelation to many:

Just 2-4% of total immigration per year is via small boats.

The UK press and some politicians claim many immigrants are criminals and sexual offenders who pose a danger to women. In reality, most sex offences are committed by a friend or family member of the victim. Immigrants hardly fall into this category.

The asylum system is not working due to the current backlog which arose when the Conservative government chose to pause dealing with claims when the Rwanda scheme was started.

Hotel accommodation provided is not luxury; it’s very basic and only used because no social housing is available.

The government decided to stop asylum seekers from working for six months. Most of them would like to work and contribute tax to our country.

So many of these people are genuine refugees who for example have spoken out against the regime in Iran. Jonathan is a descendant of Jewish refugees who came to Britain fleeing the Holocaust and knows only too well what the human stories are behind the narratives.

Two hundred groups have signed a letter to the government to apply fairer policies. They called for both practical solutions, which would allow refugees to work more quickly and contribute to UK tax, and a focus on human stories rather than divisive narratives.

An official refugee ‘safe route’ would help Britain to control its borders more efficiently. It would put the people traffickers and illegal operators out of business, for starters. Refugees should be allowed to work sooner. This would minimise costs.

Governments have messed up, the Conservatives in particular. Fuelling hatred without mentioning the facts is wrong.

Women and violence

Let’s put this into perspective. Violence towards women is frequently fuelled by uncontrolled social media, which masquerades as ‘freedom of speech’ in the minds of some politicians such as Tice and Farage.

The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women has called out the resurgence of right-wing politics and patriarchal attitudes which undermines women’s rights, as a real threat to women. Technology is to blame for much of this. However, the basic root cause of violence against women and girls is negative patriarchal values.

Women’s Rights organisations are under attack globally; many are forced to shut down while others are expected to do more with fewer financial resources. This is a major challenge as the scale and complexity of gender-based violence continue to grow. Such organisations are invaluable in bringing evidence-based insights into the design of policies. Funding that matches the scale of the crisis is vital to eradicate violence against women.

Prevention requires sustained, long-term investment

Civil society and women’s organisations have been instrumental in ensuring that any national plans deliver. Diversity policies are very important to national wellbeing and success of campaigns to protect women. Withdrawal of diversity budgets would therefore be more cause for alarm regarding women’s safety than the very small number of refugees who commit offences. Let’s put that into perspective:

Every ten minutes a woman or girl is killed ‘by someone close to her.’

A third of women killed by intimate partners had previously reported some form of violence.

Within the European Convention for Human Rights (ECHR), women enjoy a number of protections, which we have outlined in a previous article.

Patriarchal narratives, which discount the value of diversity projects to decrease negative attitudes to women, simply do not help to keep women safe. Tearing up Britain’s membership of the ECHR, under the guise that this prevents Britain from deporting asylum seekers, would put women’s rights several steps back. If the problem of violence against women is home grown, upholding human rights principles for women in this Country becomes even more important.

Divisive narratives

Politicians who make unsubstantiated claims are not only fuelling violence and hatred. They simply have not done their homework on consulting official statistics, and are therefore not doing the job they were appointed to do in the service of the people. The divisive narratives are also wasting police time when these provoke riots, time which would be better spent on protecting those are truly at risk, such as women in their own homes who make urgent calls. Some of these domestic violence cases were not prioritised and this has led to women being murdered.

Northumbria Police revealed in recent weeks that hiring specialists in domestic violence in their emergency call centres has enabled the force to spot urgent cases more effectively. Diversity tools turn into very important practical crime fighting strategies.

While railing against the boats and expressing concerns against violence committed against women, Reform MPs have voted against legislation to prevent upskirting, stalking, harassment, and the spiking of drinks. They also put an end to spending in councils on so called unnecessary diversity projects.

Underlying principles of human rights

In the new era characterised by Brexit, Trump, the rise of nationalism, and weakening of international norms and institutions, the underlying principles of human rights, and even of the rule of law, are coming under sustained attack.

Principles that have been hard fought for and had appeared firmly entrenched are now being questioned and attacked.

LULAC, in a Tuesday press release, said its national president, Roman Palomares, asked Home Depot CEO Ted Decker “to establish a nationwide corporate policy denying Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal enforcement agencies access to Home Depot properties unless presented with a valid court-issued warrant and proper advance notice.”

“Day laborers and families must not be subjected to the fear of being hunted down in parking lots while pursuing honest work,” Palomares said in the release.

He also noted that the Fortune 500 company benefits from labor from the communities that have been targeted by an uptick in deportation orders.

“With its size, reach, and influence, the company cannot claim neutrality — it has both the authority and the obligation to act decisively,” Palomares continued. “To allow ICE to operate unchecked on its properties is not passive; it is complicity.”

Earlier this month, the Los Angeles Times reported that an immigration raid in Los Angeles involved a Penske truck driver at a Home Depot saying he was seeking workers, according to a day laborer.

Multiple Border Patrol agents leaped from the back of the truck while workers surrounded it and more than a dozen were arrested, according to the L.A. Times.

“This week, Border Patrol conducted a targeted raid, dubbed Trojan Horse, in Los Angeles at a Home Depot that resulted in the arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua,” a DHS spokesperson told The Hill in an emailed statement earlier this month. “Federal law enforcement will continue utilizing all resources to arrest criminal illegal aliens and keep Americans safe.”

The Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.

Home Depot spokesperson Sarah McDonald said in a statement the company is not notified ahead of time when ICE activities “are going to happen.” In many cases, she added, “we don’t know that arrests have taken place until after they’re over.”

Video of the incident, captured by the driver’s son who is a U.S. citizen, shows federal agents ordering the occupants of a vehicle to lower their windows. When the driver refused and demanded identification from the officers, one agent shattered the driver-side window and at least three shots were fired as the vehicle drove off, according to footage obtained by KTLA.

Hours later, police went to the driver’s home on Mountain View Drive, where federal agents and immigrant rights advocates had gathered. Tensions escalated as protestors demanded ICE leave the neighborhood. “It doesn’t seem they’re protecting us,” said one community advocate. “It seems they’re protecting these bounty hunters and kidnappers.”

By Monday, protestors returned to the police station, insisting local authorities be held accountable.

Officials said officers were present solely to manage the crowd and were not participating in immigration enforcement.

Witnesses described the incident as chaotic and frightening. “Some of us counted about six gunshots,” said one neighbor. Employees in the area reported fleeing in panic as law enforcement activity intensified.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement, “During a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, CBP officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down. In the course of the incident, the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle. This forced a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense.”

Police confirmed the individual was briefly detained at his home but was later released.

Law enforcement used excessive force and deliberate brutality against Los Angeles protesters and journalists during demonstrations against Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in June, a Human Rights Watch report said on Monday.

Scores of people were injured as officers fired hard foam rounds, flash-bang grenades, pepper balls and tear gas from close range, during the largely peaceful response to a dramatic increase in immigration arrests across Southern California.

“Law enforcement officers... used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,” said Ida Sawyer, the rights group’s crisis, conflict and arms director.

The protests erupted on 6 June, in anger at raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been ordered by the Trump administration to target undocumented migrants across the sprawling, heavily Latino city.

The demonstrations were mainly confined to a small section of downtown Los Angeles.

Largely non-violent, they at times spiralled into chaotic scenes that Trump pounced on to send 4 000 National Guard and 700 Marines into the city - a move loudly protested by local officials.

Compiling the report, Human Rights Watch staff observed protests, visited locations of immigration raids in mid-June, and interviewed dozens of people.

The report documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers injured protesters and journalists but warned that the “actual number is most likely much higher”.

On one occasion, a police officer shot three people at “very close range with kinetic impact projectiles, leaving them in serious pain for days.

“Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: ‘I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,‘” the report found.

Other reported injuries included broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

In a statement, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said it “does not deploy less-lethal tools indiscriminately”.

“Such tools are used only when all de-escalation efforts have been exhausted,” it added.

The law enforcement agency said any time a deputy uses force, they are required to report it to a supervisor and undergo “a thorough, fair, and objective review”, including analysing evidence and video footage to determine “that the actions taken were objectively reasonable and fully aligned” with policy.

In wresting control of the police force, Mr. Trump and his allies have challenged the accuracy of the District of Columbia’s crime statistics.","In a reminder of the government’s many missteps in the case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers pointed out that Trump officials first removed him from the United States in violation of a court order. They added that instead of taking the traditional path and quickly returning him, the White House “began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation” that led to his indictment.

“Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been singled out by the United States government,” the lawyers wrote. “It is obvious why. And it is not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct. Nor is it because he poses some unique threat to this country. Instead, Mr. Abrego was charged because he refused to acquiesce in the government’s violation of his due process rights.”

The sharp-edged filing was the second time that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have sought to hold the Trump administration’s feet to the fire for how it has handled his expulsion to El Salvador and its aftermath. In mid-June, the lawyers asked Judge Paula Xinis, who is overseeing a civil case in Maryland arising from his deportation, to sanction the administration for its “sustained and flagrant” violations of her orders.

The filing in Tennessee came as Mr. Abrego Garcia’s intertwined civil and criminal cases neared a significant inflection point. He is likely to be freed from criminal custody on Friday after a federal judge in Nashville put his original release order on hold for a month. And that will force the government to decide whether it intends to push forward with his prosecution or turn him over to immigration officials to begin the process of deporting him again.

In a separate filing on Tuesday, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court in Tennessee to allow him to return to Maryland as a free man on Friday as the administration decides what to do next. He is already protected against immediate re-expulsion under a ruling issued last month by Judge Xinis, who ordered the administration to provide him with a warning of at least three business days if officials planned to seek his removal to a country other than El Salvador.

Motions for selective and vindictive prosecution are notoriously hard to win because they require proving that the government singled out a defendant for charges in comparison with similarly situated cases and used the charges to punish them merely for trying to vindicate their rights. While Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers acknowledged as much in their own motion, they also noted, “If there has ever been a case for dismissal on those grounds, this is that case.”

They alleged that “a wide-ranging and unprecedented retribution campaign” against their client began almost from the moment that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s family sued the Trump administration, seeking his return from El Salvador. Even after the White House realized that he had been mistakenly deported to a notorious terrorism prison in that country, officials “quickly latched onto unsubstantiated claims” that he was a member of the street gang MS-13 “to justify its mistake,” the lawyers wrote.

Those claims were subsequently echoed by top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who falsely declared in early April that Mr. Abrego Garcia “was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here.” Other aides to Mr. Trump soon joined in what the lawyers described as an “effort to discredit Mr. Abrego,” claiming publicly that he was “violent, a gang member and a terrorist.”

Presiding over the civil case, Judge Xinis ultimately ordered the White House to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from El Salvador in a ruling that was later upheld by both a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court.

But even afterward, Trump officials kept up their drumbeat of attacks against Mr. Abrego Garcia, his lawyers said, calling him “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater” and “human trafficker.”

While the government waged this public smear campaign, the lawyers said, it also used its prosecutorial powers “to support its arguments against him in the court of public opinion.” In June, prosecutors in Tennessee unsealed an indictment charging Mr. Abrego Garcia with having taken part in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States.

At the heart of the case was a 2022 traffic stop during which Mr. Abrego Garcia was pulled over and discovered to be driving several Hispanic men, some of whom were in the country illegally. Even though the F.B.I. learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it and Mr. Abrego Garcia was released without charges.

His lawyers now contend that the federal authorities re-examined that stop and further investigated it only because Mr. Abrego Garcia embarrassed the administration by suing about his wrongful deportation.

“The facts about Mr. Abrego’s alleged criminal conduct did not change in the intervening three years,” the lawyers wrote. “What did change was that the government unlawfully renditioned Mr. Abrego to El Salvador, and he challenged that illegal conduct.”

The lawyers also pointed to several extraordinary statements made by Mr. Trump and his top aides after the charges were announced.

On the day the indictment was unsealed, they wrote, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went on television and asserted that the government had begun to investigate Mr. Abrego Garcia only after Judge Xinis had questioned the administration’s decision to deport him and accused officials of “doing something wrong.”

Soon after, Mr. Trump himself lauded the Justice Department for having charged Mr. Abrego Garcia, saying he could see the decision as a way to “show everybody how horrible this guy is.”

“The unprecedented public pronouncements attacking Mr. Abrego for his successful exercise of constitutional rights by senior cabinet members, leaders of the D.O.J. and even the president of the United States,” the lawyers wrote, “make this the rare case where actual vindictiveness is clear from the record.”

At least three current senior officials at various intelligence agencies, all with reputations for nonpartisan work, are among those who lost their clearances and their jobs.

They included Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official who warned Congress about Russian meddling in the 2020 election; a senior C.I.A. analyst currently serving undercover; and Vinh X. Nguyen, a senior National Security Agency data scientist.

Rescinding security clearances appears to be part of a campaign by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to reveal what she sees as flaws in intelligence assessments about Russian malign influence operations during the 2016 election. Ms. Gabbard’s attention to that issue has won praise from Mr. Trump, who has long claimed without evidence that the Obama administration tried to undermine him in that vote.

Critics also say that Mr. Trump has turned the focus onto the 2016 election to distract from questions about the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

“Gabbard’s move to yank clearances from a seemingly random list of national security officials is a reckless abuse of the security clearance process and nothing more than another sad attempt to distract from the administration’s failure to release the Epstein files,” said Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Mr. Warner said he had introduced legislation to create standards for security clearances and prevent political abuse of the system.

Current and former officials said they were particularly distraught by the removal of Mr. Nguyen, a gifted mathematician, from the N.S.A.

Mr. Nguyen was mentioned in an article in Real Clear Investigations that noted his work for the director of national intelligence at the time of the 2016 election assessments. The article was highlighted on social media by Sebastian Gorka, a Trump administration national security official.

Mr. Nguyen is an expert on quantum computing, data science and cyber issues. He has been working on artificial intelligence projects for the agency. Former officials said the loss of his expertise could set back the U.S. government’s development of key technologies.

Ms. Gabbard is not the only administration official releasing documents or investigating the 2016 intelligence assessments. After she released a report and accused the Obama administration of a “treasonous conspiracy,” Pam Bondi, the attorney general, announced a task force to look into potential wrongdoing. John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, declassified a tradecraft review related to the 2016 inquiries, and made a referral to the F.B.I. seeking an investigation of John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. head.

Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Gabbard released a memo on social media about her actions, which she said were taken at the direction of Mr. Trump.

“Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,” Ms. Gabbard wrote. “Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.”

Ms. Gabbard’s office claimed that the people who would lose their security clearances were involved in the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence” to advance partisan agendas, or had failed to adhere to tradecraft practices or to safeguard classified information.

The memo provided no evidence the individuals had mishandled material or used it for partisan purposes.

While stripping the security clearances of current officials effectively removes them from their jobs, it is not clear how many of the 37 individuals were currently employed by intelligence agencies or held government contracts. It is also not clear how many of the former officials maintained a current clearance.

Most former officials who are not working for government contractors do not need clearances, though some do informal or formal consulting for intelligence officials. Holding a clearance makes such advising easier.

Many of the officials have only tangential ties or no ties to the original analysis of Russian malign influence operations. Some have been mentioned in reporting about the 2016 election assessments or have commented on the intelligence work publicly.

Edward Gistaro and Beth Sanner, both of whom briefed Mr. Trump during his first term, were also on the list. Both were mentioned in a recent book on the C.I.A. written by Tim Weiner.

Many of the individuals have commented publicly on national security matters. Some, though not all, had been critical of the Trump administration.

After serving as election threat official, Ms. Pierson returned to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to take a senior position. She has been leading the agency’s analysis team, according to former officials.

During the first Trump administration, Richard Grenell, who was the acting director of national intelligence agency, opted to keep Ms. Pierson in her post.

Members of the Biden administration’s national security staff will also lose their clearance, including Maher Bitar, who was a senior director for intelligence, and Emily Horne, a former spokeswoman. The order stripping Mr. Bitar of his clearance presents a potential separation-of-powers issue. He is now a senior national security aide to Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California.

Mark Zaid, a lawyer who frequently represents intelligence officials and whose own security clearance was stripped by the Trump administration, said to strip the security clearances in the name of ending the politicization was hypocritical.

“These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,” Mr. Zaid said. Referring to the intelligence community, he continued, “It has become clear that the current I.C. leadership itself constitutes a grave danger to national security.”

Ms. Gabbard has been removing security clearances of former officials in keeping with an executive order from Mr. Trump and as part of her efforts to counter the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence.”

C.I.A. and N.S.A. officials declined to comment, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency did not return a request for comment.

Irish whiskey, Italian Prosecco, French Cognac and all other alcohol imports from the European Union will still face tariffs for now, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding that the two sides did not carve out those products in their initial deal.

The written draft of the trade agreement is still under negotiation and isn’t final. But this deep into the process, the reality that no exemption has been agreed to does not bode well for the alcohol industry. For many spirits producers in Europe, America has a major — if not the single most important — customer base.

President Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, agreed last month to a trade deal that would apply 15 percent across-the-board tariffs to a range of products coming from the bloc’s member countries into the United States. But from the start, European Union officials have made it clear that they would continue to push for an exemption for alcohol and spirits. While European leaders expected some products to get exemptions and face lower tariffs, alcohol was not initially on that list.

Negotiators have spent weeks haggling over the specifics of the deal, as they have tried to formalize what Mr. Trump and Ms. von der Leyen agreed to orally into text. That document would not be legally binding, but it would be the first step toward making the handshake agreement concrete.

That process is now drawing closer to completion. The American side recently sent its European counterparts a draft outline, and Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission, said at a news conference on Tuesday in Brussels that European trade negotiators had sent an edited version of the text back to Washington.

But alcohol is still not part of the agreed-upon deal, and it increasingly appears that European negotiators are giving up on getting an exemption into this round of negotiations.

While 15 percent tariffs would be nowhere near as crippling as the 200 percent levies Mr. Trump at one point threatened to impose on European alcohol exporters, they are a major departure from nearly three decades of the industry’s typically facing no tariffs. And they would come after weeks in which industry groups said they were optimistic that some sort of carve-out for wine and spirits could be achieved.

Asked to comment, Mr. Gill said that “the European Commission remains determined to secure the maximum number of carve-outs.”

European producers have warned that the consequences of leaving alcohol tariffs at 15 percent could be grave. The Federation of French Wine and Spirits Exporters had previously said a failure to secure an exemption would create an “extremely violent shock.”

The American liquor industry has also warned that the 15 percent tariff could affect businesses and jobs. American spirits producers often worry that the European Union will hit them with retaliatory tariffs — which has happened before.

Plus, many alcohol companies are multinationals with business lines that span national borders.

“The U.S. hospitality industry thrives with fair and reciprocal trade with zero-for-zero tariffs on spirits,” Chris Swonger, the president and chief executive of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said by email when asked about this article. “A 15 percent tariff on E.U. spirits imports will intensify pressure on U.S. restaurants and bars already reeling from rising costs and slowing spirits sales.”

Mary Taylor, the owner of Mary Taylor Wine, wasn’t surprised by the lack of progress toward lower tariffs, but was certainly frustrated. She has been importing wines from Europe for years, and on Tuesday morning she paid $40,000 in tariffs on an order that had arrived, on top of other fees.

She estimated that the new tariff was a third of her potential profits from the shipment. While she understands the desire to make American wines more competitive, she said they were just not the same.

“For the price point, you cannot replace European wine with American wine,” Ms. Taylor said.

The troops have joined an array of federal agents who appeared on city streets after Mr. Trump declared last week that the federal government was assuming law enforcement responsibility in the capital, which he has falsely claimed is essentially lawless.

The first wave of troops sent to the city all came from the D.C. National Guard, which the president can call out directly. National Guard troops from Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia will soon also be deployed, according to the governors of those states. National Guard officials said that there were 869 troops in Washington as of Monday night; the Republican-led states so far have pledged 1,000 more.

The Republican governors said they were providing the additional troops at the request of the Trump administration. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said that Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had asked for the extra troops. “When the secretary of the Army asks for backup support to our troops that are already deployed, yes, we will back up our troops,” Mr. DeWine told the Columbus Dispatch.

The number is still expected to grow. But the role of the additional troops appears vague, and the answers to even basic questions, including whether they will be armed, have shifted.

“There is no justification for any deployment of Guard forces in D.C., let alone the deployment of hundreds of Guard forces from multiple states, which smacks of a military occupation of the district,” said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school.

“Local crime is a matter to be handled by local law enforcement,” she added.

The places where the troops have been deployed so far tell part of the story. Most have been seen near the National Mall, large monuments and other tourist-heavy areas.

Army officials said that more would be sent to 10 metro stations, most of which are also near tourist and entertainment sites. They include the Foggy Bottom, Smithsonian, Eastern Market and Waterfront stations.

Near the Washington Monument over the weekend, troops posed for photos with tourists. The National Guard presence, with desert sand-colored vehicles parked near the capital’s most visited tourists spots, is now showing up regularly on social media feeds in posts by visitors to Washington.

The rules of engagement for the troops, at the moment, remain limited to supporting, but not providing, law enforcement. That means that troops are not making arrests, though Army officials acknowledged that could change if Mr. Trump decides that he wants an even more forceful presence.

The scores of officers from federal agencies, including the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security, have linked up with local police on active law enforcement operations.

The question of whether the troops will be armed gets a different answer nearly every day. Last week, Army officials at first said that the troops would not be armed, but would have their weapons “close by.”

Asked to define “close by,” two officials said that weapons could be stashed in vehicles. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to address the issue publicly.

Then, over the weekend, the Guard and the Army issued a new statement that sounded both menacing and vague.

“Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training,” Maj. Melissa L. Heintz, an Army National Guard spokeswoman, said in the statement.

But the mission at the moment is to support law enforcement, not to enforce the law, officials said.

As of Monday night, the troops stationed in Washington were still not carrying weapons. Commanders said that in most cases, arms were being stored in the weapons rooms back at the D.C. Armory.

The reason, officials said, was basic security: If armed soldiers frisk someone, for example, that person could lunge for a weapon, escalating the situation.

During deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, troops carrying out body searches were sometimes unarmed when they were in close quarters with detainees. In those cases, armed troops were usually nearby.

The decision to arm National Guard troops in Washington will be made by operational commanders on a mission-by-mission basis, Army officials said.

“Their presence is focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” Maj. Montrell Russell, a spokesman for the Army, said in the statement.

The National Guard has also started sending military lawyers to work on incoming misdemeanor cases stemming from the deployment of forces, to help relieve the burden on the often understaffed U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, according to two people familiar with the move. At least four of the National Guard lawyers were already working on the cases, with more than a dozen more expected to be reassigned as early as next week, the people said.

While it is not unusual for the executive branch to move lawyers from one agency to another on a temporary basis — detailing, say, lawyers from the Justice Department to serve at the State or Defense Departments — legal experts said it was fairly unusual for military personnel to be placed directly into what amounted to low-level civilian prosecutorial positions. But because the National Guard lawyers serve at the pleasure of their chain of command, they can be sent into the courtroom quickly and easily.

With Republican governors lining up to send in more troops, National Guard officials were scrambling to figure out where the soldiers would sleep once they arrive. Washington has several military bases, but none would have enough room to house hundreds of additional troops.

Most of the deployed D.C. National Guard troops live in the area, so housing for them is not an issue. But troops from Mississippi, West Virginia and other states may end up in the same type of housing that was set up for the 5,000 soldiers who came to town for the June 14 military parade that coincided with the birthdays of Mr. Trump and the U.S. Army. Most of them slept on cots in empty government buildings.

Holy mother of God! What a thing to say at 8 o’clock in the morning.

This would have been a highly unusual admission from any president, but it seemed especially out of character coming from this one. The man who is regarded as a messiah by many of his own supporters — a belief he has encouraged at every turn — says now that he knows he’s no saint.

This fear of perdition raised some questions. Chief among them: Who, exactly, has been informing the president that he is “not doing well” with regard to kingdom come? Did Michael the Archangel somehow get Mr. Trump’s cellphone number?

It is rare to hear Mr. Trump say something so soul-searchingly self-deprecating, which this surely was. He has talked often about his brush with death last summer and how he felt it changed him, but it is otherwise uncommon to hear him acknowledge his own mortality. He is old — 79, to be exact — and does not ever want to be reminded of that fact.

“You know, there’s a certain point at which you don’t want to hear ‘Happy Birthday,’” he said when he turned 78. “You just want to pretend the day doesn’t exist.”

He also said then: “My father lived a long time, my mother lived a long time, and they were happy, and they were great. So maybe we’re going to live a long time. I hope so.”

Mr. Trump’s memories of his parents have stirred thoughts of heaven and hell in him in the past. After he was convicted on 34 felony counts, he talked at rallies about what his parents must be thinking. “Now my beautiful parents are up in heaven, I think they are,” he said at one rally. “They’re up there, looking down. They say, ‘How did this happen to my son?’”

But other times he confessed he was not so sure his father made it past the pearly gates.

“I know my mother’s in heaven,” he said at a Madison Square Garden rally in October. “I’m not 100 percent sure about my father, but it’s close.”

At the White House briefing later on Tuesday, Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, was asked if Mr. Trump was joking when he talked about going to heaven, or if “there was a spiritual motivation behind his peace deals.”

“I think the president was serious,” Ms. Leavitt said. “I think the president wants to get to heaven — as I hope we all do in this room as well.”

But on Tuesday morning, a day after the D.E.A.’s announcement, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico opened her daily news conference by saying she had no idea what U.S. officials were talking about.

“I want to clarify something,” she said. “There is no agreement with the D.E.A. The D.E.A. issues the statement, we don’t know based on what. We haven’t reached any agreement — none of the security institutions have — with the D.E.A.”

The D.E.A. said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that its initiative “is being conducted in coordination with Mexican law enforcement counterparts.” It added, “This is a significant step forward in advancing and strengthening law enforcement and intelligence sharing with partners regarding an issue that has positive implications on both sides of the border.”

The confusion was the latest public divergence between the Mexican and U.S. governments, amid an intense pressure campaign by the Trump administration to get Mexico to do more against cartels that has often left Ms. Sheinbaum on the defensive.

President Trump has repeatedly said Mexico must intensify the fight against cartels and curb the flow of fentanyl across the United States-Mexico border. Ms. Sheinbaum has said Mexico is doing just that, and indeed operations are up and fentanyl seizures at the border are down, according to officials in both countries.

Ms. Sheinbaum has said that some of that success has been the fruit of longstanding cooperation between Mexican and U.S. authorities. And she has repeatedly suggested, including on Tuesday, that the two countries are on the verge of significantly expanding their teamwork against cartels in a new security agreement that is being negotiated.

“This agreement is about to be signed, and it is fundamentally based on sovereignty, mutual trust, territorial respect — that is, that each nation operates in its own territory — and coordination without subordination,” she said on Tuesday.

This month, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had directed the Pentagon to explore military action against cartels his administration has declared terrorist organizations, most of which are in Mexico. That prompted another strong pushback from Ms. Sheinbaum.

“The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military,” she said at the time. “We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out.”

The contradiction this week may be the result of miscommunication and disagreement on how to frame the two nations’ work together, as the Trump administration seeks to publicize its action against cartels while Ms. Sheinbaum’s government tries to manage its image with a Mexican public wary of U.S. interventionism.

The D.E.A. release announced “a major new initiative” to fight cartels with Mexico, centered around “Project Portero, D.E.A.’s flagship operation aimed at dismantling cartel ‘gatekeepers,’ operatives who control the smuggling corridors along the southwest border.”

The D.E.A. said such “gatekeepers” helped smuggle drugs into the United States and guns and cash into Mexico.

The agency said the project involved “a multiweek training and collaboration program” in the United States that would bring together “Mexican investigators with U.S. law enforcement, prosecutors, defense officials and members of the intelligence community” to “identify joint targets, develop coordinated enforcement strategies and strengthen the exchange of intelligence.”

The release quoted the agency’s administrator, Terrance Cole, as saying the project was “a bold first step in a new era of cross-border enforcement, and we will pursue it relentlessly until these violent organizations are dismantled.”

Ms. Sheinbaum suggested that was overdoing it.

“The only thing is a group of police officers from the Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection who were taking a workshop in Texas,” she said. “That’s all there is. There is nothing else. We do not know why they issued this statement.”

That group consisted of four officers, she said.

“The only thing we will always ask for is respect — always,” she added. “So if you are going to share something regarding Mexico that’s a security matter, all we ask is that it’s done within the collaborative framework we have, and that it isn’t inaccurate.”

He revisited the claim on Monday when he disclosed in a social media post that an investigation had been opened into the issue.

“D.C. gave Fake Crime numbers in order to create a false illusion of safety,” Mr. Trump wrote. “This is a very bad and dangerous thing to do, and they are under serious investigation for so doing!”

How tabulating crime data from the local police could amount to a federal crime is not immediately clear, the two people said, though the effort aims to determine if there were false statements or fraud involved in producing the data.

Prosecutors working for the U.S. attorney, Jeanine Pirro, opened the investigation in recent days, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing inquiry.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In wresting control of the police force, Mr. Trump and his allies have challenged the accuracy of the District of Columbia’s crime statistics. They have pointed to a police official in the city’s Third District who was suspended this year in the middle of an internal inquiry into whether he downplayed the seriousness of some crimes. The head of the local police union has also claimed, amid a litany of complaints about the department’s senior leadership, that crimes have been deliberately undercounted.

Mayor Muriel Bowser has said that the matter involved data anomalies in one of the city’s seven districts. “We are completing that investigation, and we don’t believe it implicates many cases,” she told NBC4 Washington in recent days.

Since last Monday, Mr. Trump has declared an emergency in Washington, taken authority over the Police Department for 30 days and sent hundreds of National Guard troops and additional federal agents onto the streets to conduct patrols and stop cars, giving them a high-profile presence in daily life.

City officials have challenged the rationale for such an aggressive assertion of power, noting that most major categories of crime have been falling since 2023. Homicides, for instance, have dropped 11 percent so far this year compared with the same period last year.

In April, the same U.S. attorney’s office that is investigating the city’s crime data heralded its figures, praising a 25 percent drop in violent crime in Washington in the first 100 days of Mr. Trump’s administration.

Last week, however, the president declared that crime in the capital was out of control and that his Justice Department would take over law enforcement work in the city.

The standoff between federal and local authorities deepened after the city’s attorney general sued the administration on Friday over its efforts to tighten its grip on law enforcement. A day earlier, the Justice Department declared it would curb the police chief’s authority and demanded that local officers aid in immigration enforcement.

The two sides reached a tentative truce on Friday, in which the police chief, Pamela A. Smith, retains authority over the Police Department but her officers may be more helpful to immigration enforcement efforts. A federal judge may hold a hearing on the issue this week.

Federal prosecutors are not the only ones trying to find evidence of a coverup on crime figures in Washington.

Last week, a group founded by the Trump adviser Stephen Miller, America First Legal, said it was seeking police and city documents about possible problems with crime data.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/19/multimedia/19trump-news-promo5p-vgjc/19trump-news-promo5p-vgjc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 18:57:44.357995

Indeed, there is a longstanding tradition in Anglo-American law against using the military for domestic law enforcement.
What’s more, military personnel are generally trained and equipped to be soldiers, not law enforcement officers.
Using the military for law enforcement thus exposes civilians to potential rights violations by soldiers who are not trained to uphold constitutional rights.
The current deployment of state National Guard forces also raises concerns about potential circumvention of the Posse Comitatus Act.","A week ago, President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet announced a takeover of law enforcement functions in Washington, D.C. using three tools: deployment of elements of the D.C. National Guard (and National Guard troops from several cooperating states as well), invocation of a statutory emergency power to requisition the services of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department, and a surge of federal law enforcement to the city’s streets, including Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other federal agents. Over the past week, 800 D.C. National Guardsmen have been mobilized for operations in the city, with hundreds more state National Guardsmen on their way, and 500 newly deployed immigration and other federal agents are patrolling the streets or have set up checkpoints. At the same time, the district and the White House have engaged in a power struggle over control of the city’s police department.

According to the White House, these moves were necessitated by “out-of-control” violent crime in the district—a view contradicted by city and federal statistics showing a significant downward trend. Regardless of crime levels in the city, however, the use of National Guard forces raises significant legal questions, including the specter of potential Posse Comitatus Act violations. Moreover, the ebb and flow of local crime is not an “emergency” that could justify a federal takeover of the D.C. police. And as shown recently in Los Angeles, the surge of homeland security agents can lead to aggressive, escalatory policing practices with little accountability or oversight.

At the same time, the president signaled that D.C. may be a testing ground for this strategy, to be replicated in other cities where the White House has exaggerated crime rates and complained about sanctuary laws and political opposition. But there are legal guardrails against such actions. The president’s authority over state National Guard forces is more limited than his authority over the D.C. National Guard, while the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution blocks the federal government from commandeering police departments in the states or revamping their policing policies and priorities.

Federal Deployment of the D.C. National Guard

Trump began the D.C. takeover attempt by announcing two executive actions. One of these was a presidential memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to deploy elements of the District of Columbia National Guard into Washington, D.C. “to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation’s capital.” While the president has command authority over the D.C. National Guard, this use of the National Guard to support domestic policing functions is deeply concerning and may violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Posse Comitatus Act.

Any domestic military operation that involves the armed forces in law enforcement should raise alarm bells. Indeed, there is a longstanding tradition in Anglo-American law against using the military for domestic law enforcement. As the Brennan Center has explained, this line between the military and civilian spheres serves as a critical protection for democracy and individual liberty. History teaches, and the Framers well knew, that the ability to turn an army inward can be a powerful instrument of tyranny and oppression.

What’s more, military personnel are generally trained and equipped to be soldiers, not law enforcement officers. The military provides scant training on how to respond to civil unrest and no training in municipal policing. Using the military for law enforcement thus exposes civilians to potential rights violations by soldiers who are not trained to uphold constitutional rights.

For these reasons, the president’s use of the military for policing is normally barred by the Posse Comitatus Act unless expressly authorized by Congress. There is a potential legal loophole, however, when it comes to the National Guard.

There are 54 National Guards (one for all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia). Ordinarily, every National Guard operates under the command and control of its state or territorial governor unless and until it is “called into federal service,” or “federalized,” by the president. Because the Posse Comitatus Act is concerned with the president’s use of the military, National Guard forces operating under state control may be used for law enforcement to the extent permitted by state law; they are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act only when federalized and brought under the president’s command and control.

The sole exception to this framework is the District of Columbia National Guard, which is always under the president’s command and control and may be mobilized as he sees fit, without needing to formally call it into federal service. Although it might seem that the D.C. National Guard is always effectively “federalized” by virtue of operating under the president’s command, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has long maintained that it may nonetheless operate in a non-federal “militia” status in which it is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Under this view, the president can use the D.C. National Guard for law enforcement in the District whenever he chooses, without regard for the restrictions that apply everywhere else in the country.

This claim has never been tested in court, nor has Congress validated it by statute. OLC’s theory, expressed in a 1989 memorandum, is also in tension with more recent federal court decisions finding that application of the Posse Comitatus Act to the National Guard turns on whether the Guard has been placed under federal command and control. Given that the D.C. National Guard is under permanent federal control, these decisions suggest that it should always be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. One might also argue that even if the president may use the D.C. Guard for local law enforcement as a governor might in one of the 50 states, the Posse Comitatus Act applies whenever the president deploys it for a federal purpose. According to the deployment order issued pursuant to the president’s August 11 memorandum, the purpose of deployment includes protection of federal property and functions and support to federal law enforcement.

Notably, courts have held that the Posse Comitatus Act applies only when federal forces engage directly in law enforcement activities and not when they provide indirect support to law enforcement, such as logistical assistance or area surveillance. Direct participation occurs when civilian law enforcement agents make “direct active use” of military personnel to execute the laws, when federal military forces pervade civilian law enforcement operations, or when troops subject civilians to an exercise of military power that is “regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.” How the Trump administration intends to use the D.C. National Guard is still not entirely clear. The administration indicated that 100-200 D.C. Guardsmen were expected to be on duty in the city at any given time and that they would perform “an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement.” However, in at least one reported case, a National Guard member detained an individual who allegedly assaulted a U.S. Park Police officer—an act that clearly falls within the Posse Comitatus Act’s prohibition.

In addition, D.C. National Guard forces were initially unarmed. On Saturday, however, the Wall Street Journal reported that both the currently deployed D.C. National Guard personnel and arriving state National Guard troops would shift to carrying weapons. (A report later confirmed by the Guard spokesperson Army Senior Master Sgt. Craig Clapper.) The decision to arm the National Guard is a significant and unwarranted escalation that departs from established Department of Defense practices. Even when Trump and President Joe Biden deployed the Guard to provide additional security around the United States Capitol and the surrounding congressional office buildings in the weeks and months following the January 6th insurrection, they were generally unarmed. While the arming of Guard forces may not itself trigger the Posse Comitatus Act, it potentially augurs actions of a “prescriptive” or “compulsory” nature.

Deployment of National Guard Forces from Cooperating States

In his August 11 memorandum, Trump also directed the Secretary of Defense to “coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service” in D.C. On Saturday, West Virginia became the first state to announce that it would be sending National Guard troops to D.C., followed quickly by South Carolina and Ohio, and then Mississippi and Louisiana. This deployment of National Guard forces from cooperating states to support policing of crime in D.C. represents a legally questionable use of so-called “Title 32” status. And notwithstanding threats of expansion, it could not be repeated in states that did not welcome out-of-state forces.

National Guard personnel brought into D.C. from cooperating states will be operating in Title 32 status, one of three different duty statuses that the National Guard can operate in at any given time. In “State Active Duty status,” Guard personnel carry out a state-defined mission, under state command and control, and with state funding and benefits. In “Title 10 status,” the Guard has been federalized, and undertakes federal missions under federal command and control with federal funding and benefits. Title 32 status sits in between: the Guard remains under state command and control but can perform functions established by Congress or requested by the executive branch and receives federal payment and benefits. Crucially, because Guard personnel in Title 32 status are under state control, they have not been federalized and are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act.

Under Section 502(f) of Title 32, the specific authority that is being used to bring National Guard troops from West Virginia and other states to D.C., governors may deploy their National Guard in Title 32 status to support a federal mission at the request of the president or Secretary of Defense. The first Trump administration used this authority to bring thousands of state National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. in Title 32 status during the summer of 2020 to quell protests over the police killing of George Floyd.

Whether Section 502(f) authorizes the current state Guard deployments to D.C. is far from clear. Although the text of Section 502(f) is broad and might at first blush appear to permit governors to deploy their Guard forces for any reason identified by the president or Secretary of Defense, the legislative history of the provision, along with its placement in a section of the law pertaining to Guard training exercises, weighs heavily in favor of a much narrower reading of the law. It is best understood to facilitate federal payment for actions otherwise authorized under Title 32, as well as certain traditional Guard functions such as disaster relief.

The current deployment of state National Guard forces also raises concerns about potential circumvention of the Posse Comitatus Act. Although Guard forces performing federal missions under Section 502(f) remain under state command and control as a legal matter, they can in practice be subject to significant federal direction. That is particularly true when they are deployed to support the activities of the D.C. National Guard, which is always under the president’s command and control. In 2020, Department of Defense officials confirmed that state Guard forces were reporting through the D.C. National Guard’s (federal) chain of command. There is a powerful argument that the Posse Comitatus Act should be deemed to apply in such circumstances, even if Guard forces have not formally been called into federal service.

In any event, Trump could not use the same gambit in states like New York and Illinois, as he has threatened. U.S. states are sovereign entities vis-à-vis each other, and their sovereignty is both co-equal and territorially limited. As the Supreme Court has explained, “the jurisdiction of a state is coextensive with its territory, coextensive with its legislative power.” Because of this, one state cannot unilaterally reach into another and exercise governmental power there. A state court subpoena, for example, does not take direct effect in another state; instead, the party seeking to enforce the subpoena must do so through the second state’s courts. For the same reason, a state may not deploy its National Guard forces into another state without the latter state’s permission—that is to say, U.S. states may not invade one another.

Placing National Guard forces in Title 32 status as opposed to State Active Duty status does not overcome this sovereignty barrier, nor does the president’s request for assistance from a governor under Section 502(f). As a legal matter, Guard forces in Title 32 status remain under state command and control, just as in State Active Duty status. Orders to mobilize and deploy must be issued by the governor, not the president. That means that any Guard personnel deployed to DC in Title 32 status would not be considered federalized and would continue to operate under the authority of the sending state. Indeed, for this same reason, governors are free to deny the president’s request for assistance under Section 502(f). In practice, this limits the deployment of Guard forces in Title 32 status only to states in which the governor consents to such use.

Federal Government Commandeers the Metropolitan Police Department

President Trump has also invoked Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, which provides that “whenever the President of the United States determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes, he may direct the Mayor to provide him, and the Mayor shall provide, such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate.” The administration’s invocation and application of this provision appears to exceed the authority the statute provides in a number of ways.

To begin, the authority has been widely painted—most notably by Trump—as authorizing the president to take control over MPD. Indeed, the administration originally sought to oust the department’s police chief and replace her with a Drug Enforcement Administration official. The text of the provision, however, is less sweeping, only requiring the D.C. mayor to provide the president with the services of the police. This necessarily implies that the mayor retains direct control over MPD. In accordance with this reading, a federal court essentially forced the administration to reach an agreement with the district under which the existing police chief, appointed by the mayor, will retain command of MPD while the DEA official serves as a federal liaison between the Trump administration and D.C.’s elected government.

Even more fundamentally, the criteria for invoking Section 740 have not been met. First, there are no “special conditions of an emergency nature” present here. Section 740 does not define the term “emergency,” and the legislative history of the Home Rule Act offers no real insight on this point. Yet the word has a clear meaning. By definition, an emergency is a sudden and unexpected crisis. But there has been no unforeseen jump in crime in the nation’s capital; to the contrary, MPD statistics reflect a steady downward trend in crime since 2023. Of course, the administration can still take the position that crime levels are too high. What it cannot do, however, is demonstrate any sudden change in circumstances that could meet the well-established definition of “emergency.”

Second, Section 740 may be invoked only if the president requires the MPD’s assistance “for federal purposes.” Local crime prevention, even in the District of Columbia, is not a federal purpose; by contrast, suppressing an insurrection against the federal government or defending the nation’s capital against invasion by a foreign power are core federal purposes. Although the administration has been careful to include language about the protection of federal property and functions in its authorizing orders, its public statements make quite clear that the invocation of Section 740 is in response to alleged increases in local crime. There is no indication that MPD officers are being systematically moved away from residential or business areas to be deployed near federal buildings or property.

Finally, Section 740(d) imposes a 30 day time limit on presidential control over MPD that may be extended only by a joint resolution of Congress—a resolution that would be subject to a filibuster in the Senate. Trump has claimed that he could somehow unilaterally extend the time limit by declaring a national emergency. There is no legal basis for this claim, as the 137 statutory powers unlocked by a presidential declaration of national emergency do not include any authority to bypass the 30-day limitation included in Section 740(d). The Justice Department admitted to a federal court on Friday that the only way to extend the 30 days is by an act of Congress.

Homeland Security Deployment

The White House has directed a significant ramping up of federal law enforcement agencies, including those of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Throughout commercial, office, and residential areas, agencies like the DHS Federal Protective Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Drug Enforcement Administration have conducted patrols. Homeland security task forces highlighted during last week’s White House press conference have increased drug and immigration enforcement. And immigration officers and D.C. police have operated joint checkpoints to enforce local and immigration laws alike, resulting in arrests. Local and federal officers pulled drivers over for broken taillights, and border patrol participated in the arrest of a dirt bike driver who crashed into a local police vehicle.

The surge added at least 500 new federal law enforcement officers to D.C. streets on top of those routinely present. By Friday, the Attorney General announced nearly 200 arrests, 75 of which were by immigration officers. Last Wednesday alone, 1,650 officers—including over 800 federal agents—engaged in these joint operations.

There are several potential legal bases for these deployments, although the White House has not specified the exact justification. When federal property is allegedly involved, it is likely that the DHS Federal Protective Service (FPS) is taking a leading role. FPS is charged with securing federal property along with the people who work or visit there. In D.C., where the federal government owns some 25% of the land, FPS has a large footprint. Notably, the Homeland Security Act permits FPS police to work beyond the confines of federal property “to the extent necessary to protect [federal] property and persons on the property.” FPS may also enforce state and local law with the agreement of local agencies. (Whether providing such agreement is a “service” that the president can demand under Section 740 is a critical—and unanswered—legal question.) FPS itself has some 1,300 employees and 13,000 contract guards, and it can also tap up to 90,000 other DHS police.

FPS has a notable history of overreach, including aggressive crackdowns on protesters and political surveillance. In Los Angeles this summer and Portland in 2020, masked border patrol special forces cross-designated as FPS officers were deployed onto U.S. streets, armed with weaponry and training more appropriate for their war-on-terror deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this year, DHS paid to settle resulting claims by Portland protesters; in Los Angeles, a lawsuit brought by protesters and journalists, alleging that they were targeted for their constitutionally protected activities, is pending. The agency has also used its broad intelligence program to monitor Occupy Wall Street activists, campus protests, and other such events, in many cases while explicitly disavowing any impact to federal property.

Other legal authorities may also be at work here. Some of the federal operations in D.C., including DHS and DOJ agents, have taken place far from any federal property, such as the commercial corridor checkpoint on 14th Street Northwest. Without citing the exact legal theory behind these operations, the government has stated they serve either to clean up D.C. crime or enforce immigration law. It is possible that these activities are taking place under the rubric of a joint task force established by Section 3 of the Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful executive order. Alternatively, they could be attributable to a homeland security task force Trump mentioned during last week’s press conference, part of a program he created on his first day in office for the purpose of combatting transnational crime and narcotics. These task forces, managed jointly by the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security, pull in officers from across federal law enforcement agencies and focus on immigration-related criminal investigations.

History has illustrated the risks of homeland security task forces: Joint operation models used to target terrorism have subjected Americans to abuses resulting from low investigative standards and electronic surveillance while failing to deliver promised results. Moreover, federal officers on these task forces are engaged in the mixed enforcement of federal and local law, but they lack training on local criminal matters, likely exacerbating risks of abuse or error.

More information is needed to assess whether federal law enforcement officers deployed in D.C. have acted within relevant statutory authorities. For instance, while FPS has a broad mandate to protect federal property, general city patrolling would be outside that scope. It is not yet clear which agencies have enforced federal versus local law at D.C. checkpoints, but reporting suggests federal officials have arrested people for driving under the influence, possession of heroin, assault, fleeing arrest, revoked auto permits, and an outstanding Virginia arrest warrant. Many of these actions appear to fall outside the purview of federal law enforcement.

In addition, the checkpoints have raised constitutional concerns. In 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Indianapolis v. Edmond that a checkpoint established for the primary purpose of general crime control violates the Fourth Amendment, as distinct from targeted checkpoints to test driver sobriety. Edmond limits government’s “ability to construct roadblocks for almost any conceivable law enforcement purpose.” And as the Supreme Court held in 1976, while the border patrol may operate within a reasonable distance of the U.S. border, which includes proximity to maritime borders like D.C.’s, prolonged stops by the agency should be made “for the sole purpose” of assessing immigration status, not because of local infractions. The facts of the D.C. checkpoints are still coming into focus, but their legality will depend on whether vehicles have been stopped on a targeted basis for a legitimate purpose.

In addition to concerns about lawfulness, the deployment of DHS officers to city streets can quickly lead to escalation and conflict. In Los Angeles this summer, DHS officers fired so-called “less-lethal weapons” on journalists and activists in the streets, causing numerous injuries while also suppressing media coverage and free expression; border patrol’s special forces units deployed and engaged in protest response, and DHS launched Predator drones to surveil the city. In Portland in 2020, hundreds of these same border patrol agents, operating under FPS authority, notoriously followed protesters down streets far from any federal property and threw protesters into unmarked vans.

DHS abuses are exacerbated by a weak oversight and accountability infrastructure. Since the department’s creation, key offices that develop and enforce civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy policy have been plagued by weak investigative authorities and hampered by a lack of direct jurisdiction over the operations of components like ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Those agencies, which include border patrol, have internal oversight officers who report to the officials they are meant to oversee, creating fundamental conflicts of interest. And recently the Trump administration purged the “vast majority” of DHS’s public civil rights records from the last decade and gutted the headquarters civil rights office, leaving over 500 complaints to languish. Impacted organizations have challenged the decision, but if the action stands it will all but guarantee that the office will remain on the sidelines.

Prospects of a Nationwide Spread

Trump signaled Monday he sees the nation’s capital as a testing ground for a campaign targeting cities nationwide, name-checking places like Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Oakland, and Baltimore. In these other jurisdictions, the president lacks both the direct control he has over the D.C. National Guard and the legal authority to requisition the services of local police.

To make use of the National Guard in these states, the president would be required to federalize them. While the president has statutory authority to do so, it may only be exercised under certain circumstances. As the Newsom v. Trump case currently making its way through the federal courts shows, states can and will contest the lawfulness of the president’s decision to federalize their National Guard in court.

In addition, while Congress empowered the President to make use of the D.C. police department in limited circumstances, the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution would prohibit that elsewhere. That is because the Tenth Amendment reserves powers not expressly granted to federal government to the states and people. The provision does not apply to D.C., which is not a state. Statehood is the best way to ensure local control of the D.C. police—and a solution supported by the Brennan Center, where we work. But in other locations, the Tenth Amendment means that the federal government may not commandeer state agencies to operate on its behalf, or to threaten them if they choose not to.

The Tenth Amendment would also prohibit Trump from undoing laws and policies preventing local officials from sharing information about immigrants—commonly known as sanctuary laws—as he promised to do last week at the White House, by takeover or threat of funding cuts or prosecution of local officials. Sanctuary practices involve cities and states choosing not to assist in certain aspects of the federal enforcement of immigration law. Federal threats to cut funding and prosecute local officials in retaliation for their sanctuary practices have failed repeatedly in the courts. Just last month, a federal judge in Illinois affirmed that state’s sanctuary laws, ruling that Congress had permitted but not required states to work with federal agencies on immigration enforcement. The court also signaled that any such congressional requirement would run afoul of the Tenth Amendment.

Conclusion

This week’s actions in the nation’s capital illustrate the dangers of an administration willing to exploit emergency powers and disregard the limits on those powers. The administration has militarized law enforcement in the district. It has engaged in an attempted illegal takeover of local police. And it has abused flexible homeland security mandates to crack down on D.C. residents and to make a show of power against perceived political opponents. To be sure, D.C. is unique in that its National Guard is always under federal control, and Congress has authorized a mechanism by which the federal government may briefly assume significant control over D.C.’s local police. But longstanding administration messaging about political opponents, urban crime, and sanctuary laws strongly suggest the government will try similar tactics elsewhere, testing the limits of statutory and constitutional boundaries.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-22301911221.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:56:52.805952

Immigration Equality notes the report “serve as key evidence for asylum seekers, attorneys, judges, and advocates who rely on them to assess human rights conditions and protection claims worldwide.”

The 2024 report the State Department released on Aug. 12 did not include LGBTQ-specific references. Immigration Equality Director of Law and Policy Bridget Crawford in a statement said country-specific reports within the larger report “should be accurate, fact-based, and reflect the lived reality of LGBTQ people — not ignore and actively hide it.”

“When adjudicators see less information in these reports than in prior years, they may wrongly assume conditions have improved,” said Crawford. “In truth, the absence of reporting is a purely political move, not based in fact or reality.”

Organization for Refuge, Asylum and Migration Executive Director Steve Roth in a statement condemned the Trump-Vance administration’s “deliberate erasure of LGBTIQ communities from the 2024 human rights report — an unprecedented move that violates international standards.”

“This is a targeted and malicious act that will directly endanger lives,” he said.

Roth, like Immigration Equality, noted courts “around the world rely on these reports to evaluate asylum claims.”

“Stripping out documentation of LGBTIQ persecution removes a vital tool in assessing claims for protection, jeopardizing the ability of LGBTIQ asylum seekers to access safety,” said Roth.

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year.

The State Department usually releases them in the spring, as opposed to August. Then-State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who president Donald Trump has nominated to become deputy representative at the U.N., during her last press briefing on Aug. 12 defended the delay and the report itself.

“We weren’t going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration,” said Bruce. “It needed to change based on the point of view and the vision of the Trump administration, and so those changes were made.”

Asylum courts ‘will have less credible data to rely on’

Jessica Stern, the former special U.S. envoy for the promotion of LGBTQ and intersex rights under the Biden-Harris administration, co-founded the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice with several other former State Department officials.

The Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice in response to the report said the U.S. has “betrayed the trust of human rights defenders who risked their safety to share the truth” and added “some (of them) are now less safe.”

“Asylum courts in the U.S. and globally will have less credible data to rely on,” said the group.

Human Rights Watch echoed the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice.

“The human rights report has been used in U.S. asylum court cases to show that an asylum seeker could not be returned to a country where similarly situated people were being persecuted,” said Human Rights Watch in response to the 2024 report. “That essential resource for keeping people safe is not only no longer reliable or helpful, but in some cases could put people at risk by denying abuses in places where the United States or other countries intend to deport asylum seekers and immigrants.”

Advocacy groups on Tuesday sharply criticized the removal LGBTQ-specific references from the State Department’s 2024 human rights report.

The report, which the State Department released on Tuesday, does not reference Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Law and the impact it has had on the country’s LGBTQ community since President Yoweri Museveni signed it in 2023. The report, however, does note Ugandan government officials “reportedly committed acts of sexual violence.”

“NGOs reported police medical staff subjected at least 15 persons to forced anal examinations following their arrests,” it reads. “Opposition protesters stated security forces used or threatened to use forced anal examinations during interrogations.”

Uganda is among the dozens of countries in which consensual same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized. Authorities in the African country often use so-called anal tests to determine whether someone has engaged in homosexuality.

The report does not mention that Brazil has the highest number of reported murders of transgender people in the world. It does, however, note the President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2024 “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to ‘undermine democracy,’ disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians, often in secret proceedings that lacked due process guarantees.”

The report says there “were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in Hungary in 2024, even though Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government continued its anti-LGBTQ rights crackdown. The report does note Russian authorities last year “invoked a law prohibiting the distribution of ‘propaganda on nontraditional sexual relations’ to children.”

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report specifically notes a Russian law “prohibited gender transition procedures and gender-affirming care … and authorities used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘non-traditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.” The 2023 report also cites reports that “state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya” and “government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists.”

“There were instances of non-state actor violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons and of police often failing to respond adequately to such incidents,” it adds.

The 2024 report does not mention Thai lawmakers last year approved a bill that extended marriage rights to same-sex couples. Gays and lesbians began to legally marry in the country in January.

Jessica Stern, the former special U.S. envoy for the promotion of LGBTQ and intersex rights under the Biden-Harris administration who co-founded the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday said she and her colleagues “expected (the report) to be bad.”

“When we saw what the administration released, the truth is we were shocked and horrified,” said Stern.

Stern added the Trump-Vance administration “has erased or watered-down entire categories of abuse against people of African descent, indigenous people, Roma people, members of other marginalized racial and ethnic communities, workers, women and girls, and LGBTQI+ people.”

“It is deliberate erasure,” said Stern.

The Council for Global Equality in a statement condemned “the drastic restructuring and glaring omission of violence and abuse targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons in the U.S.”

“We denounce the Trump administration’s efforts to politicize the State Department’s annual human rights reports by stripping longstanding references to human rights abuses targeting LGBTQI+ and other marginalized groups,” said Mark Bromley, the group’s co-chair.

Gay U.S. Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), who chairs the Congressional Equality Caucus, echoed Bromley and Stern.

“Omitting the persecution of LGBTQI+ people from the human rights reports doesn’t erase the abuse, violence, and criminalization our community is facing around the world — it condones it,” said Takano in a statement.

“Erasing our community from these reports makes it that much harder for human rights advocates, the press, and the American people to be aware of the abuses LGBTQI+ people are facing worldwide,” he added.

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year. Foggy Bottom usually releases it in the spring.

Politico in March reported the Trump-Vance administration planned to cut “sections about the rights of women, the disabled, the LGBTQ+ community, and more” from the human rights report. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who President Donald Trump has nominated to become deputy representative at the U.N., on Tuesday during her last press briefing defended the report and the delay in releasing it.

“We weren’t going to release something compiled and written by the previous administration,” said Bruce. “It needed to change based on the point of view and the vision of the Trump administration, and so those changes were made.”

“It certainly promotes, as does our work, a respect for human rights around the globe,” added the former Fox News contributor who has described herself as a “gay woman.”

The Council for Global Equality and Democracy Forward has filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. A press release notes it is “seeking the release of additional information … including any instructions provided by political appointees to strip references to abuses against LGBTQI+ persons from the reports.”

“The reports make LGBTQI+ persons and other minorities invisible and, in so doing, they undermine the human rights landscape that protects all of us,” said Bromley.

“Erasing our community from these reports makes it that much harder for human rights advocates, the press, and the American people to be aware of the abuses LGBTQI+ people are facing worldwide,” added Takano. “Failing to rectify this censorship will have real — and potentially deadly — consequences for LGBTQI+ people, including both for those who travel abroad from the U.S. and for LGBTQI+ people in countries whose leadership no longer need to worry about consequences for their human rights abuses. The State Department must reverse course and restore the LGBTQI+ section to these reports.”

A State Department spokesperson told the Washington Blade the “information included in the 2024 reports has been restructured and streamlined for better utility and accessibility, and to be more responsive to the legislative mandate for the (human rights report.)”

“The result directly addresses the reporting requirements as laid out in statute as well as being more streamlined, objective, universal, and accessible to the American public,” said the spokesperson.

The spokesperson did not comment on the FOIA lawsuit the Council for Global Equality and Democracy Forward has filed.

Advocacy groups have sharply criticized the State Department over its reported plans to remove references to anti-LGBTQ discrimination from its annual human rights reports.

The Washington Post on Wednesday reported it obtained drafts of human rights reports for El Salvador, Russia, and Israel.

“They strike all references to LGBTQ+ individuals or crimes against them, and the descriptions of government abuses that do remain have been softened,” reported the Post.

Andry Hernández Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker, said guards at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a maximum-security prison known by the Spanish acronym CECOT, sexually assaulted him after the U.S. “forcibly disappeared” him and hundreds of other Venezuelans to the Central American country in March. The Post published its article less than a month after Hernández returned to Venezuela.

The State Department’s 2023 human rights report notes a Russian law “prohibited gender transition procedures and gender-affirming care … and authorities used laws prohibiting the promotion of ‘nontraditional sexual relations’ to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.”

“There were reports state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya,” reads the report. “There were reports government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists. There were instances of nonstate actor violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons and of police often failing to respond adequately to such incidents.”

The 2023 report notes Israeli law “prohibited discrimination by state and nonstate actors based on sexual orientation in providing goods and services and prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment.”

“The government generally enforced the law, although some discrimination against LGBTQI+ persons persisted,” it reads. “The law did not allow for same-sex marriage, and LGBTQI+ couples experienced discrimination in matters related to parenthood, including adoption, parental registration, and birth certificates.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has faced widespread criticism over its war in the Gaza Strip in response to Oct. 7. Two Israeli human rights groups — B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel — late last month said their country is committing genocide against Palestinians in the Hamas-controlled enclave.

“Secretary Rubio has repeatedly asserted that his State Department has not abandoned human rights, but it is clear by this and other actions that this administration only cares about the human rights of some people … in some countries, when its convenient to them,” Council for Global Equality Managing Director Keifer Buckingham told the Post.

Human Rights First in a statement said it “condemns the far-reaching cuts and politically driven revisions the Trump administration has reportedly made to the State Department’s soon-to-be-released annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.”

Congress requires the State Department to release a human rights report each year. Foggy Bottom has yet to release the 2024 report.

Politico in March reported the Trump-Vance administration “is slashing the State Department’s annual human rights report — cutting sections about the rights of women, the disabled, the LGBTQ+ community, and more.”

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation.
But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies.
The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is demanding an investigation of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials who allegedly retaliated against whistleblowers who flagged failures to fingerprint potentially dangerous criminal migrants, The Post can exclusively reveal.
The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman fired off a letter Monday to CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott naming and shaming those “bureaucrats” who were promoted even after they sidelined whistleblowers Fred Wynn, Mike Taylor and Mark Jones.
“To ensure that retaliation does not happen again at [Department of Homeland Security], CBP, or any of the Department’s other component agencies, the bureaucrats that retaliated against Mr. Wynn, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Jones must be held accountable,” Grassley told Scott.
Jones, Taylor and Wynn worked in the agency’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Division between 2016 and 2018 — and found out that federal law enforcement officers weren’t enforcing the statute.
OSC’s investigation concluded that CBP officials “retaliated against” the three agents “for actual or perceived disclosures of wrongdoing,” Grassley noted in his letter.","WASHINGTON — Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is demanding an investigation of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials who allegedly retaliated against whistleblowers who flagged failures to fingerprint potentially dangerous criminal migrants, The Post can exclusively reveal.

The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman fired off a letter Monday to CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott naming and shaming those “bureaucrats” who were promoted even after they sidelined whistleblowers Fred Wynn, Mike Taylor and Mark Jones.

“To ensure that retaliation does not happen again at [Department of Homeland Security], CBP, or any of the Department’s other component agencies, the bureaucrats that retaliated against Mr. Wynn, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Jones must be held accountable,” Grassley told Scott.

“Although it’s unclear to me whether all retaliators have faced consequences, I’ve been made aware that some have been promoted,” he added.

The Iowa Republican singled out Ronald Ocker, assistant commissioner of CBP’s Office of Intelligence, and Juan Fernandez, the executive director of that office, for having “improperly removed” the whistleblowers nearly a decade ago from a pilot program to implement the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005.

Jones, Taylor and Wynn worked in the agency’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Division between 2016 and 2018 — and found out that federal law enforcement officers weren’t enforcing the statute.

As a result, DNA from criminal arrestees hadn’t been collected since 2009, allowing “subjects subsequently accused of violent crimes, including homicide and sexual assault, to elude detection even when detained multiple times by CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” according to an earlier investigation by the US Office of Special Counsel (OSC).

Those “exceptions to DNA sample collection from criminal arrestees” had been approved by former Attorney General Eric Holder during the Barack Obama administration.

“I believe that if you could get the totality for that period of time [since 2009] … of how many Americans ended up being killed as a result, I think it probably exceeds the number of Americans who died on 9/11,” one source with direct knowledge of the security failure previously told The Post.

When the whistleblowers drew attention to the issue, they faced professional and financial consequences — including being kicked off the WMD pilot program by Ocker and Fernandez, according to Grassley’s letter.

Jones, who served as acting director of the pilot WMD fingerprint program, was passed over for the director position at a new office called the Operational Field Testing Division, which conducted similar law enforcement work

Taylor lost retirement benefits and had his pension payments stopped. Both he and Jones were also stripped of their guns and badges.

OSC’s investigation concluded that CBP officials “retaliated against” the three agents “for actual or perceived disclosures of wrongdoing,” Grassley noted in his letter.

“OSC also noted that Fernandez did not name Mr. Jones Acting Deputy Director of Operational Field Testing Division (OFTD), despite stating in a March 6, 2018, email that it would happen,” the senator also stated.

“Further, OSC found that both Ocker and Fernandez engaged in retaliation when they passed Mr. Jones over for Director of the OFTD when it stated, ‘the agency does not have strong evidence in support of its stated reason or decision not to interview Mr. Jones or fairly consider him for the OFTD Director position.’”

Jones, Taylor and Wynn were only given new supervisory roles, back pay and their retirement benefits back in May after Grassley highlighted the “seven-year nightmare these brave whistleblowers endured.”

In his April confirmation hearing, Scott had promised Grassley he would “look into” the case and “hold people accountable if they’ve violated policies.”

“Thank you for always stepping up and supporting the whistleblowers. I think it’s a critical part of our government, it pushes transparency,” Scott also told the Republican senator.

“I do know those three, and I know one allegation that’s never been levied against them is a challenge of their integrity.”

Grassley had also relayed details of the case to DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari in May 2024. That office is still believed to be investigating the matter as well.

The Victims of Crime Act, enacted by Congress in 1984, created a mechanism for distributing fines and fees collected in federal criminal cases. It does not use tax money. Those funds are distributed to states, which typically award money through a grant process to agencies and nonprofits that help victims.

The money has funded victim advocates, sexual assault forensic exams, emergency shelters and reimbursed victims for medical and funeral costs, among other services.

An existing shortfall in VOCA funding already had providers on edge, worried about meeting the essential needs of victims. Now, Wisconsin and other states argue the Trump administration is forcing them into an ""untenable position,"" according to the lawsuit.

""Either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law and destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime,"" the lawsuit says.

VOCA does not contain language that authorizes the U.S. DOJ to impose such funding conditions, nor does any other federal law passed by Congress, according to the lawsuit.

The brief supports the district court’s conclusion that administrative processing is not a final decision by the consular officer. This brief argues that placing a visa application into administrative processing is a refusal under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 221(g), 8 U.S.C § 1201(g), which is not a final decision, as contrasted with denying a visa because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements.

The amicus brief argues that the district court decisions recognized the lack of finality in § 221(g)’s statutory language and State Department regulations and interpretations while Karimova assumes, without citing any authority, that “refusal” in § 221(g) means “final.” The amicus brief also supports the district court’s conclusion that the consular nonreviewability doctrine does not bar judicial review of a visa delay claim. The brief argues that the doctrine—created by the judiciary to preclude interference with a consular officer’s decision to deny a visa—does not apply to a § 221(g) refusal where the consular officer has not yet decided whether to grant or deny.

The verdict came just a few months after another Big Tech giant, Apple, filed to drop a similar case against NSO, largely due to challenges with the discovery process. The company cited the risks of threat intelligence information being disclosed to NSO and other threat actors during the process, as well as the alleged attempts by the Israeli government to prevent NSO’s disclosure of important documents about Pegasus spyware in the WhatsApp v. NSO case. Tech companies like Apple risk revealing too much information about how they are protecting their customers from spyware, while being unable to obtain discovery themselves.

These challenges associated with the discovery process in spyware cases can teach civil society, legal advocates, judges, and policymakers a number of important lessons about how to minimize the inherent risks associated with such a process, while successfully utilizing the information that can be gained from it.

An Overview of the U.S. Discovery System

The United States is known for having the most expensive civil legal system in the world, at least in part due to its uniquely deep and broad discovery process. Discovery in U.S. civil litigation (also called disclosure in other countries) is where parties exchange legal demands for information that may be relevant to their case and used at trial. In other countries, discovery is often limited both in terms of tactics and scope, and there is also a greater emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. In the United States, however, a number of instruments are allowed for compelling production of various types of evidence by the parties pertaining to broad categories of matters potentially relevant to the litigation. For example, a party to a legal case in the United States may seek discovery through deposition (out of court oral examination under oath), interrogatories (out of court written questions which must be answered in writing and under oath), subpoena (court order compelling a person to testify or produce certain evidence), as well as the use of specialized experts. By contrast, in countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom, the pre-trial discovery stage is either virtually non-existent, or requires more limited oral and documentary disclosures.

This extensive process presents unique challenges, particularly in the digital age where there are vastly larger amounts of data than ever before. Locating, compiling, sorting, storing, producing, or challenging the production of digital data can be extremely resource-intensive and can prove financially devastating, especially for small organizations without significant legal budgets. Overly intrusive or broad discovery demands may also expose sensitive information and significantly interfere with fundamental human rights, such as the right to privacy or the right to the freedom of speech, and may silence an individual or an organization seeking to challenge those in power. For those reasons, invasive discovery requests can sometimes be considered a form of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), a type of legal action designed to retaliate against those advocating for issues of public concern. Such retaliatory measures can be used by both parties in a case, including against third parties.

These risks are especially prominent in litigation related to the use of spyware. Such litigation may involve spyware companies, tech platforms, individual victims, researchers, and civil society advocates, as well as foreign intelligence services, exploit developers, and criminal hacking groups or other non-state actors. Spyware companies, as well as their government clients or exporters, also extend significant resources to preserve the secrecy of their operations and technologies, while trying to silence their victims, critics, and those seeking to expose their abuses. The consequences of some of these parties and non-parties accessing discovery materials could extend far beyond the interests of a particular group of defendants or plaintiffs, and directly impact human rights, national security, and the security of billions of digital devices worldwide.

Spyware Litigation Discovery and the Risks to Civil Society

Big Tech, academia, and civil society alike supported WhatsApp when it first brought its case against NSO Group because it represented a bold step to finally hold the powerful commercial spyware industry accountable in court. Although the action focused on the harms to WhatsApp as a company and did not directly involve the software’s users targeted by the NSO’s Pegasus spyware, WhatsApp referred to the victims — over 100 of whom were members of civil society — during the pre-trial stages. Access Now, a non-profit focused on digital civil rights, along with other NGOs, also submitted an amicus brief when NSO initially appealed the case to the 9th Circuit, highlighting the stories of several civil society victims and the importance of WhatsApp’s action as potentially the only chance at justice these individuals had.

NSO, in the words of the District Court Judge Phyllis Hamilton, “repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery.” Nevertheless, NSO leveraged the discovery process to try to obtain sensitive information not only about WhatsApp but also third parties, such as civil society victims and security researchers.

For example, one major point of contention during the discovery process was the identities of the individuals whose Android phones were targeted by NSO’s exploitation of WhatsApp’s vulnerabilities. NSO attempted to challenge whether those victims were indeed members of civil society, as opposed to criminals or terrorists, which would have allegedly made them legitimate targets of hacking. Unsatisfied with obtaining thousands of documents from WhatsApp, NSO sought additional discovery from an uninvolved party — the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs. The research group has been responsible for the lion’s share of investigations uncovering NSO’s spyware abuses around the world, including the very first documented case of Pegasus spyware use against an Emirati human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor. When WhatsApp discovered that NSO exploited vulnerabilities in the tech company’s app to target users with Pegasus spyware, the Citizen Lab helped identify cases where the attack’s suspected targets were members of civil society, such as human rights activists and journalists.

Over the course of many months, NSO submitted multiple discovery requests to the Citizen Lab seeking to compel deposition and document production related to the identities of the civil society victims and the organization’s research methods, arguing that this information was essential for NSO’s defense against WhatsApp’s lawsuit. Needless to say, this arbitrary “fishing expedition” sought information that was extremely sensitive and, in fact, protected under the University of Toronto’s research ethics protocols. The Citizen Lab had an obligation to protect the confidentiality of their research subjects, which is why they used every legal means possible to resist such requests. However, many researchers and civil society organizations investigating spyware lack the protections and resources offered by a major university to defend themselves against such invasive discovery requests. This seriously risks chilling public interest spyware research and accountability efforts and discouraging victims from participating in such measures.

NSO’s tactics were especially worrisome given the company’s history and its customers’ retaliation against researchers and advocates who expose its abuses and seek justice. In fact, one confirmed target in the WhatsApp Pegasus hack was a British lawyer representing a group of Mexican journalists and government critics and a Saudi dissident living in Canada, suing NSO in Israel for the targeting of their phones. We consider these cross-border attacks to be transnational repression and a tool of digital authoritarianism.

Another prominent British lawyer, Rodney Dixon, was targeted with Pegasus spyware in 2019, likely in retaliation for representing his clients Matthew Hedges, a British doctoral student jailed in the United Arab Emirates, and Hatice Cengiz, the fiancée of the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Cengiz’s device was also infected with Pegasus, likely in response to her seeking accountability for Khashoggi’s brutal murder by Saudi agents in Turkey.

But the retaliation goes beyond just spyware. There are several reported cases of lawyers and researchers, including at the Citizen Lab, being targeted with social engineering and other types of intelligence operations aimed at gathering sensitive information about the lawsuits against NSO as well as information that could discredit NSO’s and their clients’ critics and forensic researchers. Given this context, NSO’s (ab)use of discovery against the Citizen Lab appeared even more sinister.

Ultimately, the district court judge was not convinced by NSO’s arguments, denying NSO’s discovery requests sent to the Citizen Lab and labelling them irrelevant and disproportionate to the needs of the case. However, this example demonstrates how spyware companies may turn the tables against their victims and researchers and subject them to invasive discovery requests that require significant amounts of legal resources and risk chilling digital security research and human rights activities.

Spyware Litigation Discovery Poses National Security Risks

Invasive discovery requests can also discourage major companies, such as Apple, from pursuing legal action out of concern that it will endanger sensitive threat intelligence information, highly sought after not just by the spyware companies themselves, but also by foreign government adversaries and hostile non-state actors.

It is no accident that threat intelligence teams at major tech platforms defending against governmental hacking typically also work on mercenary spyware. This is because the exploits leveraged by mercenary spyware like NSO Group’s Pegasus include capabilities that could compete with those that were “previously thought to be accessible to only a handful of nation states.” Moreover, exploits used by mercenary spyware companies have repeatedly been found in use by hostile foreign intelligence services. For example, Google found that exploits used by NSO Group and Intellexa (the maker of Predator spyware) were reused by APT29, a cyber espionage group attributed to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service. Whether these spyware companies are doing business with the same exploit sellers as Russia or the exploits are being leaked, this indicates that the spyware industry is uncomfortably close to hostile foreign intelligence activity.

The operations and detection techniques of tech platforms’ threat intelligence teams are proprietary and closely-guarded. This is because information — such as the ways that protocols, crashes, and logs are scrutinized for evidence of exploit testing and hacking activity — can all be used by any threat actor conducting attacks across their platforms to develop hacking techniques and methods of evading detection.

Discovery in cases where platforms’ threat teams have identified, tracked, and blocked an advanced threat actor or exploit could provide an unprecedented window into how these teams frustrate espionage attempts, including against targets such as heads of states. Since business activities of mercenary spyware companies, criminal hacker groups, and foreign intelligence operations are constantly in progress, depending on the category of information, it may reasonably be expected to provide immediate benefit to ongoing efforts by multiple hostile foreign intelligence services, mercenary spyware companies, exploit developers, and criminals to commit illegal intrusions that evade detection. For example, as the WhatsApp v. NSO record revealed, NSO Group continued to develop and deploy the techniques to help their customers hack WhatsApp users even after the legal case was filed.

Similarly, the non-public methods and technologies used by researchers like the Citizen Lab, Amnesty International Security Lab, or commercial research organizations are of strong interest to hacking groups, foreign intelligence services, and mercenary spyware customers past, present, and future. Exposing these methods could provide immediate benefit to many groups engaged in illegal or abusive activities.

Even if all of the parties and their representatives in spyware litigation will seek to strictly adhere to the protective orders that may be issued to safeguard the sensitive discovery information from being shared with third parties, merely by possessing this information, their systems become an attractive target for state and non-state-affiliated hackers. Similarly, depending on their home jurisdiction, parties or their representatives may face direct pressure or be compelled to provide information to foreign governments.

Discovery as an Opportunity for Justice

Despite significant challenges and risks associated with the discovery process in U.S. spyware litigation, the WhatsApp v. NSO case also shows that it can present tremendous opportunities for victims, researchers, and advocates, which makes pursuing such litigation worthwhile.

One of the trial’s most surprising outcomes was that despite NSO’s (and allegedly the Israeli government’s) attempts to avoid discovery, WhatsApp was nevertheless able to obtain a wealth of valuable information from NSO about its technology and operations. For example, the depositions of NSO’s Vice President Ramon Eshkar, Chief Operating Officer Yaron Shohat, and Research and Development Vice President Tamir Gazneli revealed that the product understood as “Pegasus” is not just one piece of technology or a physical box, but a whole package of products and services that NSO provides to its government customers.

The parts of the depositions that made it into the public record show that Pegasus includes the hardware installed at the government customer’s premises, such as the laptop containing the user interface software where the customer enters the phone number of the desired targets, as well as servers that allow the user interface to work and contain storage of the hacked information. Most importantly, it includes the so-called zero-day vulnerability installation vector developed by NSO that allows government customers to seamlessly gain access to various types of data and functions of the target’s device (depending on the vector used) from their user interface with a push of a button. This ultimately confirms what many researchers have suspected about the capabilities of Pegasus and the fact that NSO, not their customers, are responsible for the installation and extraction process of the Pegasus system.

Such information can be of a significant value to researchers, litigators, judges, activists, as well as policymakers. For example, in debates around regulating spyware technologies, not enough attention has been paid to the actual technical characteristics and operation of the spyware, primarily due to the spyware industry’s secrecy and lack of transparency over governments’ operations of spyware products. NSO and other companies exposed by researchers and journalists for selling repressive technologies have also used defamation and threats of defamation lawsuits to challenge claims about the capabilities of their products and the extent to which they or their customers are responsible for operating it.

Regardless whether a given spyware legal case results in a victory for the plaintiff, the information that arises from the litigation discovery process can shed light on the spyware’s technical capabilities and operation, as well as the spyware products’ prices, the company’s profits, and the identity of its customers — all of which could be incredibly valuable for research, advocacy, and regulation.

Managing the Risks of Spyware Litigation

The U.S. legal system’s extensive discovery process makes spyware litigation a double-edged sword, posing costly challenges to plaintiffs and third parties while exposing their sensitive information. It can also offer an opportunity to obtain crucial evidence that may lead to a victory in the courtroom, but also to successful regulation and curbing of the spyware industry. There are ways to minimize the risks while increasing the benefits.

First, judges, while respecting the defendants’ fair trial rights, should be aware of the unique digital and national security risks that invasive discovery requests pose to victims, researchers, and civil society organizations exposing the abuses of spyware. Spyware companies may be perversely incentivized to use the justice system to go on fishing expeditions and intimidate the community exposing the industry’s abuses. It is also crucial to understand the risks of the foreign intelligence services, exploit developers, and criminals benefiting from discovery materials to learn how sophisticated spyware is detected and how researchers, civil society, and tech platforms operate.

Second, spyware researchers, human rights organizations, lawyers, companies, and the victims themselves must be prepared for potentially invasive discovery requests if they become involved in litigation related to the use of spyware, directly or indirectly. To mitigate risks, they should ensure their data and security policies are in order, and that they have sufficient technical and legal capacity to respond to such requests — even if they plan to oppose them.

Third, funders and donors that provide funding for spyware research or advocacy need to ensure that there are sufficient resources included for anti-SLAPP defense, including fighting off overbroad and retaliatory discovery requests. Law firms and law school legal clinics can also play a major role in providing pro bono support in these cases to non-profits and individual victims who cannot afford an appropriate legal defense.

Finally, journalists, researchers, lawyers, activists, and policymakers should rely on evidence obtained through discovery and disclosure processes in spyware litigation to inform their reporting, investigations, and lawsuits, as well as policy and lawmaking to ensure accurate and evidence-based reporting, advocacy, and policies. Sanctions authorities should also keep a close eye on disclosures to better identify irresponsible actors and their malicious technologies.

Taken together, these steps will help ensure that the discovery process in spyware litigation cases contributes to justice and accountability and avoids putting victims, researchers, and other vulnerable parties and their sensitive information at risk.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-21889237101.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 20:57:21.395885

More than 20 state attorneys general have filed suit against the Department of Justice (DOJ), alleging the Trump administration is unlawfully seeking to withhold critical funds for crime victims from states and nonprofits deemed noncompliant with its draconian immigration enforcement efforts.

The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Rhode Island on Monday, centers on three notices that DOJ posted last month for funding allocated by a decades-old law called the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). As I previously reported for Mother Jones, those funds have long been a critical source of support for organizations including domestic violence shelters, rape crisis centers, and child advocacy centers, which use the money to run emergency shelters and hotlines and provide therapy services, legal advocacy, and court accompaniment to abused people, particularly women and children. Another bucket of VOCA funding also goes directly to crime victims, who can use the funds for pay for services including mental health counseling, funeral expenses, and clean-ups of crime scenes.

But under the Trump administration, this year’s round of $1.9 billion in funding comes with strings attached: It stipulates that grantees may not use the funds for any program or activity that, in DOJ’s opinion, “violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law…or impedes or hinders” enforcement.

While the funding announcements do not clarify what, exactly, would constitute such violations, the intent seems clear: Trump’s DOJ wants to essentially force states and the programs they fund to grant the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), unfettered access to the victims they serve—conditions that the lawsuit calls “unprecedented.”

“Playing politics with the lives of people who have suffered so greatly is reckless, it is cruel, and in this case—it is illegal,” said New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, the lead plaintiff, in a statement.

Advocates for crime victims say that, if enacted, these conditions could have a chilling effect on immigrant survivors of violence, who may avoid seeking help for fear of being deported. “One huge barrier for victims to leave an abusive situation is fear of their abusers reporting them to immigration, which is a real threat, even when the survivor has a path to lawful status,” Carmen McDonald, executive director of Survivor Justice Center, a Los Angeles organization that supports immigrant survivors of domestic violence, told me. “This will continue to cause victims to be unsafe at home and have devastating impacts for survivors.”

As I reported in June, McDonald and other domestic violence service providers in LA saw these impacts firsthand when ICE increased its presence in the city earlier this summer. Several providers told me that survivors were afraid to show up to court appointments and seek in-person help at shelters because they worried that it could put them at risk of deportation or detention from ICE.

These fears were worsened by the fact that Trump administration also rescinded Biden administration guidance characterizing domestic violence shelters and victim services centers, among others, as “protected spaces” where immigration enforcement should not take place due to the harm it could inflict on a community. It seems unsurprising, then, that a survey of more than 170 advocates and attorneys, conducted earlier this year by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, found that nearly 80 percent of advocates reported an increase in immigration-related questions from immigrant survivors since Trump’s election last year.

Now, the administration is trying to use another yet tool in its arsenal—billions in federal funding—to strong-arm nonprofits reliant on VOCA funds into cooperating with Trump’s mass deportation agenda. As I reported last year, VOCA funds come mostly from financial penalties levied in corporate criminal cases; the DOJ distributes a portion of the funds to states, while another portion of the funds are earmarked for direct compensation to eligible victims.

In the last fiscal year, the funds served more than 7 million victims, most of whom were women and victims of domestic violence, assault, and child sex abuse, according to DOJ data. That data does not specify how much of the funding went to immigration-related programs, but shows that it served millions through individual advocacy, legal advice, and referrals to other programs—all services that could theoretically include support for immigrants.

But the available VOCA funds have been declining as federal prosecutors have pursued more deferred and non-prosecution agreements, which allow defendants more time to pay up or avoid charges entirely if they cooperate with the government. That has already left organizations relying on VOCA funds stretched thin, with programs serving LGBTQ and immigrant survivors particularly difficult to fundraise for due to the hot-button politics around the clients they serve, sources previously told me.

If Trump’s DOJ prevails in court, that landscape is poised to get even worse. Krista Colon, executive director of the California Partnership to End Domestic Violence, said service providers “should not have to interrupt these services because of fears of running afoul of new, unrelated grant terms and conditions, just as they should not have to fear catastrophic cuts.”

The lawsuit alleges that the conditions seeking to mandate immigration enforcement are unlawful under various provisions of both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which governs how agencies operate; the complaint states, for example, that the DOJ does not have the authority to mandate compliance with federal enforcement due to the Constitution’s separation of powers, and that the requirements are “arbitrary and capricious,” in violation of the APA. It names as defendants Attorney General Pam Bondi and two of her subordinates, as well as the offices all three represent. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.

This is one of many times the Trump administration has threatened harm to survivors of crimes: The DOJ previously cancelled more than $800 million in grants for crime victims’ services, before restoring some following public outcry and reporting from Mother Jones. The latest lawsuit also follows another, similar suit, filed in June by 17 state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions, which targeted anti-DEI conditions that Trump’s DOJ imposed on funding allocated by the Violence Against Women Act; earlier this month, a federal judge issued a preliminary stay, temporarily blocking the administration’s requirements on those grants.

Advocates are hoping plaintiffs in the latest lawsuit will find similar success.

Connecticut is one of 21 states suing to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) from withholding grants the state receives through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). The DOJ recently announced the availability of $15.9 million in funding for victims of crime through the Crime Victims Fund. The fund was created by VOCA when it became law in 1984. It is funded by fines levied against convictions of largely white-collar crimes. Funding, which is administered by states, can cover a variety of services, from financial support for medical bills to 24/7 hotlines for crime victims.

The DOJ’s funding announcement stated that programs or activities that “directly or indirectly” violate civil immigration law in part by failing to “give access to DHS agents, or honor DHS requests and provide requested notice to DHS agents” fall outside the program scope and will not receive funding.

But a number of states, including Connecticut, are crying foul as the bulk of money comes from formula grants.

In the past few years, Connecticut has received between roughly $8.5 and $15.6 million in victim assistance formula grants and between roughly $840,000 $1.3 million in victim assistance formula grants from the Crime Victims Fund. Funds are administered by the Judicial Branch’s Office of Victim Services. Eligible individuals can receive up to $15,000 for physical injuries, up to $5,000 for emotional injuries, and up to $25,000 in survivor benefits.

According to the DOJ, the state awarded roughly $23 million in victim assistance formula grants in 2024 and served 401,585 people. It also paid roughly $2.4 million in 885 claims through the victim compensation formula grant program.

Tong’s office said in a press release that the new immigration requirement threatens $14.5 million in funding for the state.

‘This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers, and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce States to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Tong and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.” a press release from Tong’s office announcing the lawsuit stated.

The lawsuit also claims that the move violates the separation of powers, as the Constitution does not give executive branch agencies the power to unilaterally withhold spending that Congress has authorized, except for in very specific conditions that do not apply here.

The immigration requirements, the lawsuit states, amount to “refusing to spend money that Congress intends to be used for crime victims” until the conditions the administration has imposed are met.

Connecticut was recently placed on a list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ by the Trump administration, sparking a back-and-forth between attorney general Pam Bondi and Gov. Ned Lamont over what exactly that term means. Bondi has given the state until August 19 to confirm its ‘commitment’ to complying with federal immigration law and has threatened potential fines. While Bondi has not named the state’s so-called ‘sanctuary policies and practices,’ the federal government is presumably aiming at Connecticut’s Trust Act.

The law prevents state and local law enforcement from arresting someone solely because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has issued a detainer, unless that person is wanted on terrorism charges or certain class A or B felonies. The legislature voted to expand and amend the Trust Act this year. Individuals can now sue towns that cooperate with ICE, in violation of the law. It also expanded the number of alleged crimes for which state law enforcement can cooperate with ICE.

Funding for victims of crimes has already faced shortfalls in recent years as VOCA funds have declined, leading victim advocates to worry about the suspension of services that rely on those dollars. The shortfall was temporarily made up with federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars, which have since expired. In 2018, the state received $36.45 million through VOCA.

The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.

Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations — just several hundred over two years — but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.

Both agreements are based on a ""safe third country"" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.

The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.

At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.

Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.

A senior State Department official said, ""We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.""

Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.

In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.

The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.

Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a ""safe third country"" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.

Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.

In a report released last week, the State Department described ""negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,"" citing unlawful killings, ""arbitrary"" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.

Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in ""exceptional"" cases only.

Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage — like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments — to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.

Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.

""The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,"" she said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/19/1e48dec9-70c5-4356-b218-f752a3c2faf4/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ed8bce20d67aefe77916801dcf844462/gettyimages-2196376791.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 15:57:12.867493

Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions.
The court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”","After a Los Angeles federal judge rejected the Trump administration’s bid to end a 28-year-old edict governing how immigrant children are detained, attorneys stressed Tuesday that the government remains legally obligated to promptly process, transfer, and release such children as quickly as possible.

The “Flores settlement agreement” – overseen by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California – remains one of the only legal tools to prevent the prolonged incarceration of immigrant children detained at U.S. border crossings.

Despite the required protections, attorneys for detained children have presented evidence they say shows migrant children are being subjected to “prolonged detention in punitive, prison-like conditions.”

Many are confined for weeks or even months in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities – detention sites intended only for short-term processing, where conditions are wholly inappropriate and harmful for children, the attorneys argued in court papers.

“These CBP facilities are cruel, barren, and psychologically scarring to children,” Sarah Kahn, senior staff attorney with the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said in a statement Tuesday.

“No child should be in a prison for any amount of time. This order will help to shorten the imprisonment of children and move them promptly out of the worst and most traumatizing facilities.”

In her ruling issued Friday, Gee wrote that the government has failed “to identify any new facts or law that warrant the termination of the Flores Settlement Agreement at this time.”

Approved in 1997, the settlement, named for lead plaintiff Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old detainee when the class-action complaint was filed in 1985, requires that children be held in licensed, child-appropriate facilities, and released to family members or guardians as quickly as possible.

Under the terms of the settlement, Flores co-counsel are permitted to visit detention sites where children are being held and hear directly from them about their treatment and the duration of their detention.

Lawyers for the federal government had argued that the agreement is out of date and needed to be dissolved in order to reflect changes brought by the second Trump administration, including modifications to law, compliance, “facts,” shifts in policies and executive function.

During a hearing before Gee on Aug. 8, U.S. Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis told the judge that the Flores settlement was unusual in that it “dictates the operation of immigration law,” which should not be under the supervision of the court.

But Gee countered, “It does not dictate the operation of immigration law,” explaining that the agreement dictates the conditions of children in immigration custody. Moreover, Gee said, the government bound itself to the consent decree nearly 30 years ago.

Immigrant-rights groups have alleged ongoing violations of the settlement’s protections, including the long-term detention of migrant children in punitive conditions at border stations.

Arguing for the plaintiffs against the government’s motion to terminate, Carlos Holguin, an attorney at the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law, said the government wanted to terminate the settlement “so it can detain children for as long as it wishes … given this administration’s propensity for hardship on children.”

Joshua McCroskey, a Justice Department attorney, responded that “there have always been difficult cases where processing takes longer periods of time. … (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) does try to transfer minors out of its custody as quickly as possible.”

At the hearing, the court addressed conditions that directly affect children’s well-being, including freezing temperatures and lights that stay on all night.

Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions. She ordered that children be kept in safe, comfortable temperatures and that lights be dimmed or turned off at night so they can sleep.

“Every time I have visited a CBP border station, children and teenagers alike have described the constant frigid air that blows on them day and night while they sit in holding rooms they are not allowed to leave,” said Becky Wolozin, senior attorney with the National Center for Youth Law.

“One child told me he missed seeing the sun, and the only way he knew the time or day was by keeping track of a clock mounted on a guard surveillance station. The court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICE-rally-10.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 14:57:21.440090

Ice arrested the Old Orchard Beach police department reserve officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on 25 July, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the US.

An Ice representative reached by telephone told the Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’s case.

Evans’s arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and Ice. The police chief, Elise Chard, has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s E-Verify program before Evans’s employment. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of homeland security, then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the US.

The town was aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said on Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

Ice’s detainee lookup website said on Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W Wyatt detention facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

""Non-enforcement and radical immigration policies have turned the trucking industry into a lawless frontier, resulting in unqualified foreign drivers improperly acquiring licenses to operate 40-ton vehicles.""","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis blames California's immigration policies for a fatal crash involving an undocumented immigrant with a California commercial driver's license.

DeSantis criticizes Congress for not taking stronger action against sanctuary cities and states with lenient immigration laws.

The driver, Harjinder Singh, entered the U.S. illegally in 2018 and received a work permit in 2021.

Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to criticize California over an incident the previous week in which an undocumented immigrant with a California-issued commercial driver’s license made an illegal turn that resulted in the deaths of three people in St. Lucie County.

“It should’ve never have happened. He should never have been here,” DeSantis told reporters on Aug. 19 at an event in St. Cloud. “In Florida we’re not giving licenses if you’re here illegally.”

But he also slammed Congress for not doing enough to crack down on California and similar states and cities with what DeSantis sees as lax immigration policies.

He urged Washington lawmakers to withhold funding from states and cities with sanctuary policies and to change asylum laws to prevent illegal immigrants with frivolous asylum claims from getting work permits.

“Congress can remove funding for sanctuary cities, so stop subsidizing this,” DeSantis said. “You guys have the power of the purse. You can discipline these states that don’t follow the law.”

DeSantis’ comments come one week after he named Jay Collins, then a Republican state senator from Tampa, as his lieutenant governor, possibly setting him up for a run to replace him in 2026.

The only major declared GOP candidate for governor so far is U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Naples, who also has decried California’s issuing a license to the driver.

""(Three) innocent people were killed in St Lucie County because CA wrongly issued a driver’s license to an illegal alien. He shouldn’t have been here. He shouldn’t have received a license. THIS NEVER SHOULD’VE HAPPENED,"" Donalds posted on X on Aug. 18.

Law enforcement officials say the crash occurred when Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce. Singh originally came from India and entered the U.S. illegally through the Mexico border in 2018, according the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.

After being denied a work permit in 2020 under President Donald Trump’s first term administration, he was issued one in 2021 under President Joe Biden’s administration, Trump officials have said.

Driving a semi-trailer, Singh tried to use an “official use only” segment of the Turnpike to make a U-turn from the northbound outside lane, and a 2015 Chrysler minivan traveling north on the inside lane slammed into the truck, killing a 54-year-old man from Miami, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach, and a 30-year-old man from Florida City.

The Florida Highway Patrol has not released the names of the victims.

Singh has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations. Dave Kerner, executive director of the DHSMV, which oversees the FHP, said Singh, who is in custody, will be deported after the conclusion of his state charges.

The Trump administration further responded on Aug. 19, with U.S. Department of Transporation Secretary Sean Duffy saying the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will investigate the incident, including White Hawk Carriers, Inc., the trucking company that hired Singh.

""This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures,"" Duffy said in a statement.

Developing news this afternoon as the Trump administration plans to build a new immigrant detention facility in McCook and house migrants in several county jails as part of an effort to expand capacity.

The Lincoln Journal Sar reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to open a 300-bed facility near the Work Ethic Camp in Red Willow County by as early as next month.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen is expected to announce plans for the facility Tuesday, according to several sources.

The proposed detention center is part of ICE’s plan to open or expand 125 facilities this year, more than doubling its capacity from 41,000 to more than 107,000 beds across the country.

Originally opened as a minimum-security prison for low-level offenders to free up space in Nebraska’s prisons, the Work Ethic Camp has a capacity to house up to 200 inmates.

The news of an ICE facility has largely been kept under wraps in recent weeks as other states have announced plans to open their own detention centers similar to the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades.

Pillen’s office said the governor remained “staunchly committed to keeping Americans safe, our nation’s borders secure and getting criminal, illegal aliens off our streets.”

“The governor, and his administration, continues to be in communication with federal partners on how Nebraska can best assist in these efforts,” spokeswoman Laura Strimple told the Journal Star in early August. “At this time, it is premature to comment on potential detention operations.

“Gov. Pillen will make details public at the appropriate time,” Strimple added.

McCook Mayor Linda Taylor said she had not “received a whole lot of information” about the facility.

“We’re just trying to get it all figured out,” Taylor told the Journal Star on Monday.

As part of its rapid expansion of detention capacity, ICE has proposed building new tent cities, repurposing portions of military bases, and reopening dormant prisons.

The Trump administration is also seeking to partner with Republican governors and local sheriffs to free up space to house detained individuals, the Post reported.

Legal experts assert that sharing publicly observable information about law enforcement activity is generally protected speech.

Concerns were raised about potential obstruction of justice, but attorneys argued the senator's actions did not meet that threshold.

An Arizona lawmaker who shared the whereabouts of federal immigration officers on social media sparked a national debate, but First Amendment attorneys said what she did was legal.

Yes, the public has a right to post about what law enforcement is doing, said Gregg Leslie and James Weinstein, attorneys at Arizona State University's First Amendment Clinic.

""The public has a right to report on publicly observable events or data about a law enforcement's official duties,"" Weinstein said.

Where actions can become illegal, he said, is if a person starts to physically interfere or obstruct an officer from their work.

The dispute in Arizona comes after a right-wing social media account called ""Libs of TikTok"" called out state Sen. Analise Ortiz, a Democrat, for posting the location of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The account accused Ortiz of ""actively impeding and doxxing"" the agents' efforts and said she should be charged.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Ortiz was ""siding with vicious cartels,"" endangering agents and weakening national security.

""This certainly looks like obstruction of justice,"" she said.

But the notion that Ortiz's speech isn't protected or obstructs justice is just ""absolutely irresponsible and lawless,"" Weinstein told The Republic.

""I think it would be a very odd definition of interfering with law enforcement to say something (Ortiz) saw in the street that she feels is illegal activity by the government, she still has an obligation to keep quiet,"" Leslie said.

It's similar to apps that alert drivers when speeding cameras or red-light cameras are ahead, Leslie and Weinstein said.

The exceptions would be if Ortiz had physically blocked or stopped ICE agents from their duties or if she had illegally obtained the information, they said.

""If you were working as a file clerk in ICE and you saw a list where the next raids would be and you posted that, that could be a crime,"" Weinstein said.

But if Ortiz hadn't played a role in the theft and instead got the information from someone else who obtained it illegally, her speech would still be protected, Weinstein said.

The First Amendment protects the disclosure of illegally intercepted information, according to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on the 2000 case Bartnicki v. Hopper. A union negotiator and union president's phone call had been wiretapped by an unidentified source and leaked to a radio station, which aired the call. The union sued the radio station.

But the court said, ""a stranger's illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern.""

Reporting ICE agents' publicly observable duties is ""by defintion, public concern,"" Weinstein said, but without evidence or reason to think Ortiz came by the information illegally, he questioned the need for an investigation.

Nonetheless, Sen. President Warren Petersen, a Republican running for attorney general in 2026, called for a federal investigation of Ortiz. Pinal County Attorney Brad Miller, a Republican, volunteered to conduct the investigation.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes condemned Petersen and Miller, saying Ortiz's posts were protected by the First Amendment. She also suggested an investigation could run afoul of Arizona's anti-SLAPP law, meant to clamp down on strategic lawsuits against public participation.

Ortiz could assert the anti-SLAPP law as a defense if Miller were to investigate and prosecute her, Leslie said. A judge would then have to decide if Miller was trying to suppress Ortiz's protected free speech.

A federal investigation of Ortiz would be conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice or the FBI. The DOJ declined to comment when The Arizona Republic questioned whether Ortiz was under investigation, citing a policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation. The FBI had no comment when contacted by the Republic.

The Trump administration says detainees held at the site they're calling Alligator Alcatraz now will have their cases heard before immigration judges at another south Florida detention center. NPR's Greg Allen reports that immigration officials made that announcement in response to a lawsuit over the civil rights of detainees.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Lawyers who represent people held at the detention center in Florida's Everglades say they've been unable to meet with clients at the facility in a timely manner or in a confidential setting, and that outgoing calls by detainees are monitored and recorded. They say attorneys can't even confirm their clients are held at the facility because the federal immigration detainee locator website doesn't contain information about the Everglades site.

Their lawsuit said attorneys have been unable to determine which immigration court has jurisdiction over their clients' cases. But in a document filed over the weekend, the Trump administration notified the federal judge hearing the case that it has now designated the Krome Processing Center, another federal facility in south Florida, as the immigration court that will handle their cases. That answered one of the plaintiff's key demands, and U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz said it rendered the issue moot.

Judge Ruiz said he's still considering the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction to force the state and federal authorities to ensure detainees' rights to legal counsel are respected. Lawyers for Florida, which built and operates the facility, said there are now rooms at the Everglades site where attorneys can meet and talk with clients in a confidential setting. A lawyer for the state chalked up any delays immigration lawyers encountered in meeting with clients as a, quote, ""natural byproduct of the facility being stood up quickly."" ACLU attorney Eunice Cho said the court should not be satisfied with that answer.

EUNICE CHO: People are being held at Alligator Alcatraz in horrifying conditions. Their rights are being violated on a daily basis. And it is not acceptable for the government to say we're going to fix this later.

ALLEN: Yesterday's hearing followed proceedings last week in another lawsuit challenging operations at Alligator Alcatraz. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says he's expecting the judge in that case to rule that the hasty construction of the facility violated federal law.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RON DESANTIS: This is a political thing. We get that. But we also know that we're right on the law. And if we don't win with the trial judge, you know, we'll ultimately win going forward.

ALLEN: Last week, DeSantis announced Florida was opening a second detention center at a shuttered prison in north Florida.

“This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history,” the ACLU said, noting the base’s association with confining German, Italian and Japanese immigrants during World War II.
The ACLU argued the conversion of Fort Bliss exemplifies Trump’s misuse of military resources to facilitate the deportation of long-standing residents as well as newly arrived immigrants.
“President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy,” Mehta said.","WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union warned in a press release that the Trump administration will convert Fort Bliss — a military base historically tied to the mistreatment of migrant children — into one of the nation’s largest immigration detention sites, with capacity for up to 5,000 people.

Fort Bliss spans El Paso, Texas, and parts of Doña Ana and Otero counties in New Mexico. The ACLU described the plan as “the latest escalation in President Trump’s dystopian agenda to detain and deport millions of immigrants from communities nationwide.”

The organization said the detention camp will be structured as a tent facility, leaving detainees vulnerable to “extreme heat and other harsh conditions.”

Media reports have indicated that the Trump administration is prepared to spend about $1.26 billion to build the detention camp. The ACLU said Congress has also passed legislation providing $170 billion to accelerate deportations and expand detention.

“This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history,” the ACLU said, noting the base’s association with confining German, Italian and Japanese immigrants during World War II. The facility was later used from 2016 and again between 2021 and 2023 to hold unaccompanied children, many of whom suffered extreme abuse.

The ACLU argued the conversion of Fort Bliss exemplifies Trump’s misuse of military resources to facilitate the deportation of long-standing residents as well as newly arrived immigrants.

In response, Sarah Mehta, deputy director of government affairs for the ACLU, condemned the move. “President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy,” Mehta said. “Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.”

Mehta concluded, “Members of Congress must stop the use of the military — including its bases — for the Trump administration’s reckless and wasteful deportation drive.”

The Victims of Crime Act was enacted by Congress in 1984 under former President Ronald Reagan (R) and is split between two funds: victim compensation and victim assistance.
Victim assistance can be used by public agencies and community organizations to assist crime victims in a particular case, which can include emergency shelter, wrap-around services and communication to victims and witnesses when a person is released from custody.
A deadline to apply for new federal grants for states is Wednesday with awards expected to be announced by Sept. 30.","Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has joined two more multistate lawsuits against the Trump administration, one over proposed caps on administrative costs for renewable energy projects and another on restrictions for federal grants for victims of crime.

The suits, filed Friday and Monday, are the latest of dozens that have been filed by Democratic attorneys general and governors challenging executive actions by President Donald Trump (R) and proposed cuts enacted by federal agencies. In each of the latest cases, Maryland was one of 20 states and the District of Columbia to sue.

On Monday, the states filed suit against the U.S. Department of Justice for its proposal that would tie federal grants under the Victims of Crime Act to a state’s willingness to support what the states called the “administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.”

The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island asks the court to permanently stop the administration from implementing or enforcing these “illegal conditions.” In addition, the suit claims the department “literally has no power to act … unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”

“Crime victims need all the help they can get to survive traumatic, often violent experiences that can forever change their lives,” Brown said in a statement. “The administration’s unlawful attempt to withhold this critical funding undermines the ability of states to provide essential services and threatens the trust that survivors place in programs designed to help them heal and rebuild their lives.”

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for department, declined to comment Monday afternoon.

According to the suit, the department would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, about half of which would be due to the states filing suit. The federal fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.

The Victims of Crime Act was enacted by Congress in 1984 under former President Ronald Reagan (R) and is split between two funds: victim compensation and victim assistance. The compensation grant can be used for medical care, mental health counseling, funeral expenses, among other sources. Victim assistance can be used by public agencies and community organizations to assist crime victims in a particular case, which can include emergency shelter, wrap-around services and communication to victims and witnesses when a person is released from custody.

In Maryland for state fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy awarded $60.5 million in state and federal funds to 125 state, county and local offices and state and local nonprofit organizations, among others. Some of the money went to assist victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, legal assistance and other services.

A deadline to apply for new federal grants for states is Wednesday with awards expected to be announced by Sept. 30.

Attorneys general from Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, California and Illinois participated in a Zoom call with reporters Monday to discuss the lawsuit.

“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said, according to a story in the Rhode Island Current, a part of the States Newsroom network. “We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime. That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

The other jurisdictions in the lawsuit are the District of Columbia, and the states of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

Another 20 Democrat-led jurisdictions filed suit Friday in U.S. District Court in Oregon against the Department of Energy and its proposed cap on administrative and staffing costs associated with clean-energy and energy-efficiency projects.

Appeals court lifts injunction that would have blocked DOGE access to personal records

The suit said federal law has required agencies to negotiate agreements with states that set fair reimbursement rates for federally funded, state-run energy programs, including basic administrative and staffing costs needed to run these programs. It said those costs were never capped until May 8, when DOE announced that it was capping reimbursement to the states at 10% of a project’s total budget. Any balance would fall to the states.

Brown said in a prepared statement that the suit is needed to “help our State meet its commitment to advancing clean energy, reducing harmful emissions and supporting Marylanders’ efforts to make energy improvements to their homes.”

“Maryland has set ambitious climate goals that promise a cleaner, healthier, and safer future for our children – but this short-sighted federal policy would unlawfully limit our State’s ability to support projects that are crucial to meeting those goals,” his statement said.

Oregon was the lead plaintiff in the suit, which was joined by Maryland, New York, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement to the Oregon Capital Chronicle, another member of the States Newsroom network, that Oregonians “count on these programs to keep our homes energy-efficient, our air clean and our bills manageable.”

“This cap strips away the resources we need to keep that work going — and the people and expertise behind it,” Rayfield said. “We can’t meet Oregon’s energy needs if the federal government pulls critical infrastructure that supports the people and expertise behind this work midstream.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_feb10_anthonybrown-newsletter-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:40.174826

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court, seeks to release more than $1 billion approved by Congress intended to go to survivors of violent crimes like rape and domestic violence under the Victims of Crime Act, also known as VOCA.

In Washington state, more than $34 million in funding for programs and compensation for victims for fiscal year 2025 is at risk of being withheld unless the state agrees to new immigration enforcement requirements, according to a statement from Attorney General Nick Brown’s office.

“Nothing is safe from the Trump administration’s political attacks—including funds to help people at their most vulnerable, after they’ve survived a crime,” Brown said.

The lawsuit is the latest legal challenge Brown has brought against the Trump administration, as it freezes millions in federal funding, dismantles government agencies and challenges constitutional rights. The state has already filed or joined more than two dozen suits against the federal government since Trump’s return to office.

Under new conditions issued by the U.S. Department of Justice in July for VOCA funding, states and recipients under state programs will not receive funding if they impede or hinder the enforcement of federal immigration law, such as failing to give immigration officials access to facilities.

The lawsuit asks the court to stop the Trump administration from enforcing the conditions, arguing the Justice Department is overstepping its statutory authority.

“Defendants’ brazen attempt to manipulate critical funding for crime victims to strong-arm States into supporting the Administration’s immigration policies runs headlong into two basic principles of American governance: separation of powers and federalism,” the complaint stated.

The Crime Victims Fund was established through VOCA, which President Ronald Reagan signed into law in 1984. Under the federal law, states can apply for funding to pay for victim compensation programs or cover services by local organizations that provide support like housing, therapy and more to crime victims.

Washington expected to receive more than $29 million to fund such support for fiscal year 2025, which ends in September, according to the attorney general’s office. That funding would go toward emergency shelters and mental health services, as well as organizations that provide resources to victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, human trafficking and child abuse. Losing the funds would likely mean cuts to those services.

Additionally, $4.8 million in benefits slated to go directly to victims of crimes is also at risk, according to the state attorney general’s office. That funding helps victims cover out-of-pocket expenses related to crimes, such as medical bills, rape kit tests, funeral costs, grief counseling and more.

“As Attorney General, public safety is one of my top priorities, and that includes ensuring the federal government makes good on its obligations to crime victims,” Brown said in a statement.

If federal VOCA funds suddenly become unavailable, the risk to victims and survivors will be immediate, said Kate Garvey, CEO of King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, in a statement.

When a victim of crime needs help, “the last thing they need is a long wait — or worse, a closed door,” she said.

Her organization, which is in part funded with federal VOCA dollars, serves about 4,500 survivors and their families annually, providing legal advocacy, counseling services and more.

“It can be a matter of life and death to a domestic violence survivor trying to exit abuse,” she said. “It might be the last time a survivor of sexual assault tries to get help if the message is ‘take a number, we’ll get back to you.’ ”

Not only are the immigration-related requirements not specified in the Victims of Crime Act, the lawsuit argues, but also they would undermine public safety efforts by creating a chilling effect among victims and witnesses who fear reporting crimes because of the possibility of deportation.

In some cases, victims of crimes eligible to receive assistance may be undocumented themselves, or have family members who are. King County Sexual Assault Resource Center, like most organizations assisting crime victims, does not track the immigration status of their clients.

“The last thing we need in terms of family stability, community well-being and public safety is for sexual assault survivors to fear the consequences of speaking out, Garvey said.

The lawsuit argues the immigration-related conditions force states into an “untenable position”: forfeit access to critical funds to support crime victims, or allow local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration officials and break the community trust needed to prevent and respond to crimes.

Washington passed the Keep Washington Working Act in 2019, which limits the ability of local law enforcement agencies to help federal officials arrest or deport undocumented immigrants. The law came under fire from members of Congress earlier this year.

Gov. Bob Ferguson has defended the state’s immigration policy in recent days amid threats of federal crackdowns on so-called sanctuary jurisdictions.

Those include permanent bars to good moral character — like murder, aggravated felonies and genocide — and other offenses, like gambling and drug-related violations.

The big picture: The Friday USCIS memo calls for a more ""holistic"" approach to assessing the ""good moral character"" of an immigrant seeking naturalization under an administration that has cracked down on immigration and pathways to citizenship in unprecedented ways.

Driving the news: Good moral character is not a new requirement for naturalization. But under the USCIS memo, officers are instructed to put ""greater emphasis"" on an applicants' ""positive attributes and contributions.""

Those can include factors like community involvement, family caregiving and educational attainment.

""Going forward, USCIS officers must account for an alien's positive attributes and not simply the absence of misconduct,"" the memo states.

Zoom out: It also calls for heightened scrutiny of disqualifying behaviors.

Those include permanent bars to good moral character — like murder, aggravated felonies and genocide — and other offenses, like gambling and drug-related violations.

But the memo also stipulates that other disqualifying actions could include behavior that is technically lawful but is ""inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community,"" like habitual traffic infractions or solicitation.

The policy also instructs officers to consider factors that show an applicant could have demonstrated ""genuine rehabilitation,"" through actions like rectifying overdue child support or past-due taxes.

Context: The test of ""good moral character"" has in the past largely been satisfied if applicants don't have any of the disqualifying or criminal offenses detailed in U.S. immigration law, per CBS News.

But the memo says ""[e]valuating GMC involves more than a cursory mechanical review focused on the absence of wrongdoing.""

It continues, ""It entails a holistic assessment of an alien's behavior, adherence to societal norms, and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.""

What they're saying: USCIS Spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a statement provided to Axios that the agency is restoring ""integrity"" in the immigration system.

""Today, USCIS is adding a new element to the naturalization process that ensures America's newest citizens not only embrace America's culture, history, and language but who also demonstrate Good Moral Character,"" he said.

Catch up quick: The Trump administration has launched a sweeping spectacle cracking down on illegal immigration, but it's also significantly curtailed avenues to being in the country legally by terminating past legal protections and targeting refugee admissions.

That effort has also included heightened scrutiny of legal immigrants and those who want to study in the U.S.

Under an April policy, USCIS officials screen immigrants' social media accounts for ""antisemitic activity,"" which includes content that indicates an applicant ""endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity.""

Immigrants contribute a lot to West Virginia.
Immigrants are not causing problems in West Virginia.
Maybe it’s time Morrisey remembered that West Virginia was settled by immigrants and be grateful they still want to live here.","Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that West Virginia is now participating in Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which will allow the National Guard and local police to enforce certain immigration laws.

Fox News called this one of the most “wide-ranging agreements” a state has forged with ICE under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 after a Department of Justice investigation found widespread racial profiling and other discrimination against Latinos by an Arizona task force, Stateline reported.

Although West Virginia is nearly 1,500 miles away from the U.S. southern border, Morrisey said during a press conference that the state has “effectively become a border state.” He also blamed the people entering the country illegally for “unlimited amounts of fentanyl flooding into our state.”

The majority of fentanyl is smuggled into the country by people who can enter the U.S. legally, according to the American Immigration Council.

Fewer than half of people arrested by ICE since Trump took office are actually convicted criminals and only 5% were arrested for drug crimes nationally. So either ICE is doing a terrible job, or immigrants aren’t the problem.

The Deportation Data Project reported earlier this month that 1 in 5 ICE arrests are of Latinos with no criminal past or removal order. A substantial portion of ICE arrests this year were a result of illegal profiling. Basically, people are being arrested for having brown skin.

If your argument for ICE is that people should enter the country legally, then shouldn’t ICE be only using legal methods to arrest people?

The legal route for ICE to make an arrest would be if a suspect was arrested first by local police and found to be in the country illegally. Raiding Japanese and Mexican restaurants or hanging out at Home Depot and Lowes is not the legal way.

In July, a court in California ordered ICE to stop using these methods to arrest people in the Los Angeles area, and an appeals court upheld that order. Since then, street arrests went down by 83%.

ICE’s illegal profiling has also resulted in numerous U.S. citizens and legal immigrants being arrested.

Morrisey’s move will result in your friends, neighbors and co-workers being profiled and arrested for not passing as white. In Alabama, a man was tackled at his worksite and ICE officers said his REAL ID was fake. It wasn’t. A man in California was detained for three days, despite being a legal citizen. A woman in Los Angeles was grabbed by ICE agents moments after her family dropped her off for work — witnesses said they never even asked to see her ID.

West Virginia has a small number of immigrants — only about 2% of the population, but they also account for 18% of employees in farming, fishing and forestry occupations, and 11% in science occupations, such as microbiologists, biochemists and epidemiologists.

Immigrants contribute a lot to West Virginia. In 2023, they paid $450.3 million in taxes. And thanks to immigrants, our population loss was less severe than it would have been without them.

As of 2018, about 52% of immigrants in the Mountain State had gone through the long process to become legal U.S. citizens. And about 42% of adult immigrants had a college degree or higher that same year — compared to 19.6% of West Virginians.

There are many reasons people choose to migrate to the United States without going through the proper channels — crime, violence, war or simply to build a better life — but our immigration policy has made it harder and harder for people to immigrate here legally.

Immigrants aren’t the enemy that Trump’s administration is trying to paint them to be. Immigrants are not causing problems in West Virginia. Maybe it’s time Morrisey remembered that West Virginia was settled by immigrants and be grateful they still want to live here.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/end-ice-collab.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 15:57:48.349820

Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents the El Paso area, visited the site Monday for nearly 2½ hours and said migrants began being detained at the facility as early as Aug. 1 and that it now houses nearly 1,000 people. She said she is pushing federal officials to allow local officials, faith leaders and media to conduct oversight visits to the camp and observe the conditions, expressing concerns the “massive” facility is understaffed and improperly equipped to humanely house the detained migrants.

She said at a news conference that she was unable to speak to detainees but saw elderly men detained at the facility and added that, while it was just housing men for now, there are plans to hold women and potentially women with children in the future.

“We will finish construction for up to 5,000 beds in the weeks and months ahead,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said earlier this month. “Upon completion, this will be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission — the deportation of illegal aliens.""

The presently 1,000-bed tent camp officially began operations Sunday with temperatures in the mid-90s and just days after the region saw readings as high as 105 degrees. Democrats and civil rights groups are raising the alarm about the human rights conditions and lack of transparency. El Paso County Commissioner David Stout described it as a “concentration camp for migrants.”

“I have very, very many doubts about how people are going to be treated in these facilities,” Stout, a former television reporter for Telemundo and Univision, told NewsNation earlier this month. “I think we are going down the road to becoming a fascist country. I think it’s a very slippery slope, and the actions that are taking place at this point in time are comparable to [Nazi Germany].”

The American Civil Liberties Union noted that Fort Bliss housed an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II, imprisoned thousands of Mexican refugees fleeing war earlier in the century and was the site where imprisoned migrant children were separated from their parents during President Donald Trump’s first term and into President Joe Biden’s time in office. A Department of Health and Human Services inspector general’s report published in 2022 found the conditions at Fort Bliss “caused children to experience distress, anxiety, and in some cases, panic attacks” and documented cases of self-harm by children.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn said after visiting the facility last week that he was told by federal officials that “no families and no children” would be imprisoned at the camp, “just single adults.”

“We're not talking about gardeners, housekeepers or people like that,” Cornyn said. “We're talking about as many as … 291,000 individuals who are called criminal aliens, who are people either with criminal charges pending or criminal convictions, and who have exhausted all of their legal remedies.

“In other words, there's no due process issue involved here,” said Cornyn, a Republican with the backing of Senate leadership, but who faces a formidable primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

Escobar disputed Cornyn's characterization, saying that “there are folks inside the facility who have recently been apprehended, maybe even here at the border, or apprehended as far away as Miami or as far away as LA in enforcement operations that ICE is conducting inside the U.S.”

The U.S. Army bills Fort Bliss as a military installation that “proudly offers the highest standards of living within the Department of Defense” for soldiers and their families. According to the Army, about 70,000 soldiers and their family members live on the base, which is larger than the state of Rhode Island.

Federal officials, the Pentagon and Republicans touted the new detention camp as vital to Trump’s goal of rounding up and deporting millions of migrants, framing the vast majority of those imprisoned and deported as dangerous and criminals, though federal data released publicly shows the vast majority have no criminal conviction and only about 12% of those deported between January and May were convicted of violent crimes or crimes that could be considered potentially violent, according to the Marshall Project.

Trump’s signature taxes and spending legislation signed into law in July and nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill” included $45 billion for immigrant detention facilities and more than $170 billion total for immigration and border enforcement. Bloomberg and Military.com reported the Fort Bliss facility will cost at least $1.26 billion to construct.

The new camp is already under investigation by an independent government watchdog for the process its contracts were awarded to private companies, the Army confirmed to NBC News. And a 38-year-old worker, Hector Gonzalez, employed by a subcontractor on the project died in a workplace accident in July, the company Disaster Management Group said. The Army is investigating the circumstances.

The camp, officially known as Camp East Montana and dubbed “Lone Star Lockup” by Cornyn, has drawn comparisons to the similarly outrage-inducing “Alligator Alcatraz” tent camp in Florida where the ACLU, detainees and detainees' lawyers have reported abuse, unsanitary and unsafe conditions, and unconstitutional restrictions of migrants’ legal rights — claims the Department of Homeland Security has denied.

During his visit to Fort Bliss last week, Cornyn did not actually go inside the tent camp — “We saw it from a distance” — but assured the public, “These are humane, safe facilities, and in many instances, a vast improvement over what many of these folks are used to.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/US_Deportation_Flights_AP,N,,2025-08-19 12:58:25.148399

The White House is reportedly preparing to cap the U.S. refugee admissions at 40,000 for fiscal year 2026, with a striking three‑quarters of these slots—approximately 30,000 places—earmarked specifically for white South Africans, particularly Afrikaners. This represents not only a sharp reduction from the 100,000 refugees admitted under the Biden administration in fiscal year 2024 but also a notable increase from the Trump-era cap of 15,000 in 2021.

This figure stems from internal discussions, including an email from Angie Salazar, the senior refugee program official at the Department of Health and Human Services, which outlined the allocation during internal coordination efforts. However, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly cautioned that no decisions are final and that any refugee cap—including this proposed figure—is speculative until confirmed before the fiscal year begins on October 1.

The policy would mark a dramatic exception in U.S. refugee policy: while most refugee admissions remain frozen or sharply cut, this plan would fast‑track cases for a single demographic group—white South Africans. Earlier this year, a similar directive resulted in the first group of approximately 49–59 Afrikaner individuals arriving as refugees in the U.S., a move facilitated via an executive order that invoked claims of racial persecution and land confiscation as justification.

This planned allocation has stirred considerable backlash. In a June poll by Yahoo News/YouGov, while 61% of Americans supported accepting refugees generally, only 36% supported giving special priority to Afrikaners. Opposition rose sharply (52%) when this group was fast‑tracked ahead of others included in the broader refugee process.

The Episcopal Church, speaking out strongly against the policy, announced its withdrawal from the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, stating the Trump administration’s preferential treatment of white South Africans contradicted its commitment to racial justice. At the same time, the U.N. stated that no South Africans met international refugee criteria last year. Meanwhile, South Africa has rejected claims of targeted persecution, with President Cyril Ramaphosa denouncing the underlying premise as factually baseless and politically motivated.

The focus on Afrikaners coincides with intensified U.S. criticism of human rights practices in South Africa. Drafts of the State Department’s annual human rights reports, reviewed by The Washington Post, signal a shift—highlighting alleged ‘genocide’ and persecution of Afrikaners while omitting or downplaying issues in other countries. Critics—ranging from human rights advocates to foreign leaders—have condemned this move as politicized and aimed at reshaping global narratives.

As the federal government evaluates refugee allocations ahead of the new fiscal year, the proposed plan to prioritize white South Africans looms as one of most contentious immigration policy shifts of the Trump administration so far. With global refugee crises ongoing and calls for humanitarian consistency mounting, officials face mounting pressure to justify such a targeted approach—both within domestic politics and on the international stage.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation.
But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies.
The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

Council member Brianne Nadeau wants people living and visiting her diverse community to be aware of their legal rights if they’re stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or other federal law agencies during the recent surge.

In a Monday virtual town hall, Nadeau, who represents Ward 1, said she wanted to provide some answers and conversation about the recent federal actions by the Trump administration, after the president announced he was invoking section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which Mayor Muriel Bowser characterizes as a surge in federal law enforcement.

The virtual meeting included guidance from Emily Cassometus, an assistant professor of law and director of legislation clinics at the University of the District of Columbia’s School of Law.

While not providing legal advice, she provided general guidance on a person’s rights if a federal law enforcer knocked on their door or stopped them in a public area.

If a person is at home, “The first thing we need to do is ask them, ‘Do you have a warrant?’ If they don’t have a warrant, you do not have to open the door, and you do not have to let anyone in,” said Cassometus.

If the officer says they have a warrant, “You should ask them to slide it under the door and check the details on the warrant.” Cassometus said a legal warrant should be specific to the address, and include “either the things or the people that the warrant is for, and it should be signed by a judge.”

If the warrant has that specificity, Cassometus said you should open the door, “or they’ll let themselves in.”

What about in a public area?

If stopped in a public area, Cassometus said a person should ask if they are free to go.

“If you’re stopped in a car, on a bus, on the sidewalk, ask the officer, ‘Am I free to go?’ If they say yes, leave. Don’t stick around to ask more questions. Just leave. Leave calmly, but please leave.”

If the answer is no, Cassometus said a person should say “I do not consent to a search.”

And, finally, “The third phrase is ‘Am I under arrest?'” If the answer is yes, a person should expect to be handcuffed and taken into custody.

If the answer is no, “Say ‘Am I free to go?’, and leave as quickly as possible,” said Cassometus.

Cassometus said to protect your rights, “You need to be very specific: I want to speak to a lawyer.”

And if you choose to remain silent, “you must actually remain silent. You cannot talk to anyone about anything, or they will use that as an excuse to ask questions.”

What bystanders can do

Cassometus, Nadeau and Samantha Davis with the Free DC group, which supports Home Rule, said concerned bystanders should witness and document when someone is being taken into custody.

“You, as a bystander, can ask to see that warrant, too,” said Nadeau. “And you can videotape, and you can ask questions, and you can ask the names of the officers, and you can ask for the names of the people who are being taken, so that we can all assist, further.”

After videotaping a person being taken into custody, Cassometus suggests sharing the video with a legal aid group, who can help protect the person’s rights.

Products like steel, copper, lithium, caustic soda and red dates coming from China are now designated ""high priority"" for inspection and will come under the microscope by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in line with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

Caustic soda, or sodium hydroxide, is an industrial chemical used in everything from aluminum production, paper-making, textiles and soap to petroleum refining. Red dates, a fruit grown in China, are often dried and used in teas and snacks.

""The use of slave labor is repulsive, and we will hold Chinese companies accountable for abuses and eliminate threats its forced labor practices pose to our prosperity,"" Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

CUSTOMS BUSTS $400M TRADE DUTY-EVASION RING INVOLVING CHINA AND OTHERS

As of Aug. 1, CBP has stopped 16,700 shipments, worth around $3.7 billion, for further examination under the UFLPA Congress passed in 2022. Of those, around 10,000 shipments worth almost $900 million have been turned away.

Some 144 entities are listed on an entity list under the UFLPA as using slave labor in their supply chains, in sectors like agriculture, batteries, electronics, food additives, metals, plastics and textiles.

President Donald Trump has already placed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, arguing that foreign nations were flooding the U.S. market with cheap, subsidized products and jeopardizing national security by making the U.S. reliant on foreign sources for such products.

Congress passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) in 2022 with broad bipartisan support, targeting goods made wholly or in part with forced labor from China’s Xinjiang region.

CHINA APPEARS TO BE BUILDING 'LEVERAGE' TO USE AGAINST FOREIGN ENTITIES

The law operates on a ""rebuttable presumption,"" meaning that any product connected to Xinjiang or listed entities is assumed to involve forced labor unless companies can prove otherwise. Rights groups and U.S. officials say the Chinese government has detained more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in camps, where many are subjected to indoctrination, surveillance and forced labor. Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them fabrications designed to contain China’s rise.

Initially focused on apparel, cotton, tomatoes and polysilicon used in solar panels, enforcement under UFLPA has steadily widened. DHS and CBP have been expanding the scope of ""high-priority sectors"" subject to strict scrutiny as evidence mounts of forced labor practices in a broader range of supply chains.

Harjinder Singh crossed the southern border into California in September 2018 and was processed for fast-track deportation by the first Trump administration, sources told The Post.

The Indian national was previously processed for deportation, but was able to stay after claiming he feared being sent back home. Singh was later released on a $5,000 immigration bond in January 2019 and still awaits a decision on his asylum case.

After receiving his work permit in June 2021, Singh was able to secure a Commercial Driver’s License in California, according to DHS.

On Monday, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin hit back at an X post from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office after it accused the Trump administration of issuing the work permit and either “lying” or acting “clueless” about it.

“False. Harjinder Singh is in the United States illegally and his work authorization was rejected under the Trump Administration on September 14, 2020. It was later approved under the Biden Administration June 9, 2021,” said McLaughlin.

“The state of California issues Commercial Drivers Licenses. There is no national CDL. Sincerely, Genius,” she concluded.

US Marshals in California nabbed Singh on Saturday on a warrant for three counts of vehicular homicide in connection with the deadly crash in Florida at around 3 p.m. last Thursday.

Singh allegedly made a hard left turn while driving a tractor-trailer on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce and attempted to cross the median through an “Official Use Only” pass, authorities said.

The trailer blocked all lanes of oncoming traffic when a minivan slammed into it at full speed. The victims’ vehicle became wedged underneath the trailer, killing a 37-year-old Pompano Beach woman, a 30-year-old Florida City man and a 54-year-old Miami man, Treasure Coast Newspapers reported.

The two passengers died at the scene, and the driver was transported to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced deceased.

Neither Singh nor his passenger was injured, the Florida Highway Patrol said.

Shocking video taken inside the truck cab showed Singh seemingly unfazed at the moment of the crash as he calmly put the vehicle into park and turned off the engine.

Shortly after the immigration white paper was published, two petitions against the doubling of the settlement period from five to ten years in two specific routes hit the 100,000 threshold required for the government to consider holding a debate on the issue. Keeping the five year route to settlement in the skilled worker and Hong Kong BN(O) routes will be the subject of a Westminster Hall debate on 8 September 2025. The House of Commons library have published a briefing ahead of the debate.

I mentioned this in the newsletter earlier this year, but the US State Department has published its “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices” and these are no longer reliable, which means that extreme caution should be exercised when relying on them. In light of these extremely serious concerns, it will be important to monitor whether or not the Home Office continues to reference the reports in its country policy and information notes. If they do, this will need to be checked and challenged where appropriate.

The Unity Project has published its latest analysis of the Home Office data on change of conditions applications submitted by people who need to have the no recourse to public funds restriction lifted from their grant of leave. There has been a significant increase in Home Office decision making, leading to a decrease in the backlog of applications, however success rates have dropped significantly. On the same topic, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has recently published a report looking at the dire situation and hardship experienced by families who are subject to the condition.

On Free Movement, today Niamh Fegan takes a look at some common issues that arise with bail conditions. Last week I updated our briefing on the inadmissibility process in asylum applications, given it is once again relevant in light of the new UK/France returns agreement.

There were several cases covered on the blog, including an appeal against an Immigration Advice Authority decision, an Afghan driver who unsuccessfully challenged the refusal of his resettlement application, and a successful procedural fairness challenge in a Hong Kong application. If you work on trafficking cases where a public order disqualification is threatened, then this post and the associated case are both useful.

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz issued the decision late Monday, writing in a 47-page ruling that claims the detainees at the facility don’t have confidential access to their lawyers or to hearings in immigration court were rendered moot when the Trump administration recently designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for their cases to be heard.

The judge heard arguments from both sides in a hearing earlier Monday in Miami. Civil rights civil rights attorneys were seeking a preliminary injunction to ensure detainees at the facility have access to their lawyers and can get a hearing.

The state and federal government had argued that even though the isolated airstrip where the facility is located is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida’s southern district was the wrong venue since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state’s middle district.

Judge Ruiz had hinted during a hearing last week that he had some concerns over which jurisdiction was appropriate.

The state and federal government defendants made an identical argument last week about jurisdiction for a second lawsuit in which environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued to stop further construction and operations at the Everglades detention center until it’s in compliance with federal environmental laws.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in Miami on Aug. 7 ordered a 14-day halt on additional construction at the site while witnesses testified at a hearing that wrapped up last week. She has said she plans to issue a ruling before the order expires later this week. She had yet to rule on the venue question.

While federally driven, these policies – if they discourage tax filing, reduce federal financial support, and remove economic contributors from communities – could strain the finances of many states and localities.

Discouraging tax filing

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (PL 119-21) limits tax benefits for families with mixed immigration status – where some members are US citizens and others are not – as well as families with all undocumented members. For example, the child tax credit (CTC) will now require both the qualifying child and at least one parent to have Social Security Numbers (SSNs), which undocumented immigrants cannot obtain.

Contrary to some perceptions, an estimated 5.4 million undocumented immigrants pay taxes using individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). But if their households lose eligibility for key tax benefits, they may become less likely to file. This will impact US citizens too: an estimated 2.7 million US citizen children live in single- or two-parent households where the parents are undocumented.

Additionally, the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has asked the Treasury Department to deputize special agents in the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) division to help DHS with deportations. And, in April, the IRS and DHS reached a memorandum of understanding that allows the IRS to provide taxpayer information to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Several high-ranking IRS officials have resigned or been placed on leave over their objections to the data sharing. As of August 12th, court filings confirm that the IRS has responded to requests for tax filers' information.

Taken together, the loss of federal tax benefits and fear of being targeted or deported may reduce tax filing by undocumented immigrants and mixed-status families. One independent estimate suggests that the IRS information-sharing alone could cost the federal government $147 to $479 billion over the next 10 years.

At the state and local level, the net fiscal impacts are more complex because there are key considerations of how the costs of public goods are allocated and what time periods or generations to consider. However, many estimates suggest that in the long term, immigrants overall pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits compared with native-born Americans.

Reducing federal financial support

President Trump signed two executive orders in January and April to withhold federal money from “sanctuary” cities, counties, and states, which broadly refer to those that may limit immediate cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Federal grants comprise a significant share of state and local revenues, and billions of dollars are at stake in federal funding allocated for states and localities across the country.

The courts are currently debating the legality of these orders. In further attempts to pressure those jurisdictions, the federal government is suing many, with ongoing cases in California, Chicago, Denver, the state of Colorado, Rochester, New York, and others.

Removing economic contributors from communities

Immigration helps national and local economies in myriad ways. As of 2022, there were 8.3 million undocumented immigrants working in the US, with large shares in construction (1.5 million), restaurants (1 million), agriculture and farms (320,000), landscaping (300,000), and food processing and manufacturing (200,000).

If undocumented immigrants find it challenging to continue working their jobs (due to employers’ reluctance in hiring them or out of fear of being deported while at their jobs, for example), or if they feel compelled to shift to informal labor markets, those industries would be especially vulnerable. President Trump implied as much when he announced an exemption for farms and hotels from immigration raids, though the Administration reversed course shortly after.

Recent evidence suggests a large reduction in undocumented immigrants’ labor could also lead to job losses and worse working conditions for US-born employees, especially in fields like construction or child care. Jobs held by immigrant workers and US-born workers tend to be complementary: for example, with fewer immigrant roofers available, there will be fewer jobs available for US-born electricians and plumbers.

Immigrants contribute to their communities through deep social ties as well. As immigration enforcement efforts ramp up, local communities across the US have been reckoning with both the economic consequences and the community impacts.

What this could mean for state and local governments

Altogether, if enforced to the fullest extent, federal immigration actions may push out many undocumented immigrants as well as an estimated 4.7 million mixed-status families with US citizens, and those who remain may find it challenging to file their federal or state-level tax returns or be forced to find informal employment and housing.

There are some early warning signs. Worries about detention and deportation have risen sharply among all immigrants, including lawfully present immigrants and naturalized citizens. This stress is taking a toll on their health; they are withdrawing from day-to-day activities like driving to work or seeking medical care. Delayed care could put stress on hospitals, with long-term financial impacts for states and localities.",https://taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_768x256/public/2025-08/getty-images-CDpgDB2YfbA-unsplash.jpeg?h=0047ab37&itok=H5b6VLse,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:53.829771

That was enough for “@LibsofTikTok” to proclaim Sunday that ICE had referred Paris for prosecution.
Paris did not identify any locations where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were gathered, instead sharing unverified reports that ICE agents were active in his House district.
“People forget that public officials are human beings.” Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.","The timing and reach of a social media post accusing a Connecticut state lawmaker of impeding federal immigration agents are drawing the FBI, state police and Capitol police to assess the threat posed by the resulting deluge of abuse.

It is the latest and highest-profile example of what House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford says is is an all-too-common drill: divining the differences between political speech, harassment and credible criminal threats.

“That line can be very small and thin at times,” said Ritter, who estimates that half of all lawmakers will need threat assessments in any given two-year term. “We have a protocol in place.”

The shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14 had lawmakers on edge long before “@LibsofTikTok,” a right-wing poster with 4.3 million followers on X, urged federal charges against Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.

Three days ago, it accused him of divulging, in an Instagram post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ “live location and warning illegals to stay ‘vigilant.’ He’s helping illegals evade arrest and impeding ICE. Charge him.”

It was reposted a day later by the official ICE account, tagging the Justice Department account. That was enough for “@LibsofTikTok” to proclaim Sunday that ICE had referred Paris for prosecution.

Paris did not identify any locations where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were gathered, instead sharing unverified reports that ICE agents were active in his House district.

“While we are still working to verify the full scope of these reports, I urge all residents to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety,” Paris wrote in his post.

The @LibsofTikTok critique was viewed 970,000 times, a number amplified by other reposts. The reaction over the weekend was furious and abusive, much of it racist, friends said.

Paris is Black.

“I think the dehumanization of public officials is horrifying — and coming out of what happened in Minnesota is particularly concerning,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.

Candelora returned Monday morning on a red-eye flight from Los Angeles, where he was attending a small bipartisan legislative conference. One of the attendees was a friend of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic legislative leader killed in Minnesota. Her husband also was killed, and a second lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded in a separate attack the same night.

“Her life is changed forever. I’ve gone to several conferences with her,” Candelora said. “People forget that public officials are human beings.”

Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.

Candelora said even before the incident with Paris that state legislators in Connecticut were removing legislative plates from their motor vehicles because they feared being identified.

One anonymous caller to Paris’ cell phone said his life and family connections were known and being distributed widely, a chilling claim, said other lawmakers.

The call was recorded by Paris’s fiancée. They were together in his car when his phone rang, and she answered. She used her phone to record it. A copy was provided to the Connecticut Mirror.

“You’re messing with someone that was a subcontractor for the NSA, you stupid [expletive] idiot,” the caller said. “This content is being replicated and duplicated all across Christian networks, all across Trump supporters, MAGA supporters and right wing newspapers.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Christine Bartlett-Josie, a political consultant and family friend of Paris, said the FBI has a copy of the recorded call and is investigating, as are the Capitol and state police.

“It is unfortunate and alarming to be wrongfully targeted by a federal agency and even called for arrest by the DOJ,” Paris said in a statement released by the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. “However, my commitment to compassion, courage, and community — and my refusal to be silenced when the safety of my neighbors is at stake — will never be shaken.”

Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said angry calls and emails come with the job, but what Paris is experiencing is of another scale — as is the role of a federal law enforcement agency in fueling the abuse.

“The federal government should be a place that you go to protect yourself when you’re facing these attacks, not a place that amplifies them and calls people against you,” he said.

Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, a Black and Puerto Rican Caucus member who is accustomed to online abuse as the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over hot-button issues such as gun control, said it has become unwise to dismiss harassment as merely offensive words.

Winfield spent time with Paris, reviewing the threats.

“Some of these folks seem unhinged,” Winfield said. “It’s been a crazy day and a half.”

Like the anonymous caller, many made clear they know where to find Paris and people in his immediate circle.

“There may not be a direct threat, but there is an implied threat,” Winfield said.

Candelora, the Republican leader, agreed.

“That is the danger of social media. It brings everyone into your living room,” he said. “You don’t know.”

Candelora said the accused shooter in Minnesota did not have any direct contact with his victim.

“It was random,” he said. “It was evil.”

While the focus of Monday's discussion was on halting illegal entry of immigrants, several speakers acknowledged the role immigrants play in supplying the U.S. workforce.
""Calling people illegal and referring to people as illegal is very demeaning,"" he said.","LAYTON — A contingent of Republican leaders from Utah gathered Monday to parse the complex immigration issue, recognizing the varied problems that come from illegal immigration and lauding President Donald Trump's focus on the topic.

Still, a comprehensive solution may not be in the offing anytime soon.

Jamie Renda, of Path Forward Utah, said resolving the issue can't be solely the duty of elected lawmakers, which spurred her efforts to organize the event. Monday's forum is the first of three for her Ogden-based organization, which promotes conservative voices and viewpoints within minority communities, plans to foster debate on the topic. ""We need to take ownership of helping our neighbors find those solutions and have the difficult conversations to move forward,"" said Renda.

Potential fixes to tackle the immigration issue, she said, will be the focus of future forums, though Monday's participants — who included U.S. Rep. Mike Kennedy and Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz — broached possibilities, notably the need for federal officials to take action.

Kennedy, a Republican and Utah's 3rd District congressman, said there's no lack of ideas to help resolve the immigration issue, long a focus of debate among U.S. lawmakers, just a lack of political will. He also pointed to insufficient efforts by some immigrants to remedy their situations.

There are plenty of potential solutions to allow ""contributing"" immigrants to ""come out of the shadows,"" he said. ""But I need Democrats and Republican colleagues to help me with that. And at this point, it still continues to be a political football with unwilling participants on both sides to actually do something about this.""

Meantime, he voiced support for increased moves under the Trump administration to detain and deport immigrants here illegally, particularly those with criminal backgrounds. Asked about detention and deportation of immigrants here illegally who otherwise abide by the law — which has prompted an outcry from some critics — he said the onus is on them to seek a means to remain legally.

""I know we all benefit from a lot of these people, but the reality is they've had sometimes years, if not decades, to go through some legal process and at least try,"" said Kennedy, a Republican who represents Utah's 3rd District. If an immigrant has lived here for many years ""and never done anything to formalize your status, it's final exam time, and you may find yourself being deported.""

Schultz, a Republican from Hooper, favors moves to improve the immigration system but pointed to federal lawmakers as the sticking point.

""If you want to come to the United States of America and you're willing to work, you're willing to put forth the effort, then there needs to be a pathway,"" Schultz said. ""For whatever reason, Congress has not come together and created a pathway to citizenship, and so what you're having is the cartels step forward, find ways to sneak people across the border.""

U.S. Rep. Blake Moore, who also took part, made the case for passage of House Resolution 2 as proposed in 2023 to address the immigration issue. Even if some elements would potentially have to be removed to get enough votes for passage, it would be a start. The multipronged proposal, sponsored by Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, addresses border security, hiring of immigrants and more.

""I'll take whatever percentage of HR2 that I can get done, and we'll keep working on the rest,"" Moore said.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political group, helped sponsor the event, and Kevin Greene, director of the group's Utah chapter, said moves by the Trump administration to secure the border allow for forward movement on the issue. The forum, also co-hosted by Weber State University's Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics and Public Service, was held at the college's campus in Layton.

With the strides under Trump in halting illegal crossings into the country via the U.S.-Mexico border, ""we can have a conversation on what we do to fix the system as is,"" Greene said. ""How do we make it so people who want to come here can come here legally, not wait 10, 15, 20, 30 years?""

Heightened efforts under Trump to detain and deport immigrants here illegally — a point of public debate nationwide — was a central talking point as well, with broad support from many of those on hand for the president's efforts. Numerous Republican members of the Utah Legislature attended, as well as some local elected officials and others.

""The border is secure,"" Kennedy said, referencing increased border enforcement and other actions by Trump. ""The next step is legal immigration.""

Renda noted the complexity of the issue, underscored by the need of some labor sectors for immigrant labor, and also stressed the need ""to take race out of this conversation."" While critics may rail against the ongoing immigration crackdown as ""racist"" given the ethnicity of many facing deportation, she said about three-quarters of immigrants in the country illegally are Latinos and called for understanding of ""the dynamics of who's here.""

While the focus of Monday's discussion was on halting illegal entry of immigrants, several speakers acknowledged the role immigrants play in supplying the U.S. workforce. Luis Lopez, for one, a former member of the Ogden City Council and founder of the Ogden branch of Latinos United Promoting Education and Civic Engagement, a Latino advocacy group, said the ""vast majority"" of immigrants in the country are ""good, hardworking people.""

Himself a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Mexico, Lopez, a member of the audience, said he favors efforts to remove criminal immigrants in the country illegally, but bristles at the use of the word ""illegals"" as an all-encompassing word for immigrants.

The roughly 141,000 international students in California spent $6.4 billion in 2023, supporting 55,000 jobs, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators.","The first time I got on a plane was for a flight from Delhi, India to JFK Airport in New York. I came to the United States as a student, first to the University of Illinois, and after earning my master’s degree, to California, where I’ve lived ever since. I’ve built businesses, hired people and created a life here.

My story is the story of countless others who came to America to study, work and build. My roommate in graduate school, Arvind Krishna, is now the CEO of IBM. Millions of others have come to California and gone on to create lives and opportunities.

To be sure, international students aren’t the only — or biggest — immigrant community. Earlier this summer, I attended my niece’s graduation from UC San Diego and visited Chicano Park, where large murals adorn an outdoor cathedral to community activism, celebrating millions of immigrants whose labor and creativity built California.

That’s what makes today’s news so hard to watch. As the founder of a college counseling service, I have a front-row seat to a wave of recent federal policies reshaping education.

Recently the Supreme Court let the U.S Department of Education lay off thousands of employees, causing delays in processing financial aid, slowing civil rights investigations and presenting challenges for communities.

That’s just the latest blow. There have been cuts to research funding, a wave of new visa hurdles and efforts to dismantle diversity and inclusion initiatives that help underrepresented students. And, of course, recent ICE raids have disrupted long-settled immigrant communities in cities like Los Angeles.

I’ve seen the ripple effects in my work. Some international students are afraid to apply to college, afraid to leave for a distant campus or afraid to come to the U.S. at all.

Many of the students I counsel are immigrants or the children of immigrants. One college-bound student’s mother is from Vietnam and worked in a nail salon in Oakland. The student, while still in high school, handled the family’s taxes, filled out forms and held down a job.

She also earned a full scholarship. After she finishes her education, I’m confident she’ll make a remarkable contribution to the world.

One student, whose parents emigrated from India, went to UC Berkeley on a scholarship after developing an app to detect “forever chemicals” in their community’s water supply. Another student, whose parents came from Mexico to build a life in Southern California, is now in a nursing program at Cal State Fullerton.

There are thousands of these stories across the state. Each young person holds the potential to shape our future, to become the next great leader, innovator or healer.

International students not only bring skill and ambition — they bring real dollars to California.

The roughly 141,000 international students in California spent $6.4 billion in 2023, supporting 55,000 jobs, according to the NAFSA Association of International Educators. At public universities like UC and CSU, these students’ higher tuition helps fund financial aid and services for residents.

More broadly, immigrant households contribute $715 billion, or about a third of the state’s gross domestic product. Undocumented Californians alone pay about $8.5 billion a year in state and local taxes.

Much of the commentary about recent policy changes rightly focuses on the cruelty, but these measures harm all of us.

California’s strength comes from its immigrant communities. Our leadership in science, technology, agriculture, and the arts depends on students, scholars, and workers from around the world.

To protestors fighting to preserve immigrant rights and opportunity, your fight is our fight. To those who think this doesn’t affect you, I promise it will. It touches your economy and your children’s future. And to leaders advancing these policies in Washington and elsewhere — stop before California and America lose the very strengths that built them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050625-TurnitinAICollege-JAH-CM-02.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-19 09:56:20.798911

Thanks to Flores and this ruling, immigrant children are better protected today than they were just days ago.","LOS ANGELES — After rejecting the federal government’s efforts to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement last Friday, a federal court on Monday reaffirmed that the government remains legally obligated to promptly process, transfer, and release immigrant children as expeditiously as possible.

Despite these clear protections, Flores co-counsel has documented alarming evidence that children are being subjected to prolonged detention in punitive, prison-like conditions. Many are confined for weeks or even months in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, detention sites intended only for short-term processing, where conditions are wholly inappropriate and harmful for children.

“These CBP facilities are cruel, barren, and psychologically scarring to children,” said Sarah Kahn, Senior Staff Attorney with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “No child should be in a prison for any amount of time. This order will help to shorten the imprisonment of children and move them promptly out of the worst and most traumatizing facilities.”

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee acknowledged this reality, ruling that “CBP facilities are intended only for short-term use” and ordering that children be detained there only for the time “reasonably require[d] to process [them] for release and/or actively arrange for and complete transport … to a more suitable facility,” noting that CBP facilities “by design, are not suitable for [children] for long periods of time.”

“The district court’s ruling underscores the critical role of the Flores Settlement Agreement in protecting the safety and welfare of children in government custody,” said Leecia Welch, Deputy Litigation Director at Children’s Rights. “In our role as Flores counsel, we will continue to lift up the voices of imprisoned children and hold the government accountable for their humane treatment. Without court oversight, children in immigration custody would be left entirely at the mercy of a government that has consistently betrayed them.”

The Court also addressed conditions that directly affect children’s well-being: freezing temperatures and lights that stay on all night. Judge Gee found that Flores co-counsel had shown the government was in “substantial noncompliance” with the Flores Agreement, leaving children exposed to unsafe conditions. She ordered that children be kept in safe, comfortable temperatures and that lights be dimmed or turned off at night so they can sleep. These practices are deliberate government failures aimed at increasing the suffering of immigrant children and their families, leaving them cold, exhausted, and deeply vulnerable.

“Every time I have visited a CBP border station, children and teenagers alike have described the constant frigid air that blows on them day and night while they sit in holding rooms they are not allowed to leave,” said Becky Wolozin, Senior Attorney with the National Center for Youth Law. “One child told me he missed seeing the sun, and the only way he knew the time or day was by keeping track of a clock mounted on a guard surveillance station. The Court rightly recognized that CBP facilities are unacceptable places to hold children for prolonged lengths of time.”

This ruling underscores the ongoing power of the Flores Settlement Agreement to protect children in immigration custody. In place since 1997, the Flores Agreement holds the government accountable for ensuring immigrant children are processed, transferred, and released promptly. Thanks to Flores and this ruling, immigrant children are better protected today than they were just days ago.

States were set to receive more than $1.2 billion in federal crime victim funding this year, with California expected to claim $165 million. But last month, the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Victims for Crime announced that states must agree to support and assist the Department of Homeland Security with federal immigration enforcement in order to access those funds.

Some states view that condition as unworkable and the potential loss of funding could be the second significant hit this year from the Trump administration to California programs that support crime victims. Earlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department slashed grants for violence prevention and victim service programs that were initially valued at $811 million. In California alone, the department cut just over $80 million.

“Congress has never put civil immigration enforcement conditions on this funding because it has nothing to do with immigration. This is a brazen abuse of the president’s power,” Bonta said at a Monday press conference about the latest lawsuit.

California and 20 other states are suing the Trump administration over the potential cut in the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The states want the courts to prevent the Department of Justice from implementing the new rules.

The contested funding for crime victims supports expenses such as emergency shelter, sexual assault medical support, compensation for lost wages and funeral expenses.

The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating the U.S. Constitution by going around Congress on how a program it created should be funded. The lawsuit also alleges that the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that is the subject of most of the lawsuits California has filed against the White House. The act says that a federal agency needs to follow procedures and explain its rationale for changing a policy.

The states allege that the Department of Justice “arbitrarily relied on immigration-related factors that Congress did not authorize it to rely on in allocating federal grant monies to support victims.”

Rhode Island’s attorney general, Peter Neronha, said during the press conference that the Department of Justice’s new rules go against his values. He gave the example of a child who’s the victim of sexual assault being interviewed at a child advocacy center. “One question that should not be asked is whether that child is in this country lawfully or unlawfully,” he said.

The crime act fund was signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. The law emerged after a report from Reagan’s 1982 Task Force on Victims of Crime said that the “neglect of crime victims is a national disgrace,” according to Monday’s lawsuit. Among the report’s recommendations was to “enact legislation to provide federal funding to assist state crime victim compensation programs.”

In May, California filed two other lawsuits against the Trump administration for tying immigration enforcement to transportation and counter-terrorism funding, affecting billions of dollars in federal support.

Border Patrol worked with Romulus police Here's what happened to Alexa after she was arrested, according to her attorneys and advocates.
In a statement to the Free Press, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which Border Patrol is part of, strongly denied the claims of mistreatment.
The spokesperson said Romulus police contacted Border Patrol for help ""with identifying one subject they had in custody.""
Alexa uses she/her pronouns but was referred to as they/them by the Border Patrol spokesperson.","Alexa, a trans immigrant, was detained by Border Patrol after a traffic stop by Romulus police.

Federal and county officials deny Alexa was mistreated.

The case illustrates the unique problems LGBTQ+ immigrants face while in custody.

On a Friday in June, Alexa was driving her Ford Focus on Interstate 94 when a Romulus police officer pulled her over for allegedly speeding. Instead of just writing the Ypsilanti woman a ticket, police took her to the police station and contacted Border Patrol, who then took the immigrant from Honduras to the Gibraltar station of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Despite having no criminal record, she was held for eight days in a cell where the lights remained on 24 hours day, making sleep almost impossible, and she was not allowed to shower, her attorney Ruby Robinson said.

Things got worse for Alexa, a trans woman, after she was transferred to a county jail in southwestern Ohio where, she alleges, she faced groping and an attempted assault after she was denied a request to be housed with other female inmates. The Spanish-speaking inmate was also mistakenly assumed to be suicidal when asked questions in English and denied her hormonal treatment that some trans people take, which led to health problems, Robinson said.

A CBP spokesman and Butler County (Ohio) Chief Deputy Sheriff Anthony Dwyer told the Free Press she was not mistreated and they do not have reports she was abused or discriminated against. ""There was no record of an incident,"" Dwyer said. An immigration judge has denied her attorney's requests for her to be freed on bond while her case is being heard.

The case of Alexa illustrates the unique challenges that trans immigrants are facing as the administration of President Donald Trump vows to carry out a record number of arrests and deportations, according to immigrant and LGBTQ+ advocates. In addition to the crackdown on immigrants, Trump issued an executive order in January restricting gender-affirming care in prisons that affects some immigration detention centers. Alexa's challenges have alarmed civil rights and immigrant advocates in Michigan, who say it's part of a growing pattern.

""It's definitely very worrisome,"" said Robinson, with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""A major concern, both for her and for other individuals, is getting the appropriate gender-affirming care that they deserve. Everyone deserves appropriate and sufficient care. We all deserve human dignity in all interactions and … that's not happening.""

Alexa was born in Honduras and entered the U.S. without authorization, but has no criminal record since entering, Robinson said. She was not convicted of the alleged speeding she was pulled over for in June. The Trump administration has said they're going after all unauthorized immigrants, regardless of whether they've committed crimes. Alexa, who doesn't have legal permission to stay in the U.S., falls into that category of immigrants who may have previously been allowed to stay, but now face removal. The Free Press did not speak with Alexa, but with advocates who know about her case.

""She came to the United States because of discrimination that she had been experiencing in Honduras"" because of her gender identity, Robinson said. Alexa lived in Honduras identifying as a man, but was able to experience a more free life in the U.S., undergoing top surgery a few years ago as she transitioned. She has lived in the U.S. for about 13 years, supporting herself by cleaning businesses and homes while living in an apartment in Ypsilanti.

But as Trump cracked down on immigration and gender-affirming care, her life became upended as she faced discrimination in custody and now faces the possibility of being deported to Honduras, where she could face even more problems.

""She would likely be very likely to be persecuted on account of her gender identity, an identity that is very much innate and has characteristics that she just she cannot change,"" Robinson said. ""And so the likelihood of persecution is going to be even greater.""

Alexa was transferred on July 10 to, and currently stays at, North Lake Correctional Facility, a private prison in northwest Michigan run by GEO Group, which contracts with ICE. Alexa has a different name in government records; the Free Press is using the name she uses.

""All of this was happening inside a U.S. facility, under government custody, where there are supposed to be policies and standards to protect vulnerable individuals, especially those like Alexa,"" read a staff memo from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""But Alexa wasn’t protected. She was punished, humiliated, and traumatized simply for being who she is.""

Robinson said this case reveals multiple issues with how immigrants are treated: arresting and detaining immigrants without criminal records; local police working with federal immigration agents on non-criminal cases; holding immigrants for several days in Border Patrol centers not meant for long-term stays; not respecting gender identities of trans people; and denying immigrants bond they were granted under the previous administration.

""This is an ongoing problem,"" Jay Kaplan, staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan's LGBTQ+ Project, told the Free Press. ""A county jail, if they were to deny her medical treatment, that would be highly problematic."" The ACLU filed a lawsuit in March challenging Trump's order against gender-affirming care that includes facilities overseen by the Department of Homeland Security; in June, the ACLU got an injunction from a federal judge blocking Trump's order. In June, a report from the Vera Institute said ICE is excluding data on transgender inmates as required by a congressional mandate.

Border Patrol worked with Romulus police

Here's what happened to Alexa after she was arrested, according to her attorneys and advocates.

After Border Patrol picked her up from the Romulus police station, she was placed in a brightly-lit holding cell, where she was offered only two meals a day and denied hygiene needs such as bathing, her attorney said. It was ""very difficult for her to communicate directly with family members"" or her attorney, but she later was able to, Robinson said.

Romulus Police Chief Robert Pfannes did not return a message seeking comment about Alexa or about what his department's policies are on working with federal immigration agents.

In a statement to the Free Press, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which Border Patrol is part of, strongly denied the claims of mistreatment. The spokesperson said Romulus police contacted Border Patrol for help ""with identifying one subject they had in custody.""

Alexa said she was ""a citizen of Honduras and stated they did not possess any documents allowing them to stay, live, reside, work, or remain in the United States legally,"" the spokesperson said. Border Patrol agents then arrested Alexa and took her to the Gibraltar station ""for identity verification and verification of the documents they had in their possession,"" the U.S. official said. Alexa uses she/her pronouns but was referred to as they/them by the Border Patrol spokesperson.

""The claims they did not shower or have any communication are blatantly false,"" the spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection said. ""Detainees are provided showers, soap, and a clean towel for those approaching 72 hours in detention. They showered on June 9 and June 12. Additionally, agents granted them telephone access per policy. Both of these are outlined in CBP’s National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search.""

Alleged abuse in Ohio county jail

After eight days, Alexa was transferred on June 13 to the Butler County jail, about 30 minutes north of Cincinnati, which works with ICE on holding immigrant inmates, records show.

""From the moment she arrived at Butler, communication was a barrier that endangered her safety,"" said the memo from Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. ""Alexa speaks only Spanish, but staff asked her intake questions in English. It seems that the staff was reluctant to secure an interpreter.""

Alexa said she later realized she may have answered ""yes"" to a question asking her if she was suicidal, but she did not understand at the time what the questions was about. The staff at the jail thought she was suicidal and then stripped Alexa of her clothes and put in a restrictive safety gown that was too small for her, the memo said.

""Her back was exposed,"" the memo said. ""She was denied a blanket. She was forced to either sit on a toilet or press herself against a wall to preserve any sense of dignity.""

In an interview with the Free Press, Butler County Sheriff Chief Anthony Dwyersaid ""there is a record of (Alexa) talking about being suicidal.""

Dwyer said they have translations services given the linguistic diversity of immigrant inmates.

""We have ICE detainees, so we have a multitude of different languages, and we have translation services that we use frequently that have aided us very well, and I think are very well put together,"" Dwyer said. ""We have an actual device that translates, as well as telephonic, where we can make calls and have live translations.""

In Alexa's case, the staff used ""translation services that we're comfortable with,"" Dwyer said. ""And I have documentation when they came in, of what they indicated about the suicidal ideations, and that would trigger (suicide prevention) in our jail."" Dwyer also referred to Alexa with they/them pronouns.

Alexa was then placed in an area not meant for long-term housing, separate from other female inmates. When Alexa asked why she wasn't placed in a regular unit, a staff member told her: ""We don’t know where to put people like you"" because they weren't sure to place her in either a male or female area.

Alexa was placed in a 4' x 8' cell with constant lighting, continued isolation, and not allowed to shower for almost a week. Other inmates were allowed to shower once a day, the memo said.

""She tried to stay clean by washing her underarms at the sink/toilet, having no access to showers,"" the memo said.

Dwyer maintains that Alexa was originally placed in an isolated area known as ""protective custody"" because she had requested it, but then later requested to be taken out of it. She was then ""housed at different locations around our facility,"" Dwyer said.

Deputy sheriff: No mixing of 'biological' men and women

Dwyer said their jail has protocols for trans people, but they will not put biological males with biological females.

""We deal with transgender inmates and we have a lot of protocols in discussing the situation with them and where proper housing is,"" he said. ""Some choose to go into protective custody or isolation. Some choose to be housed here, there or anywhere else. We do not put biological males with biological females. We just do not do that. That is asking for trouble, and it's been trouble around jails in this whole country.""

Another problem was she was not given access to communication with her family and attorney, Robinson said.

""Only after her attorney contacted the sergeant at the jail did staff allow her to bathe,"" the memo said.

Alleged groping after transfer to men's area

Alexa had a bond hearing on July 1, when Jennifer Riedthaler-Williams, a Cleveland immigration judge, said she needed more information before deciding. The following day, July 2, after Alexa had been transferred to a men's area, a male inmate shoved her against the wall and groped her, attempting to assault her, Robinson said.

""A guard witnessed the incident, and instead of intervening right away, just kind of laughed and said, 'Oh, you want to (expletive) him,'"" Robinson said. ""Fortunately, she was able to get another inmate to interpret and another guard listened to her concerns, and she was able to be moved to a safe section, and since then ... as far as I know, she hasn't had any other incidents like that, but it's very disturbing for lots of reasons.""

Dwyer said ""there is no record of any any information where this person made a complaint of an issue as they were touched or assaulted. We have a system in place where they can report that, and I don't have anything, so I can't comment.""

On July 8, Alexa was denied bond, Robinson said. She had strong family ties and an ability to support herself and so she should have gotten bond, which was more the norm in the past, he said.

Another issue was she was unable to get her hormonal treatment that some trans people take. After several weeks without it, she suffered ""breast pain, leakage, and deepening depression,"" the memo said.

""If you're on hormones, stopping those hormones has real effects ... on both short and long term care,"" Robinson said.

ICE did not comment on Alexa's case.

Some groups in Ohio have raised concerns about treatment of ICE inmates in Butler County, but Dwyer said ""it's going fine.""

""We really don't have any problems with ICE inmates,"" he said. ""We have a lot of transparency down here to try and provide people the information they want.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/15/PDTF/85671153007-alexa-photo.jpg?crop=899,506,x0,y160&width=899&height=506&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-19 09:56:24.662474

And it takes a lot of people,” said Escobar, the first member of Congress to set foot inside the Department of Homeland Security’s East Montana Detention Facility.
The El Paso Service Processing Center on Montana Avenue near Hawkins Boulevard can also hold up to 1,000 detainees.
TRAC does not yet reflect any statistics from the East Montana facility.
She said that the process for attorneys and families to access detainees is not yet clearly defined.","A sprawling migrant detention facility in Far East El Paso fades into the desert, appearing somewhat unassuming to passersby. Its distance from the highway diminishes its scale.

“The facility is really, really big and it will continue to grow,” U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said Monday after taking a two-and-half-hour tour of the tent structure on acres of military land north of Montana Avenue off George Dieter Drive.

“It is really massive. It is a huge facility that takes a lot of power – a lot of power – to run. And it takes a lot of people,” said Escobar, the first member of Congress to set foot inside the Department of Homeland Security’s East Montana Detention Facility.

The $1.24 billion, soft-sided Immigration and Customs Enforcement East Montana site on Fort Bliss land began taking in detainees Aug. 1 and now holds about 1,000 people – all men. Its capacity is expected to grow to about 5,000 detainees, including women, in the near future – set to become the largest federal detention center for civil detainees in the country.

Escobar said the facility is a reinforced tent with hard floors and walls that don’t extend to the ceiling but create some division and privacy. Cameras are everywhere, she added.

The funding comes from the Department of Defense budget under the reconciliation bill, known as the Big Beautiful Bill, that provided for $45 billion in supplemental funding to double migrant detention capacity to 100,000 beds.

“When you think about the amount of money that is being funneled into this facility … think about how much good that money would do if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans,” Escobar said during a news conference just outside the facility.

The East Montana Detention Facility is the latest to open in recent months as part of the ramped up immigration enforcement and mass deportations efforts by the Trump administration, which is seeking to deport 1 million people a year.

At least three other detention centers have opened in recent months throughout the country, including what are being called “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Deportation Depot” in Florida and the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana.

While the square footage of the East Montana detention center is unclear, a similar tent facility in Northeast El Paso with a capacity of 1,000 people stands at about 153,000 square feet on 28 acres. The El Paso Service Processing Center on Montana Avenue near Hawkins Boulevard can also hold up to 1,000 detainees. Both will likely remain operational, Escobar said.

Nearly 59,400 people were in ICE detention as of Aug. 10 – 70% of them with no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, or TRAC.

In El Paso, TRAC reports an average daily number of detainees at the Montana Facility at just over 800 on Aug. 4, with another 180 at the Northeast facility. TRAC does not yet reflect any statistics from the East Montana facility.

Escobar praised what appeared to be a “highly sophisticated” medical facility at the site, and said the kitchen and open areas are large and clean.

Still, she expressed several concerns, including that the facility which is now running on generators will take a large amount of energy and water resources to maintain the facility. Aside from utility resources, Escobar said she feared the camp was “poaching” health care professionals from the region, offering temporary but high-paying jobs.

Escobar said she wasn’t able to talk with detainees as she has in past visits to other detention facilities, including under Trump’s previous administration. She said that the process for attorneys and families to access detainees is not yet clearly defined.

Escobar, who in early July was denied access to the facility near Hawkins, said her staff has since been able to visit the site and talk to detainees at that site. She said she was on the House floor in Washington, D.C., when her staff was granted access and left with “a lot of case work, which we cannot talk about.” She referred to assistance members of Congress provide to their constituents to help resolve problems related to federal agencies.

East Montana ICE facility to be privately run

While Escobar said that it doesn’t appear that any military personnel are involved in running the East Montana detention center, she said she has other staffing concerns. Most such centers are run by private staffing companies.

“I am very concerned that there are not enough ICE personnel who have been trained by the federal government and have done this for a living for their whole career,” she said. “I’m concerned that there are not as many federal personnel to provide oversight as we should have.”

Without the appropriate number of ICE or other federal employees, she said, it’s too easy for standards to slip “when there are private facilities that far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Acquisition Logistics LLC, a Virginia-based company that specializes in providing logistics and supply chain management services primarily to Department of Defense agencies, was awarded nearly $232 million upfront to begin the work, with an estimated completion date of September 2027 for a total contract of $1.24 billion, according to the DoD.

About 10 other military sites are being considered for ICE detention facilities, with Fort Bliss serving as a model, the New York Times reported in February. The Fort Bliss site was selected after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited with troops at the base earlier this year, according to the news organization. Other sites being considered include Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado, and Hill Air Force Base in Utah.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, in a statement said the Trump administration is working “at turbo speed” to execute mass deportations, saying that the Big Beautiful Bill provided “historic funding” to secure 80,000 new ICE beds and capacity to detain up to 100,000 people daily.

“The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” the statement reads.

Sen. John Cornyn, who visited the site but did not go into the facility last week, said during an Aug. 11 news conference that all detention facilities meet state or federal standards, including that detainees receive medical care, three meals a day, air conditioning and “a place to sleep.”

“These are humane, safe facilities and in many instances, a vast improvement over what many of these folks are used to,” Cornyn said, calling the facility “the lone star lockup.” He said the detention facilities are needed to address the “unmitigated disaster” of the past several years and the need to remove “illegal aliens who have no legal right to be here.”

Washington’s “Keep Washington Working Act” strictly limits how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities.
Brown said he expects the feds to try and cut federal law enforcement grants again.
“I’ve been waiting for the US Attorney General to give us a hand here,” Swank said.","Washington officials are responding to a letter from the federal government last week demanding they end so-called “sanctuary jurisdiction” policies — local laws stopping police from working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote to Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Aug. 13. “This ends now.”

Ferguson posted on Facebook that “Washington has no intention of changing our values in the face of threats from the Trump administration.”

Washington Attorney General Nick Brown told KUOW the letter is an intimidation tactic that doesn’t rely on “a sound analysis of what the law actually requires.”

""I just think the threats from the Department of Justice and from the Trump administration are fairly hollow when it comes to the actual law,"" Brown said Monday. ""I think the letter is bluster, but it's a letter from the most powerful law enforcement officer in the country. So I, as the [state’s] attorney general, I need to take it seriously.""

Washington’s “Keep Washington Working Act” strictly limits how local law enforcement can interact with federal immigration authorities. Adams County’s sheriff and Snohomish County prosecutors have recently landed in court for sharing inmate information and immigration status with federal authorities, and holding people in local jails based solely on immigration status.

The letter contained vague threats to cut federal law enforcement funding to Washington state, which Trump tried to do to other states during his first term — to mixed success. Brown said he expects the feds to try and cut federal law enforcement grants again.

“It’s really absurd, and it's really sad, frankly, that we have an administration that is so vindictive and reckless with public safety, because every law enforcement agency in Washington state relies on assistance from the federal government to some degree or another,” Brown said.

Pierce County Sheriff Keith Swank, a newly-elected conservative with a history of inflammatory posts online, recently went to D.C. to ask the federal government to intervene in Washington. Swank has been involved in litigation with his own county prosecutor over the state’s law.

“I’ve been waiting for the US Attorney General to give us a hand here,” Swank said. “I’m looking forward to warrants being issued. I’m going to have to dust off and oil up my cuffs.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/1ec6b0245324fc8348c86bd640a8223f.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-08-19 12:58:45.413592

The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.","The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.

Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview. She demanded the areas answer her by Tuesday.

Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.

“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.

The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.

The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.

Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.

Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.

One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.

States, sheriffs puzzle over Trump’s error-filled list of immigration sanctuaries

A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”

“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”

Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.

“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.

Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.

“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

During that time, he said he was denied access to a lawyer, prevented from contacting his family, and placed in an isolation cell, all without being charged with a crime.

Retes, a security guard at Glass House Farms in Camarillo, said he was on his way to work on July 10 when he encountered an ICE roadblock amid protests and federal agents. According to Retes, officers broke his car window, sprayed him with pepper spray and tear gas, and forcibly removed him from the vehicle. Two officers placed a knee on his back while another knelt on his neck, despite his compliance and repeated attempts to identify himself as a U.S. citizen.

He was transported first to a nearby Navy base and then to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where he remained in custody for three nights. Retes described being covered in chemical irritants, denied showers or fresh clothing, and placed on suicide watch after becoming emotionally distraught. Meanwhile, his family was unable to locate him, and he missed his daughter’s third birthday. He said he received no explanation for his detention and was released without apology or charges.

Now, Retes is seeking accountability through the Federal Tort Claims Act, a law that allows citizens to sue the federal government when harmed by its employees. Represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, Retes has submitted claims to the federal agencies involved. Only if the agencies deny or fail to act on the claims within six months can he proceed to court.

“I’m calling out the federal government not just for what they did to me, but for what they are doing to others,” Retes said. “I’m continuing to fight for this country, now as a civilian.”

Attorneys representing Retes described the case as an example of how federal agents can strip Americans of basic constitutional protections, even when those individuals have served in the military. “George’s claims are a critical step to enforce the Constitution and other laws in court,” said Institute for Justice attorney Marie Miller.

Senior attorney Anya Bidwell added, “Without accountability for these actions, the relationship between citizens and their government remains broken. George is doing his part to repair that relationship, just as he did when he served his country in Iraq.”

The raid at Glass House Farms was part of a broader federal enforcement operation that led to the detention of hundreds of people, including undocumented workers, and sparked protests from farmworkers and advocacy groups. One worker died after falling from a greenhouse roof during the operation. Federal officials have not clarified why Retes, a U.S. citizen, was detained or addressed his allegations of excessive force.

Retes’ case comes amid a climate of heightened scrutiny over immigration enforcement in Southern California.

OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

Officials with Old Orchard Beach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy.

When it comes to Illinois laws aimed at protecting immigrants, Adams County Sheriff Tony Grootens has made his views clear.

“I have no intentions of turning away ICE agents or any of them, Homeland Security agents, any of them, that encounter illegal aliens in our community,” Grootens said in a July interview with TV station KHQA. “I know that we’ve had a few, and we put a few in jail and they’ve since been transported out of here by ICE.”

It appears the western Illinois sheriff has made good on his promise, according to documents obtained by WTTW News.

The Adams County Sheriff’s Office has transferred at least two men into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, in apparent violation of the state’s TRUST Act and Way Forward Act, according to a lawyer who helped provide technical support for the legislation. Both men were later deported.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin pointed to both men’s criminal charges — but in one case, the federal government dismissed its criminal complaint; in the other, he was never charged for the alleged crime that landed him in jail.

In addition, the Adams County Jail also has a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service that authorizes ICE to utilize the jail to detain people for $80 a day. Such contracts also appear to run afoul of state law.

The acts generally prohibit collaboration between Illinois law enforcement officers and federal immigration agencies.

“All of those things are violations,” Mark Fleming, associate director of federal litigation with the National Immigrant Justice Center, said of both the men handed off to ICE by Adams County and the jail contract.

WTTW News detailed these apparent violations to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office, which oversees compliance and enforcement of the state’s sanctuary laws. The office did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In July, WTTW News sent Grooten’s remarks on KHQA to Raoul’s office for comment. A spokesperson replied that “nothing in the TRUST Act violates federal law. Local law enforcement in Illinois must follow the TRUST Act, just like any other Illinois law. Our office is aware of the comments made by the Adams County Sheriff. We have no further comment at this time.”

WTTW News also laid out the apparent violations to the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, which did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

The Jail Agreement

The intergovernmental agreement between Adams County and ICE is through a contract with the U.S. Marshals Service and Adams County Jail, effective last February: “this agreement is for the housing, safekeeping, subsistence and care of Federal prisoners.” ICE is marked under “other authorized agency user.”

“No law enforcement agency, law enforcement official, or any unit of State or local government may enter into or renew any contract, intergovernmental service agreement, or any other agreement to house or detain individuals for federal civil immigration violations,” states the Illinois’ Way Forward Act.

“That is precisely one of the scenarios that the Illinois Way Forward Act sought to address,” Fleming said. “That authorization of ICE to use it is a clear violation.”

Fleming compared the situation to a 2021 lawsuit, in which McHenry and Kankakee counties sued to stop the implementation of the Way Forward Act and thereby protect their existing lucrative detention contracts with ICE. But a federal judge upheld the act, terminating the inclusion of ICE on their contracts.

Detainers and ICE Custody

Since the beginning of this year, Adams County has transferred at least two men into ICE custody — which also violates the TRUST Act, according to Fleming. Both men were deported, according to DHS.

In both instances, civil immigration detainers were issued. An immigration detainer is a request that a local law enforcement agency detain an individual to then transfer that person into federal immigration custody.

“A law enforcement agency or law enforcement official shall not detain or continue to detain any individual solely on the basis of any immigration detainer or civil immigration warrant or otherwise comply with an immigration detainer or civil immigration warrant,” the TRUST Act states.

“Unless presented with a federal criminal warrant, or otherwise required by federal law, a law enforcement agency or official may not … transfer any person into an immigration agent’s custody,” it continues.

One case involves Alejandro Palomo-Godines, a Mexican man. In September 2024, he was arrested in Sangamon County and charged with violating federal weapons laws. An immigration detainer was issued for him on June 16.

A June 18 filing shows that the federal government dismissed Palomo-Godines’ case. On June 21, he was transferred from Sangamon County to Adams County Jail in Quincy, held on an ICE detainer and was then “picked up by ICE.”

WTTW News has not been able to reach Palomo-Godines.

The other case involves Romaido Garcia-Santizo, a Mexican man who, according to ICE documents, had been removed on one prior occasion from the United States to Mexico in 2011. He said he worked at a dairy farm in nearby Missouri, the documents state. WTTW News has not been able to reach Garcia-Santizo.

An affidavit from an ICE deportation officer states that in March, he confirmed Garcia-Santizo reentered the U.S. after he was arrested for “aggravated assault use of a deadly weapon” by Quincy police. However, according to the Quincy Police Department, Garcia-Santizo was not charged.

The Quincy Police Department denied a WTTW News request under the Freedom of Information Act for his arrest report.

The ICE affidavit states that after Garcia-Santizo’s arrest, the ICE officer searched through a jail booking database, where he found that Garcia-Santizo was in Adams County Jail custody.

The officer then issued a civil immigration detainer for Garcia, according to the affidavit. Garcia-Santizo was taken into ICE Enforcement and Removal Options custody inside the booking area of the Adams County Jail; this transfer into ICE custody breaks the TRUST Act, Fleming said.

According to the affidavit, Garcia-Santizo was then transported to the St. Louis ICE office before being placed into ICE custody at the Ste. Genevieve County Jail in Missouri. At some point, he was taken back to Adams County Jail during his trial on re-entry charges, according to a court filing. In June, he pleaded guilty to one count of re-entry of a removed alien and was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, filings state.

When asked about Adams County’s apparent violation of the TRUST Act, DHS’ McLaughlin said in a statement that the department condemns “any sanctuary city or jurisdiction for breaking federal immigration law by refusing to enforce our laws.”

In that interview with KHQA, Grootens reasoned his defiance of these sanctuary laws by stating, “If state law conflicts with federal law, federal law trumps state law. Being a sanctuary state, they’re going to seek refuge, protection from the state. But not here.”

But Fleming said it’s not a decision about choosing sides between state and federal law enforcement. What the TRUST Act and Way Forward Act do is withdraw the state and its resources from being expended on immigration enforcement, which is a federal responsibility, he said.

“I am shocked by the county sheriff’s misunderstanding of the law,” Fleming said.

He said the U.S. Supreme Court has made this clear, pointing to the 1997 decision Printz v. United States, where the court ruled that state legislatures are not subject to federal direction.

“Counties are just a subdivision of the state, the state can decide on behalf of the counties and behalf of all municipalities in the state as to what sort of cooperation or participation they may have in enforcing a federal regulatory program, like immigration enforcement, in the state,” Fleming said.

For his part, Gov. JB Pritzker is firm in his belief that state law is not in violation of federal law.

“But let me be clear: We expect the federal government to follow the law, too,” Pritzker said at a June congressional hearing on sanctuary laws. “We will not participate in abuses of power. We will not violate court orders. We will not ignore the Constitution. We will not defy the Supreme Court.”

If local law enforcement breaks these sanctuary statutes, the Attorney General’s Office has “fairly broad power to investigate,” Fleming said.

The attorney general could bring civil action against a sheriff in state court to try to get them into compliance through additional reporting requirements or training. If they remain in blatant violation, Fleming said, it could lead to contempt proceedings against an official.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-19 10:57:07.124204

ALXnow has reached out to the Alexandria Police Department, the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.","Federal immigration agents arrested 15 construction workers at an Alexandria apartment complex Monday afternoon, sparking an evening community rally where city officials and residents denounced the enforcement action.

The arrests occurred at Eaton Square Apartments on Florence Drive in the Chirilagua neighborhood while the men were working on a roofing project, according to Evelin Urrutia, executive director of Tenants and Workers United. The timing coincided with the first day of school in Alexandria, heightening community concerns about children’s safety.

“The people arrested were working on the roof of an apartment building when they were targeted and abducted by masked federal agents,” Urrutia said during the community gathering at 3801 Florence Drive. “This comes as families were ready to pick up their children on the first day of classes.”

Community members filmed the arrests and confirmed that seven to eight ICE agents were present during the operation. Witnesses said the agents provided no information about the reason for the arrests or where they were taking the workers.

On short notice, a couple of dozen people rallied with signs in front of the apartment complex where the workers had been detained earlier in the day.

Mayor Alyia Gaskins attended the rally and condemned the federal enforcement action.

“The men who were taken today, who were kidnapped today, they were not strangers. They are our neighbors. They are someone’s parent. They are someone’s son, someone’s brother, cousin, friend,” Gaskins said. “This is a council that we’re not going to just stay seated. This is a council that the things that are under our authority to do, we will act and do that.”

Vice Mayor Sarah Bagley and City Council member Abdel Elnoubi also attended the community gathering.

City Councilman Canek Aguirre released a statement calling the enforcement action an example of an “authoritarian regime hell bent on terrorizing communities.”

“Masked individuals in tactical gear and unmarked vehicles refusing to identify themselves have chosen the start of a new school year to inflict more fear and terror for many of our neighbors and friends in Alexandria,” Aguirre said.

Oliver Marino, a city resident who works for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and identifies as an undocumented immigrant, described witnessing the workers earlier in the day.

“This morning, I passed through these streets. I saw the men working. They were working. They were just doing things that you and I do every day to feed their families,” Marino said.

The community response included volunteers who monitored the area during the first day of school. Some community members reported seeing ICE agents near an elementary school, though this could not be confirmed.

Reverend Deborah Porras from Beverly Hills Community United Methodist Church called on faith communities to take action.

“This morning, when we were taking children to school, we had people all over this community searching and watching in case we had ICE agents popping up, trying to accost children,” Porras said.

Community leaders also criticized local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, specifically targeting Sheriff Sean Casey’s policies. Marino said his organization has confirmed more than 30 people from the community being transferred to ICE by the sheriff without judicial warrants.

Sammie Moshenberg, a 40-year resident of the neighboring Delray area, referenced Fairfax County Sheriff’s policies as an example of non-cooperation with ICE.

“If the Fairfax County Sheriff understands that there’s no legal reason to cooperate with ICE, why doesn’t our sheriff,” Moshenberg said.

The arrested workers all appeared to be men working for the same construction company, according to witnesses. Community members said they asked the apartment management company for information, but received no response.

Urrutia said the enforcement action represents part of a broader pattern affecting Virginia communities. She advised residents to know their rights, including the right not to open doors to agents and the right to remain silent.

The Chirilagua neighborhood, located in Alexandria’s Arlandria area, has a significant Latino population and a long history of welcoming immigrants. The community gathering drew dozens of residents and supporters.

Tenants and Workers United, which organized the evening rally, works with low-income communities of color, primarily immigrants, to create changes in Northern Virginia.

ALXnow has reached out to the Alexandria Police Department, the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

Amy Bertsch, Public Information Officer for the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office, shared with ALXnow on Monday night, “As Sheriff Casey’s previous statement indicates, the Sheriff’s Office does not participate in any immigration enforcement in our community.” When asked for comment on Monday’s enforcement action, Bertsch said the Sheriff’s Office had “no comment on today’s enforcement” but directed ALXnow to use Casey’s previous statement.

On Aug. 13, the Sheriff’s Office published a statement on immigration concerns stating: “I want to reassure everyone that the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office does not and will not participate in any type of immigration enforcement in our community.”

The statement continues: “The Alexandria Adult Detention Center will never be used to house individuals arrested by ICE during their enforcement of immigration laws. Additionally, we will never use any taxpayer funds or accept any funding for immigration enforcement activities.”

However, the Sheriff’s Office website also notes that Virginia law requires all sheriffs to determine the citizenship of individuals arrested on felony charges and share this information with ICE. The office transfers custody of inmates to ICE on their scheduled release date when ICE has filed a lawful warrant and detainer.

According to data published by the Sheriff’s Office, 35 inmates have been transferred to ICE as of mid-July 2025, compared to 43 in all of 2024.

ICE officials said they detained Santiago “Diego” Martinez, 30, for having a drunken driving conviction. However, his attorney said ICE admitted they made a mistake – Martinez does not have a criminal conviction – but he remained in custody as of Monday.

It was the morning of Aug. 11 that Jennifer Choi got a call from Martinez’s girlfriend, who said he needed help. Choi went behind her restaurant, Sushi Motto, and saw ICE officers detaining Martinez.

“So when I go, Diego was in the car,” Choi said. “And then I said, ‘OK, what's going on?’ They say he don't have a green card. I tell them, he has a green card. He has a green card. I tell them, like two, three times, but they said, ‘We have to take him.’”

Martinez had worked for Choi for more than five years as a sushi chef. She said he was a great employee.

“He has a good heart,” Choi said. “He helped, even though he’s a sushi chef, he helped in the kitchen, dishwash, whatever needed help. He did everything. He never complained.”

Martinez is a Mexican national who was in the country illegally, ICE spokeswoman Christine Cuttita said in an email. ICE officials first encountered Martinez in 2019 when he entered the country and was arrested by airport police, Cuttita said. His case was dismissed by a judge in 2022 for “prosecutorial discretion.”

Margaret Stock, Martinez’s attorney, said Martinez is an Indigenous person from Mexico and was seeking asylum in the United States. The charges for his initial immigration arrest were dismissed, because the judge ruled he had a valid asylum case, Stock said.

“He does have a very good reason not to return,” Stock said. “I mean, people in the family have been killed and murdered.”

It’s not uncommon for asylum cases to take years to resolve, she said.

Cuttita with ICE wrote that Martinez, “jeopardized any legal privilege to remain in the United States when he was arrested by the Anchorage Police Department on Nov. 12, 2024, for driving under the influence.”

But the charges were thrown out, Stock said, and Martinez doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction on his record.

“I talked to the ICE people, and they were operating on misinformation that he had a DWI conviction, which he doesn't have,” Stock said. “But they claim that was the reason, on the telephone to me, that they were arresting him, was that he had a DWI conviction.”

Stock said the ICE officials told her they made a mistake arresting Martinez, since he doesn’t have a drunken driving conviction, but they still won’t release him.

“They told me that once they grab somebody, they're not allowed to release him anymore,” Stock said. “And they say that this is a new rule that has been made up by the DHS leadership, that people who are pending asylum, they can just grab them anytime and put them in detention.”

Cuttita said that convictions and arrests can both jeopardize someone’s immigration status. But Stock said the Department of Homeland Security isn’t following the law.

“I think it's illegal and it's un-American,” Stock said. “It's unconstitutional, and then on top of it, there's obviously errors in the system. So how can we trust the Department of Homeland Security when they make these kinds of egregious errors all the time?”

For now, it remains unclear if Martinez will be deported.

Stock said she was able to meet with Martinez when he was being held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, but the opportunities were limited.

“He was freezing cold and shivering while he was talking to me,” Stock said. “He said it's freezing in there, and then he also told me that they would only let him make one phone call a day. They've denied me access to speak with him because they have special rules that attorneys aren't allowed to go in there for huge chunks of the day. You know, they have hours that are off-limits to attorneys.”

Those rules, Stock said, contradict what ICE’s website says about the Anchorage Correctional Complex, that attorneys can access clients from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day.

Martinez was transferred to a detention center in Tacoma, and Stock is there, too, working to get him released. But she said she was worried that the center will have similarly harsh conditions and the same lack of access as the Anchorage jail.

Meanwhile, Choi, Martinez’s boss, said she’s concerned about how his detention will impact her business and her employees.

“Everybody is getting sad, like, depressed, I think,” Choi said. “And, you know, some people, they don't even want to work, even though they have a green card. You know, they’re just scared to work.”

Choi said she’s also pitching in to try to get Martinez back to Alaska.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/818a2bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0f%2F21%2Fcad574aa4eddaa48fe2d0b7f864a%2Fimg-7976.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 22:56:26.930002

The reporting uses internal ICE documents obtained by the Post that outline national expansion plans to allow the agency to detain over 107,000 people at once. That’s up from a capacity of some 54,500 at the beginning of the year, and almost 66,000 as of July.

Arizona facilities slated to be newly included are the Maricopa County Jail and the Marana Correctional Facility outside Tucson. Neither facility is currently in use for immigration detention.

Jordan Garcia, Colorado program coordinator with the American Friends Service Committee, says the way local facilities are contracted for federal use varies from state to state. But, local authorities, like cities and counties, have little control over federally-contracted facilities.

“People tend to get really frustrated when they don’t have local control, so the county itself wouldn’t have as much control over the facility if it’s a federally contracted facility,” he said. “People are like ‘oh, I really thought that we would have some sort of say of how things will go in our community,’ and then they get this facility that’s federally-contracted, and then they don’t have that decision-making power.”

An existing facility called the Central Arizona Florence Correctional Center, south of Phoenix, will also expand to get more beds, according to the reporting. A spokesperson with CoreCivic, the private prison company that operates the facility, said the company works within ICE's established procurement processes and directed capacity questions to the agency.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency's effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans' case.

Evans' arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department's E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

ICE's detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm. WMTW-TV reported Monday that Evans' agreement to a voluntary departure means he will be allowed to leave the U.S. at his own expense to avoid being deported.

Ramirez (IL-03) convened local faith leaders and community defense organizations to discuss the critical role faith communities play in supporting families impacted by the Trump Administration’s attacks and policies. From immigration defense and protection of workers to assisting with food and fighting the criminalization of unhoused neighbors, the leaders shed light on the work their communities have done and how they must stand stronger together to serve the most vulnerable.

During the interfaith convening, Ramirez and local organizations shared information to equip faith leaders to continue supporting neighbors during these challenging times.

“Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. It’s powerful to be in a room with faithful people who hope for a just future. In hard moments, when faith feels difficult, we must remember we are not alone and lean into what we know - that community keeps us safe,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “Now more than ever, it’s important that people see faith leaders and faith communities stepping into hope, faith, and action: declaring that we will love our neighbors, welcome the stranger, care for the vulnerable.”

The convening counted with the participation of the Public Policy Director at Arise Chicago Adam Kader, Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago Ahmed Rehab, Palenque LSNA’s Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, and Sanctuary Movement's Pastora Emma Lozano as panelists. The group shared their expertise with nearly 20 faith leaders of various religions and denominations.

“Sanctuary is not a crime, it’s a moral duty. Sanctuary is not only a protection, it’s about resistance. It’s about declaring every human being deserves dignity, safety, and belonging,” said Pastora Emma Lozano, Sanctuary Movement.

“I invite you all to join ARISE Chicago in defending our immigrant neighbors and coworkers, to exercise their rights, to work free from fear, and free from oppression,” added Adam Kader, Public Policy Director at ARISE Chicago, who invited participants to a mobilization action during Labor Day.

“Civil rights are a subset of human rights, and human rights are a subset of empathy for all creatures. What our movement is about is to wake us up from whatever division may exist, whatever fearmongering and terrorizing that happens–usually by really wealthy, privileged people that divide– to stand up together, here in the United States and abroad, for our common humanity and our common existence,” said Executive Director at CAIR-Chicago, Ahmed Rehab.

“As Christians, we follow a God that tells us all the time to welcome a stranger, to love our neighbor, to stand with the most vulnerable, and the Bible for us is clear on that. So I ask you: what does it mean when a stranger is not welcomed but is hunted in our streets? Or when a child sees flashing lights and doesn’t think of safety, but instead thinks of separation? This is an attack on the very image of God in our community,” expressed Rev. Juan Pablo Herrera, Palenque LSNA

""This order and this lawsuit are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza.","Several New York physicians are speaking out against what they say are inhumane conditions at an immigration holding facility in Lower Manhattan.

Monday, physicians from the nonprofit New York Doctors Coalition tried to get into 26 Federal Plaza, requesting access to assess conditions on the 10th floor. That's where the doctors say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an overcrowded and unsanitary holding facility for detained immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security calls it a processing center.

The doctors were turned away by security.

Last month, video released by the New York Immigration Coalition and verified by CBS News New York showed conditions on the 10th floor, although it was unclear when the footage was taken. The person taking the video was heard saying ""Look how they have us here, like dogs.""

""This building has been turned into a place of health abuse""

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from detaining people in spaces with fewer than 50 square feet per person, and calling for improved access to hygiene, providing sleeping mats and access to medical care.

""The building has been turned into a place of health abuse,"" Dr. Steve Auerbach of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""We've had observers that went to the 10th floor.""

""It is not a residential building. They are violating zoning laws,"" Auerbach added.

""They detained a 7-year-old last week. A 7-year-old. How is that helping anybody?"" Dr. Sonni Mun of New York Doctors Coalition said. ""I think the distress these families are going are similar to people who lose young family members.""

Several advocacy groups who rallied with the doctors Monday called for medical professionals independent of DHS to be allowed in. They told CBS News New York loved ones of those detained fear retaliation for speaking out publicly.

""Complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza,"" DHS says

New York Lawyers for the Public Interest described recent calls they've received.

""Some of the people do not have vital medications that they need to maintain their health. Some of the most alarming things we hear is not having access to HIV medications that they've been on for long term,"" Karina Albistegui Adler of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest said. ""We were contacted about a month ago about a young person who had open heart surgery ... they were detained without their medication that they needed to maintain their health ... unfortunately, by the time they reached us, they opted to leave because they were worried they would die in detention because they were feeling so sick.""

The temporary restraining order remains in place for about another week while the judge considers more longer term relief. DHS says it is appealing the order.

""This order and this lawsuit are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza. The fact of the matter here is the Trump administration is carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history and is removing the worst of the worst from American communities. Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. 26 Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans. ICE enforcement operations will continue at full speed to protect American communities from the worst of the worst, and DHS will appeal this order,"" a DHS spokesperson said.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/22/37fa77c1-fdc8-43e1-ad62-f0c7a7a1337d/thumbnail/1200x630/1c2436081538d5b3c54e8ef831013a32/new-gainer-5p-pkg-feder-wcbsejf7-hi-res-still-00-00-2623.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 22:56:39.845352

A blog post reportedly authored by Eric Lendrum celebrated the January 6 insurrection and compared the following fallout for conservatives to the Holocaust and slavery, Notus reported.

“American conservatives are, right now, on a course for being every bit as ostracized and alienated from broader society as Jews were in the years leading up to Nazi Germany,” he claimed in a 2021 blog post on American Greatness, a rightwing opinion and news site. Lendrum posted on the site until March of this year.

His podcast, The Right Take, is listed in the author’s description on the site. On one episode of the podcast, he said he liked watching videos of scared legislators during the Jan 6 insurrection.

“There’s something so gratifying about seeing the images of these members of Congress — especially the Democrats — crouching under their chairs, putting on those stupid, like, bubble masks, those anti-gas bubble masks, and then taking selfies,” a laughing Lendrum said just days after the Capitol riot.

In another episode, published in October 2022, Lendrum said immigrants put Europe at risk, while also backing the “great replacement theory.” The far-right theory claims that nonwhite immigrants are damaging the influence of white people.

“Given the direction of Europe right now, we could use a far-right government at this point,” said Lendrum.

On X, the account @realEricLendrum has argued for the removal of transgender “ideology” and compared asylum seekers to “scum.”

In another podcast episode, Lendrum referenced his brief period as a press assistant at the Interior Department during the first Trump administration, saying that he would only return to government if he could be closer to the president.

“If I could work more closely with him, that is the one case in which I would ever go back into government work,” said Lendrum, whose online profile was first reported by Notus. “Government work is not fun.”

The Independent has attempted to reach Lendrum for comment.

The DHS Office of Public Affairs states that a speechwriter at the department is responsible for preparing “speeches, talking points, editorials, Congressional testimony, video scripts, web content, and other written content for the Secretary and Deputy Secretary.” The department ranks as the largest federal law enforcement agency.

In one of the blog posts linked to Lendrum, he appeared to argue that conservatives were facing political oppression similar to that of slaves and victims of the Holocaust.

“It has been said that the most surefire way to create an authoritarian regime is to completely dehumanize a significant portion of the population, so that their subsequent enslavement by the state will not face any larger resistance. It was true during slavery, it was true during the Holocaust, and it is true now,” the blog post stated.

Responding to questions from The Independent, DHS shared a link to the text of the First Amendment.

The X account linked to Lendrum argued that the U.S. should treat immigrants as an “invading army.”

“They are not migrants. They are not ‘undocumented.’ They are an invading army. The largest invasion in American history,” one post stated in May 2023. “And what are you supposed to do with an invading army? Crush it, by any means necessary. That’s the #AmericaFirst way.”

Also in the blog post about January 6, the author said, “The Democrats were absolutely terrified — literally cowering under their seats, horrified at the prospect of mere peasants walking through the halls of their castle.”

The lawmakers, including Republicans, were escorted by Capitol Police through the Capitol complex.

“The truth is that they are grateful the events of that day unfolded as they did,” the post argued regarding the Democrats.

In a podcast episode published in April 2023, he said he would “always properly deadname t***** freaks.”

“I will keep calling them t******* because I know it’s derogatory, and I know they freakin’ hate it. That’s why I deadname them. That’s why I use their original pronouns,” he said. “You control the language. Don’t give these freaks an inch on the language.”

“We need to eradicate transgenderism. Wipe it off the face of the Earth. Destroy it. Get rid of it,” he added. “As a disclaimer, I’m not saying to wipe the people out. I’m not saying get rid of the people. I’m saying eliminate the ideology. Cure these people.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/18/18/42/eric-lendrum.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-08-18 22:56:45.058916

Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth added that VOCA funding is directly responsible for keeping things like domestic violence shelters open, and they're now under threat.
Nationwide, VOCA funds go to help nearly 9 million crime victims each year, providing compensation for some 200,000 victims claims.
""VOCA funding is hugely important to the statewide domestic and sexual violence services system,"" said Oregon State Representative Tawna Sanchez.
Sanctuaries under fire The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds.","SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is joining a group of 21 AGs in suing to unlock federal funding for programs meant to help victims of crime, funding which the Trump administration has withheld from ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions across the country.

The funding in question is authorized by Congress under the Victims of Crime Act and distributed through grants to organizations which support victims and survivors of crime. VOCA has been law since 1984, but the Trump administration is now conditioning that funding on states agreeing to assist with federal immigration enforcement.

""This is yet another attempt to place unlawful conditions on federal funds coming into Oregon to advance the President's unpopular agenda, this time at the expense of crime victims and survivors,"" Rayfield said. ""These grants support services like the counselor who picks up the phone at 2 a.m., the shelter bed that keeps a mom and her kids safe tonight, or the advocate who walks a victim through the court process.""

STRIAGHT TALK: Oregon AG Dan Rayfield addresses legal challenges on Trump's executive orders

Last week, a sexual assault resource center in Beaverton had to abruptly pause all services due to the cutoff of federal funds, Rayfield said during a press conference on Monday. There is no timeline for reopening.

Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth added that VOCA funding is directly responsible for keeping things like domestic violence shelters open, and they're now under threat. His office will need to cut more than half of its victim advocates as well, he said.

""Let me be clear about what (this) means: When you cut victim services, you're choosing to have more crime,"" Wentworth said. ""A victim without support is a victim who cannot testify. A survivor without a place to go is a survivor who is forced to return to her abuser.""

Melissa Erlbaum of Clackamas Women's Services said that a prior 40% cut to VOCA funds had already forced them to lay off staff and reduce services. But even those reduced funds are now out of reach, she said, forcing programs to pause or shut down entirely.

""We are at the perfect storm of funding catastrophe,"" said Jenny Gilmore-Robinson with children's aid organization CARES Northwest. ""Loss of federal funding, increased competition for private grants, financial uncertainty among donors; and, as a health care clinic with 75% of our pediatric patients on Oregon Health Plan, we're also potentially facing cuts to Medicaid.""

According to Rayfield's office, 146 organizations in Oregon rely on VOCA grants, and they stand to lose $15 million in 2025 alone. VOCA isn't funded by taxpayer dollars, but by criminal fines.

Nationwide, VOCA funds go to help nearly 9 million crime victims each year, providing compensation for some 200,000 victims claims.

""VOCA funding is hugely important to the statewide domestic and sexual violence services system,"" said Oregon State Representative Tawna Sanchez. ""The reduction in these funds is likely to have a devastating effect on the programs that serve some of the most vulnerable populations in our state.""

In 1987, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a sanctuary law. What it means in practice is that state and local officials and law enforcement are barred from assisting with federal immigration enforcement. The law prohibits the use of any state or local resources to ""detect and apprehend"" people whose only crime was being in violation of immigration laws.

The states suing to release VOCA funding argue that Congress would need to approve the placement of any additional restrictions on those funds, and that the Trump administration is violating the separation of powers by imposing its own political conditions on the funds.

In this lawsuit, Oregon joins the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Sanctuaries under fire

The battle over federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions goes far beyond VOCA funds. In a letter sent to Gov. Tina Kotek on Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a warning shot over Oregon's sanctuary status.

Bondi threatened investigations, civil or criminal legal actions, and the leveraging of federal contracts or funds if Oregon doesn't aid federal immigration enforcement efforts — which is, again, prohibited under Oregon law.

""You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,"" Bondi's letter reads. ""This ends now.""

As of Monday morning, Kotek's office told KGW that they were reviewing the AG's letter, but they argued that Oregon's sanctuary law does not obstruct federal immigration efforts.

""I will fight for the safety and prosperity of every Oregonian, from recent immigrants to people who have been here for generations,"" Kotek said in a statement. ""Threats like this undermine our values and our right to govern ourselves. We will not be bullied into doing the federal government's job of immigration enforcement.""

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson received a letter from Bondi as well over the Evergreen State's sanctuary status. Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said that the DOJ has no legal standing, calling the letter a threat.

""I don't take those threats lightly,"" Brown said. ""I mean, to have the AG of the United States making threats against local officials is absurd, and should be noteworthy for everyone that's paying attention.""

Ferguson posted on social media that he would respond to Bondi on Tuesday, but said that Washington has no intention of turning its back on its values.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb/20250424T233950/e2472f22-06b5-46e4-b570-00a00ed55feb_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 20:56:29.009225

According to HRW, while the protests had largely been peaceful, the law enforcement officers frequently used a range of “less lethal” weapons, such as tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades, at protestors without apparent justification and clear, audible dispersal orders or warnings. HRW stated these less deadly weapons can still potentially cause serious injury and death.

Ida Sawyer–the crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch–stated, “Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.”

HRW specifically documented 39 cases of journalists injured by law enforcement, including Lauren Tomasi, an Australian journalist from 9News, who was fired at by a police officer using a kinetic impact projectile, resulting in a bruise on her leg. The events prompted the injured journalists and protesters to file lawsuits against the County of Los Angeles and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

HRW further stated that the use of force by the law enforcement violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Personnel, as well as the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

In particular, Article 21 of ICCPR permits restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly only in limited circumstances that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect public order, public safety, and the rights of others. Moreover, the UN Basic Principles stipulate that law enforcement officials should first use non-violent means to disperse protests, and avoid using force at all to disperse non-violent protests, regardless of whether the authorities consider the protests illegal.

Section 13652 of California’s Penal Code additionally forbids law enforcement from using “kinetic energy projectiles” to disperse a protest, except “to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury” or to “bring any objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely under control.”

Thousands of people protested in and around Los Angeles between June 6 and 14 in response to the Trump administration’s orders to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to increase daily arrests of undocumented immigrants.

OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine (AP) — A Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities has agreed to voluntarily leave the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Monday.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

Officials with Old Orchard Beach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.

ICE officials said in July that Evans overstayed his visa and unlawfully attempted to purchase a firearm.

As the Trump administration stepped in this month, announcing that it was taking control of law enforcement in the city, immigration enforcement has emerged as a key element.

Some said they had watched violence intensify on the very streets where they work overnight shifts or walk on early mornings as they open up shops.

But in recent days, workers, small business owners and street vendors say they have found themselves at the center of two crackdowns: one on crime, another on illegal immigration. With Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appearing alongside National Guard members and federal agents as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on crime in Washington, these workers say they worry that the federal show of force may only complicate efforts to lower violence in the city.

Immigrants interviewed in and near Washington in recent days described a new sense of anxiety, whether they were undocumented or had legal status in this country. And some said they worried that the result could be the opposite of the president’s intended goals, fracturing relationships between immigrants and local authorities, deterring immigrants from reporting crimes and, in the end, making the city less safe.

“My friend told me to be careful because they are squarely picking up everyone, simply for having a Hispanic face,” said Aracely, a legal resident who was wiping windows outside a furniture store near U Street. Like many of those interviewed, she declined to provide her full name for fear of retaliation from the authorities or of reprimands from employers.

As the Trump administration stepped in this month, announcing that it was taking control of law enforcement in the city, immigration enforcement has emerged as a key element. Of 308 people arrested since the federal push began on Aug. 7, 135 were unauthorized immigrants, according to the White House.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has also sought to end D.C. policies that bar local police from most collaboration with federal immigration authorities and from arrests of people solely for being in the country illegally. That issue is still being contested as part of a court battle expected to continue this week, but a federal judge allowed the administration on Friday to require the city’s help on immigration enforcement for now.

The administration threatens to withhold the funds unless states agree to unlawfully imposed immigration enforcement requirements on congressionally authorized grants for victims—jeopardizing more than $34 million slated for Washington programs in fiscal year 2025.

“Nothing is safe from the Trump administration’s political attacks—including funds to help people at their most vulnerable, after they’ve survived a crime,” Brown said. “As Attorney General, public safety is one of my top priorities, and that includes ensuring the federal government makes good on its obligations to crime victims.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. The programs fund such things as victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more.

These funding streams—totaling more than $1 billion a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly 9 million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year.

In Washington, the grants in jeopardy include an anticipated award of $29.2 million for fiscal year 2025 to support emergency shelters, mental health services, child advocacy groups, and organizations for victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and human trafficking. Loss of the funds will likely require cuts to these and other services.

Also at risk is $4.8 million slated for Washington in fiscal year 2025 to provide benefits directly to crime victims. The money helps victims with everything from medical expenses for injuries resulting from criminal acts to grief counseling and burial expenses.

Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice, has declared that states and the victims and survivors they serve will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the administration’s political agenda.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance—the separation of powers, and federalism. As such, Brown and the coalition are requesting the court permanently enjoin the Trump administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

ICE will use the new detention facility at Fort Bliss as a hub for deportations, primarily to countries in Central America, Escobar said.
Congressional representatives continue to be blocked from carrying out oversight at ICE detention centers, including those run by private companies.","U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar is the first U.S. lawmaker to carryout an oversight visit inside the new East Montana ICE detention facility on Fort Bliss in El Paso.

Intentions to build the soft-sided facility were first announced in February 2025, and a spot was selected the following month.

It will be the largest facility in the U.S. once completed, holding up to 5,000 immigrants scheduled for removal.

The new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility on Fort Bliss is now open, U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar said following the first visit to the massive facility.

Escobar, D-El Paso, discussed the conditions in the facility at a news conference after she spent more than two hours touring the East Montana Detention Facility on Monday, Aug. 18.

She described the facility as ""massive"" and said ICE officials were transparent with her and her team's questions. Escobar added that she has encouraged ICE to grant access to the facility for El Paso County and city officials, news reporters and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso.

The facility began to receive immigrants on Aug. 1, Escobar said. There are currently over 1,000 immigrants being held at the facility, but Escobar said she was unable to speak with any detainees.

Escobar is the first lawmaker to tour the inside of the new soft-sided immigration detention facility. U.S. Senator John Cornyn carried out a brief ""windshield"" tour of the facility on Aug. 11.

Concerns with East Montana detention facility

The expansive facility on the periphery of Fort Bliss is currently being run by generators, but there are plans to connect it to the El Paso electric grid. The facility also includes what Escobar described as ""a very highly sophisticated medical unit.""

But Escobar also raised several concerns about the facility, including that it could place a strain on the El Paso community. She also argued that the $1.24 billion, which the project received through the approval of President Donald Trump's ""One, Big Beautiful bill,"" could have gone to the El Paso community to improve conditions in the Borderland.

""I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community,"" Escobar said. ""There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.""

Lastly, Escobar also raised concerns with the lack of trained ICE agents at the facility, which is an expansive area run by contractors, creating concern for oversight of the conditions at the site. She said that she would raise this issue with the Appropriations Committee and internally with members of Congress.

""When you have a facility this big that is operating to detain as many people as they are detaining now and then hope to detain in the future, I have always been very deeply uncomfortable and opposed to privately run facilities,"" Escobar said. ""I think it's far too easy for standards to slip when there are private facilities. I think private facilities far too frequently are operating with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.""

The largest detention facility in the U.S.

Once completed, the detention facility on Fort Bliss will be the largest in the country.

The facility has also been dubbed “Lone Star Lockup” and ""Camp East Montana"" by political leaders.

The Trump administration announced the construction of the facility in February, and officials confirmed in March that the facility would be constructed on the site between the park-and-ride and the Texas National Guard building on Montana Avenue. The facility is about a 10-minute drive from the El Paso Processing Center.

The Trump administration has sought to expand the infrastructure for holding immigrants for deportation.

The El Paso sector, which stretches from New Mexico through El Paso County, will house one of the largest detention infrastructures in the U.S. The sector will have the capacity to hold over 8,000 people in the four ICE detention centers in the region once the Fort Bliss detention center is completed.

ICE will use the new detention facility at Fort Bliss as a hub for deportations, primarily to countries in Central America, Escobar said.

Congressional democrats sue Trump administration

Escobar is currently part of a lawsuit against the Trump administration for blocking her and other congressional representatives from carrying out surprise oversight visits to ICE detention facilities. The lawsuit was filed on July 30.

Members of Congress have the right to carry out surprise oversight visits of facilities. But the Trump administration placed new restrictions on congressional oversight visits in June 2025.

Congressional representatives continue to be blocked from carrying out oversight at ICE detention centers, including those run by private companies. Most recently, U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Austin, was blocked from visiting a detention center in the state capitol city on Friday, Aug. 15.","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PTX1/85714709007-180820256-d-8-a-6446.jpg?crop=5246,2951,x0,y273&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-18 18:56:41.882744

Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Detroit Field Office recently met with a Catholic migrant aid group and a Democratic lawmaker to discuss questions about whether ICE is prioritizing deporting violent criminals and concerns about agents wearing masks during raids.

Acting field office director for Detroit ICE, Kevin Raycraft, and other ICE officials invited Catholics — including leaders of the nonprofit Strangers No Longer — to the Detroit headquarters on Aug. 12 after Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, intervened to secure a meeting.

Strangers No Longer first requested the meeting in July by marching from Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church to the ICE headquarters with several hundred demonstrators, many of whom were Catholic. The leaders had hoped to meet with Raycraft and deliver a letter outlining their concerns.

Congressman Thanedar told CNA the leaders “weren’t allowed to enter the ICE facility” in July and “that letter was not accepted by ICE” at the time.

Thanedar was later able to arrange the August meeting, which included a priest, several nuns, and leaders of Strangers No Longer, who presented their letter and spoke with ICE agents for about an hour.

In its letter, the group expressed concerns about “face masks and the lack of identification” by agents during raids, along with “actions carried out without a federal warrant.” The group also alleged a lack of “communication with local law enforcement” before operations are carried out.

Strangers No Longer further criticized “the arrest of individuals who have committed no felony” and alleged that ICE “appears to be targeting men for incarceration and expedited removal, leaving women and children (many of whom are U.S. citizens) behind to ‘fend for themselves.’”

“This pattern of separating families is having a devastating impact on those left behind,” the letter added.

Victoria Kovari, one of the organizers of the July demonstration who attended the meeting, told CNA that the agents “were very respectful” and listened to “these stories … [about] how it’s impacting our community” but did not give any indication they would make any adjustments to immigration enforcement.

“We wanted this to be a dialogue,” Kovari said. “We wanted them to understand us and we want to understand them.”

Kovari said she spoke to ICE about cases in which agents arrived in unmarked vehicles wearing masks and carrying rifles to arrest people who “hadn’t committed any violent felonies.” She also spoke about parishioners who hadn’t committed any felonies “being picked up” by ICE for deportation.

“We really hope that they focus these [enforcement] priorities on the more difficult cases of gang members, drug cartel [members], drug dealers, violent offenders, and [work] with our local law enforcement,” she added.

“That’s what would really help our communities,” Kovari said.

Thanedar similarly told CNA the ICE agents “listened to us” and offered to help connect Strangers No Longer with some detainees, but that there was no indication they would make policy changes.

“Their response remained that these people — anybody that has broken the law — [ICE] will go after, and they were not willing to commit to prioritizing the hardened criminals and the people who are gang members, like the president has said,” he continued.

“What we are seeing lately is ICE is focusing more on migrants that have been working 20 years in the hospitality industry, working as cooks, doing landscaping, [and doing] work that makes our lives better,” Thanedar alleged.

Kovari added that Raycraft told the organization that many criticisms of ICE are based on “media manipulation,” which she said made the conversation more difficult.

CNA reached out to Detroit ICE, the national ICE headquarters, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment but did receive a response by the time of publication.

In a July 22 op-ed in the Detroit News, three weeks before the meeting, Raycraft addressed some of the concerns raised in the Strangers No Longer letter.

Raycraft said agents “identify themselves with visible markings, badges, or other identifiers” but “do not wear uniforms or drive marked vehicles.” He contested that assaults on agents have increased by about 830% and “our officers wear masks to protect their families.”

The op-ed states that agents follow the law when making arrests. He said the law allows for “the issuance of warrants upon a finding of probable cause that someone is [unlawfully] present” and works with courts to obtain warrants for other criminal matters. It adds that agents do not need to display the warrants.

Raycraft also said that ICE “routinely coordinates with local law enforcement agencies” and that they “know where to reach us … if there is an issue regarding communication.”",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/detroitprocession.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-08-18 18:56:46.985041

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court, seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities, or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by ICE because of their immigration status.

""Law enforcement officers...used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,"" said Ida Sawyer, the rights group's crisis, conflict and arms director.

The protests erupted on June 6, in anger at raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has been ordered by the Trump administration to target undocumented migrants across the sprawling, heavily Latino city.

The demonstrations were mainly confined to a small section of downtown Los Angeles. Largely non-violent, they at times spiraled into chaotic scenes that Trump pounced on to send 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines into the city -- a move loudly protested by local officials.

Compiling the report, Human Rights Watch staff observed protests, visited locations of immigration raids in mid-June, and interviewed dozens of people.

The report documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers injured protesters and journalists but warned that the ""actual number is most likely much higher.""

On one occasion, a police officer shot three people at ""very close range with kinetic impact projectiles,"" leaving them in serious pain for days.

""Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: 'I'm going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,'"" the report found.

Other reported injuries included broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

Paris on Sunday said he had been in contact with law enforcement officials, including Attorney General William Tong’s office.
“We have seen far too much violence and death this year to ignore this kind of reckless rhetoric by federal law enforcement,” Tong said.","STAMFORD, CT — A social media post has resulted in a Connecticut state representative finding himself at the center of a political firestorm involving the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the hundreds of social media commenters.

“People have called me the N-word online, they’ve called my wife a b**** and it just keeps getting worse,” said state Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford. He said multiple posts have called for his arrest and some have gone as far as to target his grandparents.

Paris, who has been in office since 2021, on Friday posted an Instagram story saying he had been informed of multiple reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the district he represents. He went on to urge residents “to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety.”

The story is no longer visible online as Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours.

He also encouraged residents to “look out for one another” and seek out legal and community resources if needed.

The post was soon shared by the X (formerly Twitter) page “Libs of TikTok” which falsely stated he was “doxxing” ICE’s live location and demanded his arrest. Doxxing is the sharing of people’s personal information without their consent, often with malicious intent.

Comments on the post called for Paris to be jailed, advocated vigilante justice and referred to him using racist language and as a DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) politician. Others called for his execution and requested the home and work address of his family members.

The backlash stepped up when ICE shared the post on the department’s official X page, and also tagged the U.S. Justice Department.

Paris on Sunday said he had been in contact with law enforcement officials, including Attorney General William Tong’s office. In a statement, Tong said federal law enforcement “should know and does know what First Amendment-protected speech is.”

Tong said the implied legal threat was “dangerous, disturbing and unacceptable” and that online harassment and threats against legislators and public servants don’t stop with words.

“We have seen far too much violence and death this year to ignore this kind of reckless rhetoric by federal law enforcement,” Tong said. “Please stop. Before anyone else gets hurt.”

House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed his support for Paris, saying “the message of ‘neighbors looking out for neighbors’ is powerful and not uncommon for an elected official.”

Ritter added “any threats and racist taunts are disgusting” and said those responsible would be held accountable.

Paris said his own situation was mild compared to the fear that undocumented people in the country live with every day, and said he does not regret making the original post.",https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/corey-paris-jr-20250729-1200x900-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 17:57:21.846787

But they seemed to take solace in the Trump administration’s request that federal judges release transcripts of grand jury testimony in three cases related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.
2 Republican, suggested that such a move might help alleviate concerns, adding that the House could not address the Epstein files while the courts were weighing in.
Instead, they have turned to legal maneuvers meant to force the Justice Department to provide the Epstein files to Congress.
On Monday, he told reporters he was confident that “we’re going to get the documents,” citing “productive” conversations with the Justice Department.","When House Republican leaders rushed to leave Washington for a long August break, they seemed desperate to quell the anger among their supporters about the Trump administration’s backtracking on a promise to release files related to its investigation of the accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

But halfway through a five-week congressional recess, the clamor shows little sign of quieting. While Republicans had hoped that legal rulings might insulate them from having to confront the issue, the courts have yet to intervene. Back in their districts, lawmakers have continued to face questions about the Epstein investigation from their constituents. And the Justice Department, which ignored a Friday deadline from Senate Democrats and is set to miss another on Tuesday to comply with a bipartisan subpoena to provide the materials to Congress, has yet to release anything.

On Monday, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said that the Justice Department would begin sharing its Epstein records with his panel by Friday. He also suggested that the release of the documents would take some time, all but ensuring that questions about the Epstein affair will drag on for weeks.

At the same time, Democrats, in some cases with the help of Republicans, have laid a series of procedural traps that will make it all but impossible for the G.O.P. to avoid confronting the issue again when Congress reconvenes in September.

Lawmakers of both parties concede that the Trump administration could quiet the furor over the Epstein files on Capitol Hill and nationwide by simply releasing them to the public. Mr. Comer’s statement on Monday was the only public indication to date that it might do so.

All the while, several efforts connected to Mr. Epstein, a disgraced financier who was found dead in his prison cell in 2019, have been percolating and threaten to disrupt a busy month in which Congress also faces a Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government and avert a shutdown.

Chief among them may be a maneuver led by Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who is a frequent Trump critic, to try to force a floor vote on the release of the files. Such a vote would thrust Republicans into a politically thorny position between Mr. Trump and constituents who are unhappy with the administration’s handling of the case.

Before leaving Washington, Mr. Massie and Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, filed what is known as a discharge petition, which allows any member of the House to force legislation to the floor if a majority of members — 218 — sign on. Because of arcane procedural rules, the pair cannot start collecting signatures until they return in September, but they appear to have more than enough support to succeed.

The timing all but guaranteed that the issue would hang over lawmakers throughout the August recess and that Republican leaders would be forced to address it when they returned. While they could try to table the effort, several rank-and-file Republicans earlier this year blocked a similar attempt to circumvent a measure that had majority support.

So far, 43 other lawmakers, 11 of them Republicans, have signed on to Mr. Massie and Mr. Khanna’s initiative. Last week, the pair announced plans for a news conference with victims of Mr. Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, to be held outside the Capitol on lawmakers’ second day back from their break.

Last month, Democrats effectively paralyzed the committee — and by extension, Republicans’ legislative agenda — with the threat of such votes. Facing pressure from their constituents, Republicans were reluctant to take up the issue, essentially forcing the committee to adjourn and keeping substantive legislation from advancing.

Matthew Bonaccorsi, a spokesman for Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the panel, said the committee had “no plans to let up pressure on this until Republicans release the Epstein files.”

Republican leaders never found a solution to the committee’s impasse, which led them to send the House home a day ahead of schedule. But they seemed to take solace in the Trump administration’s request that federal judges release transcripts of grand jury testimony in three cases related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.

Both Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, suggested that such a move might help alleviate concerns, adding that the House could not address the Epstein files while the courts were weighing in.

“That process is underway right now,” Mr. Johnson said last month. “Now, we’ve got to zealously guard that and protect it and make sure it’s happening. And if it doesn’t, then we’ll take appropriate action when everybody returns here.”

Yet so far, federal judges in two of those three cases have denied the government’s requests. A judge overseeing Ms. Maxwell’s case said that the Justice Department’s suggestion that grand jury testimony “would bring to light meaningful new information” was “demonstrably false.” A third judge, who oversaw Mr. Epstein’s 2019 case, is still considering whether to unseal grand jury materials connected to that prosecution.

And Republicans and Democrats alike have argued that the grand jury testimony falls far short of the promise that Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top officials had made. Instead, they have turned to legal maneuvers meant to force the Justice Department to provide the Epstein files to Congress.

This month, the Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to Ms. Bondi asking the Justice Department to give the committee its files related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell by Aug. 19.

Mr. Comer, a staunch Trump ally, was forced to send the subpoena after a small group of Republicans joined Democrats in voting to approve it at a subcommittee meeting last month. On Monday, he told reporters he was confident that “we’re going to get the documents,” citing “productive” conversations with the Justice Department.

The committee also sent subpoenas to former officials who were linked to the Justice Department at times that it was grappling with legal matters related to Mr. Epstein. After Mr. Barr, several other officials are scheduled to be deposed over the next two months, and each hearing is likely to generate renewed attention on the Epstein case.

Even as the Justice Department told Mr. Comer it would release the files, it did not suggest a clear timeline for doing so. Democratic lawmakers will most likely highlight any delays, forcing more attention to the issue.

Senate Democrats have already started to pressure Republicans over the matter using a little-known and infrequently tested maneuver to try to force Ms. Bondi to turn over the Epstein files.

Under a provision of federal law, government agencies are required to hand over relevant information if any five members of the Senate’s chief oversight committee requests it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and seven other Democrats asked the Justice Department to give them Epstein-related materials by Aug. 15. They also asked that a briefing be held for the committee’s staff before the end of the month.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/18/multimedia/18dc-cong-epstein-vmwt/18dc-cong-epstein-vmwt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 16:57:08.923850

Another teacher said, “For me, to be standing here today to advocate for one of my students to be released from ICE, it’s just horrible.”","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has abducted several New York City public school students since May, sparking outrage among community members and elected officials.

The City reports that on August 12, federal agents abducted and detained a 7-year-old child, her 19-year-old brother, and their mother when they went to an immigration check-in at the Manhattan federal courthouse — marking the first known ICE arrest in New York City of a child under the age of 18, according to The City, which was the first news outlet to report on the case.

The courthouse where the family was abducted, also known by its address, 26 Federal Plaza, has become a symbol of Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

Masked agents roam the hallways, abducting people who show up for mandatory immigration appointments or hearings. The 10th floor of the building has been transformed into “hell,” according to one person who was detained there for six days. After the American Civil Liberties Union and others filed suit, a judge ordered ICE to provide people with sleeping mats, period products, towels, and soap, although ICE can still refuse them toothbrushes.

ICE sent the child, a Queens public school student, and her mother to a detention facility in Texas, and her brother to Delaney Hall, an ICE jail in New Jersey run by the private prison company GEO Group.

The girl’s school principal and elected officials have demanded her release.

“We are fighting to get this family back together and will not stop until they are safely back in their community and home in Queens,” State Assembly Member Catalina Cruz and New York City Councilmember Shekar Krishnan said in a joint statement.

ICE has abducted several students after they attended routine immigration appointments or hearings — a 20-year-old student identified in the press as Dylan, a Venezuelan public school student; Derlis Snaider Chusin Toaquiza, an 11th grader who attends high school in Queens; and Mamadou Diallo, a 20-year-old asylum seeker from Guinea.

On June 8, ICE agents abducted Derlis Snaider Chusin Toaquiza, who was 19 at the time, when he went to a court appearance for his asylum application. He was detained at 26 Federal Plaza for several days and then sent to an ICE jail in Texas. He told his attorneys that while at 26 Federal Plaza, he was only given one meal a day and had to sleep sitting up because it was so crowded.

More than a month later, a Texas immigration judge set his bond at $20,000, which was paid for by the Envision Freedom Fund (formerly the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund) and he was released. On July 18, he finally arrived home on a Greyhound bus; his family greeted him at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown Manhattan.

Community members, educators, and elected officials have rallied around the students and their families.

“Mamadou did the right thing,” City Councilmember Rita Joseph said at a rally demanding his release. “He showed up for his routine check in and he was abducted.”

At least two of his teachers attended the rally.

“He’s a very bright, sweet, respectful young man that was going to a court date that was unjustly taken,” one teacher told CBS News.

Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants.","Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.

So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.

Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.”

McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.

“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.

Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.

“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.

It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.

Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.

The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.

Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.

“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”

The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.

The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.

The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks.

‘The most heinous acts’

“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.

Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”

Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.

The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.

“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.

In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.

Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo is asking for a judge to order her release on bond, which an immigration court judge granted a month ago, so that she can reunite with her family and help take care of her children.

This is the second case challenging Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that the ACLU of Nebraska has brought in recent weeks. More impacted community members are detained in the same unjust circumstances.

Carmona-Lorenzo has been in the United States for more than 25 years. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors. One of the adult children is currently in college but is now considering pausing his education to help support his family. The other is serving in the military.

ICE agents detained Carmona-Lorenzo and dozens of her coworkers in the June raid at Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha. She is currently four hours away from her family at Lincoln County Detention Center in North Platte. Although an immigration court judge granted Carmona-Lorenzo release on bond on July 15, she remains in detention due to an automatic stay issued by ICE . Her lawsuit argues that her continued detention extends beyond ICE's legal authority and violates her right to due process.

Carmona-Lorenzo's case follows a lawsuit that the ACLU of Nebraska announced earlier this month challenging nearly identical conduct. In that case, ICE blocked the release of another Nebraska mother who had been granted bond, seemingly based on new ‘interim guidance’ that asserts nearly all immigrants are ineligible for release on bond. The ACLU of Nebraska says that these back-to-back cases highlight the urgent need for immigration authorities to comply with constitutional requirements and respect immigration court judges’ bond determinations.

Speaking through a Spanish interpreter, Carmona-Lorenzo said:

“I wish no one had to live through this. It is horrible. I hope God gives me an opportunity to stay with my family and see my children graduate. I do not ask for anything else but to remain in the country to experience what I have worked so hard to accomplish for my children.”

Christopher Pacheco-Carmona, one of the plaintiff’s sons, said:

“It’s not something that I was ready to face. The impact that this has had on my family has been, to put it into simple terms, it’s just been tough. It’s tough on all of us. [...] Honestly, it’s the only thing I think about right now is my mom being home, and that day can’t come soon enough.”

Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director at the ACLU of Nebraska, said:

“Our client was granted bond by the Immigration Judge and has met every requirement for release, yet ICE is holding her without any individualized reason and without giving her a fair chance to challenge this decision. Due process is not a suggestion; it is a constitutional right. We are committed to ending these unlawful detentions and ensuring our client can return to her family.”

Like many of the people taken by ICE in the June Omaha raid, Carmona-Lorenzo has no criminal convictions and was a key earner for her family.

Pregnant women were frequently denied medical care, the report found. One detainee miscarried alone in a hospital room after staff delayed treatment for days, while others were told to “just drink water” instead of receiving exams. Attorneys reported clients waiting weeks for appointments that were later canceled.

Children as young as two — including U.S. citizens — were also mistreated, according to the investigation. A girl recovering from brain surgery was detained without access to follow-up care, while another child undergoing cancer treatment was deported without seeing a doctor. In one case, a U.S. citizen child vomited blood in custody; a guard allegedly responded, “Just give the girl a cracker”.

Most reports of abuse originated in Texas, Georgia, and California, with facilities run by DHS and private contractors accounting for the majority of complaints. The investigation also cited records of sexual assaults at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California and the South Texas ICE Processing Center.

Ossoff has pressed DHS, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon for answers, demanding transparency on detention conditions, including the use of federal prisons and military sites such as Guantánamo Bay to hold migrants. He warned that administration efforts to lower ICE detention standards and restart family detention “risk systemic violations of basic human rights.”

“This is an active and ongoing investigation,” the report states, adding that the 510 credible reports represent only a fraction of potential abuses still unreported or undocumented.

ICE arrested Old Orchard Beach Police Department reserve Officer Jon Luke Evans, of Jamaica, on July 25, as part of the agency’s effort to step up immigration enforcement. Officials with the town and police department have said federal authorities previously told them Evans was legally authorized to work in the U.S.

An ICE representative reached by telephone told The Associated Press on Monday that a judge has granted voluntary departure for Evans and that he could leave as soon as that day. The representative did not provide other details about Evans’ case.

Evans’ arrest touched off a dispute between Old Orchard Beach officials and ICE. Police Chief Elise Chard has said the department was notified by federal officials that Evans was legally permitted to work in the country, and that the town submitted information via the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program prior to Evans’ employment. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin then accused the town of “reckless reliance” on the department’s E-Verify program.

E-Verify is an online system that allows employers to check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S.

The town is aware of reports that Evans plans to leave the country voluntarily, Chard said Monday.

“The town reiterates its ongoing commitment to meeting all state and federal laws regarding employment,” Chard said in a statement. “We will continue to rely on the I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form and the E-Verify database to confirm employment eligibility.”

ICE’s detainee lookup website said Monday that Evans was being held at the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. However, a representative for Wyatt said Evans had been transferred to an ICE facility in Burlington, Massachusetts. ICE officials did not respond to requests for comment on the discrepancy. It was unclear if Evans was represented by an attorney, and a message left for him at the detention facility was not returned.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/60c48c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1440x810+0+111/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F4c%2F03%2F154eef416b096f1c38a6db90d7e5%2F1dd11c7869494ce88e063c87a6cec549,N,,2025-08-18 16:57:15.919719

In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts.
The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security.
That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.
The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.","Federal assault charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver should be thrown out just as similar charges facing dozens of people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol were tossed, McIver’s lawyers argue in a new court filing.

McIver, a Democrat accused of shoving officers during a melee at a migrant jail in Newark in May, said there is no “conduct-based justification” for the U.S. Department of Justice dismissing cases against 160 people involved in the Jan. 6 riot but continuing to prosecute her for allegedly violating the same statute.

“Her alleged conduct was manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray. Some of those defendants had significant criminal histories. Some admitted that they engaged in their assaultive conduct as part of an effort to overturn an election. Some escalated their threats in the subsequent days. Some bragged about their exploits and vowed that they would do it again,” one of the new filings says.

McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting or impeding officers while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was arrested May 9 outside of immigration detention center Delaney Hall. Prosecutors say McIver, who says she was there with two other members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit, interfered as federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka for trespassing (prosecutors dropped the charge against Baraka days later).

McIver, who was elected to Congress last year, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A judge set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10.

In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts. Her lawyers argue the confrontation was provoked by agents who escalated the situation, that her inspection of Delaney Hall was a legislative act that she cannot be prosecuted over, and that evidence cited in the indictment is contradictory to video footage of the episode shared by the Department of Homeland Security. McIver also wants a judge to order the Department of Homeland Security to delete social media posts that McIver’s attorneys say harm her ability to have a fair trial.

“Individually and collectively, those statements are extraordinarily prejudicial: they unequivocally declare Congresswoman McIver’s guilt; they assail the defenses DHS expects her to assert; they demean her as a ‘gutter politician’ responsible for purportedly escalating rates of assault on ICE agents; and they attempt to associate her with ‘Murderers, Rapists, Suspected Terrorists, and Gang Members’ supposedly housed in the detention facility that the Congresswoman inspected on May 9, 2025, as part of her congressionally authorized oversight responsibility,” one of the filings says.

The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security. Attorneys for McIver, who is seen in the videos pushing two agents during a chaotic scuffle, call her actions a “modest, proportional, and reactive response to a flood of armed and marked ICE agents.” Federal prosecutors previously said she acted as a “human shield” preventing Baraka’s arrest.

One of McIver’s arguments for dismissal of the indictment focuses on whether her prosecution violates the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which grants members of Congress broad immunity for legislative acts. McIver, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, “unquestionably had congressional authority” to conduct oversight on government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, her attorneys argue.

Putting McIver on trial for constitutionally vested duties would deter other Congress members from oversight and “imperil the separation of powers,” that filing says.

“That sort of intimidation of independent legislative prerogatives is exactly the evil that legislative immunity was designed to prevent,” her attorneys wrote.

McIver’s filings cite a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 2016 that found against then-Sen. Bob Menendez’s arguments that he was indicted over legislative acts protected by the speech and debates clause. That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.

“Her sole purpose was to fulfill her constitutional and statutory responsibility of Executive Branch oversight,” they said.

One of the lawmakers who visited Delaney Hall on May 9 with McIver was Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), the former senator’s son.

McIver’s attorneys also argue that legislators conducting oversight amid escalating immigration enforcement tactics from the Trump administration “have been met with alarming resistance.” They point to Baraka’s arrest, the detention of California Sen. Alex Padilla after questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference, and New York City Comptroller Brad Landler’s arrest at an immigration court.

“If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities. The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0JS13795_1-2048x1518.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 15:57:03.119226

The lawsuit filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their immigration status.

The lawsuit asks that the conditions be thrown out, arguing that the administration and the agency are overstepping their constitutional and administrative authority.

The lawsuit also argues that the requirements are not permitted or outlined in the Victims of Crime Act, known as VOCA, and would interfere with policies created to ensure victims and witnesses report crimes without fear of deportation.

“These people did not ask for this status as a crime victim. They don’t breakdown neatly across partisan lines, but they share one common trait, which is that they’ve suffered an unimaginable trauma,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said during a video news conference Monday, calling the administration's threat to withhold funds “the most heinous act” he’s seen in politics.

The federal conditions were placed on VOCA funding, which provides more than a billion dollars annually to states for victims compensation programs and grants that fund victims assistance organizations. VOCA funding comes entirely from fines and penalties in federal court cases, not from tax dollars.

Every state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. VOCA covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.

The funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.

Advocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets.

“The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who also joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “These grants were created to help survivors heal and recover, and we will fight to ensure they continue to serve that purpose … We will not be bullied into abandoning any of our residents.”

The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from a DOJ spokesperson Monday afternoon.

President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities. In April, it canceled about $800 million in DOJ grants, some of which were awarded to victims service and survivor organizations.

And in June, states filed a lawsuit over added requirements in Violence Against Women Act funding that mandated applicants agree not to promote “gender ideology,” or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.

Several attorneys general said the VOCA conditions appear to be another way the administration is targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, though there is no clear definition of what a sanctuary state or city is.

The Trump administration earlier this month released an updated list of states, cities and counties it considers sanctuary jurisdictions. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the August announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

We must act now.” ####### New Jersey Citizen Action is a statewide advocacy and empowerment organization that fights for social, racial and economic justice for all.","NEWARK: New Jersey Citizen Action (NJCA) issued the following statement today condemning the ongoing atrocities in Gaza and the United States’ cruel mass deportation efforts and policies, calling on elected officials to take urgent action. Executive Director of NJCA Dena Mottola Jaborska has called for the following actions on Gaza:

An immediate ceasefire of military operations in Gaza

Immediately allow the free flow of humanitarian organizations and aide into Gaza to address the urgent food and health care needs of the population

The immediate release of all Israeli and Palestinian hostages

All elected officials, in New Jersey and elsewhere, to condemn the violence and actions to stop the flow of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.

An end to labeling calls for justice and support to Gaza as anti-Semitic. What is occurring in Gaza is an attempt at genocide and a gross human rights violation. Palestinians deserve the same human rights protections as the people of Israel.

“The protection and preservation of human rights is essential to a thriving democracy – and yet, the genocide in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels,” said Mottola Jaborska. “With U.S. support, Israeli military operations in the troubled region have devastated civilian infrastructure, killed over 18,500 of children, and pushed millions to the brink of famine and displacement. The U.S. must demand that Israel take immediate action to end the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza or face withdrawal of US financial, military and diplomatic support.

“At the same time, here in the United States, the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort, being carried out in the most grossly inhumane way imaginable, is hurting families and communities across our country. People have been abused, denied basic needs, separated from their families and have had their human rights violated.”

On U.S. immigration policy NJCA urges all elected US representatives to:

End the targeted round up and mass deportation of non-criminal immigrants sweeping the country causing irreparable harm to (or violating) innocent people, including those with protected immigration status, refugees we invited in and people who came to the U.S for humanitarian reasons.

Require ICE / DHS officers abide by the same rules as any law enforcement officials by requiring them to identify themselves, advise people of their rights and follow all laws pertaining to arrest, including having valid warrants. ICE/DHS officers must be in a uniform - marked with their affiliation and in vehicles that are also marked, unmasked with visible faces, and fully identifiable.

Require anyone detained by ICE to have rapid access to lawyers, family, and full and fair due process proceedings before being placed in detention center.

End all incentives and quotas for ICE/DHS officers that is driving many to violate laws and rights of immigrants including wrongfully detaining citizens

End privately owned immigration detention facilities from operating in New Jersey

End any use of our military in civil protests or deportation efforts

Reverse the decision to use McGuire-Fort Dix as an immigration detention camp

Ensure detention centers in NJ and around the country have independent oversight of facilities and immediately investigate appalling conditions reported. Take immediate action to fix our immigration system and pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship and honors our history, as a nation of immigrants, and helps this country to thrive.

“These tactics and policies undermine our democracy and must be stopped. As a non-profit organization committed to justice, we cannot remain silent while these atrocities are carried out with our tax dollars. Now is not the time for silence or neutrality. Our democracy cannot thrive while it is complicit in the abuse and dehumanization of people: whether they are children in Gaza or families seeking safety and opportunity in the United States. We call on our elected leaders to join us in this call. Our collective voice must rise louder than the forces of injustice. We must act now.”

And from all corners.” With multiple faith leaders, residents and organizers sharing and supporting their own stories.","GENEVA, N.Y. — Dozens of rallygoers gathered on Sunday in Geneva to call for action through their chants, signs and advocacy to release their neighbors, Luis, Elena and Raymundo.

The family has been a beloved part of the community in Geneva, but after being detained in their nearby home in Clyde and separated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier last week, residents are grieving their loss.

“People who embody faith, love and service,” speaker Daisy Aguilera said. “It gives me peace knowing my child will grow up surrounded by their guidance, care, and example. So, today I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for being more than just godparents. Thank you for being family, for being a light in our lives.”

Known across the area for helping to choreograph quinceañeras, weddings and other special events in the community over the last 10 years. Those close to them, share how their work has helped build memories.

“Yesterday there was a quinceañera here, and they weren't there,” speaker Sister Luci Romero said. “It was crazy because it's something they're always a part of. And yesterday they weren’t.”

Organized by the group Finger Lakes Rapid Response Network, they have been advocating against the ICE raids since 2017. Opposing the family’s separation, but also current immigration policies.

“There’s real grief,” Finger Lakes Rapid Response Network organizer Hannah Dickinson said. “I think we all feel like it's really sad that this is happening. Not just to this family, but for many other families in our community. And also the outpouring of support once we started talking about detainment of Luis and Raymundo and Elena has been really wonderful. And from all corners.”

With multiple faith leaders, residents and organizers sharing and supporting their own stories.

“I am wearing this shirt,” Veteran for Peace National board member Windsor Wade said. “I'm a forced immigrant. Four-hundred years ago, my people were forced to come here. Their human rights have been violated. No. No person is illegal.”

In hopes that its small team can leave an impact with a larger message.

“Change doesn’t happen without action,” Wade said. “And so hopefully people will be inspired to respond to what they see is an outrage to human rights in this country.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Screenshot_2025-08-18_at_10.13,N,,2025-08-18 14:57:25.039744

Miami (CNN) — A federal judge heard arguments Monday but declined to make an immediate ruling about the legal conditions of detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz.”

US District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II heard arguments over detainee access to attorneys, if a clear immigration court was assigned for those held at the camp, and if the case was filed in the correct federal court.

“There have been a lot of changes on the ground” at “Alligator Alcatraz,” Ruiz said Monday during the hearing.

The Trump-nominated judge did not immediately rule on any of the issues from the bench or issue a preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs.

The harm taking place at the facility is “extorting,” an attorney for the ACLU told the court.

“What is happening at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ is not normal,” Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project and the lead attorney in the case, told the court.

Plaintiffs argue detainees had no assigned immigration court

In the lawsuit filed by a number of those held at the camp and advocacy groups for immigrants, the plaintiffs claimed those held at the camp did not have an assigned immigration court of jurisdiction.

In a filing over the weekend, the United States government notified the court the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami would serve as the immigration court with “administrative responsibilities over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.”

An attorney for the ACLU was skeptical the government would make this a permanent solution.

Detainees lack attorney access, ACLU says, but government says ‘access has been growing’

“There is a clear case and controversy” about attorney access at the detention camp, Cho told the court Monday.

She said the detention center had little or no means for attorneys to communicate with their clients with confidentiality via phone, mail or video conference.

The federal government and the state of Florida, both defendants in the case, sat at the same table in the courtroom Monday.

“Legal access has been growing as the facility stands up,” Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state of Florida, told the court. “Every day that goes by there is more access,” he added.

“The facility has continued to build more infrastructure,” and there are now rooms where attorney-client meetings can take place in private, Meros told the court.

Marlene Rodriguez, with the US Attorney’s Office, told the court “it just seems at the core” the issue is about the Attorney General and president’s initial decision to send detainees to the facility.

The judge noted the ACLU was not asking for the detention camp to be shut down as part of their litigation.

‘Venue is a very significant concern’

The state and federal government argued the case was filed in the improper court since the physical detention camp is not within the jurisdiction of the Miami court.

“Venue is a very significant concern,” the judge said.

He noted one of the federal defendants, Garrett Ripa, who is head of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in Miami, was within the court’s district.

The government argued Ripa didn’t play a significant role in the case.

The judge read back an agreement between the state and the federal government indicating the Miami office was responsible for supervision at “Alligator Alcatraz,” including a provision stating attorney-client privilege was protected.

The federal government noted any supervision happening is at the facility – physically outside the court’s district.

The judge, repeating previous comments, said he believes the case – at least for the federal defendants – was in the proper court.

The judge then took his focus to Florida. “Where is venue proper for the state defendants?” the judge asked the ACLU attorney.

The ACLU argued the case was in the proper venue, since the state and federal government had previously entered into an agreement with the Miami immigration field office, but the judge was skeptical.

“When it comes to running ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ it seems like the state defendants are doing their thing, without input from the federal government,” the judge said, adding he had seen no documentation that the “day-to-day direction of operations” was coming from the federal government.

The judge said he needed to rule on the state’s issues about venue, adding, “I don’t want this to be delayed any further.”

What the plaintiffs are seeking

The goal of the plaintiffs was to make ensure the “basic constitutional rights” of detainees are being upheld, including the “basic right to be able to speak to their lawyers and the basic right to be able to petition the government for release from custody,” Cho, the ACLU attorney, told CNN last weekend.

The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the “facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,” and attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email.

Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, “Alligator Alcatraz” has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals.

The state of Florida has pushed back, saying conditions at the camp are in “good working order” and that claims to the contrary are false.

During court on Monday the ACLU claimed at least one person held at the facility was improperly removed from the United States.

“Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear,” Cho previously told CNN.

The child, however, is not the first New York youth caught up in President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant dragnet.

The Intercept has confirmed the identity of a 15-year-old Manhattan high school student deported to Ecuador after a secretive detention that involved days trapped inside hotels hundreds of miles away, while unable to contact the outside world.

The teen, Roger Iza, and his father, Edison Iza, were arrested by ICE at a check-in in New York on August 9 and, after being whisked to hotels in Louisiana then Texas, deported to Ecuador on August 14, the pair said by phone from Quito.

“We couldn’t call or go on the web to ask for help,” Roger said. “Without our phones, we didn’t know any names or phone numbers.”

ICE’s latest published data, from June and July, indicates that 48 minors were arrested in New York City, some counties north of the city, and parts of Long Island during those months, and 32 of them had been deported by last week. But who those children are is frequently shrouded in mystery. Roger Iza’s is the first account from a minor deportee to emerge from the Trump administration’s crackdown on New York City.

Detention centers operated by ICE allow unlimited phone calls to anyone with the money to pay for them or make collect calls; they also allow for attorney calls. The case of the 7-year-old and her mother has been highly publicized and garnered efforts by immigration activists, political leaders, and school administrators to keep her in the U.S.

Roger, however, was not in a detention center where it would have been relatively easy to communicate with the outside world. He was locked up with his father in a private hotel, with no ability to use the internet or phone to get attention to his case before it was too late. (ICE did not respond to questions for this story.)

As the immigration detention system is becoming more overcrowded, authorities are turning to hotels to house detainees. Earlier this month, The Intercept and Injustice Watch reported on the case of a mother and her infant son, a U.S. citizen, being locked incommunicado inside a Chicago Sonesta hotel for five days by ICE contractors. Roger, an immigrant minor himself, is the latest child known to have been detained by ICE in private hotels.

There may be many other such children.

Snatched at ICE Check-in

Two years ago, Edison and Roger Iza traveled to the Mexican border and presented themselves to border agents in El Paso, Texas, to apply for asylum. They soon ended up in New York City, in a hotel near Times Square that was repurposed as a shelter for asylum seekers. The New York Department of Education enrolled Roger, who was 13 at the time, in a public middle school near Union Square, where he quickly made an impression.

“Most of the immigrant kids kept to themselves, but Roger wasn’t insular,” said a native-born classmate who grew close to Roger there and requested anonymity for privacy because he is a minor. “He was fascinated with America and really into being an American. For instance, if people pronounced his name like in Spanish, ‘Ro-hair,’ he would say ‘No!’ and demand that they pronounce it like in English.”

Despite a language barrier, the two became good friends. They rented Citi Bikes and rode to Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. While Roger’s dad worked in construction, Roger spent time at his classmate’s apartment after school.

“He was giggly, shy, and joyous,” the classmate’s mother recalled. “And so sweet and polite.”

After Roger completed middle school, he enrolled in the Manhattan Academy for Arts and Language, near the Empire State Building.

In October of last year, an immigration judge in Manhattan denied a joint petition for asylum submitted by the Izas. They had filed it without a lawyer’s assistance because they could not afford counsel. Edison Iza said in an interview that he applied for asylum due to his inability to make a living in his home country because his business was constantly threatened by extortionists. Their attempt to appeal also failed.

In July, the Izas said, they were ordered to report to ICE for a check-in — a monitoring program requiring in-person attendance. The first meeting concluded without incident. Meanwhile, Roger attended a summer class at his high school, to raise a poor grade he’d gotten in math during the regular academic year.

According to a document examined by The Intercept, however, he and his father were ordered to appear at another check-in on August 9 — and this time they were arrested.

Edison, by phone from Quito, said, “It was so unexpected.”

“They Monitored Us”

Edison said that he and his son were taken to a holding area in a federal building in Manhattan, where their phones were seized. Roger recalled that within hours they were driven to LaGuardia Airport and put on a plane bound for Louisiana.

The Izas were taken to a Sheraton hotel in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to location information from Roger’s phone shared with The Intercept. The hotel is near a major ICE holding facility that serves as a deportation hub for Central and South America. (Neither the hotel nor Marriott International, Sheraton’s parent company, immediately responded to requests for comment.)

The father and son were told by security officers that they could make one call a day that could last for at most two minutes. They were ordered to speak in loud voices when they made the call, and not to disclose their location.

“They monitored us,” Roger said.

They made calls to Roger’s grandmother in New York. She said that Roger’s math teacher had called to ask why he wasn’t in class.

“When my grandmother told her I was being deported,” Roger said, “the teacher said that I could get a lawyer, but I would have to be in New York for that.”

The teacher may have been talking about the possibility of an attorney filing a habeas motion in a New York federal district court to free Roger. But he was no longer in New York, and he couldn’t contact his teacher.

After four days in the hotel, the Izas said they were flown to McAllen, Texas, and put into another hotel under the same conditions of isolation. Roger said they had no privacy.

“The guards were with us day and night, and they wrote down everything we did, even when I went to the bathroom. We couldn’t leave the room. We couldn’t even look out the window.”

The Izas were put on an ICE deportation flight to Guayaquil, Ecuador, on August 14.

When the father and son landed in Guayaquil and were given back their phones, the first person Roger called was his American friend, who was shocked to hear what had happened.

“It’s hard for me to comprehend that I might never see him again,” the friend said.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2230132283-e1755439700872.jpeg?fit=6000%2C3000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-18 16:57:25.585394

Atlanta, Ga. — U.S. Senator Jon Ossoff has successfully pressured the Trump Administration to restore Federal support for foster children that the Administration paused earlier this year.

In April, Sen. Ossoff soundedThis is an external link the alarm after the Trump Administration abruptly cutThis is an external link key Federal grants for programs that provide advocacy and support for foster children in Georgia. According to expertsThis is an external link, the Administration’s decision threatened the ability of Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and volunteers to support children who have faced abuse, neglect, and instability.

Following sustained pressureThis is an external link from Sen. Ossoff and child welfare advocates across Georgia, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has now reversed course and reinstated the funding, according to the National CASA/GAL Association for Children.

“The Trump Administration should never have paused this funding in the first place,” Sen. Ossoff said. “I will continue my oversight to ensure that vulnerable foster children in Georgia and nationwide receive the support Congress directed to them.”

Georgia CASA leaders expressed deep gratitude for Sen. Ossoff’s intervention.

“We sincerely appreciate the support of Senator Ossoff and his team in following up on the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) termination of grant funding for the National CASA/GAL network. The reinstatement of funding from DOJ will allow the National CASA/GAL network to continue our critical work on behalf of children who have experienced abuse and neglect and deserve a caring, consistent adult to speak for their best interests in the courtroom and in the community,” said Sally Wilson Erny, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, National CASA/GAL Association for Children.

“This funding is more than just dollars, it is hope for children in foster care. At Atlanta CASA, it means we can continue to stand up for children who need someone in their corner, making sure their voices are heard, and their needs are not overlooked. Restoring this support ensures our volunteers and staff can do what they do best fight for stability, safety, and brighter futures for every child we serve,” said Domonique Cooper, CEO, Atlanta CASA.

“We are deeply grateful to Senator Ossoff for championing this funding. His support ensures that CASA volunteers can continue to stand beside children in foster care, giving them a consistent voice and trusted advocate during their most uncertain times. This investment strengthens families and protects the well-being of our community’s most vulnerable children,” said Kate Blair, Executive Director of Savannah/Chatham CASA.

The reinstated funding will allow CASA/GAL volunteers to continue providing life-changing advocacy and support to foster children in Georgia, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs are met.

Last year, Sen. Ossoff led a 13-month bipartisan investigation into Georgia’s foster care system, uncovering systemic abuse and neglect and issuing a series of recommendations to improve safety, oversight, and support for vulnerable children.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May.
The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request.
During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.
The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.","Contractor Hector Madrid Reyes was driving to Home Depot in March when he was rear-ended. As he and the other driver exchanged information, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled up and asked for their licenses. Madrid, who arrived in the U.S. from Honduras as a teenager and was awaiting a court hearing for his asylum claim, didn’t have one.

“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything’s 45 minutes from everything. It’s a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history.

The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.

People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials’ continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.

The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.

ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”

Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.

Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.

“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”

Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that’s the only accusation, in my mind that’s pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.

The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.

After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.

Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”

Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.

In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.

“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”

As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

Neronha today co-led a coalition of 21 attorneys general in filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island against the Trump Administration over the imposition of illegal conditions on more than $1 billion in Congressionally-authorized funds for Victims of Crime Act grant recipients. The Trump Administration, disregarding the law and the intent of Congress, has declared that states will be unable to access these funds – used to support victims and survivors of crimes – unless they agree to support the Trump Administration’s extreme immigration enforcement efforts.

“When the U.S. Department of Justice is actively preventing Americans from receiving – justice – we have a problem,” said Attorney General Neronha. “We’ve seen this before, DOJ threatening to unlawfully withhold critical federal funding for things like disaster relief and safe roads and bridges. Now, the department tasked with ensuring justice for all is targeting victims and survivors as they attempt to navigate some of the most difficult times of their lives. And their supposed reasoning here is unfounded: Rhode Island consistently cooperates with all federal law enforcement agencies, as required by federal law. What we won’t, and can’t do legally, is divert important state law enforcement resources to do the federal government’s civil immigration law bidding.

“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable. In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation. We can and must support crime victims, and support must not be illegally tethered to federal policies. We are on the right side of the law here, and we will prevail.”

The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) was enacted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan, creating a series of grant programs to enable states to provide critical resources and services to victims and survivors of crime as they try to restore normalcy in their lives. Supported programs include victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelter, medical, funeral, and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, sexual assault forensic exams, and much more. These funding streams—totaling more than a billion dollars a year nationwide—have long ensured that states could fulfill their most fundamental duties: to protect public safety and redress harm to their residents. States use these funds to assist nearly nine million crime victims per year and to provide compensation for more than 200,000 victims’ claims per year. Congress has required the distribution of nearly all VOCA funding to states based on fixed statutory formulas and has repeatedly acted to ensure sufficient funding for crime victims, including after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

However, the Trump Administration, through the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ), has declared that states, along with the victims and survivors they serve, will be blocked from these funds unless they comply with the Administration’s political agenda – namely its immigration enforcement priorities. To receive these funds, states must assist the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with civil immigration enforcement efforts – a federal government responsibility.

This directive conflicts with core principles of American governance – the separation of powers and federalism. Congress did not authorize USDOJ to impose conditions on these grant programs that coerce states to devote their resources to enacting the Administration’s immigration agenda. As such, Attorney General Neronha and the coalition are requesting that the Court permanently enjoin the Trump Administration from implementing or enforcing these illegal conditions.

In Rhode Island, VOCA grants are the primary source of funding for victim services. Most of that funding flows from VOCA’s two main grants: victim compensation grants, which provide direct financial support to crime victims, and victim assistance grants, which are almost entirely distributed to nonprofits throughout the state to provide additional support services to those impacted by crime. For federal FY 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3 million in VOCA victim assistance funds and another close to $300K in VOCA victim compensation funds. During that same time period, VOCA assistance funds were used to provide services to approximately 41,015 individuals through dozens of nonprofits, and 635 individuals received VOCA compensation payments through the State’s Crime Victim Compensation Program.

Attorney General Neronha co-leads the coalition together with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and is joined in filing the lawsuit by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.

Two boats, carrying 58 and 68 people and believed to have departed from Libya, were stopped and the passengers placed under guard at temporary shelters.

More than 100 other migrants arrived on Crete over the weekend after strong winds eased.

Greece's conservative government suspended all asylum claims for migrants arriving by sea from North Africa in July, a move it argued helped deter crossings that peaked in July at more than 2,500 in a single week.

The suspension passed by a vote of 177-74 despite fierce opposition from left-wing parties, which unsuccessfully challenged the amendment as unconstitutional.

The emergency measures drew sharp criticism from international human rights organisations.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees expressed ""deep concern."" While acknowledging Greece's right to manage borders, UNHCR said border control ""must be in line with international and European law.""

Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, also condemned Athens' response, arguing it ""would legalise returning people to face a risk of torture and other serious violations, in breach of (Greece's international) obligations.""

But Thanos Plevris, the migration affairs minister, told lawmakers up to 1,000 migrants were arriving daily and described the situation as resembling an ""invasion.""

U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz II heard arguments over detainee access to attorneys, if a clear immigration court was assigned for those held at the camp, and if the case was filed in the correct federal court.

What's at stake in Monday's Alligator Alcatraz hearing

""There have been a lot of changes on the ground"" at ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" Ruiz said Monday during the hearing.

The Trump-nominated judge did not immediately rule on any of the issues from the bench or issue a preliminary injunction requested by the plaintiffs.

The harm taking place at the facility is ""extorting,"" an attorney for the ACLU told the court.

""What is happening at 'Alligator Alcatraz' is not normal,"" Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU's National Prison Project and the lead attorney in the case, told the court.

Plaintiffs argue detainees had no assigned immigration court

In the lawsuit filed by a number of those held at the camp and advocacy groups for immigrants, the plaintiffs claimed those held at the camp did not have an assigned immigration court of jurisdiction.

In a filing over the weekend, the United States government notified the court the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami would serve as the immigration court with ""administrative responsibilities over the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility.""

An attorney for the ACLU was skeptical the government would make this a permanent solution.

Environmental court battle over 'Alligator Alcatraz' exposes impacts on state

Detainees lack attorney access, ACLU says, but government says 'access has been growing'

""There is a clear case and controversy"" about attorney access at the detention camp, Cho told the court Monday.

She said the detention center had little or no means for attorneys to communicate with their clients with confidentiality via phone, mail or video conference.

The federal government and the state of Florida, both defendants in the case, sat at the same table in the courtroom Monday.

""Legal access has been growing as the facility stands up,"" Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state of Florida, told the court. ""Every day that goes by there is more access,"" he added.

""The facility has continued to build more infrastructure,"" and there are now rooms where attorney-client meetings can take place in private, Meros told the court.

Marlene Rodriguez, with the U.S. Attorney's Office, told the court ""it just seems at the core"" the issue is about the Attorney General and the president's initial decision to send detainees to the facility.

The judge noted the ACLU was not asking for the detention camp to be shut down as part of their litigation.

'Venue is a very significant concern'

The state and federal government argued the case was filed in the improper court since the physical detention camp is not within the jurisdiction of the Miami court.

""Venue is a very significant concern,"" the judge said.

He noted one of the federal defendants, Garrett Ripa, who is head of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in Miami, was within the court’s district.

The government argued Ripa didn't play a significant role in the case.

The judge read back an agreement between the state and the federal government indicating the Miami office was responsible for supervision at “Alligator Alcatraz,” including a provision stating attorney-client privilege was protected.

The federal government noted any supervision happening is at the facility — physically outside the court’s district.

The judge, repeating previous comments, said he believes the case – at least for the federal defendants – was in the proper court.

The judge then took his focus to Florida. ""Where is venue proper for the state defendants?"" the judge asked the ACLU attorney.

The ACLU argued the case was in the proper venue, since the state and federal government had previously entered into an agreement with the Miami immigration field office, but the judge was skeptical.

""When it comes to running 'Alligator Alcatraz,' it seems like the state defendants are doing their thing, without input from the federal government,” the judge said, adding he had seen no documentation that the “day-to-day direction of operations” was coming from the federal government.

The judge said he needed to rule on the state’s issues about venue, adding, ""I don't want this to be delayed any further.""

What the plaintiffs are seeking

The goal of the plaintiffs was to make ensure the ""basic constitutional rights"" of detainees are being upheld, including the “basic right to be able to speak to their lawyers and the basic right to be able to petition the government for release from custody,"" Cho, the ACLU attorney, told CNN last weekend.

The Department of Homeland Security has denied the allegations, telling CNN in a statement Sunday the ""facility maintains a physical space for attorneys to meet with their clients,"" and attorneys may also request to speak with detainees they represent via email.

Deep in the marshy wetlands of the Florida Everglades, ""Alligator Alcatraz"" has been mired with controversy since the start, with reports of hundreds of migrants confined in cages amid sweltering heat, bug infestations and meager meals.

The state of Florida has pushed back, saying conditions at the camp are in “good working order” and that claims to the contrary are false.

During court on Monday the ACLU claimed at least one person held at the facility was improperly removed from the United States.

""Alligator Alcatraz cannot end up being a black hole where people disappear,"" Cho previously told CNN.

(Reuters) -A group of Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking to prevent the Trump administration from forcing them to cooperate with immigration enforcement activities in order to receive grant funding to support crime victims.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Rhode Island is the latest case to challenge efforts by Republican President Donald Trump's administration to impose immigration-related conditions on states' ability to receive federal funding.

Monday's lawsuit by state attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia takes aim at a condition the U.S. Department of Justice recently imposed on the ability of states to receive grants pursuant to the Victims of Crime Act, which Congress enacted in 1984 to bolster support for crime victims.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The department administers programs funded by fines and penalties assessed in federal criminal cases that allow states to receive grant funding to provide services for victims including medical care, counseling, shelter and compensation for lost wages.

Attorneys general from states including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island say those funds help about 10 million people annually. In 2025, nearly $1.4 billion in such funding is available, the lawsuit said.

But under a new Trump administration policy, states can lose out on such funding if they decline to provide U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to facilities or honor all civil immigration enforcement requests, the lawsuit said.

The conditions were imposed in keeping with a policy Attorney General Pam Bondi unveiled in February requiring the Justice Department to ensure that federal funds do not flow to so-called ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" that do not cooperate with ICE.

The states' lawsuit argues that such conditions are unlawful and violate the U.S. Constitution by undermining Congress’ power over appropriations. They are asking a judge to block the Justice Department from enforcing the conditions.

Judges in Rhode Island have issued a series of rulings preventing the administration from imposing conditions on grant funding that align with Trump's broader agenda.

Most recently, a judge in the state this month barred the Justice Department from enforcing new restrictions on grant funding used to support victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.

All law enforcement agencies involved should respect the right to protest and ensure that those responsible for abuse are held to account.

(Los Angeles, August 18, 2025) – Law enforcement officers responded to protests against immigration raids in and around Los Angeles, California, between June 6 and 14, 2025, with excessive force and deliberate brutality, Human Rights Watch said today.

Officers fired tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades directly at protesters, journalists, and other observers, often at close range and often without sufficient warning or provocation. Scores of people suffered injuries, ranging from severe bruising and lacerations to broken bones, concussions, an amputated finger, and severe eye damage.

“Sweeping immigration raids have terrorized communities across Los Angeles and driven thousands of people to the streets in protest,” said Ida Sawyer, crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “Local, state, and federal law enforcement’s aggressive response to these protests violently oppressed the public’s right to express outrage and the media’s right to report safely.”

The protests were sparked by a dramatic escalation of immigration raids across Los Angeles and the surrounding area, following the Trump administration’s orders to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to increase daily arrests of undocumented immigrants. Heavily armed federal agents have stormed stores, warehouses, hotels, restaurants, farms, car washes, taco stands, and other workplaces and detained those they suspect of being undocumented with the aim of deporting them.

Human Rights Watch observed protests and visited locations of ICE raids in and around Los Angeles from June 10 to 14, and interviewed 39 people, including protesters, journalists, legal observers, volunteer street medics, immigration rights advocates and organizers, and others affected by the raids. Researchers analyzed lawsuits, documentation by the Los Angeles Press Club, media reports, and photos and videos recorded during the protests and posted on social media or shared directly with researchers.

Human Rights Watch documented 65 cases in which law enforcement officers from various local, state, and federal agencies injured protesters, journalists, and other observers. The actual number is most likely much higher. In the three weeks following June 6, more than 280 people contacted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California, most reporting that they had been personally injured by law enforcement agents while engaged in protest activity.

The first major protests began on June 6, when ICE agents raided several locations, including two Ambiance Apparel facilities in the Los Angeles Fashion District. On June 7, a group of protesters encountered armed federal agents and Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) deputies in the suburb of Paramount, across from a Home Depot store outside an office park where there were reports of a planned raid.

In a directive issued on June 7, US President Donald Trump claimed the Los Angeles protests “constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States,” called in the National Guard, and authorized the deployment of “any other members of the regular Armed Forces as necessary.” On June 9, the administration mobilized 700 active-duty Marines to join several thousand National Guard soldiers, who primarily guarded federal buildings. Local and state officials objected to Trump’s actions, though local police themselves acted to aggressively shut down the protests.

Starting on June 6 and at least through June 14, protesters gathered every day outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, where agents detained many undocumented people. Protesters also demonstrated at other government buildings in the surrounding area of downtown Los Angeles.

Human Rights Watch repeatedly witnessed and documented law enforcement officers forcing protesters to leave certain areas, often with no apparent justification and without delivering clear, audible dispersal orders or warnings. Officers frequently aimed and fired their “less lethal” launchers directly at protesters, sometimes at close range, including using tear gas, pepper balls, hard foam rounds, and flash-bang grenades. These weapons, while less deadly than bullets, can cause serious injury and death.

Human Rights Watch documented 39 cases of journalists injured by law enforcement, most of whom were holding cameras and wearing visible press credentials. Several appear to have been deliberately targeted. On June 8, a police officer fired a kinetic impact projectile directly at Lauren Tomasi, an Australian journalist from 9News, while she was reporting live on television from downtown Los Angeles, leaving a bruise on her leg.

On June 9, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer shot three people—all known advocates for police accountability—at very close range with kinetic impact projectiles, leaving each of them in serious pain for days, according to two of the advocates and video footage Human Rights Watch reviewed. Before shooting one of them in the groin, the officer said: “I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus.”

A volunteer street medic, who was himself hospitalized after being lacerated by a hard foam round that caused a deep, gaping wound, said he spent several hours in downtown Los Angeles on June 14 responding to people yelling for help. They included protesters hit by projectiles and bleeding from their heads or faces, one with a broken leg, and others with difficulty seeing and hearing because of the flash-bangs and tear gas.

There were some acts of violence against police and property destruction by protesters, primarily in the early days of the protests. Human Rights Watch found evidence that most of the violence by protesters occurred after acts of violence by law enforcement officers, and that only a small portion of the protesting crowd engaged in destructive acts. To the extent individuals engaged in violent or destructive acts, law enforcement officers did not limit their aggressive actions and response to those individuals.

Human Rights Watch found that law enforcement officers committed clear violations of international human rights law. These findings also implicate civil rights protections under the US Constitution, as well as recently amended California state law, which includes strict restrictions on when and how law enforcement officers may use force to disperse protests and provides protections for journalists covering protests.

Human Rights Watch wrote to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the LAPD, and the LASD on July 31, but has not received responses.

In a June 23 statement, Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said the department would conduct a “comprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident” and act against any officer “who has fallen short” of the department’s standards. While he said the protests had “most often been marked by peaceful expression,” they were at times “hijacked by violence, vandalism, and criminal aggression” and “officers were justified in taking swift and measured action to prevent further harm and restore public safety.”

Journalists, protesters, and legal observers have filed several lawsuits against the City and County of Los Angeles and the DHS regarding the harm caused during these protests. Past lawsuits regarding law enforcement misconduct during protests in Los Angeles have cost taxpayers millions of dollars in settlements, but secured little to no accountability for the agencies and senior officials responsible for the abuse nor changes in law enforcement practice.

“Law enforcement officers in Los Angeles used brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force against people standing up for human rights and those reporting on the protests,” Sawyer said. “All law enforcement agencies involved should respect the right to free speech and protest, protect journalists, and ensure that those responsible for abuse are held to account.”

Applicable Legal Standards

International Law

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, protects the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. US obligations under the covenant extend to authorities at every level of government, federal, state, and local. The Unites States is thus obliged to ensure that all law enforcement personnel respect fundamental rights.

The ICCPR allows only for limited restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect a narrow range of important interests including public order, public safety, and the rights of others. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, an international expert body that monitors compliance with the ICCPR, issued a General Comment in September 2020 that offers detailed practical guidance on how governments should approach their obligation to respect the right to peaceful assembly.

It emphasizes that restrictions on the right should be carefully tailored; more specifically, they should both be necessary for and proportionate to a permissible ground for restriction. It also emphasizes that restrictions justified on grounds of public safety require the authorities to demonstrate “a real and significant risk to the safety of persons (to life and security of person) or a similar risk of serious damage to property.”

Even when law enforcement personnel may have a legitimate basis to confront or curtail demonstrators, their use of force should be carefully calibrated. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Personnel, law enforcement officials should use nonviolent means before resorting to force and avoid using force to disperse nonviolent protests, regardless of whether the authorities deem the protests illegal.

Using force is only appropriate if other measures to address a genuine threat have proved ineffective or have no likelihood of achieving the intended result. When using force, law enforcement should provide clear warnings, exercise restraint, and act proportionately, taking into account both the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved.

Federal Law

The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the right to free speech and peaceful assembly and treats these rights as a core pillar of the country’s system of governance. US courts have evolved a deep jurisprudence governing permissible regulation of, and limitations on, the exercise of these rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures by law enforcement, including the use of excessive force during an arrest or other seizure.

State Law

Following the 2020 George Floyd protests, California passed laws restricting the use of less lethal weapons during protests and protecting the rights of journalists and others. Section 13652 of California’s Penal Code forbids law enforcement from using “kinetic energy projectiles” to disperse an assembly, protest, or demonstration, except “to defend against a threat to life or serious bodily injury” or to “bring any objectively dangerous and unlawful situation safely under control.”

Even under those circumstances, such use of force is permitted only when a list of other requirements are met, including making reasonable efforts to identify violent individuals and not shooting indiscriminately into a crowd; not targeting heads, neck, or vital organs; giving clear, audible warnings; allowing people a chance to leave; and attempting reasonable de-escalation techniques. Law enforcement may not use these weapons solely to confront curfew violations, verbal threats, or noncompliance with law enforcement directives. The same provision requires officers to minimize use of these weapons on bystanders, journalists, medical personnel, and others.

Penal Code section 409.7 states that journalists may enter areas closed by law enforcement during protests and that law enforcement officers shall not remove or otherwise interfere with individuals who are lawfully gathering news at these events.

The Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s departments issued directives in late 2021 outlining how officers should comply with these laws.

Law Enforcement Agencies Deployed to Los Angeles Protests

A range of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies were deployed to protests in the Los Angeles area from June 6 to 14.

Los Angeles police officers and sheriff’s deputies were present at nearly all protests and led efforts to police or disperse these protests. Officers from the California Highway Patrol (CHP) primarily blocked entry points to the 101 Freeway in downtown Los Angeles.

Federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—including from ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—as well as agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) engaged with protesters at immigration raids and deployed outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility, along with other federal buildings in downtown Los Angeles.

Following President Trump’s June 7 directive, approximately 2,000 National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles under federal authority. On June 9, the administration sent an additional 2,000 troops and mobilized 700 active-duty Marines to join them. They primarily guarded federal buildings. All but around 250 National Guard personnel have since been withdrawn.

Less Lethal Weapons Used Against Protesters and Observers

Law enforcement officers fired a range of less lethal weapons at protesters. They included chemical irritants, including tear gas, pepper spray, and pepper balls, all of which are designed to temporarily incapacitate people through severe irritation to the eyes, nose, face, lungs, and skin. Officers also fired kinetic impact projectiles, including sponge or hard foam rounds, which are designed to cause pain upon impact without penetrating the skin, and flash-bang grenades, which are meant to disorient people by temporarily disrupting sight and hearing.

Police officers also used horses, batons, shields, and their hands to knock protesters and observers over, push them back, or beat them.

Excessive Force by Law Enforcement

Human Rights Watch documented the 65 cases of individuals injured by law enforcement officers during the protests based on interviews with victims and witnesses, analysis of photos and videos, and reviews of lawsuits, credible media reporting, and documentation by the Los Angeles Press Club.

Most were hit and injured by kinetic impact projectiles, including hard foam rounds, pepper balls, or the canisters delivering tear gas and flash-bang grenades. In many cases, officers fired directly at individuals, sometimes from very close range, and targeted their upper body, head, or groin area. Several others were injured by officers on horseback, using their horses to trample or ram into people and beating people from atop their horses with batons, or when officers not on horseback beat individuals with their batons or hands.

The injuries included severe bruising, lacerations, hematomas, concussions, broken bones (including to the ribs, hand, fingers, and nose), near-severing of a finger in one case and an amputated finger in another, severe eye damage resulting in loss of vision in one eye, and large gaping wounds caused by projectiles that entered or hit legs.

Of these injuries, it appears that police officers were responsible for 36 cases, federal agents were responsible for 13 cases, sheriff’s deputies were responsible for 8 cases, and Highway Patrol officers were responsible for 1 case. In seven cases, it is not clear which agency was responsible.

Human Rights Watch also documented many incidents of officers firing tear gas and other chemical irritants into crowds, causing temporary incapacitation. These cases are not included among the 65 injured.

The actual number of injured is likely much greater than those documented, including those with more minor injuries who did not seek medical attention or speak out publicly.

The Los Angeles Times reported on July 10 that the police department was investigating 86 complaints against officers from the recent protests, including 59 cases of possible excessive force and 3 in which people were hospitalized.

Researchers repeatedly observed and documented law enforcement officers using force to disperse protesters and others, without giving clear, audible dispersal orders or a reasonable opportunity to disperse. Protesters and observers also expressed frustration about the lack of clarity about where they were allowed to go. In many cases, a line of officers would forcibly push the protesters in one direction, only for them to meet another line of officers pushing them in the opposite direction. In at least one case, officers clearly “kettled” or contained protesters, without giving them a way to disperse, before detaining them.

Violence by Protesters

Human Rights Watch researchers were present on June 11, 12, and 13 and saw no acts of protester violence. During protests earlier in the week, particularly on June 8, some protesters threw water bottles and rocks in the direction of law enforcement officers, lit fireworks, set a tire on fire, and wrote graffiti on government buildings, based on accounts from protesters and observers and videos Human Rights Watch reviewed. A few people set five empty Waymos, self-driving vehicles, on fire that day. Some people threw objects at police cars on the freeway. In the most serious incident documented, also on June 8, a video Human Rights Watch analyzed shows an individual throwing a rock from an overpass over the 101 Freeway near City Hall, hitting a police officer’s protective face gear. The officer then runs for cover under the overpass. Witnesses and a Los Angeles Times reporter covering the protest said the crowd had been peaceful until police initiated the use of force.

On June 14, Human Rights Watch observed and documented a few instances in which protesters threw bottles at police officers, after police had charged the crowd with horses and fired large quantities of less lethal ammunition at them. There may have been isolated incidents by individual protesters earlier that day, but otherwise the protest was not violent or destructive.

Los Angeles Police Chief McDonnell said that 52 officers suffered injuries requiring medical treatment, but did not elaborate on the extent of those injuries or how they occurred.

Selection of Incidents Documented by Human Rights Watch

Below is a selection of the incidents documented in which law enforcement officers used force against protesters.

Ambiance Apparel Warehouse and Store, June 6

In the late morning on June 6, federal agents, including from ICE and the FBI, conducted a series of coordinated raids of workplaces. Masked and dressed in tactical gear, they went to the Ambiance Apparel headquarters on 15th Street and their clothing showroom and warehouse on Towne Street, both in the Fashion District near downtown Los Angeles. They arrested over 40 people, handcuffed them, loaded them into vans and SUVs, and took them to the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown.

According to the US Attorney for the Central District of California, federal officials had a judicial warrant to search the business for “fictitious employee documents.” It is unclear how they determined who to detain and take from these workplaces.

As news of the raids spread, people gathered outside the two Ambiance Apparel facilities to support the workers and voice opposition to the raids, including family members of workers, people living and working in the surrounding community, and labor and immigrant rights advocates. Human Rights Watch spoke to several witnesses who saw the federal agents loading people into unmarked vans and said the agents prevented detainees from speaking with their family members. One person, who watched agents take his father, said the agents were aggressive with the people they detained, even though they were compliant. Advocates yelled out to the detained workers, advising them in Spanish to exercise their right to remain silent.

At the 15th Street facility, some people stood in front of the ICE vans attempting to enter the facility through the front gate. David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW), positioned himself at the gate until federal agents pushed him to the ground, injuring him, and then arrested him. The US Attorney filed criminal charges against Huerta, alleging “conspiracy to impede an officer.” Los Angeles Police Department officers later formed a skirmish line and moved protesters away from the front gate, assisting the federal agents leaving the facility.

Family members and protesters similarly gathered at the Towne Street facility. Masked and helmeted FBI agents, in combat gear and brandishing assault rifles, forcibly cleared the crowd, knocking people down with batons and shields to allow ICE agents and their vans to leave with their prisoners. After the vans left, FBI agents backed away from the facility as the crowd followed them. A couple of people threw plastic bottles at the well-armored and shielded agents, who fired flash-bang grenades at the crowd as they left the area.

Paramount, June 7

On June 7, federal agents in full tactical gear from the DHS, including CBP, deployed outside a commercial park across from a Home Depot store on Alondra Boulevard in Paramount, a southern suburb of Los Angeles. As word spread of the agents’ presence, people from the neighborhood and around Los Angeles gathered in protest. From late morning into the evening, federal agents repeatedly fired tear gas, pepper balls, and hard foam projectiles at the crowd, who mostly stayed across the street, with people often hiding behind trees, based on witness accounts and video footage Human Rights Watch reviewed.

An immigrant rights advocate said that around noon, federal agents shot him repeatedly with less lethal munitions: “They had just done a round of tear gas. I had a gas mask on and no one else did, so I went … to move the [tear gas] canister away from the families protesting.” He said that he put the canister into a container and turned around to go back, when he “heard lots of shooting and felt the impact on my back.”

They hit him at least four times with what appear to have been 40mm blue-capped foam rounds that left large bruises on his buttocks, lower-left thigh, back of his right knee, and back of his right ankle, based on the injuries seen and photographs Human Rights Watch reviewed. He said they also hit him in the back with pepper balls, which did not leave longer-term marks, but made him feel like his “back was on fire.”

The advocate said there was no dispersal order before the officers fired at him, that his back was to them, and that he was “not even approaching them,” leading him to view the shooting as arbitrary and unwarranted.

Federal agents also injured Ryanne Mena, a reporter from the Los Angeles Daily News, shooting her in the head above the ear with a less lethal projectile, then unleashing a large amount of tear gas. “I’ve been teargassed a number of times,” she said. “But nothing like this. I have asthma, and it was really tough for me to breathe or see. My friend [another journalist, who was also hit above his eye with a projectile] helped lead me around the corner to get away from this really big cloud of tear gas. We were just coughing, struggling to breathe.” Mena suffered a concussion and shared her medical report with Human Rights Watch.

Sheriff’s deputies deployed to surrounding streets, where protesters had also gathered.

Nick Stern, a Los Angeles-based British photojournalist, arrived in the area at around 3 p.m., and saw a skirmish line of sheriff’s deputies and a group of about 150 protesters further west along Alondra Boulevard. “We pulled up to the sound of less lethals being fired,” he said. Stern said it appeared that deputies were firing projectiles at the crowd and that some in the crowd responded by throwing plastic water bottles. Later in the day, he said, some protesters also threw stones and set off fireworks. But, Stern said, the protesters were 150 to 200 feet away from the deputies, and so the objects they threw hit the ground without reaching the officers.

Starting around 7:30 p.m., Stern said, “the LASD just launched this barrage of less lethals: high foam impact devices, flash-bangs, pepper balls. It resembled a war zone.” Stern said he was clearly identified as a journalist, holding up his press card and carrying a large professional camera. At 8:50 p.m., he was standing in the street near a group of people. At that moment, Stern said, “no one had stones, bottles, or fireworks at all near me. They were just waving flags.” Then, he suddenly “felt this excruciating pain in my right thigh. I instinctively put my hand down and felt something solid sticking out of my leg.”

A bystander captured the moment on camera. In the video, Stern is standing in the middle of the street, about 150 feet from the police line, when a sudden bang and flash of light erupts just a meter in front of him. Clutching his leg in pain, Stern begins to stagger away.

A group of protesters carried Stern to the curb, where a volunteer medic cut his pants off and applied a bandage to stop the bleeding. Stern briefly passed out. “It was really scary,” he said. “When I came back, I had no clue where I was or who these people were.” They rushed him to the hospital. He had surgery the next day to remove a 3-inch (7.5-centimeter) long, hard plastic object that appears to have housed an explosive warning device or flash-bang.

Stern remained in the hospital for three nights. When Human Rights Watch interviewed him a week after the incident, he was still in pain and largely bedridden.

Downtown Los Angeles, June 6 to 14

After the detainees from Ambiance Apparel were taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center on June 6, protesters gathered outside and in the surrounding neighborhood every afternoon and evening through at least June 14. Protests varied in size, with the largest on June 8 and 14. Following are some of the incidents Human Rights Watch documented.

June 8

Thousands of protesters were in downtown Los Angeles on June 8. National Guard soldiers deployed outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, police officers set up lines throughout the surrounding area, and large numbers of California Highway Patrol personnel were on and around the nearby 101 Freeway. Human Rights Watch interviewed six protest participants.

The National Guard fired tear gas at the crowd starting in the early afternoon, two witnesses said. A Los Angeles Times reporter who was present described the protest as “peaceful” until National Guardsmen charged the crowd and launched tear gas and smoke grenades. By 2 or 3 p.m., large groups of protesters had gathered on Alameda Street between Temple and Aliso Streets, on either side of the detention center. At Alameda and Temple, the police arrived in riot gear and started firing less lethal projectiles at the crowd, three witnesses said.

The police actions scattered the crowd as another larger group of protesters marched into the area. Some went to Los Angeles and Temple Streets, by City Hall, where police officers fired kinetic impact projectiles and pushed the protesters back with horses. Two witnesses said they saw officers striking one person with batons.

Meanwhile, another group of protesters was near the 101 Freeway, north of the Metropolitan Detention Center. A witness in that area said that Highway Patrol officers had initially blocked the entrance to the freeway, but then moved. Once the ramp was clear, a few dozen protesters went down the ramp and onto the freeway, unfurling a banner. Highway Patrol officers formed a skirmish line and pushed the protesters off the freeway using force, including tear gas, and arrested some of them.

As police were firing on the protesters near City Hall and addressing the situation at the freeway, a separate group of people vandalized and burned five empty Waymo driverless cars on Alameda Street, just north of the protest. Police did not appear to respond. Later in the day and into the evening, after the bigger protests had largely dispersed, small groups of people vandalized government buildings with graffiti and some people on the street above the freeway threw things, including chunks of concrete, at Highway Patrol cars and officers on the freeway below them.

Two street medics said they treated multiple people for injuries from the projectiles on June 8. One described the spent ammunition propellent cartridges she saw lining the streets. The other said that after treating dozens of injuries, including many head injuries, she was shot in the head with a projectile while in her car near the Federal Building at around 6 p.m. She said she experienced headaches, nausea, blurred vision, and an inability to concentrate for almost a week afterwards. She also said that police shot her husband in the foot, causing him pain for weeks.

June 9

Protesters again gathered in downtown Los Angeles on June 9. Human Rights Watch documented several instances in which police officers fired less lethal munitions at close range at people without justification, causing injuries.

Jeremy Lindenfeld, a reporter, was filming police officers as they rushed toward a group of protesters near Little Tokyo at around 7:30 p.m. “I had my press helmet on, my press badge, and I was videotaping them detain a protester right in front of me,” he said. “They tackled him, got him down to the ground, detained him, and then, a few seconds later … one of the LAPD officers raised the foam baton launcher at me and just fired.” A video shows him backing away from the line of police after the arrest is made. An officer standing a few meters away fires a projectile directly at Lindenfeld, without warning. Lindenfeld said it left him with a bruise on his stomach.

At around 9:30 p.m., a police officer shot three people, all known advocates for police accountability, at very close range with less lethal projectiles, just outside police headquarters. An officer “had his less lethal 40mm pointed at us as we were walking by the headquarters,” one of the advocates said. “We were like, ‘What are you doing? Are you going to shoot us right now?’ Within a minute, he shot my buddy in the leg. He had his hands up when he was shot… I back up into the street, clearly not a threat,” and then the officer pointed his weapon “directly at me and gets me in the stomach.”

The officer didn’t have his name or badge number on his helmet, so the third advocate then approached him, while filming, and asked for his name and badge number. The officer said: “I’m going to pop you, as you are taking up my focus,” and shot him in the groin at close range. Moments later, the officer shot him again as he was backing away.

All three were still in pain several days later. One said: “It felt like I got hit by a 90 miles-per-hour fastball in my stomach. It hurts to move or get up when I’m sitting.”

June 11

On June 11, protesters marched from Pershing Square to Grand Park, across the street from City Hall. Police officers and sheriff’s deputies were there by the time protesters arrived, around 6:15 p.m., with skirmish lines on the steps of City Hall and at the north end of the block by Temple and Spring Streets. The protesters were chanting and standing in the park and on the street. One witness said police gave a dispersal order at Temple and Spring Streets, but that it was not audible in the park where most people were, and it was not repeated.

By about 6:30 p.m., Human Rights Watch observed police officers forming lines sealing off the area and firing flash-bang grenades. Around 6:45 p.m., police officers and sheriff’s deputies were firing what appeared to be pepper balls and other kinetic impact projectiles at people in the park.

At 6:53 p.m., Human Rights Watch saw police officers on horseback moving in on protesters who were fleeing that section of the park. One officer on horseback rammed a protester to the ground using their horse as the protester was moving away with her back turned. Several other mounted officers immediately moved toward her. Other protesters rushed in to assist her. One officer drew a baton, swung it, and struck another officer’s horse on the head, then hit a protester. Another officer fired a projectile at close range toward the protesters.

The officers continued pushing the crowd from the area. At around 7:20 p.m., on Hill Street by 1st Street, researchers saw officers form a line at 1st Street blocking protesters who were being moved down Hill Street from the park by another line of officers, trapping them in a “kettle.” The officers detained dozens of protesters and several legal observers, wearing clearly identifiable green hats, and took them to a police station over seven miles away. Those arrested were given citations and released later that night, said one arrested person and a lawyer who represented the group.

“No Kings” Protest, June 14

On June 14, tens of thousands of people gathered downtown to protest the Trump administration generally, some as part of the national “No Kings” protests, and more specifically to protest the Los Angeles-area ICE raids.

A Human Rights Watch researcher arriving in the early afternoon observed a festive atmosphere until around 3:30 p.m. At that time, a line of police officers moved south down Alameda Street toward the Metropolitan Detention Center, while another group formed a line at Temple Street, indicating they might intend to trap or kettle protesters. The researcher and others left the area up Temple Street to avoid possible detention.

Between 4 and 4:06 p.m., Human Rights Watch saw police officers, led by a line of horse-mounted officers just northeast of the Federal Building, charge at a large crowd of cheering, chanting people gathered on Los Angeles Street. Human Rights Watch heard no dispersal order and observed no violent or destructive acts that might have triggered a lawful dispersal order. Officers pushed those fleeing down Los Angeles Street, pointing less lethal launchers at the crowd, as horses nearly trampled some people. At Los Angeles and Temple Streets, officers fired tear gas and less lethal projectiles into the crowd.

At Temple and Spring Streets, officers formed a skirmish line and fired a barrage of hard foam projectiles into the crowd. For the next several hours, police officers continued to fire less lethal weapons into crowds as they moved their lines down various downtown streets.

A protester said he had been impressed by the protest’s “happy vibe” until the police, with no discernible dispersal order, attacked the crowd, seemingly at random. As the protester fled, he turned onto 4th Street from Broadway. Police officers shot him in the head with a less lethal projectile. He said it felt like getting hit with a baseball bat. He fell to the ground, losing consciousness. Other protesters helped him get away, and a street medic provided first aid. The protester learned at the emergency room the next day that he had a concussion with extensive bruising to the brain, in addition to a laceration on his ear and numbness in his arm.

Another protester, Sergio Espejo, a 28-year-old data engineer and artist, joined the protest waving an American flag and chanting “peaceful protest” alongside others. After he made his way to the courthouse by City Hall, he saw sheriff’s deputies holding shields arrive on the opposite side of the street. Espejo said the deputies shouted something inaudible on loudspeakers before firing tear gas and throwing stun grenades at the crowd. At around 5 p.m., a sheriff’s deputy fired a flash-bang device that exploded upon impact on Espejo’s hand. “As soon as I got hit, I dropped to the ground and then immediately got teargassed,” he said. “I couldn’t catch my breath.” A street medic helped Espejo before he was rushed to Los Angeles General Medical Center, where he underwent surgery the same day. The explosion resulted in the amputation of the top two inches of his left index finger. Espejo is left-handed and his ability to work and produce art have been seriously affected. Human Rights Watch reviewed Espejo’s medical report and photos and videos of the injury.

Christopher Fernandez, an intensive care nurse at a local hospital, came to the protest with a wagon with medical gear to treat injured protesters. He said it was calm until about 4 p.m., when police officers started using tear gas and firing less lethal rounds at protesters. Over several hours, he treated 20 to 30 people, including about a dozen injured with kinetic impact projectiles, five of them with head injuries, including a pregnant woman. One man had lost his hearing and was bleeding from his right ear due to a flash-bang explosion. Fernandez used a flagpole to create a splint for another man with a broken leg. He helped many people wash chemical irritants out of their eyes.

In the midst of this, a police officer shot Fernandez in the back of his left thigh with what appeared to be a 40mm hard foam projectile, leaving a gaping 2-by-3-inch open wound that went down to his muscle.

From when he arrived at the protest at around 11 a.m., until he left just before 8 p.m., Fernandez said the only violence by protesters that he observed were two incidents later in the day when protesters threw empty plastic water bottles toward the police line. “Both times, a lot of [other protesters] yelled out saying, ‘Hey, don’t do that!’ I never saw any police injured or any use of force against the police.”

The overwhelming violence by police made Fernandez feel like he was in “a wartime movie.” He said: “The chaos. The volume of everything. I was just going from people screaming, ‘Medic, medic!,’ one after another, for hours… People were bleeding from the head or the face, and they needed someone to look at them to tell them if they should go to the hospital. I have never experienced anything like this.”

Fernandez never heard any police officers issue orders to protesters to disperse or warning that they would use force. The officers didn’t respond when he and other protesters asked where they could safely go. “It was really frustrating,” he said. “They gave us zero directions, and it was so disorienting.”

When Human Rights Watch spoke with Fernandez, he had been unable to return to work for six weeks and still had difficulties walking or bending his knee.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/08/082025CCA_US_LAprotest%20cover%20photo.jpg?h=2d91fedc&itok=gAvapGEM,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:06.181194

Nofil said immigration advocates have been warning for years about how bad ICE was and how much worse things could get, but many of those warnings were not heeded.
Nofil called those local collaborations the “most unsettling” aspect of the new version of ICE.
There were calls by activists and some Democratic representatives to completely “abolish ICE,” but despite what Republicans say, this was never embraced by Democratic Party leadership.
“There’s always a lot of blurriness around jurisdiction and immigration law,” Nofil said.","“They were sort of saying they were focusing on removing people who had broken some law that wasn’t just illegal entry,” Nofil said. “I think what is absolutely changing right now is that there is no pretense of that anymore. It has become very clear that the goal is just maximizing the numbers.”

She added that the recent explosion in funding will have a dramatic impact. The massive legislation package championed by Trump and passed narrowly by Congress in July included about $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security, with $75 billion of that specifically going to ICE — unprecedented amounts. Nofil said immigration advocates have been warning for years about how bad ICE was and how much worse things could get, but many of those warnings were not heeded.

“It does feel like the gloves are sort of completely off now,” Nofil said. “It also feels like a lot of chickens have come home to roost.”

ICE is currently trying to recruit a lot more agents to carry out the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and many have noted that they seem willing to hire just about anyone, and they’re offering some major incentives to take a job with the agency. To observers, this push looks increasingly dire.

“I think that the hiring is really scary,” Nofil says. “They have never tried to recruit on this massive of a scale. I don’t know if they’re having trouble recruiting right now or not, but it does feel increasingly desperate.”

Also worrying are the moves by ICE to expand its reach by partnering with local police forces. Nofil said that could have many negative effects and could contribute to the impression that immigration enforcement is reaching every corner of the country.

Nofil called those local collaborations the “most unsettling” aspect of the new version of ICE.

“I think that you just cannot undersell how dramatically that reshapes ICE’s power and their reach and their footprint,” Nofil said.

As with many other issues, experts warned things could get really bad if the wrong person was put in the White House, and not enough was done to make sure that things didn’t spiral out of control if that did happen. There were calls by activists and some Democratic representatives to completely “abolish ICE,” but despite what Republicans say, this was never embraced by Democratic Party leadership. Now, Donald Trump is taking advantage of the fact that things were not done to limit his powers when they could have been done.

“There’s always a lot of blurriness around jurisdiction and immigration law,” Nofil said. “It seems like they have kind of capitalized on a lot of that blurriness.”",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/08/ice_immigration_crackdown_trump.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 15:57:07.937301

What we know:

The local nonprofit announced that José Gregorio González donated a kidney to his brother, José Alfredo Pacheco, in a surgery completed last week at a Chicago-area hospital.

Pacheco, who lives in Chicago, suffers from end-stage renal disease and needed the transplant to survive.

The backstory:

Gonzalez came to the United States last year in the hopes of being a donor, and the two were scheduled for a transplant evaluation in April.

But on March 3, ICE agents arrested Gonzalez while he was accompanying his brother to a dialysis appointment in Cicero. His attorney said Gonzalez has no criminal record and has complied with federal immigration requirements since arriving in the U.S.

A month later, he was granted humanitarian parole following weeks of advocacy, including nearly 2,000 petition signatures and pressure from elected officials.

What they're saying:

""Today we celebrate not just a successful surgery, but the triumph of love and community over fear and cruelty,"" said Erendira Rendón, vice president of immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project.

González still faces the possibility of deportation after one year, though he is eligible to apply for a work permit in the meantime.

""My brother saved my life before being deported,"" Pacheco said in a statement on GoFundMe. ""There aren't enough words to describe his generosity. He's about to leave the country, but before that, he left me the most valuable gift: the opportunity to continue living.""

""This victory shows us what’s possible when communities organize together,"" said Tovia Siegel, director of organizing and leadership for immigrant justice at The Resurrection Project. ""José Gregorio came to this country with one mission – to save his brother’s life… While their story is remarkable, it shouldn’t be extraordinary.

Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.
According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.
The department said it learned the man, whose identity was not revealed, was wanted for assaulting a federal officer.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers opened fire during a targeted immigration enforcement operation in San Bernardino, California, on Saturday, calling it an act of self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.But the family inside the vehicle said they drove away out of fear for their safety after masked men emerged from unmarked cars and surrounded their truck with weapons drawn before smashing the truck’s windows.Martin, one of the three men in the vehicle, told KABC he was working with his father-in-law and 18-year-old brother-in-law on Saturday morning when their vehicle was suddenly surrounded.The agents did not identify themselves and the family stayed inside the locked car, said Martin, who KABC only identified by his first name.Videos recorded from inside the family’s truck show at least three masked agents wearing tactical vests marked with “police” surrounding the car. At least one of the agents is wearing a hat marked “CBP.”The agents are seen asking the men inside the truck to roll down the window, but the men refuse. The agents are then seen breaking two windows in the truck before the driver accelerates away.It’s unclear why DHS was pursuing the men in the vehicle.“Once the glasses were shattered, my father-in-law, fearing for his life from his perspective … he drove the vehicle away from where those agents were at,” Martin told KABC.It is unclear in the videos when officers were struck by the vehicle. In its statement, DHS said two officers were injured. It did not specify the severity of the injuries.As the truck drives away, three apparent gunshots can be heard in the videos and one video shows what seems to be bullet holes in the side of the truck. “Thank God the bullets didn’t go through the truck.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers opened fire during a targeted immigration enforcement operation in San Bernardino, California, on Saturday, calling it an act of self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

But the family inside the vehicle said they drove away out of fear for their safety after masked men emerged from unmarked cars and surrounded their truck with weapons drawn before smashing the truck’s windows.

Martin, one of the three men in the vehicle, told KABC he was working with his father-in-law and 18-year-old brother-in-law on Saturday morning when their vehicle was suddenly surrounded.

The agents did not identify themselves and the family stayed inside the locked car, said Martin, who KABC only identified by his first name.

Videos recorded from inside the family’s truck show at least three masked agents wearing tactical vests marked with “police” surrounding the car. At least one of the agents is wearing a hat marked “CBP.”

The agents are seen asking the men inside the truck to roll down the window, but the men refuse. The agents are then seen breaking two windows in the truck before the driver accelerates away.

It’s unclear why DHS was pursuing the men in the vehicle.

“Once the glasses were shattered, my father-in-law, fearing for his life from his perspective … he drove the vehicle away from where those agents were at,” Martin told KABC.

It is unclear in the videos when officers were struck by the vehicle. In its statement, DHS said two officers were injured. It did not specify the severity of the injuries.

As the truck drives away, three apparent gunshots can be heard in the videos and one video shows what seems to be bullet holes in the side of the truck.

“Thank God the bullets didn’t go through the truck. They just went in, got stuck into the door, but they were aimed at my brother-in-law, who was in the passenger front,” Martin told KABC.

Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.

At 9:30 a.m., about an hour after the vehicle stop, armed immigration and Homeland Security agents, along with San Bernardino police, surrounded the family’s home, according to the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice. They remained at the scene until 3:45 p.m., despite never presenting a warrant, “pressuring the individual to come outside and placing the entire family in fear,” the organization said in a statement to CNN.

“This is a clear abuse of power. Firing at civilians, detaining families without cause, and silencing community voices is unacceptable and must end,” the organization said.

DHS said local police “located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody,” but “he was set free” and officers left the scene.

“This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities,” DHS said in a statement.

According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.

Police told KABC they later returned to the scene after a request from federal officials due to a large crowd forming as federal officers attempted to arrest a man. The department said it learned the man, whose identity was not revealed, was wanted for assaulting a federal officer.

Most clicked story of the week:

When, if ever, is it racially discriminatory to use or to ban Native American mascots? Who gets to decide what a mascot should be? And who should pave the road to approval?

These questions are at the heart of a long-standing debate stretching from school sports to the big leagues. And in recent months, the Trump administration has brought that debate back into the spotlight with a push to revive Native American mascots on the grounds that bans on them constitute discrimination based on race and national origin.

Number of the week:

10,000+

The number of students Austin Independent School District lost within the past decade — resulting in about 21,000 empty seats across its classrooms. The Texas district is weighing school consolidations that could go into effect as soon as the 2026-27 school year, amid challenges with prolonged declining enrollment, Superintendent Matias Segura told families in a letter on Aug. 11.

Education in the courts:

Federal Judge Myong Joun is standing by his June decision requiring the U.S. Department of Education torestore the Office for Civil Rights “to the status-quo” so it can “carry out its statutory functions.” The order, which prevents the department from laying off OCR employees, comes despite a U.S. Supreme Court emergency order in a separate case allowing the agency to move forward with mass layoffs across the agency.The Education Department appealed Joun’s ruling Thursday to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking the appellate judges to allow the department to move forward with shrinking OCR.

A 2024 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission discrimination charge constituted an overly broad and vague “fishing expedition” that a federal court should block, the board of education for New Mexico’s Gallup-McKinley County Schools alleged in a lawsuit filed Aug. 8. Per the complaint, then-Commissioner Andrea Lucas submitted a charge alleging that the district discriminated on the basis of race in its hiring practices. The district claimed that EEOC refused a request for information about the charge’s basis, violating its due process rights, and that EEOC’s request was overbroad and exceeded its investigative authority.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling on an Indiana teacher’s failure-to-accommodate claim Aug. 5, saying the evidence raised questions over whether the teacher’s requested religious accommodation — an exemption from calling transgender students by their chosen names — created an “excessive” or “unjustifiable” burden on the school district.

Schools on ICE alert:

A 15-year-old Los Angeles Unified School District student with disabilities was detained outside of Arleta High School on Monday morning by immigration enforcement officers who refused to identify themselves, according to a district spokesperson. During the incident, agents drew guns on and handcuffed the student “in an alleged case of mistaken identity,” LAUSD Board Member Kelly Gonez said in a Monday statement.

In at least the third known time that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time, federal immigration enforcement officers apprehended a parent during morning student drop-off hours in California’s Chula Vista Elementary School District earlier this month. While the arrest was not on public school grounds, it took place near school property, outside of the district’s Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School.

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies are having “ripple effects” on immigrant children as well as children who are U.S. citizens living in mixed-status families, according to a new report by psychiatric researchers from University of California, Riverside and New York University.

As time went on, boats carrying refugees and migrants began to set sail from Libya with the intention of reaching Greece.
The route from Libya to Greece is notoriously deadly.
Refugees and migrants travel in flimsy boats, dangerously overloaded and equipped with engines not suited for such a lengthy and perilous crossing.
The rise in arrivals wasn’t just on Crete — boats were also reaching the small island of Gavdos, Europe’s southernmost point.","After Ahmed left Egypt, he made the journey through Libya and across the Mediterranean Sea to the Greek island of Crete. He carried with him not just the dream of a better future but the hope to survive. “Our trip was difficult,” he said. “We were at sea, and we feared we would drown. We had no gasoline for the boat, no food, no water.”

At the time he recounted his crossing, he had only been at the old Kitrenossi Building, an abandoned structure on the outskirts of Crete’s Rethymno that now served as a makeshift shelter, for one day. He described a grueling journey at sea. The passage from Libya to southern Greece, an often deadly corridor that was once used less often than the Aegean crossing from Turkey, has now become increasingly common. In recent months, displaced people from Sudan, Egypt, Bangladesh, and beyond have set off from North Africa to the Greek islands of Crete and Gavdos in growing numbers.

“As far as I remember, the first report came sometime in the autumn of 2023,” explained Lefteris Papagiannakis, director of the Greek Council for Refugees. At the time, he added, “there was an issue because we knew that there had been some arrivals in Crete, but we couldn’t quite understand how or why.”

Many of the early arrivals to Crete, Greece’s largest island, had reportedly intended to reach Italy. In June 2023, for instance, an Italy-bound fishing trawler from Libya went afoul of its route and sank off the coast of southern Greece’s Pylos, killing hundreds. As time went on, boats carrying refugees and migrants began to set sail from Libya with the intention of reaching Greece.

The route from Libya to Greece is notoriously deadly. The journey itself can take several days on the open sea, and survival isn’t guaranteed. Refugees and migrants travel in flimsy boats, dangerously overloaded and equipped with engines not suited for such a lengthy and perilous crossing.

Worse yet, it’s common for boats to run out of fuel or face harsh weather along the way. The Missing Migrants Project documented 139 cases of missing migrants on the Central Mediterranean route between January and February 2025 alone, making it the deadliest migrant route in the region.

Rihab had left Sudan with her sister, both hoping to reunite with their mother in France. That reunion is now shrouded in uncertainty. The sisters ended up in temporary housing in Crete’s Agia, not far from Chania. Having gone barefoot for days, Rihab now hoped to find a pair of shoes. “We almost died,” she explained. “Our journey was hard. The boat engine wasn’t working.”

“We were at sea, and we feared we would drown. We had no gasoline for the boat, no food, no water.” – Ahmed

Crete, Europe’s fifth-largest island, had never before been a sustained landing point for migrants, nor was it prepared to become one. Local authorities, eager to preserve the island’s visitor-friendly image, have passed responsibility for creating temporary housing facilities back and forth, despite clear signs since 2023 that Crete would face a growing influx. Combined with a lack of national government planning, this has transformed a manageable flow into a visible humanitarian crisis, during the heart of the tourism season, leaving real people in limbo. The result: men and women sleeping in port areas, sports fields, and abandoned buildings.

At the port of Rethymno, up to 442 people took shelter on a small fenced-off plot, hidden from tourists. Exposed to 40-degree heat (104°F), they had access to just three chemical toilets and no running water. They lay on blankets and pieces of cardboard, drying their clothes on the ground or hanging them over rocks by the port. The only shade came from olive netting, hastily strung up to offer minimal relief. The reasons they ended up there were unclear. Locals said the facility in Agia was full; others claimed it was the result of phone calls from high-ranking officials. Whatever the cause, it added to the atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty that shapes their daily lives.

Most were young men, and many explained that Libya is too dangerous to pass through with women and children. As one Egyptian man, at the time waiting for transport to one of the three holding facilities, said, “I hope someday I can bring my son with me.”

In response to far-right rhetoric that portrays the majority of arrivals as young men without legitimate asylum claims, and criticizes them for arriving without their families, several realities must be acknowledged. The journey is perilous, and it is often the men, those physically able to withstand the risks, who migrate first in hopes of earning enough to eventually bring their families. Moreover, Libya is notoriously dangerous, particularly for female migrants. It is known for its slave markets and remains a deeply hostile environment where women face extreme risks, including sexual violence, trafficking, and forced labor or prostitution.

One of the temporary shelters, a facility in Heraklion known as the “Fridge,” was off-limits to press, but multiple sources explained that the conditions there were dire: Refugees were held in a basement with no windows, and fainting wasn’t uncommon.

Many of the refugees and migrants had to wait for days under the summer sun at the port before the authorities eventually transferred them to the old Kitrénosi building near Latsimas. A dilapidated, makeshift facility, it was set up hastily by the municipality. It was only meant to hold some 150 people, but its occupancy now topped 450, according to Alekos Marinakis, a regional councilor with the Communist Party of Greece, or KKE. “We want people to live in dignity,” he explained. “We don’t want our country to become a prison of souls.”

In the dark, cramped Kitrénosi building, where the only bathroom facilities were chemical toilets, the stench of sweat and sewage hung thick in the humid air. People slept shoulder to shoulder on flat strips of cardboard retrieved from the garbage outside. Ventilation was as scarce as privacy. For his part, Ahmed, the Egyptian migrant, said he was just grateful to have food. “Life in Egypt is almost unlivable,” he went on. “It’s too hard. There’s no future there. That’s why we left.”

All around him, people lined up in the midday heat to escape the suffocating air inside the building. They gathered under the few trees that offered shade, or cooled off beneath the makeshift water faucets, before returning inside. Some asked for cigarettes. Others just asked where they were.

At the gate, new arrivals were getting off buses. They scavenged scraps of cardboard to piece together ramshackle pallets to sleep on atop the hard cement floor. Communication with the police wasn’t helpful. No translators were present, and the police officers shouted orders in Greek, adding to the confusion and tension. Arguments erupted — not just between police and migrants, but among the exhausted, displaced men. Across the street, staff turned away drivers who’d spotted a sign that led to the sea. This part of the island, it seemed, was not meant to be seen.

The rise in arrivals wasn’t just on Crete — boats were also reaching the small island of Gavdos, Europe’s southernmost point. At Trypiti Beach, eight boats that had shuttled migrants to Greek shores sat abandoned. Nearby lifejackets, clothes, and other personal belongings sat in scatters — silent markers of who landed and pressed on by foot along a nearby path. “If we kept all the boats here,” one local said at the harbor, “we’d be sunk.”

A ferry was preparing to depart, and close by, tourists on holiday sat in a small boat, fishing and drinking by the shore not far from a dinghy still holding lifejackets and discarded clothing. The eerie signs of desperate journeys were invisible to the tourists, who appeared happily relaxed as they carried on.

Refugees and migrants hardly spend much time on Gavdos, sticking around only when bad weather delays the ferries off the island, but many locals have adopted the view that their presence threatens the tourism the community relies on. Local Manolis Tsigonakis had escorted migrant boats to the shores during the trying winter months, but he was concerned. “We only experience migration in passing,” he said. “They’re kept at the port, but it still creates a negative image for tourists.”

Concerns like these have taken root amid the Greek government’s rapid shift toward far-right rhetoric on migration. Right-wing politicians now speak of the humanitarian crisis as a “hybrid war” and issue panicked warnings about the impact of immigration on the country’s social fabric. Still, Greece isn’t alone in this rightward shift: The European Union at large has moved toward stricter migration controls and hardline anti-migrant policies, some of which have led to embarrassing diplomatic mishaps.

In July, EU envoys, including Greek ministers, turned up in Libya with the hopes of visiting Benghazi. General Khalifa Haftar, the unrecognized warlord who rules eastern Libya, immediately declared the European visitors persona non grata. After following his orders to depart and effectively granting him legitimacy, the EU has appeared to prepare to renew engagement with Libya under new terms.

Some have speculated that this could result in a new migration pact flush with enormous sums of money for Libya, a deal not unlike the EU-Turkey agreement in 2016. These agreements, which the EU has also struck with Lebanon and Egypt, outsource migration controls to third countries: In other words, political concessions and funds are traded for reduced migration. “To prevent escalation, we’d give them money to run the trafficking networks,” argued Papagiannakis of the Greek Forum for Refugees. “Then, they’d collect the profits and cut their losses, somehow channeling funds into the war to help Haftar, who is aligned with European interests, win. It sounds bizarre, but in international relations, nothing is impossible.”

Meanwhile in Crete, the tourist season continues to deliver surreal scenes of leisurely holidaymaking alongside the misery of exile. At an exhibition center in Agia, a 20-minute drive from Chania, another ad hoc shelter has come up. Out of the three camps in Crete, this one has appeared most often on television. On the backside of the building, posters advertising tourist destinations are pinned up: “Must Visit Rural Crete,” “Visit All-Year Round,” and “Must Do Alternative Activities.”

During a visit to that facility, two refugees fainted from the heat. An ambulance soon arrived — one was worse off than the other, reportedly because of dehydration. People all around were asking for painkillers. Volunteers said many were suffering from fevers. Any health concern not deemed urgent on the spot meant a long wait to see a medical professional.

For the refugees and migrants, life inside the camp was a routine: eat, sleep, wait. Small children kicked soccer balls. Men and women stayed in separate areas. Two young girls sprinted to their father for a hug, then played games with one another beside him. Some prayed together. Others prayed on their own. One man grabbed a broom and swept the rugs scattered across the floor. Mealtime came around again. Some took showers in makeshift stalls. There was only one faucet they could all use to wash their clothes.

In exchange for waiting patiently, they hoped to soon file their asylum claims. For most, the Greek government has already dashed that hope. New migration policies mean their next stop will likely be closed refugee facilities in Malakasa or Amygdaleza, both on mainland Greece near Athens. On July 9, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced that his government had introduced a three-month suspension of new asylum claims for refugees and migrants arriving from North Africa. Human rights groups and legal experts have condemned the move, especially regarding Sudanese refugees fleeing an ongoing war, but the Greek government has only shrugged.

According to Papagiannakis, Greece has already violated the principles of asylum. For years, Greek authorities have carried out pushbacks — extrajudicial expulsions in which displaced people are effectively denied their right to request asylum — on the country’s land and sea borders with Turkey. Despite challenges, pushbacks have continued in ebbs and flows.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/DSC07713-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:18.401086

Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.
The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said.","Health officials say federal attempts to bar community health clinics from offering care to people regardless of immigration status will lead to unintended consequences for Nevada’s medical infrastructure while also preventing vulnerable populations from vital services.

The Trump administration in July announced changes to long-standing federal guidelines that allowed social safety net programs including community health centers, homeless shelters, and child care programs to offer services without verifying immigration status.

“Currently, no individual is being denied services at the Health District or Southern Nevada Community Health Center under this reinterpretation,” Jennifer Sizemore, a spokeswoman with the Southern Nevada Health District, said in an email. “We are closely monitoring developments, providing input, and preparing for potential operational changes should the policy take effect. Our priority remains protecting the health of all residents and maintaining access to essential public health services.”

SNHD couldn’t answer additional questions about the potential impact of the federal policies changes on undocumented people accessing health services, since the issue is being litigated.

Days after the administration’s announcement in July, Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia and signed onto a lawsuit challenging the rule.

Dr. Cassius Lockett, the District Health Officer for the Southern Nevada Health District, told district board of health members at a July 24 meeting that “a little over 50% of our clients in the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are undocumented” and could lose access to primary care services, behavioral health services and family planning under the rule change as written.

Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district.

The district is conducting an analysis to understand the fiscal impact from the federal changes, he said.

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had a long-standing practice of allowing various community based programs that rely on federal funds to serve people regardless of immigration status.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced July 10 it would reverse that policy and require agencies to check immigration status.

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in a statement.

In their suit challenging the policy reversal, attorneys general argued multiple programs “cannot realistically conduct verification at the door, such as 24/7 crisis hotlines, emergency services for individuals suffering an overdose, and homeless shelters.”

“Even if some programs could implement such verification with time and resources, vulnerable people lack government identification when accessing these services for myriad reasons—some may be undocumented immigrants, but many others are U.S. Citizens or permanent residents,” the suit contends. “For the first time, millions of people are facing a new demand before they can access the Nation’s most essential programs: ‘show me your papers.’

Dr. Frank Nemec, the vice chair for the health board, said during the board’s July 24 meeting that the decision wasn’t just cruel but could have a “devastating economic impact on an already fragile medical infrastructure” in Nevada.

Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.

Federally Qualified Health Centers, which receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations, are still unclear on the full impact of the rule change, said Randy Smith, the CEO of Southern Nevada Community Health Center.

“The individuals that we’re talking about are some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. “There’s also a public health implication. They may have communicable diseases that are going to go untreated. Certainly on the individual level, it’s about quality of life … It’s a whole system of care really impacted in a very significant way in terms of access to care and the costs associated with that care.”

While roughly half of the patients coming into the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are uninsured, Smith said he wasn’t sure how many lacked health insurance because they didn’t have legal status.

“The health center program has never had a requirement to collect eligibility documentation,” he said. “What I do know is a significant portion of them are and that’s because we’ve made efforts to help folks get on insurance and they’ve been unable to do so.”

There are also public health implications around the spread of communicable diseases.

The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said.

Some in the board worried that many people, even those who are legal permanent residents or have Green Cards, aren’t seeking care, including vaccinations.

Lockett said the district is working on doing more outreach to “make it clear they still have access to immunization services at the health district and they still have access to communicable disease services.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-8-15-25-at-12.01%25E2%2580%25AFPM-1024x5721755535895.jpeg?h=335cd77d&itok=O6ty4tqE,N,,2025-08-18 12:57:25.429379

The federal government has long acknowledged that tuberculosis is a problem in immigration detention.

But ICE detention facilities don’t necessarily have such rooms, medical experts said.

It’s better known now by its other name, tuberculosis, and it’s the most deadly infectious disease in the world, the World Health Organization says, responsible for killing 1.5 million people each year, even though it’s both preventable and curable.

Detainees have tested positive for tuberculosis at the Anchorage Correctional Complex in Alaska and Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, according to news reports. One immigrant died days after a diagnosis of the disease in the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, an ICE death notice shows. Detainees may have been exposed at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, according to a lawsuit. And in Washington state, several possible cases of tuberculosis in the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma were reported this month to state authorities, and one man was hospitalized for it, his attorney said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not respond to a request for comment. Officials have previously downplayed the presence of tuberculosis, the reports show, including responding to questions about the cases in Tacoma by saying, “This false claim needs to stop.”

The same conditions that allowed the disease to flourish at the end of the 1800s are hallmarks of immigration detention, medical experts and immigration advocates told the Prospect, including overcrowding, poor sanitation, and a breakdown of health protocols.

Tuberculosis outbreaks can allow the disease to become more resistant to treatment, one of the major global concerns about the massive outbreaks in post-Soviet Russia. And, of course, the disease doesn’t recognize the limits of prison walls, Dr. Leonardo Martinez, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University, noted. If someone leaves ICE with an active case of tuberculosis, they can transfer it to the larger population. “By protecting people in carceral settings,” he said, “we’re protecting people outside of carceral settings.”

There is no good reason why tuberculosis is spreading in ICE detention, Martinez and other medical experts said. They called on the Centers for Disease Control teams to control outbreaks and for federal detention sites to provide proper screening, isolation, and care, and to follow their own protocols.

Even simply giving detainees more space would make the situation safer, medical experts said. But they doubted ICE will spend much of its new windfall from the GOP mega-bill, which includes billions more for detention facilities, on detainee health measures. As the Prospect reported earlier this month, the two big companies that provide or run most of ICE’s detention centers, CoreCivic and Geo Group, are raking in the cash, with plans to expand thanks to “unprecedented growth opportunities.”

“I hesitate to say there aren’t enough resources,” said Dr. Katherine Peeler, medical adviser for Physicians for Human Rights and assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “ICE just got an appropriation of $45 billion, but if I had to predict, the line item for health care is not the thing that’s going to be increased.”

TUBERCULOSIS THRIVES IN CARCERAL SETTINGS of all kinds. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or spits, and it only takes a few droplets to sicken someone.

Those with active infections can develop symptoms that grow progressively worse, including a chronic cough that brings up blood, high fever, and “wasting,” the process of unintentionally losing significant amounts of weight. Almost everyone who contracts it needs treatment to survive, and those who do may live with lungs so damaged they struggle to breathe.

The federal government has long acknowledged that tuberculosis is a problem in immigration detention. More than two decades ago, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies examined the spread of the disease among ICE detainees and decided not to remove or release from custody anyone suspected of having an active tuberculosis case without first consulting the U.S. Public Health Service. Agencies have addressed the issue repeatedly since then, such as in 2011, when they held a conference about how to halt the spread among people in ICE detention.

National medical care standards in immigrant detention facilities require all facilities where detainees are held for more than 72 hours to have on-site clinical settings. But that doesn’t necessarily happen, as the recent lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security over its dirty and overcrowded makeshift detention site on the tenth floor of Manhattan’s 26 Federal Plaza illustrates. A judge last week ordered ICE to improve the conditions immediately.

Tuberculosis outbreaks can allow the disease to become more resistant to treatment, and the disease doesn’t recognize the limits of prison walls.

Under federal law, everyone entering an ICE facility must be screened for tuberculosis within 12 hours of intake, then subsequently retested every 12 months. But that doesn’t always happen, either, the government also acknowledges. At the now-shuttered Nye County Detention Center in Pahrump, Nevada, for example, unannounced inspectors from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General found that staff failed to perform such screenings before transferring detainees to another facility, according to a report published in May.

Anyone in ICE custody with symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis is supposed to be placed into an airborne infection isolation room with negative pressure ventilation, which experts in infectious diseases told the Prospect was necessary to avoid spreading the illness to other detainees and staff. Such rooms reverse the flow of air to make transmission less likely.

But ICE detention facilities don’t necessarily have such rooms, medical experts said. Instead, they often put those with infectious diseases in solitary confinement, which they refer to as “segregation” to avoid criticism. The typical solitary cell does not use negative pressure, detention and medical researchers said.

When they do use a negative-pressure room, there’s no guarantee staff will clean it between patients, as the unannounced inspectors in Nevada found. “We observed that medical staff did not clean the medical isolation room in between medical isolation stays. Additionally, wads of soaked toilet paper were stuck to the ceiling … and there was graffiti on the walls throughout much of the room,” the report stated. “Failure to thoroughly clean medical isolation rooms in between detainee stays increases the risk of disease transmission and other safety hazards for detainees and medical staff.”

Even if a location has competent medical practices, it may not have enough staff to execute them, as an unannounced visit to the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, New York, found, according to a report published in June. Investigators found there was no permanent physician or dentist at the facility, so detainees had to wait months for help when they got sick. As of September 10, 2024, the medical scheduler had a backlog of 150 “specialty appointments” for the next five months. Detainees had a five-month wait for dental appointments, too.

THE OVERALL SENSE MEDICAL DOCTORS have about ICE squares with that of immigrants, their families, and their lawyers: The U.S. government is unconcerned about detainees’ health. The litany of failures specific to tuberculosis is just one symptom. Others include reported outbreaks of COVID-19 and ongoing reports describing how ICE routinely denies detainees medical attention.

A recent report Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) published late last month described such instances in brief but potent detail, such as an attorney who reported that a U.S. citizen child with severe medical issues was detained with her mother, “and that when the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention. A CBP guard reportedly responded, ‘Just give the girl a cracker.’” Ossoff said he has received 510 credible reports of human rights abuses against immigrants in detention since the beginning of the year, including multiple instances of abuse against pregnant women and children.

Melissa Chua, co-director of the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection unit, told the Prospect in an interview that immigration detention staff are denying her clients medicine and medical attention, too, including people with life-threatening pre-existing conditions. One client in detention is a whistleblower seeking asylum from Ecuador, who is recovering from a severe liver infection and must eat a special diet. It would be straightforward to provide, but ICE won’t do it. He also hasn’t gotten the medication he needs to prevent the infection from recurring. In another instance, a high-school-age client said he asked for a doctor, only to be met with beratement and, ultimately, silence.

The ultimate symptom of the government’s disregard for detainee health is death, including by suicide. So far this calendar year, ICE has recorded ten people who have died in custody, including the man in Arizona who tested positive for tuberculosis, and at least one who news reports said later died by suicide, though the notice didn’t list that as the cause of death.

But that is an undercount by at least one. Earlier this month, 32-year-old Chaofeng Ge hanged himself in Pennsylvania’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center, according to reports. He is not listed on ICE’s death roster; ICE has 30 days to publish initial information after someone dies in custody and another 60 days to complete and release subsequent reporting.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment about Chaofeng Ge.

Experts expect the situation to get much worse in the months ahead. That’s because Trump’s drive to deport one million people hasn’t yet coincided with the height of flu season, or the GOP’s recent cuts to the health care system, or its exclusion of undocumented immigrants from several social programs. Active Medicaid cuts threaten to kick millions of people off their health insurance and have already shuttered hospitals across the country, as the Prospect reported last month.

Trump’s immigration raids are further eroding societal health by discouraging documented and undocumented people alike from seeking medical care, even when they’re very ill. So, medical doctors told the Prospect, not only will more people enter detention facilities, but more will enter sick and with weakened immune systems, which makes contracting tuberculosis much likelier. It doesn’t have to be that way, Martinez said, but it does indicate political priorities.

“We know this population has a really high risk of tuberculosis and many other infectious diseases,” Martinez said, yet the federal government and prison companies don’t spend the money to control them. “It gives some indication that this health care issue is not being given priority.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23384/download/Wimbish-ICE%20tuberculosis%20081825.jpg?cb=15ac46ef89a880bbf7233b81d3945a2a&w=1024,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:52.469288

Practical Guidance for Litigators Federal Government Cases: The Casa decision primarily restricts district courts from issuing universal injunctions against the federal government, especially preliminary injunctions that restrict the government’s conduct towards non-parties.
Courts must ensure that injunctive relief is no broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the parties.
Review of Existing Injunctions: Courts may revisit the scope of existing injunctions to ensure they are not broader than necessary, especially in light of Casa.","On June 27, the US Supreme Court issued a significant decision in Trump v. Casa, clarifying the limits of federal district courts’ authority to issue broad, so-called “universal” injunctions against the federal government.

The Court held that district courts generally cannot prohibit the government from enforcing a law or executive action against non-parties to a lawsuit. Instead, courts should focus on providing “complete relief” to the parties before them, not sweeping relief “against anyone, anywhere.”

Key Principles From the Decision

Universal vs Complete Relief: The Court distinguished between “universal injunctions,” which bar the government from enforcing a law against anyone, and “complete relief,” which is narrowly tailored to the parties in the case. The Court emphasized that “complete relief” is not the same as “universal relief.” Relief for non-parties should be incidental, not the primary purpose of the injunction.

Separation of Powers Concerns: The Court expressed concern that universal injunctions intrude on the executive branch’s authority by preventing the government from enforcing its policies against those not involved in the litigation.

Remand for Tailoring Relief: The Supreme Court remanded the cases to the district courts, instructing them to determine whether their injunctions were broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.

Implications for Commercial and IP Litigation

Courts will have to grapple with how the Casa decision impacts litigation that does not involve the US government, especially as litigants attempt to use the holding creatively to avoid expansive injunctions in other contexts. Recently, in an appeal before the Ninth Circuit, the appellate court rejected Google’s arguments that a nationwide injunction against Google was overbroad. In the antitrust dispute with Epic Games, Google argued that “Epic is a single plaintiff…[b]ut the injunction does not just impact Epic; it seeks to regulate Google’s interactions with over half a million developers, OEMs, mobile carriers, and Android app stores—none of whom are parties.” The Ninth Circuit issued its opinion on July 31 and explained that the Casa decision does not render the injunction against Google overbroad because “the scope of a permanent injunction following a finding of antitrust liability” is not comparable to that of a preliminary injunction against the US government “on a constitutional question.” The Ninth Circuit further explained that the Casa decision clarifies that traditional, parties-only injunctions can apply nationwide and restrict parties’ conduct towards individuals and entities that are not involved in the lawsuit.

Practical Guidance for Litigators

Federal Government Cases: The Casa decision primarily restricts district courts from issuing universal injunctions against the federal government, especially preliminary injunctions that restrict the government’s conduct towards non-parties. Courts must ensure that injunctive relief is no broader than necessary to provide complete relief to the parties.

Private Party Disputes: In cases between private parties, such as intellectual property disputes, litigants should still avoid unnecessarily broad injunctions. However, if broad relief is required to fully remedy a party’s harm, incidental benefits to non-parties do not automatically render the injunction improper. With that said, as a direct result of Casa, we expect to see novel and creative arguments attacking the scope of injunctions.

Review of Existing Injunctions: Courts may revisit the scope of existing injunctions to ensure they are not broader than necessary, especially in light of Casa. Parties should be prepared to argue whether the scope of relief was appropriately tailored.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 12:58:13.996598

Videos recorded from inside the family’s truck show at least three masked agents wearing tactical vests marked with “police” surrounding the car.
Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.
According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.
CNN has reached out to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and San Bernardino Police Department for further information.","US Customs and Border Protection officers opened fire during a targeted immigration enforcement operation in San Bernadino, California, on Saturday, calling it an act of self-defense after a man “struck two CBP officers with his vehicle,” the Department of Homeland Security said.

But the family inside the vehicle said they drove away out of fear for their safety after masked men emerged from unmarked cars and surrounded their truck with weapons drawn before smashing the truck’s windows.

Martin, one of the three men in the vehicle, told CNN affiliate KABC he was working with his father-in-law and 18-year-old brother-in-law on Saturday morning when their vehicle was suddenly surrounded.

The agents did not identify themselves and the family stayed inside the locked car, said Martin, who KABC only identified by his first name.

Videos recorded from inside the family’s truck show at least three masked agents wearing tactical vests marked with “police” surrounding the car. At least one of the agents is wearing a hat marked “CBP.”

The agents are seen asking the men inside the truck to roll down the window, but the men refuse. The agents are then seen breaking two windows in the truck before the driver accelerates away.

It’s unclear why DHS was pursuing the men in the vehicle.

“Once the glasses were shattered, my father-in-law, fearing for his life from his perspective … he drove the vehicle away from where those agents were at,” Martin told KABC.

It is unclear in the videos when officers were struck by the vehicle. In its statement, DHS said two officers were injured. It did not specify the severity of the injuries.

As the truck drives away, three apparent gunshots can be heard in the videos and one video shows what seems to be bullet holes in the side of the truck.

Watch a different angle here:

“Thank God the bullets didn’t go through the truck. They just went in, got stuck into the door, but they were aimed at my brother-in-law, who was in the passenger front,” Martin told KABC.

Once home, the men called San Bernardino police to report the incident, Martin said.

At 9:30 a.m., about an hour after the vehicle stop, armed immigration and Homeland Security agents, along with San Bernardino police, surrounded the family’s home, according to the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice. They remained at the scene until 3:45 p.m., despite never presenting a warrant, “pressuring the individual to come outside and placing the entire family in fear,” the organization said in a statement to CNN.

“This is a clear abuse of power. Firing at civilians, detaining families without cause, and silencing community voices is unacceptable and must end,” the organization said.

DHS said local police “located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody,” but “he was set free” and officers left the scene.

“This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities,” DHS said in a statement.

According to KABC, San Bernardino police cited the California Values Act, which prevents local law enforcement from helping federal officials with immigration enforcement actions.

Police told KABC they later returned to the scene after a request from federal officials due to a large crowd forming as federal officers attempted to arrest a man. The department said it learned the man, whose identity was not revealed, was wanted for assaulting a federal officer.

It’s unclear if the man was taken into custody.

CNN has reached out to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and San Bernardino Police Department for further information.

Anaheim Union High School District officials have held know your rights forums for the community and a town hall last month on keeping schools safe amid the ICE raids.","School district officials across Orange County have been preparing for a scenario they haven’t really had to deal with before: what to do if federal immigration enforcement agents show up to one of their schools?

While some have had protocols on the books for such a situation, they have been sharpening up those policies and training staff as students in Orange County start heading back to school after a summer break that saw widespread deportation raids rock the region.

Voice of OC reached out to administrators in five school districts covering Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Costa Mesa and Orange – cities that have strongly felt the impacts of the sweeps and where residents have called on city leaders to step up and support immigrant families.

Carlos Hernandez, Anaheim Union High School district’s director of Community Schools & Community & Family Engagement, said it was important for districts to prepare for ICE showing up to campus as they hear stories of families self-deporting amid increased fear and anxiety in the community.

“That’s what we’re trying to avoid, at least, to give them an opportunity to know what we are doing to ensure the safety and security of our families,” he said in a phone interview.

“Unfortunately, other superintendents may not make this a priority for their district.”

Officials in many districts say school staff would initiate a school lockdown where classrooms are locked and lessons continue if ICE shows up on campus or if there is immigration enforcement nearby.

They also say they won’t let agents in without a federal judicial warrant.

At the same time, some elected officials like State Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva are worried that the sweeps will have other impacts as families worry about leaving the house – a fear that could impact attendance, which in turn could impact district funding.

“For school districts, this could be a very big hit to their budget,” she said in a Wednesday interview.

Meanwhile, a 15-year-old boy with disabilities was detained at gunpoint outside a high school in Los Angeles last week before being released causing city and district officials there to look at expanding safe passage ways to schools.

What Happens if ICE Shows Up?

Anaheim Union High School District officials say they have been spending the summer break enhancing a 2018 policy dictating how school administrators should respond if federal immigration agents show up to one of the campuses.

“Now what we do is we immediately go on what’s called a level two lockdown and what that means is the school shuts the perimeters of the school, the classrooms are secured and locked. Instruction continues,” Jaron Fried, the district’s assistant superintendent, said.

“That gives our office staff and our admin time to, one, verify if it’s an actual ice agent or not and then, two, if they have proper papers with them.”

Fried, who is expected to take over as superintendent at the end of the year, said if the immigration agents don’t have a warrant signed by a judge they won’t be allowed to speak to the student or staff member they are looking for.

“If they begin to become more aggressive or abrasive, then the administrator knows that they may choose to elevate to a level three lockdown,” he said.

That is the type of lockdown schools in the district follow in the event an active shooter is on campus.

If they do have a warrant, Fried said the student or staff would be brought out to the agents rather than letting the agents enter the campus.

“We’re still protecting our students in large if they have a proper court order signed document,” he said.

While the lockdown is initiated, school administrators notify the district and the local police department.

“We’ve talked to our site admin about being very proactive with doing lockdown drills to start the school year and I hate to say it, but we want to normalize, God forbid, wherever the situation there’s preparation that has taken place on how to operate under a level two or level three lockdown,” Fried said.

He adds they’re asking parents not to come to campus if a lockdown occurs as they worry that federal immigration agents might show up to schools as a tactic to draw out the adults.

Garden Grove Unified officials have also implemented a new similar lockdown procedure as their counterparts in Anaheim if there is immigration enforcement near a school campus.

Administrators there first implemented their immigration response policy in 2021 which requires school staff to document and inform the district superintendent if ICE shows up on campus or requests data.

Under the policy, school administrators can’t grant access to the agent unless they have a a federal judicial warrant or if they declare “exigent circumstances exist.”

If the immigration enforcement agent enters without permission from the school, staff is instructed not to physically stop the officer but document their actions.

“We value our district’s primarily immigrant families and are committed to do everything in our power to keep our families and students safe,” wrote Abby Broyles, a spokeswoman for the district, in a Friday email.

“It is our duty and our moral imperative to uphold the constitutional rights of our students to attend school freely and without fear and to ensure our families know how to protect themselves.”

Rachel Monárrez, the new superintendent at Orange Unified, said the district has had protocols in place since January in case of such a scenario and immigration agents have to show a federal judicial warrant before they could be let on campus.

She also adds that the building will be locked while instruction continues.

Monárrez said that while she was not at the district at the time the protocols were instituted many districts started to prepare after President Donald Trump was elected to office.

“Just going with what was happening at the federal level, knowing that there was going to be more targeted approaches to immigration, and knowing that the families that we serve, the children that we serve, there could be a potential need for it,” she said in a phone interview.

Fermin Leal, a spokesman for the Santa Ana Unified School District, said school administrators are directed to contact the district immediately if a federal immigration comes to campus.

“Agents are routed to the District office, and no access to non-public areas or student information is permitted without a valid judicial warrant reviewed by District legal counsel,” he wrote in an email last week.

“Our goal is to minimize disruption to instruction, keep students supervised, and communicate with families if an incident affects school operations.”

Leal said the protocol was first developed in February and staff has been regularly trained on them – sharing a training video with the Voice of OC.

Officials from Newport-Mesa Unified did not respond to multiple requests for comment and emailed questions on the issue.

According to the Newport-Mesa Unified School District website, any request by immigration agents to enter a district school should be reported to district staff.

The district adopted a Immigration Enforcement Response policy in 2019.

The policy states the superintendent will create protocols for a scenario where immigration agents show up to a campus and train staff on those procedures.

The policy does not provide details on what those protocols are exactly.

Know Your Rights Resources & Student Support

School districts are also offering immigration resources and other support to their students and their families.

Anaheim Union High School District officials have held know your rights forums for the community and a town hall last month on keeping schools safe amid the ICE raids.

Beyond that, the district has launched a webpage with immigration resources as well as a plan to help families prepare if a loved one gets taken.

They are also offering academic and mental health support for students on campus as well as connecting families to food pantries.

“When our family calls and says, I need x, y, z, we point them immediately to site staff, to the people that they have a relationship with, and we go from there,” Hernandez said.

Broyles said Garden Grove Unified has been partnering with different organizations to host Know Your Rights webinars, distributing Know Your Rights information and helping families develop an emergency plan in response to the deportation sweeps.

They also have created a hotline to help respond to families’ needs and trained staff on how to provide social emotional support to students and families struggling with immigration related challenges.

“Over the Summer, we launched a Family Helpline (714-663-6257) which now has extended hours and is staffed by bilingual community liaisons who provide connections to food, immigration assistance, mental health counseling, legal referrals, and more—in Spanish, Vietnamese, and additional languages upon request,” wrote Broyles in an email.

Monárrez said Orange Unified has launched a webpage with a variety of resources for families including Know Your Rights information and a resource handbook is being shared with school staff.

“It just shows where all these resources are,” she said. “If there’s food insecurity, here’s what you can share with the family. If they need shelter, here’s what you can share so all those things are put into this resource handbook that was pulled together by our staff really aligning to what’s already in the community.”

Leal said Santa Ana Unified offers mental health support for students. The district also has a Know Your Rights page on their website as well.

Offering Online Options

District leaders in Anaheim are also offering families who do not want to go to school right now the option to learn virtually from home or enter a hybrid educational program.

“You can imagine the fear and the anxiety of sending your student to school and not knowing if they’re going to be coming back to you if the ICE agents are out in the community. So we’ve had a few families reach out, and so we’ve developed some options,” Robert Saldivar, the district’s executive director of educational services, said in a phone interview.

One of the options is the district’s independent learning center which offers a hybrid or virtual educational program and home visits from teachers, counselors and social workers.

Officials in other districts are encouraging in person attendance but also offering virtual options in some circumstances.

Broyles said Garden Grove Unified is offering a virtual learning academy but also increasing bus options for families scared to take their kids to school.

Monárrez said in-person learning is really important for students but there is an option for people to temporarily enroll into their virtual academy .

“They can do a 15-day, short term independent study where they would do some learning at home, not the ideal, but for some families, that might be just enough for them to feel comfortable. So we are going to give them options, but we’re really going to try to encourage them to bring their children to school,” she said.

Leal said the district can work with families on short-term independent study in limited circumstances on a case by case basis reviewed by principals and counselors.

Meanwhile, officials in Anaheim Union High School District – who say they have one of the strongest protocols in place in OC – are worried that other districts are not planning for ICE coming to campus as thoroughly as they are.

Salidivar said he hopes other districts in the county will follow the lead they have set.

“I can’t imagine how many families are out there … feeling paralyzed and not knowing who to turn to in terms of their son or daughter’s education,” he said in a phone interview.

Fried agreed.

“I don’t think there’s another district doing what we do,” he said.

“I think we’re way out in front even in this work.”

By contrast, it does not encompass the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.
Therefore, their U.S.-born children are birthright citizens, in contrast to the children of diplomats.
As to each of the three established excepted categories of persons born in the United States, the answer to that question was: no.
The “occupied forces” exception applies when a foreign sovereign has displaced the federal government in the United States.","This is the second in a series of four articles about the many pending suits that challenge the legality of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order No. 14160 (the “Citizenship Order”). In that Order, Trump declares that two categories of persons born in the United States to foreign nationals are not U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth, and instructs federal officials not to treat them as citizens, at least if they were or will be born after February 19, 2025. (In an earlier post I briefly discuss the implications for individuals born before that date.)

A couple of weeks ago, I published a long post about the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., in which I assessed (among other things) how the Court’s decision might affect the nonsubstantive questions that remain open and contested in the lower court cases. The remaining posts in this series, beginning with this one, are about the substantive merits of the challenges to the Trump Citizenship Order. Of course, by now many scholars and lawyers have written a great deal about this issue. I don’t intend to rehash all of that here. Instead, my focus in this and the remaining installments of this series is on the Department of Justice’s arguments in support of the Trump Citizenship Order in the courts of appeals, because those arguments are likely to shape how the Supreme Court approaches the question when it eventually considers the merits.

Recently, in Washington v. Trump, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit became the first appellate court to opine on the legality of Trump’s attempted redefinition of birthright citizenship. Like every other court (or Supreme Court Justice) to have addressed the merits in the past few months, the Ninth Circuit panel concluded that the purported limits on birthright citizenship in the Trump Citizenship Order are likely to be inconsistent with the Citizenship Clause found in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The panel also held that the Citizenship Order likely violates the statutory provision establishing birthright citizenship, 8 U.S.C. § 1401. (These holdings, like those of other courts, were framed in terms of the “likelihood” of unlawfulness because they were issued at a preliminary stage in the litigation. None of the courts, however, has concluded that it’s a close question and the issue has been fully briefed; in other words, “likelihood” is a virtual certainty here.)

As the Supreme Court noted in its decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. (pp. 24-25 n.18), the Solicitor General committed to the Court that he would “absolutely” seek certiorari when the Government lost one of its pending appeals. Therefore, presumably the SG will petition for certiorari from the Ninth Circuit decision sometime in the next few weeks or months (assuming the court of appeals doesn’t hear the case en banc).

On August 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit heard two oral arguments in three other cases raising the merits issues—two from U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts (O. Doe v. Trump and New Jersey v. Trump) and the third from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire (New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support v. Trump). Until recently, an appeal was also pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in CASA, Inc. v. Trump, but on July 29 that court dismissed the appeal and remanded the case to the district court, which has now entered a new preliminary injunction protecting a certified class of plaintiffs that includes every child born after February 19, 2025 who’s covered by the Citizenship Order. That classwide preliminary injunction conforms with another such injunction that a district court in New Hampshire entered on July 10. The Government has yet to appeal either of these classwide preliminary injunctions, but it might do so soon.

Judge Ronald Gould’s opinion for the Ninth Circuit in Washington v. Trump, joined by Senior Judge Michael Daly Hawkins, nicely summarizes the judiciary’s uniform views on the merits thus far. (Judge Patrick Bumatay dissented on questions related to the standing of States to challenge the implementation of the Citizenship Order. He did not address the merits.) Interested readers should start with the relevant section of Judge Gould’s opinion (see pages 24-43) in order to understand the merits questions. The remainder of this series offers a deeper dive into certain important and/or underemphasized aspects of the Department of Justice’s arguments in defense of the Citizenship Order.

In this post, I evaluate DOJ’s lead argument in each of its appellate briefs, which is an argument about what the key, contested phrase in the Citizenship Clause—“subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]”—allegedly cannot mean.

According to DOJ, the plaintiffs’ proposed construction, which the Ninth Circuit, several district courts, and three Supreme Court Justices in Trump v. CASA, Inc. have now adopted, simply can’t be right because (according to DOJ) it’s inconsistent with at least two of the accepted, historical exceptions to birthright citizenship. My primary objective in this post is to explain why, properly understood, the plaintiffs’ reading of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” derived from the Supreme Court’s governing opinions in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), does justify the three established exceptions but does not cover the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.

The next article will examine DOJ’s principal affirmative reading of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” which is that it requires a person born in the United States also to be domiciled here on the date of birth in order to be a birthright citizen. That post will explain why DOJ’s “domicile” argument can’t be reconciled with the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court’s governing opinion in Wong Kim Ark. It’ll also highlight an important, and widely overlooked, aspect of DOJ’s affirmative argument, which is that it’s almost entirely devoted to defending the second (and less numerous) category of persons identified in Section 1 of the Trump Citizenship Order—persons born in the U.S. to women who were, on that date, lawfully but temporarily present in the country (for example, on a work or student visa). As the post will discuss, DOJ’s reading of the Citizenship Clause offers almost nothing in support of the Order’s declaration that the first, and much larger, category of persons—those born in the U.S. to women who, on the date of birth, were not legally authorized to be in the country—are not birthplace citizens.

In my final post, I’ll address plaintiffs’ (and certain amici’s) statutory argument, which is independently sufficient to demonstrate that the Trump Citizenship Order is unlawful. That article will explain that DOJ’s argument about the relevant statutory enactments—in 1940 and 1952—is based upon an unconvincing account of the public and governmental understanding of the scope of birthright citizenship in the decades between Wong Kim Ark and 1952.

* * * *

The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” A federal statute Congress first enacted in 1940, and re-enacted in 1952, likewise provides, in materially identical language, that “a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” shall be a national and citizen of the United States “at birth.” 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a).

On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump issued the Citizenship Order. Section 1 of that Order declares that neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the federal statute guarantees U.S. citizenship for two categories of persons who were born in the United States to a father who wasn’t a citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the person’s birth: (1) those whose mothers were “unlawfully present” in the United States on the person’s date of birth; and (2) those whose mothers were lawfully present in the United States on a temporary basis, such as on a student, work, or tourist visa, on the child’s date of birth. (Sections 2 and 3 of the Order direct Executive agency officials to implement President Trump’s new definition of citizenship in particular ways. I discuss those aspects of the Order in my earlier article.)

All parties in the various suits agree that the legality of the Citizenship Order turns on the constitutional and statutory phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently concluded that that phrase means, simply, “subject to the laws and authority of the United States,” such that an individual born in the United States is a citizen if, on the date of birth, she was “subject to” the regulatory authority of federal law—unless she falls within one of three discrete historical exceptions. Justice Sonia Sotomayor offered a similar formulation in her dissenting opinion in Trump v. CASA, Inc.: “To be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States means simply to be bound to its authority and its laws. … As the Government would presumably concede, virtually everyone born in the United States and present in its territory is subject to its authority and its laws.”

DOJ offers a different understanding of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]”—a very unusual, counterintuitive reading that depends upon whether the individual in question (the newborn) was “domiciled” in the United States on the date she was born here. As the next article in this series will explain, and as the Ninth Circuit held in its recent Washington v. Trump decision, DOJ’s affirmative, domicile-dependent argument about the scope of the Citizenship Clause is (at best) unconvincing in light of the Court’s rationale in Wong Kim Ark.

There is, however, one aspect of DOJ’s argument that appears to be much more formidable, at least on first glance. At the outset of each of its appellate briefs, DOJ argues that the definition of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” that the plaintiffs and the courts have adopted—in the Ninth Circuit’s words, being “subject to the laws and authority of the United States” at birth—simply can’t be right because (according to DOJ) it doesn’t account for at least two of the three well-recognized exceptions for categories of persons who, everyone agrees, are not deemed citizens on the basis of their birth in the United States—the children of diplomats and persons who are members of Indian tribes at birth. If the plaintiffs’ reading were correct, says DOJ (see, e.g., its opening brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 9), it would leave the term “jurisdiction” “without a coherent meaning,” and would read the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” condition “out of the Citizenship Clause, since everyone born or present on U.S. soil is subject to U.S. regulatory jurisdiction.” See also id. at 13-16 (purporting to explain how Congress has the power to subject persons in each of the excepted categories to regulation). And therefore, DOJ insists, “jurisdiction” in the Citizenship Clause must have some other, less familiar meaning.

The first problem with DOJ’s critique of plaintiffs’ (and the courts’) reading is that it caricatures that reading. The plaintiffs in each of the cases readily concede (or presumably they’d do so if pressed) that Congress has the power to regulate the persons described in at least two of the three historically exempt categories (i.e., all but the children of occupying forces). After all, as Justice Horace Gray wrote for the Court in Wong Kim Ark itself (pp. 683-684), quoting Chief Justice John Marhsall in The Schooner Exchange, “‘[t]he jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute.’” The plaintiffs do not take issue with that proposition. Their argument is, instead, that “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” refers to whether the individual in question was in fact bound by federal law at the moment of birth, rather than to whether Congress had the constitutional power to regulate that newborn person.[1]

Even so, this “negative” aspect of DOJ’s argument has at least some superficial analytic force by virtue of the fact that U.S. law does regulate, at least in some measure, two of the historically exempted categories of newborns—those born to foreign ambassadors and ministers, and those who are members of federally recognized Indian tribes. If that is so—i.e., if those categories of U.S.-born persons are not citizens (as all agree) even though they are subject to U.S. law—then how can it be that, as Justice Sotomayor put it, “[t]o be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States means simply to be bound to its authority and its laws”? That puzzle is the thrust of DOJ’s lead argument.

As I’ll explain in this article, however, not only is there a throughline that connects each of the three historical exceptions, but that common ground does, indeed, depend upon the application of U.S. regulatory law to the categories of newborns in question (rather than merely to their parents). The common ground, however, is not quite as simple as whether Congress has authority to regulate such persons (it does) or whether Congress has actually regulated their conduct in some degree (which it has, at least as to some of the excepted categories). Instead, as the Supreme Court explained in Wong Kim Ark (quoting its earlier decision in Elk v. Wilkins), each of those excepted categories describes persons whoare, at birth, immune in a material respect from the application or enforcement of U.S. law, such that they are not “completely subject” to the “political jurisdiction” of the United States.[2]

* * * *

Before I examine more closely the Court’s gloss on the “subject to” phrase and explain how it is designed to encompass the three recognized exceptions—and only those exceptions—it’s important to emphasize that the Court’s reading of the Citizenship Clause was powerfully influenced, and perhaps ultimately determined, by its understanding of why the framers of the Clause included that qualifying language in the constitutional provision. That doesn’t mean the words of the phrase are unimportant. Indeed, Justice Gray acknowledged in Wong Kim Ark that “the intention of the Congress which framed and of the States which adopted this Amendment of the Constitution must be sought in the words of the Amendment,” and that “the debates in Congress are not admissible as evidence to control the meaning of those words.” 169 U.S. at 699 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, Gray stressed that legislators’ statements were “valuable as contemporaneous opinions of jurists and statesmen upon the legal meaning of the words themselves,” id., and, of greater significance here, the ultimate touchstone for the Court’s holdings was “the intention of the Congress which framed and of the States which adopted this Amendment”—i.e., the Court’s assessment of what the framers were trying to accomplish. Cf. King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 498 (2015) (“A fair reading of legislation demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.”).

So what was the framers’ objective? In Wong Kim Ark, the Court held that the Citizenship Clause is “declaratory in form, and enabling and extending in effect.” 169 U.S. at 676. Thus, explained Justice Gray, the Clause is “not intended to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship, or to prevent any persons from becoming citizens by the fact of birth within the United States who would thereby have become citizens according to the law existing before its adoption.” Id. (emphasis added). (That understanding reflected the views of Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan, who introduced the Clause. Howard characterized the amendment as “simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already.” Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2890.)

Accordingly, far from establishing an open-ended condition that might apply to various additional categories of U.S.-born persons whom the framers had not contemplated, “[t]he real object” of the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase apparently was, instead, simply “to exclude, by the fewest and fittest words, (besides children of members of the Indian tribes, standing in a peculiar relation to the National Government, unknown to the common law,) the two classes of cases—children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation, and children of diplomatic representatives of a foreign State—both of which, as has already been shown, by the law of England, and by our own law, from the time of the first settlement of the English colonies in America, had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the country.” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 682.

In other words, in order to be faithful to the framers’ objectives, the Court construed the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” phrase as establishing a ceiling of those U.S.-born persons who are excepted from the baseline citizenship guarantee, rather than a general standard that might result in further exceptions for additional, unforeseen categories of native-born persons.

Until very recently, the fact that the “real object” of the Citizenship Clause was to establish a hard-and-fast general rule with a small handful of discrete, established exceptions would have been virtually sufficient, in and of itself, to decide the question of whether the Trump Citizenship Order is constitutional. It wouldn’t have been necessary to explain whether and how the Trump categories materially differ from the established exceptions. The only reason DOJ’s critique of the plaintiffs’ position might have any purchase at all in 2025 is that some Justices on the current Court purport to be far more textualist than the Court has been in previous eras—including in 1898, when it decided Wong Kim Ark—and concededly it’s difficult to understand the scope of the conditional clause merely by viewing the words in isolation, given the consensus about the three preserved exceptions.[3]

Even in this purported age of textualism, however, there’s nothing to prevent the Court from using such a “framers’ objectives” lens in resolving the challenges to the Trump Citizenship Order. Indeed, that approach would be fully consistent with the way the modern Court itself—including self-professed textualist Justices—approaches another very important, familiar part of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Citizenship Clause is the first sentence of Section 1. The much more well-known second sentence of Section 1 then famously provides that “[n]o State shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Read literally, that clause might appear to prohibit states from drawing just about any legal distinctions whatsoever among persons; its language, like “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” one sentence earlier, is remarkably open-ended. Yet in construing the Equal Protection Clause, the Court has developed an elaborate edifice of doctrinal distinctions among different forms of discrimination that has no grounding in the text.

For example, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett recently pointed out in her concurring opinion in United States v. Skrmetti, the Court has generally adhered to “the principle that ‘[w]hen social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude, and the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes’” (quoting Cleburne). In contrast, the Court has created various tiers of “scrutiny” that are to apply to some other grounds of discrimination in state and federal laws (e.g., race, national origin, and sex)—a method, as Justice Barrett noted, the Court has derived from Carolene Products footnote 4 rather than from the text of Section 1. The Court has also established “tests” that are to be applied at each level of scrutiny; and has applied such tests to countless different factual scenarios. The result is that, notwithstanding the broad prohibitory language of the Equal Protection Clause, grounds of distinction found in state statutes are ordinarily permissible … but not invariably.

In creating and adjudicating all of these fine-grained distinctions, the Court has virtually always disregarded the broadly worded constitutional text entirely; instead, the Court has focused on what the Justices believe to be “the real object[s] of the Fourteenth Amendment,” 169 U.S. at 682, just as the Court did when construing the Citizenship Clause in Wong Kim Ark.

Examples of the Court’s text-free, purpose-centered application of the Equal Protection Clause are legion. Most recently, Chief Justice John Roberts explained in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023)—as he had in earlier cases—that the Court applies strict scrutiny to race-specific distinctions, including affirmative action laws, not because of any textual command, but instead to reflect “‘[t]he clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment … to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States’” (quoting Loving v. Virginia). In that same case, Justice Clarence Thomas insisted that the Equal Protection Clause requires strict color-blindness “with no textual reference to race whatsoever”—indeed, even though Congress chose not to use an earlier proposal from Representative Thaddeus Stevens that would have provided expressly that “[n]o discrimination shall be made by any State nor by the United States as to the civil rights of persons because of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” According to Thomas, the lack of a textual hook is no matter; it’s sufficient to point to the “equality vision reflected in the history of the Fourteenth Amendment’s enactment.” (Thomas further noted that the Court applies strict scrutiny to race discrimination by the federal government even though the Fifth Amendment doesn’t include an equal protection clause at all (citing Bolling v. Sharpe).) Similarly, in last Term’s decision in Skrmetti, the extensive debate between Justices Barrett and Sotomayor about whether discrimination against transgender persons should be subject to heightened scrutiny included discussion of many factors, but the text wasn’t among them.

If the Court were to apply a similar sort of analysis to the Citizenship Clause, with an emphasis on the “real object” (Wong Kim Ark) or “clear and central purpose” (SFFA) of the Clause, then it would be clear as day that the Trump Citizenship Order directs federal officials to act unconstitutionally, because (as the Court has already held in Wong Kim Ark) the framers’ object in including the “subject to the jurisdiction” qualifier was simply to codify the three established exceptions, and nothing more. There would be no need for the Court to discern or apply any sort of Grand Unified Theory of what “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means for categories of U.S.-born persons who don’t fall within one of those three established exceptions.

* * * *

In any event, the Supreme Court already has determined the proper way to apply the qualifying phrase to various categories of native-born persons, and it did so in a way that fully accounts for the three established exceptions the framers intended to preserve.

There are only two Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Citizenship Clause—Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and Wong Kim Ark (1898). Justice Gray wrote the opinion for the Court in each case. “The evident meaning” of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” wrote Gray in Elk, “is, not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction, and owing them direct and immediate allegiance.” 112 U.S. at 102 (emphasis added); see also Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 680 (quoting this holding from Elk); Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors’ Snug Harbor, 28 U.S. 99, 155 (1830) (Story, J., dissenting) (“the party must be born within a place where the sovereign is at the time in full possession and exercise of his power”).

In other words, in order to explain the established exceptions that the framers uncontrovertibly intended to preserve, the Court concluded that the “subject to” phrase must be construed to have an implied modifying adverb: “completely.” Accordingly, the determinative question the Court asked in both cases (the “test,” in a sense, that it employed) was whether U.S. law entirely regulated the conduct of the person claiming citizenship himself—not his parents—on the date of his birth in the United States.

Before turning to examine how Justice Gray’s formulation explains the three established exceptions, it’s important to address two conceptual matters.

First, in its appellate briefs in the pending cases, DOJ oddly insists that the Court’s use of the term “political jurisdiction” in Elk (which Justice Gray then repeated in Wong Kim Ark) did not refer to the federal Government’s regulation of an individual’s conduct. See, e.g., Appellants’ Reply Brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 4-7. Yet Justice Gray made clear in Wong Kim Ark that even a temporary visitor to the country is “subject to the political jurisdiction” of that nation’s government in the sense that “‘for so long a time as he continues within the dominions of [the] foreign government’” he “‘owes obedience to the laws of that government, and may be punished for treason, or other crimes, as a native-born subject might be.’” 169 U.S. at 693-94 (quoting Secretary of State Webster’s report in Thrasher’s Case). In other words, the Court itself used the term “political jurisdiction” to mean the government’s exercise of regulatory or prescriptive authority.

Best I can tell, DOJ’s argument that “political jurisdiction” “cannot mean regulatory jurisdiction,” Reply Brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 7, is predicated entirely on the fact that the Court held in Elk that tribal Indians were not completely subject to the “political jurisdiction” of the United States even though it “was well settled when the Citizenship Clause was ratified that the United States could exercise regulatory power over Indian tribes,” id. at 6. As I’ve tried to explain in this post, however, the holding in Elk was based on the fact that Congress generally had not exercised its available regulatory authority against tribal members and thus had chosen not to subject them to Congress’ “complete” regulatory jurisdiction. There’s nothing inconsistent between that holding and the fact that Congress could have exercised regulatory power over tribal Indians.

Nor does DOJ offer any plausible alternative meaning of “political jurisdiction.” DOJ posits that an individual is only subject to the “political jurisdiction” of a nation if she owes that nation “allegiance.” That gets things backwards: required allegiance (at least while one is present in a state) is an incident of being subject to a state’s political jurisdiction, rather than a precondition for being subject to that jurisdiction. In any event, DOJ’s alternative understanding doesn’t support their argument: As the Wong Kim Ark passage quoted above, as well as others, establishes, and as the next post in this series will explain in greater detail, the Court held that even persons temporarily visiting the nation do owe it “allegiance” in the relevant sense—that is, they “owe[] obedience to the laws of that [nation’s] government,” 169 U.S. at 694—while they are present within its territory.

Second, there’s concededly something formalistic about a reading of the Citizenship Clause, such as the one the Court adopted, that turns on a fact about whether federal law regulates a person’s conduct at the moment of their birth in the United States. To be sure, persons born in U.S. territory technically owe obedience to federal law on their date of birth; they are prohibited, for example, from violating any part of the federal criminal code. But what does that matter, given that they aren’t aware of that law and, in any event, can’t form the requisite mens rea? Likewise, as the Court in Wong Kim Ark explained, 169 U.S. at 680, it’s true that individuals born in the United States presumptively owe the United States “direct and immediate allegiance” from the very moment of their birth. But, again, that’s effectively a legal fiction that has little or no practical significance, at least during infancy, given that a newborn can’t choose whether or not to honor such a duty.

Even so, the language of the Citizenship Clause does appear to make regulatory, i.e., prescriptive, jurisdiction over the child relevant to the question of birthright citizenship; and, more to the point, the Supreme Court held, in both Wong Kim Ark and Elk, that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” turns on whether the United States exercises complete “political jurisdiction” (i.e., prescriptive authority) over a person at the moment of his or her birth in the United States.[4] As I’ll now elaborate, that gloss on “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” explains each of the three categories of persons born in the United States who are not deemed citizens at birth. By contrast, it does not encompass the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order.

1. Persons Born to Occupying Enemy Forces

This is the easiest of the three established exceptions to understand, because it involves a situation in which the territorial government of the relevant nation is disabled from exercising regulatory jurisdiction over the persons in question. If, for instance, military forces of an enemy nation were to occupy and govern the territory of the United States, the U.S. government established by the Constitution would lack the ability to apply or enforce its law as to anyone. To be sure, in such a case the foreign nation wouldn’t establish territorial sovereignty (see Chris Mirasola); nevertheless, the newborn child of one of those invading forces wouldn’t in any practical sense be subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the sovereign occupied state, let alone be “completely subject” to it. Justice Gray explicated this exception at page 683 of Wong Kim Ark, where he quoted at length from Justice Joseph Story’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Rice (1819):

In United States v. Rice, (1819) 4 Wheat. 246, goods imported into Castine, in the State of Maine, while it was in the exclusive possession of the British authorities during the last war with England, were held not to be subject to duties under the revenue laws of the United States, because, as was said by Mr. Justice Story in delivering judgment: “By the conquest and military occupation of Gastine, the enemy acquired that firm possession which enabled him to exercise the fullest rights of sovereignty over that place. The sovereignty of the United States over the territory was, of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced there, or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who remained and submitted to the conquerors. By the surrender the inhabitants passed under a temporary allegiance to the British Government, and were bound by such laws, and such only, as it chose to recognize and impose. From the nature of the case, no other laws could be obligatory upon them, for, where there is no protection or allegiance or sovereignty, there can be no claim to obedience.”

The “foreign enemy occupation” exception does, however, raise one thorny question. What about other children born during such an occupation, including to the citizens of the occupied state itself? Like the children of the occupying forces, they are not in a practical sense subject to the jurisdiction of the “native” nation at birth because the government of that state has been displaced. Does this mean that they’re not birthright citizens and therefore must be naturalized after the occupation ends in order to become citizens?

I haven’t studied how the common law treated such persons, but I imagine that it deemed them to be birthright citizens after the occupation, in contrast with the children born to the occupiers themselves. That is, in any event, what Justice Story himself suggested in his dissenting opinion in Inglis v. Trustees of Sailors’ Snug Harbor (1830). Story explained (28 U.S. at 156) that “the children of the natives, born during such temporary occupation by conquest, are, upon a reconquest or reoccupation by the original sovereign, deemed, by a sort of postliminy, to be subjects from their birth although they were then under the actual sovereignty and allegiance of an enemy.” (The majority in that case didn’t disagree with Story on this point—they didn’t address it because the case itself didn’t concern a dispute about birthright citizenship.) I assume Story was right about that, but it hardly matters whether his is the best explanation because—fortunately—this isn’t a conundrum the United States has had to deal with for centuries, if ever.

2. Persons Born to Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers

The second established exception is that the children of foreign ambassadors and ministers born in the United States are not U.S. citizens by virtue of their native birth because the national government has afforded them a particular sort of immunity from the enforcement of domestic law. See Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 685 (incorporating Chief Justice Marshall’s description in The Schooner Exchange (1812) of the form of diplomatic immunity that protects “foreign ministers”).[5] Notably, this exception is uncontroverted despite the fact that such persons are “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States in the sense that they are obligated to comply with U.S. law.

It’s a mistake to assume, as many commonly do, that doctrines of “diplomatic immunity” afford foreign ministers and their families—let alone all foreign representatives—a right to violate domestic law while they’re present in the United States. Even the foreign representatives protected by the strongest form of such immunity—“personal inviolability,” which is the common label for the sort of immunity the Court discussed in Wong Km Ark—are generally subject to U.S. law, in at least two important senses: (i) they have a legal obligation to comply with the law; and (ii) law enforcement officials can constrain them from committing offenses. They also can be removed from the United States if they violate its law, and they can even be subjected to trial for violating the law if their home country consents.[6] Thus, as the State Department explains, “[i]t should be emphasized that even at its highest level, diplomatic immunity does not exempt diplomatic officers from the obligation of conforming with national and local laws and regulations. Diplomatic immunity is not intended to serve as a license for persons to flout the law and purposely avoid liability for their actions.”

The more limited effect of the doctrine of personal inviolability is, instead, that covered diplomatic representatives (and their family members) may not be subjected to criminal trial or sanction (nor to civil proceedings, either, except under particular circumstances) for violating the law of the host state, absent the consent of their home state. Moreover, in most cases they can’t be arrested or held in custody, either, though they can be temporarily interdicted in order to prevent them from violating the law.

This is a longstanding norm of international relations, which now appears in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Such personal inviolability is only available by virtue of the host state’s consent, see Won Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684, but virtually all nations confer it, not only because they have entered into a treaty requiring it, but also because their ability to engage in foreign relations would be significantly compromised if they didn’t extend such inviolability. As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in The Schooner Exchange (quoted in Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 685), “without such exemption, every sovereign would hazard his own dignity by employing a public minister abroad. His minister would owe temporary and local allegiance to a foreign prince, and would be less competent to the objects of his mission.”

The First Congress codified the personal inviolability rule in Section 25 of the 1790 Crimes Act, 1 Stat. 117-18,[7] and it remains U.S. law today.[8] Under current law, as under early American law, such personal inviolability extends only to diplomatic agents and to family members who are part of their households—including newborns.[9]

Because the children of such diplomats themselves enjoy personal inviolability, they don’t become U.S. citizens when born in the United States. This exception carries over into the Constitution the common law rule that the Citizenship Clause incorporates. See Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 658 (“every child born in England of alien parents was a natural-born subject, unless the child of an ambassador or other diplomatic agent of a foreign State, or of an alien enemy in hostile occupation of the place where the child was born) (emphasis added)).

Importantly, children born in the United States to all other sorts of foreign representatives are citizens pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment because they are not protected by the personal inviolability rule. For example, although consular officials enjoy some limited forms of immunity when performing official acts, they and their families aren’t entitled to the personal inviolability that diplomats and their families have even for conduct undertaken in their personal capacity, because the consuls don’t represent their home nations in the conduct of foreign relations. See Foreign Ministers, Consuls, Etc., 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 406 (1820); see also Respect Due to Consuls, 1 Op. Att’y Gen. 41, 42 (1794) (because a consul “is not in any degree invested with the representative character[,] it has, more than once, been judicially determined that he is not entitled to the privileges attached to the person of every public minister”). Therefore, their U.S.-born children are birthright citizens, in contrast to the children of diplomats. (Check out, for example, the extraordinary case of Moncada v. Blinken, 680 F. Supp. 3d 1190 (C.D. Cal. 2023), in which the State Department treated the plaintiff as a citizen for many decades based upon the assumption that he’d been born while his father was serving as Nicaraguan Consul in New York, only to have the first Trump Administration strip him of citizenship—and revoke his passport—when it determined that his father had become an attaché to the permanent mission of Nicaragua to the United Nations, a diplomatic position subject to full personal inviolability, before the plaintiff was born.)

The children-of-diplomats exception, then, is not a case, akin to foreign occupation, in which the federal government is incapable of exercising its jurisdiction over the newborns in question. It may do so, but it has chosen, in light of international law obligations and diplomatic norms, to confer upon them a form of partial immunity—freedom not from the application of domestic law but from being subject to certain means of enforcement of that applicable law. In this respect the United States has “‘waive[d] the exercise of a part of that complete exclusive territorial jurisdiction, which has been stated to be the attribute of every nation.’” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684 (quoting The Schooner Exchange) (emphasis added). Personal inviolability of the child of a foreign minister, which is “traced up to [the Government’s] own consent, express or implied,” thus creates an exception to the exercise of the Government’s “full and absolute territorial jurisdiction” that it is entitled to exercise. Id. at 686. And that, according to the Court in Wong Kim Ark, is sufficient to trigger an exception to the rule of birthplace citizenship, because although children born to diplomatic agents in this country are subject in some respects to the federal government’s “political jurisdiction,” they aren’t “completely subject” to it (id. at 680).[10]

3. Persons Born as Members of Indian Tribes

The final exception is the one the Court recognized in Elk—the only one of the exceptions that doesn’t have its genesis in the common law. A person who, at birth, is a member of an Indian tribe is not deemed a U.S. citizen pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, even if (as in Elk) they later purport to leave the tribe and pledge full allegiance to the United States. See Elk, 112 U.S. at 102 (holding that the “subject to” phrase relates to the time of birth rather than the date on which the individual seeks to be treated as a citizen). (This constitutional exception is no longer of practical importance because in 1924 Congress enacted a statute conferring citizenship upon persons who are born in the United States to a member of an Indian tribe. See 8 U.S.C. § 1401(b).)

In support of its argument that the plaintiffs’ reading of “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” must be wrong, DOJ emphasizes that this tribal exception exists despite the fact that Congress has the constitutional power to regulate the conduct of tribal members—even on Indian lands and with respect to other tribal members—and that Congress has exercised that authority (relatively rarely before ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, but more commonly after 1871). According to DOJ (reply brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 5), “plaintiffs’ articulation of the legal standard is clearly incompatible with the Supreme Court’s treatment of tribal Indians, who plaintiffs concede are subject to the government’s regulatory jurisdiction, … but are nonetheless not ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States for the Citizenship Clause, Elk, 112 U.S. at 102.”

The Court’s holding in Elk, however, wasn’t predicated on the (incorrect) supposition that Congress is constitutionally disabled from regulating members of tribes. The Court recognized that Congress has such authority. See 112 U.S. at 107 (discussing an 1871 statute, Act of March 3, 1871, ch. 120, the effect of which was “to require the Indian tribes to be dealt with for the future through the legislative and not through the treatymaking power”); id. at 100 (observing that historically “[g]eneral acts of Congress did not apply to Indians, unless so expressed as to clearly manifest an intention to include them”) (emphasis added).[11] What made tribal newborns “the anomalous case,” Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 683, then, was not that Congress couldn’t regulate them, but that it had done so only rarely: such tribal members might have been “subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States,” but they were not “completely subject to their political jurisdiction” at their “time of birth,” Elk, 112 U.S. at 102 (emphasis added), and therefore were not deemed U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth on U.S. territory.

* * * *

Before turning to the question of whether the persons covered by the Trump Citizenship Order are “subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction” at birth in light of the Court’s understanding of that phrase in Elk and Wong Kim Ark, it’s necessary to highlight one other thing about the three established exceptions to citizenship for native-born persons. As elaborated above, when evaluating whether an individual was born “subject to the jurisdiction [of the United States]” in Elk and Wong Kim Ark, the Court identified the relevant question not as whether the national government had authority to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over that person at the time of their U.S. birth—something it can do in all cases apart from occupation—but instead whether the government had in fact applied its regulatory power to that person “completely” on the date of birth. As to each of the three established excepted categories of persons born in the United States, the answer to that question was: no.

But that’s not the only thing the three established exceptions had in common. To be sure, as Justice Story noted in Inglis, 28 U.S. at 155, each of the exceptions is “founded upon peculiar reasons.” See also Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 682 (“children of members of the Indian tribes … stand[] in a peculiar relation to the National Government”). Yet they aren’t simply random, idiosyncratic situations in which Congress happens to have chosen, willy-nilly, not to assert its full authority over a subset of minors. (And they certainly aren’t cases in which Congress elected not to fully regulate a class of newborns specifically in order to circumvent Fourteenth Amendment citizenship.) Rather, there’s an important throughline connecting those three exceptions: Each is a function of a particular relationship between the United States and another sovereign—or, in the case of tribes, other quasi-sovereign entities. The “occupied forces” exception applies when a foreign sovereign has displaced the federal government in the United States. The “children of diplomats” exception applies because international law requires states to confer “personal inviolability” that precludes enforcement of the law against certain resident agents and families of fellow sovereign states. And the uniquely American exception for tribal members was a function of the federal government’s treatment of tribes as “distinct, independent political communities” (Worcester v. Georgia (1832)) embedded within U.S. territory.

Although Justice Gray did not write, in so many terms, that such an “inter-sovereign” justification is a necessary condition for an exception under the qualifying phrase of the Citizenship Clause, that characteristic is emphasized throughout the Court’s opinions in Elk and Wong Kim Ark.[12]

* * * *

By contrast with the newborns covered by the three established exceptions, all other persons born in the United States to foreign nationals are—and historically have been—subject to the complete political jurisdiction of the United States (as are their parents in the United States) on the day they are born. That includes both of the categories of persons described in the Trump Citizenship Order. United States law does, of course, apply in its entirety to a person born in the United States to a woman who entered the nation unlawfully (or who violated the law by overstaying her visa or other permission). And the same is true of someone born while their mother is visiting the United States lawfully—just as the law applies to the person’s mother herself while she is in the United States. As the Supreme Court held in Wong Kim Ark, when “private individuals of another nation enter the territory and mingle indiscriminately with its inhabitants, for purposes of business or pleasure,” they are not subject to any “exemption from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found,” and therefore that jurisdiction remains “absolute,” 169 U.S. at 686, as applied not only to such persons, but also to their newborn children. And the application of such “absolute” regulatory jurisdiction means that the child becomes a citizen at birth.

* * * *

The next post in this series will address DOJ’s affirmative, alternative reading of the Citizenship Clause, which is that a newborn in the U.S. is “subject to [U.S.] jurisdiction” only if he or she is domiciled here.

[1] The disconnect here might be attributable, at least in part, to the fact that most of the plaintiffs invoke the 1865 edition of Noah Webster’s American Dictionary of the English Language, which defined a nation’s “jurisdiction” as the “[p]ower of governing or legislating,” the “power or right of exercising authority,” the “limit within which power may be exercised,” or the “extent of power or authority.” The recent Ninth Circuit decision (see p.26) also cites that and similar dictionary definitions concerning a nation’s authority to regulate. Those definitions of “jurisdiction” are fine as far as they go, but they don’t address what it means for a newborn to be subject to that jurisdiction for purposes of the Citizenship Clause. Fairly read, the plaintiffs (and the Ninth Circuit) are not arguing that a newborn is “subject to” U.S. jurisdiction simply because Congress could in theory obligate that person to comply with U.S. law; instead, they contend that the child is “subject to” U.S. jurisdiction if such federal laws do, in fact, regulate that person.

[2] For what it’s worth, I think the Court’s understanding in Elk and in Wong Kim Ark was correct, at least as a matter of reflecting the framers’ objectives. Many others, however, have written about the original understanding and about pre-Wong Kim Ark interpretations. My focus in this piece and the next piece, by contrast, is on how the Supreme Court’s precedential holdings bear upon DOJ’s arguments.

[3] As noted in the text, Justice Gray wrote in Wong Kim Ark that the framers accomplished their objective by using “the fewest and fittest words.” “Fewest,” perhaps. “Fittest,” however, is a stretch. One can easily imagine “fitter,” i.e., more descriptive, words. For example, if, as the Court held in Wong Kim Ark, the “object” of the phrase was merely to carve out three discrete exceptions (two emanating from the common law and the other to deal with the idiosyncratic relationship of the federal Government to Indian tribes), and nothing more, the framers could have precluded any uncertainty simply by identifying those three exceptions by terms. Likewise, if the pertinent “test” is, as Justice Gray indicated in Wong Kim Ark, whether the newborn child is completely subject to the nation’s political jurisdiction, the framers of the Citizenship Clause surely could have added the adjective “completely” in order to be clear about what is and isn’t covered. As far as I know, there doesn’t appear to be any evidence of why the drafters of the Clause (Senator Jacob Howard, in particular) chose the particular words that appear in the qualifying phrase, rather than opting for a more cabined and precise formulation.

[4] DOJ at times emphasizes the flip side of the duty of allegiance—namely, that a birthright citizen “derive[s] protection” from the United States (Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 659). It’s true that that legal relationship, unlike allegiance, obviously is of practical significance at the moment of birth: The federal government has the same obligation to protect newborns from harm that it has for others within its territory, and when dealing with newborns it must comply with those legal obligations that apply to all persons—including, for example, the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Yet the Government has such obligations of protection with respect to all minors in the United States, whether they’re citizens or not, and whether or not they fall within one of the historical exceptions to birthright citizenship. (The federal government cannot, for example, refuse to protect children of ambassadors from harm, nor discriminate against them on the basis of race.) Application of the Citizenship Clause therefore cannot turn on whether the United States owes some duty of protection to the person at birth, for that would cover the waterfront and wouldn’t admit of any exceptions at all.

[5] As Marshall explained in The Schooner Exchange (see Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 684), such immunity also applies to a “foreign sovereign” him- or herself (e.g., a king or queen) when present in the United States.

[6] As to possible waiver of immunity by the sending state, the State Department explains: “Always keep in mind that privileges and immunities are extended from one country to another in order to permit their respective representatives to perform their duties effectively; in a sense, it may be said the sending countries ‘own’ these privileges and immunities. Therefore, while the individual enjoying such immunities may not waive them, the sending states can, and do. Police authorities should never address the alleged commission of a crime by a person enjoying full criminal immunity with the belief that there is no possibility that a prosecution could result. The U.S. Department of State requests waivers of immunity in every case where the prosecutor advises that, but for the immunity, charges would be pursued. In serious cases, if a waiver is refused, the offender will be expelled from the United States and the U.S. Department of State will request that a warrant be issued and appropriate entries to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database be made by the responsible jurisdiction.”

[7] Section 25 provided: “[I]f any writ or process shall at any time hereafter be sued forth or prosecuted by any person or persons, in any of the courts of the United States, or in any of the courts of a particular state, or by any judge or justice therein respectively, whereby the person of any ambassador or other public minister of any foreign prince or state, authorized and received as such by the President of the United States, or any domestic or domestic servant of any such ambassador or other public minister, may be arrested or imprisoned, or his or their goods or chattels be distrained, seized or attached, such writ or process shall be deemed and adjudged to be utterly null and void to all intents, construction and purposes whatsoever.”

[8] See 22 U.S.C. § 254d (providing that “[a]ny action or proceeding brought against an individual who is entitled to immunity with respect to such action or proceeding under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations … shall be dismissed”); Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations arts. 31(1) (“A diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State”), 32(1) (providing that the sending state can waive such immunity).

[9] See Vienna Convention art. 37(1) (extending that inviolability to “members of the family of a diplomatic agent forming part of his household”). Section 25 of the 1790 Act referred to the “domestic[s]” of the ambassador or minister. The United States defines members of the household to include spouses, children until the age of 21 (until the age of 23 if they are full-time students at an institution of higher learning), and such other persons expressly agreed to by the U.S. Department of State in extraordinary circumstances.

[10] Jim Jordan and 17 other members of the House Judiciary Committee, appearing as amici in some of the cases, argue that this sort of “partial” immunity can’t be the actual explanation for the “children of ministers” exception because “[i]f qualified, partial, or contingent immunity were sufficient to render diplomatic officials’ children not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, then the children of domestic officials who receive such immunity—e.g., judges and prosecutors—would likewise not be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and thus not citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment. That is wrong, of course.” Corrected Brief of Members of Congress as Amici Curiae in Support of Appellants and Reversal in O. Doe v. Trump at 30-31. Amici’s attempted analogy to judicial and prosecutorial immunity is misplaced. For one thing, foreign ministers, unlike judges and prosecutors, have “inviolability” from prosecution as to unlawful conduct undertaken in their personal capacity—it’s not merely an immunity for certain official-capacity acts. More importantly for present purposes, judges’ and prosecutors’ children don’t have any immunity at all, in contrast to the children of foreign ministers, who do. The relevant inquiry under Elk and Wong Kim Ark is whether the federal government exercised its complete regulatory authority over the newborn herself, rather than over the parents, even if the child’s immunity might be derivative of the parents’.

[11] The authorities the Elk Court cited for that proposition included United States v. Rogers, 45 U.S. 567 (1846), in which the Court wrote in dicta (id. at 572) that “it [is] too firmly and clearly established to admit of dispute, that the Indian tribes residing within the territorial limits of the United States are subject to [the United States’] authority, and where the country occupied by them is not within the limits of one of the States, Congress may by law punish any offen[s]e committed there, no matter whether the offender be a white man or an Indian”; as well as Crow Dog’s Case, 109 U.S. 556, decided less than one year before Elk, in which the Court appeared to assume (id. at 572) that Congress had authority to deviate from its “general policy” and to prohibit crimes by Indians against other Indians, at least as long as it provided a “clear expression” of an intent to do so.

Although the 1866 Senate debates are hardly clear on this point, it’s possible that some congressional proponents of the Citizenship Clause might have believed that Congress lacked any constitutional authority to regulate members of tribes—a view suggested, as well, by a sentence in an 1870 Senate Report, see S. Rep. No. 41-268, at 9 (“an act of Congress which should assume to treat the members of a tribe as subject to the municipal jurisdiction of the United States would be unconstitutional and void”). To the extent anyone in Congress held that view, however, it would have been inconsistent with the Supreme Court dicta in Rogers. And just a few months after the Senate Report, the Court adopted the Rogers dicta as a holding, going so far as to say that the propositions in Rogers about congressional authority over Indians were “so well settled in our jurisprudence that it would be a waste of time to discuss them.” The Cherokee Tobacco, 78 U.S. 616, 619 (1871); see also id. at 622 (Bradley, J., dissenting) (“the United States has not relinquished its power to make such regulations as it may deem necessary in relation to [Indian] territory, and … Congress has occasionally passed laws affecting it”). Congress itself likewise rejected any constitutional disability over Indians in the 1871 statute flagged in Elk, 112 U.S. at 107. Congressional enactments both before and, especially, after enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment also bely the idea that Congress can’t regulate the conduct of tribal Indians. See, e.g., United States v. Kagama (1886) (upholding Congress’ authority to enact an 1885 statute prohibiting Indians from committing violent felonies on Indian reservations); see also Maggie Blackhawk, Foreword: The Constitution of American Colonialism, 137 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 107 (2023) (noting that the process of Congress and the Executive regulating Native nations and their polities directly through domestic law “began much earlier” than 1871 “and progressed more informally over time”). Today, there’s little dispute within the Court that Congress has a “muscular” power to regulate tribal members. Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 273 (2023) (citing numerous cases); see also, e.g., United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323 (1978) (noting that the “general government” “alone can enforce its laws on all the tribes”); Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 56 (1978) (“Indian tribes are, of course, no longer ‘possessed of the full attributes of sovereignty.’ Kagama. Their incorporation within the territory of the United States, and their acceptance of its protection, necessarily divested them of some aspects of the sovereignty which they had previously exercised. By specific treaty provision they yielded up other sovereign powers; by statute, in the exercise of its plenary control, Congress has removed still others.”). Justice Neil Gorsuch is a possible exception. Concurring in Brackeen, he wrote that the proposition in Santa Clara Pueblo that Congress has “plenary authority” to “limit, modify, or eliminate the powers of local self-government which the [T]ribes otherwise possess” is “an ‘inconceivable’ suggestion for anyone who takes the Constitution’s original meaning seriously.” 599 U.S. at 328 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). No other Justice expressed such doubts, however.

More to the point for present purposes, and as explained in the text, the Court in Elk didn’t rely upon the notion that Congress lacked constitutional authority; rather, it held that newborn members of tribes were not birthright citizens because, inter alia, Congress had chosen (in light of the unique relationship between the U.S. and recognized tribes) not to subject them to federal jurisdiction “completely,” 112 U.S. at 102. Nor did the Court in Wong Kim Ark rely upon any purported want of congressional power in describing the three established exceptions to birthright citizenship.

[12] In Wong Kim Ark, Justice Gray discussed a fourth situation in which states historically refrained from exercising jurisdiction over persons in their territory, which also involved a particular relationship between sovereigns—namely, when public armed ships of a friendly nation are docked in a domestic port. Gray quoted at length from Chief Justice Marshall’s discussion of this issue in The Schooner Exchange (1812), 169 U.S. at 684-85:

[A] public armed ship, in the service of a foreign sovereign, with whom the Government of the United States is at peace, and having entered an American port open for her reception, on the terms on which ships of war are generally permitted to enter the ports of a friendly power, must be considered as having come into the American territory, under an implied promise, that while necessarily within it, and demeaning herself in a friendly manner, she should be exempt from the jurisdiction of the country.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/getty.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:57:01.248887

Federal funds, which have been choked off to some municipalities, have continued to flow to the city. There has been no talk of deploying National Guard troops to neighborhood streets, as in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville, elected to lead a blue city in a deep-red state, is trying to keep it that way with a rare gambit for a Democratic mayor. He has agreed to the Trump administration’s request to place a 48-hour hold on immigrant inmates at the city’s jail that would allow the Department of Homeland Security more time to detain them.

The new policy, a reversal of a 2017 city ordinance that limited how the police could work with immigration authorities, seems to have achieved the mayor’s goal for now. Louisville was removed this month from the Department of Justice’s list of sanctuary cities, counties and states that are being threatened with litigation.

But the mayor’s decision has also generated blowback from Democratic leaders and immigrant rights organizations in a city with a rich history of opening its arms to refugees and where Kentucky’s two headlining industries — horse racing and bourbon — rely heavily on labor from immigrants, including many who are undocumented.

Since the early 1990s, resettlement programs have helped make Louisville a landing spot for immigrants fleeing wars in Bosnia and central Africa, and economic hardships in Cuba and Haiti. Louisville, with a population of roughly 640,000, has more Cuban immigrants than any other U.S. city outside Miami. More recently, Central Americans have landed in Louisville.

The city estimates there are nearly 80,000 immigrants in the metro area, about half of whom are naturalized.

In announcing the policy change last month, Mr. Greenberg said he agreed to the request to prevent a widespread federal crackdown. “I will not risk the safety of our broader immigrant community,” he said.

While critics acknowledge that Mr. Greenberg was in a difficult position, they say that agreeing to the administration’s demands offers no guarantee that immigration raids will be tempered and federal funds won’t be cut off.

The move also raises the question of whether this will affect his political fortunes. In Louisville, he won in a crowded Democratic primary field by nearly 20 percentage points in 2022 and won the general election by five percentage points.

“Any day that we allow the administration to bully us is not a good day,” said Nima Kulkarni, a state representative who represents the area around the Churchill Downs horse racing track and is an immigration lawyer.

Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, has celebrated Mr. Greenberg’s decision. “This should set an example to other cities,” she wrote on social media. “Instead of forcing us to sue you — which we will, without hesitation — follow the law, get rid of sanctuary policies, and work with us to fix the illegal immigration crisis.”

But not all Democratic mayors are in the same spot. Some, as in Atlanta and Cleveland, do not have jurisdiction over the city jail. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams tried to allow U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into the city’s Rikers Island jail, but a state judge indefinitely blocked his executive order after the City Council sued in opposition. The mayor’s attempt to help the Trump administration did not stop the Department of Justice from suing the city.

Many Democratic mayors find themselves in positions similar to those who head law firms, universities and agencies that have promoted diversity initiatives. They face a multipronged attack from the federal government, which plays a sizable role in a city’s well-being through funding and policy.

Mr. Pureval, like other mayors who were interviewed, did not criticize Mr. Greenberg but added that “the fundamental question we all face is: When does protecting your constituents go from trying to avoid confrontation to confrontation?”

Kentucky Republicans have largely applauded the new policy, which puts Louisville into alignment with the commonwealth’s other cities. “Today is a victory for every Kentuckian and the rule of law,” Daniel Cameron, the former Kentucky attorney general and current Senate candidate, wrote on social media when the decision was announced.

Mr. Greenberg declined to be interviewed, but in his public remarks, he affirmed his commitment to Louisville’s immigrant community. Shortly after taking office in 2023, he created the Office of Immigrant Affairs, which coordinates a free leadership training program for foreign-born residents.

But leaders of support organizations in the city were irked that the mayor indicated in his public remarks that he had consulted them before reaching his decision. In reality, the mayor simply declared his plans and did not seek advice, according to two people who met with Mr. Greenberg who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. A spokesman for the mayor did not respond to a request to comment on the characterization of the meeting.

The mayor met again with community leaders last week.

Mr. Greenberg has said there are about 100 inmates annually in the Louisville jail who are subject to detainers, requests by federal officials to be notified of a release. As of last Monday, just after the 48-hour holds went into effect, the mayor’s office said 36 people were being held in the jail who were subject to detainers.

Louisville had been holding immigrant detainees for five to 12 hours, according to the mayor. While every state has seen an increase in immigration arrests since President Trump took office, Kentucky has experienced the smallest bump (28 percent), according to data reviewed by The New York Times. There are rarely more than 10 immigration arrests per day in the state.

Some expect those numbers to climb as D.H.S. uses the lure of a $50,000 signing bonus to recruit new ICE officers in a state as poor as Kentucky. ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Some immigrants in the city who were interviewed said they were disappointed in the mayor’s decision. An owner of a Louisville restaurant, who came to the United States as a teenager and said he was in the process of trying to gain legal residency, said the new policy made him feel as if people like him were unwelcome. But the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is undocumented and concerned about drawing attention from federal authorities, said he was trying to stay hopeful.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/15/multimedia/nat-immig-louisville-top-ztbg/nat-immig-louisville-top-ztbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:35.370149

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 2025 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

They need to have a reasonable cause to believe the person is either at a risk of using the firearm to harm themselves or to make sure their reasonable controls are designed to prevent the sale.

Stacey Mayer with Connecticut Against Gun Violence says a new state law holds gun makers and sellers accountable and open to lawsuits if they fail to prevent illegal or risky sales.

One amendment groups object, but supporters say Connecticut is building on reforms since Sandy Hook, with a move intended to stop straw purchases, trafficking and sales to prohibited buyers.

In spite of Washington, D.C.'s violent crime being at a 30-year low, the Trump administration is continuing a crackdown there.

Borders Czar, Tom Homan says, deploying immigration officers in the nation's capital removes some criminals and deters others.

""I just saw an officer with a train and police taxis too.""

The move comes as former Vice President Mike Pence is voicing support for Trump's taking control of D.C. law enforcement and several GOP-led states sending National Guard troops.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott is calling another special legislative session to finish redistricting.

Democrats who stalemated the first session by breaking quorum now look likely to return to Austin.

President Donald Trump asked state Republicans to add five seats in the midterms, and Abbott says the new districts comply with court rulings.

But Tania Chavez with La Unión del Pueblo Entero says they're designed to dilute the power of Latino, Black and Asian voters.

The proposed map disrupts minority representation in K-12 South Texas and Central Texas.

And the ballot board would be triplet.

And the proposed map appears to have one goal, and that is to change the district just enough to force out the representative chosen by Latino voters.

Community groups in Nebraska are urging Congress to modernize decades-old immigration laws, by passaging long-stalled legislation creating a path to citizenship for Dreamers, migrants brought to the country as children.

Darcy Tromanhauser with Nebraska Appleseeds says that's better for families and local economies than sudden deportations.

We need better ways to transition from temporary to permanent status for neighbors, friends, family members who've been part of local communities for 20, 30 or more years who don't have a way to apply for residency. - Michigan state regulators may see tens of thousands of public comments on a plan by Canadian energy company Enbridge to replace part of a pipeline by tunneling under the Straits of Mackinac.

Other questions remain after rep's letter,"Bekah Morr, Paul DeBenedetto, www.keranews.org, rebekah-morr",,,,,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2025-08-18/does-dallas-partner-with-ice-287g,"What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?
Johnson gave Comeaux an Aug. 21 deadline to respond, and DPD said the chief planned to respond by that date.
But ICE also offers a “task force model,” which grants law enforcement “limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.” Johnson’s letter comes as the Trump administration continues its ramped-up immigration enforcement.
We know Chief Comeaux has faced criticism for his remarks about working with ICE.
It's voluntary if the police department chooses to become local ICE enforcers in addition to their other jobs.","The Dallas Police Department says it currently has no plans to enter into a formal agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, offering one of the clearest responses to date amid growing questions for Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux.

Asked whether DPD has opted in to ICE's 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to help in the arrest and deportation of immigrants, department spokesperson Corbin Rubinson confirmed in an email it has not.

Asked whether the department was exploring opportunities to partner with ICE, Rubinson said, “The Department is not currently pursuing a 287(g) agreement.”

The statement appears to settle at least one question raised by North Texas U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson, who joined the chorus of people raising concerns about what they see as an unclear position taken by the department.

Johnson, who sent a letter to Comeaux last week, sought answers to six questions:

Has your department entered into any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or informal agreements with ICE or other DHS agencies?

What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?

Does your department collect or share immigration status information during routine policing?

What is the department’s process for ensuring transparency and accountability in federal partnerships?

Are DPD officers ever stationed or detailed to work alongside ICE officers, and if so, in what capacity?

Has your department received funding, equipment, or other resources from ICE or DHS this year? If so, for what purposes?

Johnson gave Comeaux an Aug. 21 deadline to respond, and DPD said the chief planned to respond by that date.

In an interview with KERA News last week, which can be read below or listened to at the top of the page, Johnson said Dallas residents deserved answers to those questions.

“I think transparency in government is important,” Johnson said. “Constituents deserve to know what policies their law enforcement and their local governments are enforcing or not enforcing.”

The 287(g) program is often used by sheriff’s offices and other agencies that run jails, as part of ICE’s “jail enforcement model.”

DPD doesn’t operate a jail. But ICE also offers a “task force model,” which grants law enforcement “limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties.”

Johnson’s letter comes as the Trump administration continues its ramped-up immigration enforcement. The chief came under fire after remarks he made on Fox News earlier this year, in which he said the department would fully cooperate with ICE. He later walked back those statements in part.

Since then, Dallas residents have spoken publicly about their concerns and have called on the department to clarify its stance.

The Community Police Oversight Board also wants clarity on Comeaux’s immigration stance, and has requested his presence at the board’s next meeting to answer questions.

Asked whether Comeaux would attend, Rubinson would not confirm.

“The Chief’s schedule for next month has not been finalized,” Rubinson said.

The chief did attend a board meeting in June, but the board was prevented from asking him any direct questions.

KERA’s Bekah Morr spoke with U.S. Rep. Julie Johnson anbout her letter to the Dallas police chief. The below interview has been edited for length and clarity. For the full-length interview, listen at the top of the page.

We know Chief Comeaux has faced criticism for his remarks about working with ICE. He later told reporters he was specifically talking about undocumented people with felony warrants, but he reiterated the department would continue to assist, ""federal partners."" What are you specifically looking to hear from the chief?

JOHNSON: Well, I think transparency in government is important. Constituents deserve to know what policies their law enforcement and their local governments are enforcing or not enforcing. And it was my understanding, it was brought to my attention that constituents and community groups have asked and inquired of the chief of police, did they sign a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, yes or no?

They've not been provided those answers. And so I sent them a letter asking the questions just to tell us what are they doing, so that the community can then know and make their own decisions in response accordingly.

Has this been something you've been hearing about from your constituents?

JOHNSON: Well, yes, with Donald Trump having this reckless program of snatch and grab, just people based on the color of their skin, irregardless of whether they're citizens or not, or if they're here legally, or about anything. They're just snatching people with masked men who are unidentified, and people are very concerned about that.

But also, there's a lot of crime, there's lot of responsibilities that the local police department is in charge of. I mean, immigration is a federal law enforcement program. And then Dallas Police, they're supposed to enforce local laws and state criminal laws here within our city. And so, you know, there's agreements. It's voluntary if the police department chooses to become local ICE enforcers in addition to their other jobs. And I think the constituents of Dallas have deserved the right to know if the Dallas Police Department's participating in that program. Yes or no? It's a simple question. And we just want the answer.

Your letter sets a deadline of Aug. 21 to receive a written response from Comeaux. If that doesn't happen, what then?

JOHNSON: Well, we'll certainly take a look at our next steps to see whatever we need to do. I would expect that the police chief would respond to a sitting member of Congress' question about whether or not they're going to engage with federal ICE detention officers. I sit on the Homeland Security Committee, and I think we can subpoena him to our committee if that's where we go. But hopefully he'll just answer my questions, so that the public can get answers to the questions that they've raised.

There was a story in 2023 about former police chief Eddie Garcia, who's now in the running for Fort Worth police chief. He joined Dallas interfaith leaders, did a block walk in largely Latino and Hispanic communities with immigrant populations, and he made a point to reach out to those communities to try to garner trust. With everything happening now in Washington, and with the questions you've raised for Chief Comeaux, are you concerned that the trust that has been built in the past is now starting to go away?

JOHNSON: That's always a concern. You know, one of the strongest deterrents to crime is strong community engagement and strong trusted relationships with the police. You want people to feel safe in reporting crime to the police, you want people feel safe in their interactions with police and notification and that community joint response. We all want a safe community. No one wants dangerous criminals roaming our streets and we need our local police. To have the support of the local community, it makes everyone stronger.

So, you know, just answering questions, letting people know, these are the policies of the police department, this is what we're gonna do and what were not gonna do, just helps provide trust and helps provide information and let everyone know what page he's on, so that everyone is focusing down in the right plane and on the same page. And so I think that hopefully the police chief will answer my questions and we'll see what happens.

I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I do have to ask about redistricting, since it's been such a hot-button issue here in Texas as of late. Obviously, Texas House Democrats have left the state to block the passage of Republican-drawn maps that could give the GOP as many as five new seats in the midterms. You've publicly criticized the president's push for this redistricting. What would you say to Texans who might be impacted by this process, who may be feeling disenfranchised right now?

JOHNSON: Well, you know, unfortunately, Republicans are more concerned about a tweet of Donald Trump than they are about the votes of their voters. And it's really unfortunate that they're doing such a disservice to the communities of Texas. Here in North Texas, they're dismantling Dallas County and Tarrant County, the urban core, and pairing that with rural counties, east, west, and north, and south to try to dilute the urban vote, to dilute the minority vote in direct, overwhelming violation of the Voting Rights Act. So I think folks are outraged. You're seeing Democrats really engage and feeling disenfranchised by Republicans who don't care about their communities and their rights to vote and their rights to select their elected leaders, versus elected leaders selecting their voters.

What are your thoughts on the Democrats leaving the state? And if their efforts don't work, are Democrats in Washington prepared to step in in some way? Or do you see this more as a state's issue?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02b0e9e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7540x3959+0+535/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Ff4%2F27194193464b8e524651c0523e91%2F04012025-dallas-police-chief-candidates-02-kera.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:38.664308

The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.
The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions.
The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.
The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is challenging the outcome of a vote in Mason that would enter the city into a detention facility contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.

The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to reopen the West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention center on Tuesday, voting 4-1 with two abstentions.

The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions.

Questions over the vote’s outcome surfaced immediately after the chaotic meeting concluded. Some officials reported that the vote was successful in approving the ICE contract, claiming the abstentions did not count toward the vote total and therefore the vote passed 3-2, a simple majority of the votes counted (but not the number of members present).

West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

But the ACLU says this is an error, according to the letter sent to the town’s mayor, recorder and an attorney who spoke on behalf of the municipality during Tuesday’s meeting. The organization stated that, according to the town’s charter, the vote should have been counted based on members present. Thus, it would need four votes out of seven total votes to pass.

“The Town of Mason Charter says any form of board action should be passed by a majority of members present if there is a quorum,” ACLU of Tennessee Policy Director Bryan Davidson said Friday. The charter also states that the board can determine its own rules, and has chosen to follow Robert’s Rules of Order.

Based on the charter, state law and Robert’s Rules, the ACLU said the contract was not approved.

“We do not believe that this contract passed, and therefore any action taken by the mayor and board of the Town of Mason to further the execution of this contract is illegal and it’s invalid,” Davidson said.

Mayor Eddie Noeman, City Recorder Lureatha Harris, and attorney Nathan Bicks could not be immediately reached for comment.

The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.

ACLU Tennessee Legal Director Stella Yarbrough requested a written response from town leadership within seven days of the letter’s receipt. The organization also included a request for all communication between the mayor and board members and representatives of both CoreCivic and ICE, beginning in November 2024 through present day.

“Zooming out from the procedural deficiencies, there’s a lot of questions here around the total lack of transparency in this process,” Davidson added.

The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.

The majority of people who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting opposed using the currently empty prison facility as an immigration detention center.

Eloise Thompson, whose family has roots in Mason and surrounding areas going back to the 1870s, was one of the residents to stand in opposition.

“We’re just absolutely not interested in a for-profit prison operation … at the expense of human suffering,” she said on a media call Friday. “Not only does it come down to the human suffering part, it really can eat at one’s soul to feel a part of something like that.”

The community in Mason is interested in economic growth, she said, but “moving forward in the right way and in the way that lifts those around us and lifts our community.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mason004seqn-2048x1219.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 06:56:38.354493

“People have called me the N-word online, they’ve called my wife a b**** and it just keeps getting worse,” said state Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford. He said multiple posts have called for his arrest and some have gone as far as to target his grandparents.

Paris, who has been in office since 2021, on Friday posted an Instagram story saying he had been informed of multiple reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the district he represents. He went on to urge residents “to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety.”

The story is no longer visible online as Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours.

He also encouraged residents to “look out for one another” and seek out legal and community resources if needed.

The post was soon shared by the X (formerly Twitter) page “Libs of TikTok” which falsely stated he was “doxxing” ICE’s live location and demanded his arrest. Doxxing is the sharing of people’s personal information without their consent, often with malicious intent.

Comments on the post called for Paris to be jailed, advocated vigilante justice and referred to him using racist language and as a DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) politician.

The backlash stepped up when ICE shared the post on the department’s official X page, and also tagged the U.S. Justice Department.

Paris on Sunday said he had been in contact with law enforcement officials, including Attorney General William Tong’s office. In a statement, Tong said federal law enforcement “should know and does know what First Amendment-protected speech is.”

Tong said the implied legal threat was “dangerous, disturbing and unacceptable” and that online harassment and threats against legislators and public servants don’t stop with words.

“We have seen far too much violence and death this year to ignore this kind of reckless rhetoric by federal law enforcement,” Tong said. “Please stop. Before anyone else gets hurt.”

House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, expressed his support for Paris, saying “the message of ‘neighbors looking out for neighbors’ is powerful and not uncommon for an elected official.”

Ritter added “any threats and racist taunts are disgusting” and said those responsible would be held accountable.

Paris said his own situation was mild compared to the fear that undocumented people in the country live with every day, and said he does not regret making the original post.",https://ctnewsjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/corey-paris-jr-20250729-1200x900-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 08:56:47.125164

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles issued her ruling a week after holding a hearing with the federal government and legal advocates representing immigrant children in custody.

Gee called last week’s hearing “déjà vu” after reminding the court of the federal government’s attempt to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement in 2019 under the first Trump administration. She repeated the sentiment in Friday’s order.

“There is nothing new under the sun regarding the facts or the law. The Court therefore could deny Defendants’ motion on that basis alone,” Gee wrote, referring to the government’s appeal to a law they believed kept the court from enforcing the agreement.

In the most recent attempt, the government argued they made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

Gee acknowledged that the government made some improved conditions of confinement, but wrote, “These improvements are direct evidence that the FSA is serving its intended purpose, but to suggest that the agreement should be abandoned because some progress has been made is nonsensical.”

Attorneys representing the federal government told the court the agreement gets in the way of their efforts to expand detention space for families, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Tiberius Davis, one of the government attorneys, said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores Settlement Agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said last week.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s.

The agreement set standards for how licensed shelters must provide food, water, adult supervision, emergency medical services, toilets, sinks, temperature control and ventilation. It also limited how long U.S. Customs and Border Protection could detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

In arguing against the Trump administration’s effort to completely end the agreement, advocates said the government was holding children beyond the time limits.

The Trump administration opened what it calls the largest federal migrant-detention center in the country’s history in Fort Bliss, Texas, under a $1.2 billion Defense Department contract.

Dubbed “Lone Star Lockup,” the facility holds 1,000 beds with a plan to expand to 5,000 beds by 2027. Inside are legal access and medical treatment areas, and recreational space — amenities that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say make it like a “traditional” facility.

Supporters of the detention center, like Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, say it will help ease overcrowding at other facilities and serve as a processing hub, sending migrants with final removal orders directly onto ICE air flights back to their home countries.

“Fort Bliss is an amazing military facility,” Gonzales said. “Everything thrown their way, they’ve handled. We should be supporting this, not attacking it.”

The project does have its critics.

“That money will enrich private contractors. Imagine what one billion could do for health care or law enforcement here in El Paso,” Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas said.

The new Fort Bliss facility joins Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” as the latest migrant detention facility to get pushback. Critics have alleged the facility suffers from flooding, unsanitary conditions, and even deaths.

Officials insist no one has died there and deny reports of worms in food or sewage flooding, asserting that the facility meets federal detention standards.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has already unveiled a second site he’s nicknaming the “Deportation Depot.” The facility is inside a former state prison and staffed in part by the Florida National Guard.

These types of agreements originated in 1989 at the UN Refugee Agency to help humanely address the mass migration out of East Berlin and elsewhere.

The “Refugee Protection and Mixed-Migration: The 10-Point Plan in Action” report discusses the “phenomenon of refugees” who move in “an irregular manner” from countries where they have already found protection and leave to seek asylum and find permanent resettlement in a third country, calling it “a matter of growing concern.” The plan created standards for countries to share the responsibility of aiding refugees in seeking asylum.

While the report addresses why migrants may feel compelled to leave a country they pass through due to a lack of resources, employment, or educational opportunities, it didn’t address how migrants may want to leave due to not being welcomed or a country that can’t handle larger influxes of migrants. In today’s environment, various elements are at play, like regional xenophobia and white nationalism in the U.S., that weren’t major issues in 1989, and now these agreements are being used for a much different purpose: to outsource human rights obligations.

The U.S. began using these agreements after signing a formal SCTA with Canada in 2004. The U.S. later signed more informal “Asylum Cooperative Agreements” with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador that were established in 2019 under the first Trump administration. While the Biden administration effectively cancelled those agreements, Trump has made it very clear just how his administration intends to weaponize them again.

Ms. Conrad said that as of late September, 48% of the court’s docket consisted of business cases.
Mr. Knowles presented a sworn stipulation that the total damages in his putative class action suit would be less than $5 million.
A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al.","Cases involving class actions that are of interest to risk managers and businesses are front and center for the U.S. Supreme Court session that begins Oct. 1.

Foremost among them is The Standard Fire Insurance Co. v. Greg Knowles, which deals with criteria that determine whether a class action can be moved to federal court from state court as permitted under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005.

Knowles is one of several cases the Supreme Court has accepted that are of interest to risk managers and businesses in general.

In fact, the Supreme Court once again is tackling a considerable business docket after broad issues such as health care reform and immigration reform overshadowed business cases in the last term, Robin S. Conrad, executive vice president of the Washington-based National Chamber Litigation Center, which handles litigation for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said during a court preview late last month.

Ms. Conrad said that as of late September, 48% of the court’s docket consisted of business cases. Since then, the court has agreed to hear an additional business-related case regarding the scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement powers.

But possibly the most closely watched case with risk management implications is Knowles. Under CAFA, the amount in controversy in a class action must be at least $5 million for such a case to be moved to federal court.

Mr. Knowles presented a sworn stipulation that the total damages in his putative class action suit would be less than $5 million. That was disputed by Standard, which argued the stipulation’s language “does not adequately bind plaintiff” and that the total amount will exceed $5 million once attorneys’ fees and costs are included, according to the Dec. 2, 2011, ruling by Judge P.K. Holmes III, chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Fort Smith, Ark.

%%BREAK%%

Ruling in the plaintiff’s favor, Judge Holmes said, “The question is whether a plaintiff may meet his burden of proof by stipulating at the time the complaint is filed that he will not seek more than the federal jurisdictional minimum for himself and the putative class.”

In its ruling Jan. 4, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis denied Standard’s request for a rehearing.

Another class action case before the high court, Comcast Corp. et al. v. Caroline Behrend et al., involves the question of whether a trial court can certify class actions before it resolves whether plaintiff expert testimony is admissible.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held for Ms. Behrend and the class in the case.

As Dan Himmelfarb, a partner in the Washington office of Mayer Brown L.L.P., put it during a Supreme Court preview at the Washington Legal Foundation last month, the issue is an important one because the “certification stage is really where the action is” in class action cases.

A third class action case before the high court is Amgen Inc. et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds. At issue in Amgen, which is a securities case, is whether courts should reject certification for a securities class when the plaintiffs fail to adequately demonstrate that they relied on alleged misrepresentations when they purchased a stock.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of the retirement plan.

Foreign affairs and business converge in yet another case before the court, Esther Kiobel et al. v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. et al. At issue is whether the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 applies to conduct outside the United States.

%%BREAK%%

During the NCLC briefing, Andrew J. Pincus, a partner in Mayer Brown’s Washington office, said the plaintiffs in the case are taking a broad position that “U.S. courts are open for business” to provide a civil remedy for anyone who is injured anywhere in the world.

The case was brought on behalf of the widow of Barinem Kiobel, a Nigerian activist who was executed in 1995. The plaintiffs allege that Royal Dutch Shell bribed witnesses to give false testimony to a special tribunal that sentenced Mr. Kiobel and others to death.

Lower courts had rejected the plaintiffs’ position, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and held oral arguments in February. A few days later, the court said it was postponing its review until this term, and instructed lawyers on both sides to file new arguments as to whether the Alien Tort Statute allows U.S. courts to permit lawsuits for violations of international law that took place in foreign territory.

The court also will deal with an employment case — Mayetta Vance v. Ball State University et al. — that asks whether the supervisor liability rule under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applies to workplace harassment by people who oversee and direct a victim’s daily work or whether it is limited to those who have the power to hire, fire, demote or otherwise affect their victim.",https://www.businessinsurance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NEWS06_309309978_AR_-1_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 20:56:22.506019

Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza.
“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.","A day after conservative activist Laura Loomer, an advisor to President Trump, posted videos on social media of children from Gaza arriving in the U.S. for medical treatment and questioning how they got visas, the State Department said it was halting all visitor visas for people from Gaza pending a review.

The State Department said Saturday the visas would be stopped while it looks into how “a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas” were issued in recent days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday told “Face the Nation” on CBS that the action came after ”outreach from multiple congressional offices asking questions about it.”

Rubio said that there were “just a small number” of the visas issued to children in need of medical aid but that they were accompanied by adults. The congressional offices reached out with evidence that “some of the organizations bragging about and involved in acquiring these visas have strong links to terrorist groups like Hamas,” he asserted, without providing evidence or naming those organizations.

As a result, he said, “we are going to pause this program and reevaluate how those visas are being vetted and what relationship, if any, has there been by these organizations to the process of acquiring those visas.”

Loomer on Friday posted videos on X of children from Gaza arriving this month in San Francisco and Houston for medical treatment with the aid of an organization called Heal Palestine. “Despite the US saying we are not accepting Palestinian ‘refugees’ into the United States under the Trump administration,” these people from Gaza were able to travel to the U.S., she said.

She called it a “national security threat” and asked who signed off on the visas, calling for the person to be fired. She tagged Rubio, Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Trump has downplayed Loomer’s influence on his administration, but several officials swiftly left or were removed shortly after she publicly criticized them.

The State Department on Sunday declined to comment on how many of the visas had been granted and whether the decision to halt visas to people from Gaza had anything to do with Loomer’s posts.

Heal Palestine said in a statement Sunday that it was “distressed” by the State Department decision to stop halt visitor visas from Gaza. The group said it is “an American humanitarian nonprofit organization delivering urgent aid and medical care to children in Palestine.”

A post on the organization’s Facebook page Thursday shows a photo of a boy from the Gaza Strip leaving Egypt and headed to St. Louis for treatment and said he is “our 15th evacuated child arriving in the U.S. in the last two weeks.”

The organization brings “severely injured children” to the U.S. on temporary visas for treatment they can’t get at home, the statement said. After treatment, the children and any family members who accompanied them return to the Middle East, the statement said.

“This is a medical treatment program, not a refugee resettlement program,” it said.

The World Health Organization has repeatedly called for more medical evacuations from Gaza, where Israel’s 22-month war against Hamas has heavily destroyed or damaged much of the territory’s health system.

“More than 14,800 patients still need lifesaving medical care that is not available in Gaza,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday on social media, and called on more countries to offer support.

A WHO description of the medical evacuation process from Gaza published last year explained that the organization submits lists of patients to Israeli authorities for security clearance. It noted that before the war in Gaza began, 50 to 100 patients were leaving the territory daily for medical treatment, and it called for a higher rate of approvals from Israeli authorities.

The United Nations and partners say medicines and basic healthcare supplies are low in Gaza after Israel cut off all aid to the territory of over 2 million people for more than 10 weeks earlier this year.

Peace is the best medicine,” Tedros added Wednesday.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2e904d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4067x2135+0+288/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F86%2F1a5b6e6748fbab1b98d0b2d9f7c6%2F23e35d7da9da4c4fb0230be5ed32c882.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 17:56:57.442066

United States

WASHINGTON — With additional state National Guard troops deploying to D.C. as untrained federal law enforcement agents perform local police duties in city streets, the American Civil Liberties Union is issuing a stark reminder to all federal and military officials that — no matter what uniform they wear or what authority they claim — they are bound by the U.S. Constitution and all federal and local laws.

Over the weekend, the Trump administration declared that state National Guard troops would be called in to Washington, and the governors of West Virginia, Ohio, and South Carolina announced they are deploying hundreds of their National Guard troops to the nation's capital on top of the 800 D.C. National Guard troops who were already activated by President Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a major shift, these troops may receive orders “to start carrying weapons in the coming days.” National Guard troops are generally not trained in local policing or de-escalation and should never be used for federal immigration purposes.

President Trump has also ordered FBI personnel and other federal officers, who similarly are not trained for local policing, to patrol the city. He earlier promised to let police “do whatever the hell they want” — raising grave concerns about civil rights abuses, particularly for Black, Brown, and unhoused residents.

“Through his manufactured emergency, President Trump is engaging in dangerous political theater to expand his power and sow fear in our communities. Sending heavily armed federal agents and National Guard troops from hundreds of miles away into our nation’s capital is unnecessary, inflammatory, and puts people’s rights at high risk of being violated,” said Hina Shamsi, director of ACLU’s National Security Project. “Governors need to understand that with each order, the Trump administration increases legal and ethical jeopardy for state troops being deployed. No matter what uniform they wear, federal agents and military troops are bound by the Constitution, including our rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, due process, and safeguards against unlawful searches and seizures. If troops or federal agents violate our rights, they must be held accountable.”

On Friday, D.C. sued the administration to block its order asserting federal authority over the city’s police department, saying it violated the Home Rule Act. After a federal court hearing on Friday afternoon, Attorney General Bondi rescinded her most brazen order undermining D.C.’s home rule, thereby allowing the D.C. police commissioner to remain at her post over the D.C. police department.

“The deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops and more federal agents onto D.C. streets is a brazen abuse of power meant to intimidate and create fear in the nation’s capital. This is an unnecessary overstep to micromanage D.C. under a phony emergency, causing real harm to residents and visitors — all to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda.” said Monica Hopkins, executive director of ACLU of D.C. “The ACLU-D.C. will continue to monitor the use of D.C. police and federal law enforcement to ensure that the constitutional rights of our community are protected. We need the nation to join us in the fight for statehood so that D.C. residents are treated like those in every other state and have the same guardrails against federal overreach.”

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Martinez was arrested in connection with a prior DUI.

Newsweek reported Martinez, who is well-known on TikTok for posting videos that document several ICE arrests, was filmed on Friday seated in her Tesla when agents opened her car door and pulled her onto the pavement. She also appeared to experience a medical event during the arrest, and at one point onlookers are heard demanding treatment for her.

The arrest was also briefly interrupted by a man who attempted to tow one of the police cars in the arrest.

“He mocked and videotaped ICE officers chasing after him,” McLaughlin also told Newsweek. “Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who seeks to impede law enforcement will be found and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Martinez was initially transported to White Memorial Hospital and is currently being held in a detention center in downtown Los Angeles.

On Thursday, Los Angeles Rep. Jimmy Gomez accused ICE of staging an empty migrant detention center.

“One person was talking to the Mexican consulate who happened to be there, and the other person was just in the cell with their head down on a table or on the table or something. He was just kind of sitting there,” Gomez said of the center he visited recently.

Gomez also questioned why the center was so empty despite the numerous arrests made recently. Nearly 2,800 people have been taken into ICE custody since early June.

Several Oklahoma City priests report parishioners being detained and deported, some with long-term residency and U.S.-born children.

While acknowledging the right to secure borders, priests express concern over the impact of deportations on families and the targeting of those seeking legal status.

In early summer, as immigration raids were ramping up across the country, Bishop Albert Rojas of the Diocese of San Bernardino granted a dispensation excusing undocumented parishioners in the diocese from attending Mass. The unusual move came out of fear they might be detained by immigration agents if they were in a public gathering like church.

News of the dispensation quickly got back to Little Flower Catholic Church in Oklahoma City, where the Rev. Tim Luschen oversees a heavily Hispanic parish.

The Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley, archbishop of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, has not granted such a dispensation in the archdiocese, which includes parishes across two-thirds of Oklahoma. Luschen said he hasn't seen a noticeable increase in absences at his church. However, he did know that Rojas' action in the wake of the U.S. immigration Enforcement and Customs efforts in California was a topic of conversation at Little Flower, 1125 S. Walker Ave.

Not surprising, Luschen said, because ""people are living on edge.""

""They're afraid.""

Two of his counterparts whose parishes are on the opposite end of the Oklahoma City metro area, shared similar comments.

""I've noticed that the anxiety level among my parishioners has increased,"" said the Rev. Jim Goins, pastor of St. Eugene Catholic Church, who described his church as the most diverse in the archdiocese.

Though neither Goins, Luschen or the Rev. Stephen Hamilton are aware of large numbers of parishioners disappearing from the pews, all three said they have been talking with their parishioners about the boosted ICE efforts occurring across the country.

And, Luschen said he knows of four people from his historic parish in south Oklahoma City who have been detained, including a man who had been in the U.S. for 30 years and whose son is in the military.

Luschen said he also knew of several people who attended the Warr Acres church where he served as pastor who have been detained. The priest said one of them already has been deported to Honduras. Another man from the Warr Acres church was apprehended by ICE, taken from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, and then on to a private prison in Drumright. Luschen said the man had been in the U.S. for 20 years and has four children who were born in America.

""It hurts me,"" he said.

""All you can do is make sure that people know their rights.""

Facing uncertainty

With people from around the world attending Mass, including people from Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Africa, ""it's like the United Nations here"" at St. Eugene, 2400 W. Hefner Road, Goins said. The church has two Spanish Masses and three English Masses each weekend, plus a Swahili Mass once a month, he proudly pointed out.

So, instead of tiptoeing around the subject, Goins said he spoke about the ramped-up immigration enforcement at one of the church's recent Spanish Masses.

""We just talked about how they might feel more vulnerable,"" he said. ""Many of them are unclear about their rights.""

Goins said St. Eugene has a large number of Hispanic parishioners who are in the U.S. legally. However, some of them worry about family members and friends who are undocumented.

""It's causing a lot of stress, particularly for 'mixed-status households,'"" he said.

The priest said he talked about self deportation — but, whether or not they are picked up by ICE or self deport, there is the agony of wondering what happens to their U.S.-born children who are legal citizens.

""They had to make that terrible choice ― it's heartbreaking,"" Goins said. ""I have had many people worry about their children ― 'Will I see them at the end of the day?'""

Both Luschen and Goins said they understand legalities of the situation, but Americans were initially told that the federal government would be concentrating immigration enforcement efforts on getting the most hardened criminals off the streets.

""If you have a criminal record, yes, I want you removed, but the vast majority (of immigrants) are very law abiding,"" Goins said.

He said apprehending and deporting those who have been stuck in the immigration system trying to take the legal route seems ""punitive.""

""In my mind, it's overzealous,"" he said.

""Most of our people have tried and are trying, and most of them have a valid case. There's really no path for them ― it just stretches for years. It's crazy.""

Luschen, at Little Flower, said he's also been told about the choices some parishioners are making, choices Goins described as heartbreaking. He said some people have told him of their plans to self deport, although their children will remain in America.

""The kids are going to stay here,"" he said.

Then, there are the concerns about people being deported to countries that they have never been to.

""No matter what president it is, it doesn't seem to be humane,"" Luschen said. ""This is a new level and new struggles that are really challenging.""

'Complicated and complex'

Hamilton, pastor of St. Monica Catholic Church in Edmond, said attendance at his parish's Spanish Mass has increased from about 225 people when he was first appointed to lead the parish in June of 2012, to between 475 and 550 each weekend now.

The priest said he's proud of the work his parish has done to minister to the Hispanic community, which is a significant part of the universal church.

Thus, he's been well aware of the fear that some parishioners are feeling as ICE's efforts continue.

""I've picked up conversations with people in my own parish and in the larger community that people are scared and unsettled and uncertain,"" he said.

Hamilton said he didn't know of anyone who had been deported and he couldn't say for certain that Mass attendance has dwindled because attendance may decrease in the summer months. The priest said he's not certain who is documented and who is undocumented, but their status is not his first concern.

""Frankly, the church's concern first and foremost, basically, is just human dignity and as a church is to preach the gospel and to proclaim the kingdom of God,"" he said.

The clergy leader said the issues surrounding immigration, border enforcement and deportation are complicated and complex. That's why he thinks people sometimes misunderstand the Catholic Church's position.

""I think it's fair to say that the church supports the country having sovereign borders and that the country does have a right to protect its borders,"" he said.

Having said that, Hamilton said some immigrants have come to the U.S. under policies by previous administrations and the country has a moral responsibility to those people who came under those past conditions.

""We can support border enforcement,"" he said.

""We can support, I think, the arrest and removal of people, who in addition to being here illegally, have committed other criminal acts, but I would say indiscriminate deportation is really not as easily supported by our Catholic social teaching.""","https://www.oklahoman.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/30/NOKL/85442770007-rev-jim-goins-03.JPG?crop=3098,1744,x0,y298&width=3098&height=1744&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-17 13:56:42.912866

The Metropolitan Police Department said Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in D.C. for an internship, was shot June 30 around 10:28 p.m. and died at a hospital July 1. At the time, Tarpinian-Jachym was an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.

Several people were seen exiting a car before opening fire, with one of the shots wounding Tarpinian-Jachym. Police said Tarpinian-Jachym wasn't the intended target, adding an adult female and 16-year-old male were injured. The shooting happened in the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest, near the Mt Vernon Sq 7th St-Convention Center Metro stop.

Tarpinian-Jachym's mother, Tamara Jachym, told Fox News Digital the Trump administration is taking more steps than the D.C. Council to fix the youth crime wave plaguing the nation's capital.

After the fatal shooting, Trump sent a letter to Jachym, saying he and Melania Trump were ""heartbroken for your entire family.""

Please know that my Administration will not stop fighting to clean up our streets and ensure law and order. May God hold Eric in His eternal love and care and provide you and your other incredible children, Angela and Jeremy, with abiding peace and unending strength.""

Jachym said ""of course"" the Trump administration is taking her son's death more seriously than the D.C. Council.

""Or [the D.C. Council] would change the laws so 12- to 17-year-olds are booked and charged for crimes and get jail time or juvenile detention,"" Jachym said. ""I am not saying for stealing a pair of shoes, but for serious crimes.

""I believe that something needs to be done because the council is allowing these people to engage in serious crime in D.C., and it's getting worse, not better,"" she added. ""It's serious. And you know if they can't see that this is a serious problem, then we have a serious problem.""

The D.C. Council did not respond to a request for comment.

NBC Washington reported that the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has risen every year since 2000, with over 2,000 minors arrested in 2023 and 2024.

In 2024, juveniles made up 51.8% of robbery arrests, according to police, adding that almost 60% of those arrested for carjacking in 2025 are also juveniles.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith said the uptick in juvenile crime was one reason she helped establish a Juvenile Investigative Response Unit within the agency.

""Recently, we have seen an increase in fights in our schools and more serious criminal offenses outside of our schools,"" Smith said in April. ""And we have seen an increase in juvenile suspects involved in criminal offenses district-wide.""

Jachym said the D.C. City Council needs to go a step further and ensure minors are held accountable for any criminal behavior because, right now, she feels it's a ""crime utopia.""

""I mean, if you're old enough to walk around with a gun and pull a trigger, you're old enough for the consequences,"" Jachym said. ""And these things that the council have in place are not working. Then what's the alternative? Have more people killed, raped, robbed, carjacked? It's just, you know, it's really scary.""

More recently, two juveniles were arrested after allegedly assaulting a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee in Washington, D.C.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has begun detaining people at Fort Bliss as part of its mass deportation campaign. The military base – which has land across El Paso, Texas, and Doña Ana and Otero Counties in New Mexico – will detain up to 5,000 people, making it the country’s largest immigrant detention site. The administration also plans to use at least two more bases to detain and deport people who are immigrants.

The detention camp’s opening is the latest escalation in President Trump’s dystopian agenda to detain and deport millions of immigrants from communities nationwide. The Fort Bliss detention camp, similar to the hastily built detention camp in the Florida Everglades, is a tent facility that will leave detained individuals vulnerable to extreme heat and other harsh conditions. Media reports suggest that the administration is poised to spend $1.26 billion to build the camp. Last month, Congress passed a budget reconciliation bill which will funnel $170 billion to turbocharge deportations and detention.

This expansion marks another shameful chapter in Fort Bliss’ history, as the facility was used to intern German and Italian immigrants and people of Japanese descent during World War II, and later used to detain unaccompanied children in 2016 and from 2021 to 2023, where some were subjected to severe abuse.

The renewed use of this base to detain immigrants and stage deportations comes as the Trump administration continues to misuse military resources to deport long-standing residents and other immigrants and plans to deploy troops to other ICE detention sites around the nation, including at military bases.

Sarah Mehta, deputy director of government affairs, Equality division at the American Civil Liberties Union, issued the following statement in response:

“President Trump’s use of Fort Bliss for the nation’s largest immigrant detention site is cruel and a reminder of a shameful detention legacy. Thousands of people, including our neighbors and loved ones, will be torn from their communities while this administration enlists the military to rubberstamp its abusive agenda.

“Members of Congress must stop the use of the military – including its bases – for the Trump administration’s reckless and wasteful deportation drive.”

For information about how The Observer protects your data, read our Privacy Policy.

The impact on free speech is evident even as I write this piece. I’m given less latitude to counter the home secretary’s claims than she is afforded to advance them. Her decision to proscribe gives her a higher degree of control of the narrative, as many papers will be reluctant, for legal reasons, to publish a piece that may make the readers sympathetic to Palestine Action’s aims. So all I am allowed to say on that is contained within my first witness statement. But I must do at least this. It is important that readers understand our case.

As I explained to the court, Palestine Action “take direct action against Israel’s arms trade in Britain”. We “put our bodies in the way of a military machine perpetrating genocide”. In my view the campaign has been effective, so I believe weapons firms and the Israeli embassy lobbied hard for ministers and police to crack down on Palestine Action.

However, proscribing a domestic direct action group has sparked outrage. So far, more than 700 people have been arrested under the Terrorism Act for holding signs, while opposition to the ban is growing across the political spectrum. To save face, it seems to me the government has resorted to a smear campaign. Rather than solely litigating the case in the courts, they’re also trying to litigate it in the media, where hard facts are swapped for soundbites.

Their newest claim refers to supposed evidence of “disturbing” plans and ideas. Yvette Cooper failed to reference any such evidence in court ahead of the “permission hearing” to challenge the ban, instead launching the claims on TV. These allegations are not supported by the security assessments disclosed by her own department, and don’t match the facts.

The assessment to proscribe Palestine Action was made in March 2025, but it seems Cooper delayed proscription until the most politically convenient moment. If there were “disturbing plans” and serious concerns of national security, why wait four months?

Even Keir Starmer weighed in, making reference to “Jewish-owned” businesses. The intention seemed to be to imply that Palestine Action was antisemitic. In reality, it targeted dozens of companies associated with Israel’s biggest weapons producer, regardless of the identities of the owners. This fact is known by the government, yet they continue to weaponise antisemitism.

I believe the idea behind the government’s statements is to deliberately mislead the public and parliament. The group was banned due to “serious property damage for a political cause”, not because of racism or alleged violence against people. It is false to claim the organisation had violent intent against people. The home secretary’s own security assessments say the direct action group didn’t advocate violence or pose a threat to life.

Cooper’s attempt to justify her decision by misleading the public shows only what a huge political misstep she has made. Her political career will be marked by the most draconian attack on our civil liberties in a generation.

Tom Kisken covers health care and other news for the Ventura County Star.","Patient visits at some sites have fallen.

A petition calls for ICE-free zones.

At-risk people worry any excursions bring risks.

The 9-year-old boy needed medical care.

His mother, an undocumented farmworker who lives in west Ventura County, was too scared to take him to an Oxnard clinic. She worried any excursion outside of her home could mean being detained, deported and separated from her son and his two siblings.

She canceled an appointment for what she described as a “highly important” medical procedure, then canceled a second date for the same treatment.

“I’m afraid they’re going to get me,” she said through an interpreter in a phone interview, declining to give her name. “I’m afraid with everything.”

Advocates with 805 UndocuFund contend more than 400 people in Ventura County have been detained by immigration police so far this year, though U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have provided few numbers.

As enforcement anxieties percolate, driven by actions like the July 10 raid at Glass House Farms near Camarillo, doctors and advocates worry many undocumented people are choosing to stay away from emergency rooms, urgent care centers and medical clinics.

And if they do come, they worry ICE will somehow find them.

“I’ve had two patients in the ER tell me that,” said Dr. Tipu Khan, an addiction medicine specialist at Ventura County Medical Center, the Ventura hospital that serves as a safety net for people with little money, no insurance and other barriers. Delays in care mean patients will become sicker and could ultimately need more treatment.

“This is the only access to care that they may have. They are very medically fragile,” Khan said.

It’s hard to quantify the extent to which fear is keeping people from seeking care in emergency rooms, urgent care centers or clinics.

At the countywide Clinicas del Camino Real health system that also delivers care to underserved populations, visits were once projected to rise by more than 10% in August. Instead, they’re down about 4% over last year largely because of fears of detention and deportation, said CEO Dr. Gagan Pawar.

A surge of enforcement actions across the county in June contributed to cancellations and no-shows too with about 1,800 less visits than June 2024. The system is encouraging people who are afraid to come to clinics to use telehealth options.

“Health care, education and food are not privileges, they are human rights. Those are at stake right now,” Pawar said, contending the fear is affecting medical facilities across the regions. “It’s everywhere. It’s not just us.”

At Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, visits to the emergency room fell about 9% in June compared to 2024 — 330 visits ― and fell a little more in July, said Dr. John Fankhauser, the hospital's CEO. Numbers regularly fluctuate from month to month.

""It's not atypical,"" he said, noting it's too early to attribute the numbers to fear or any specific cause. He emphasized the hospital's mission is to treat everyone who needs care.

""For us as a hospital, it’s so important to message that we’re here for people,"" he said. ""We’re truly committed to providing care to all comers.""

ER visits for June and July were still slightly higher than 2023 levels, Fankhauser said. Usage for the calendar year so far is higher than last year, partly because of a surge of respiratory and other illnesses in January that packed hospitals across the county.

And while doctors say visits to some countywide clinics fell in the wake of the Glass House raids on July 10, officials said patient interactions in June and July were “comparable” to last year’s levels. The ambulatory care system saw about 31,000 patient visits in June, about 2,000 less than a year earlier, said spokesperson Lydia Collins.

Emergency room visits at Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks are also down but the decline appears linked to seasonal trends and not to immigration anxiety, said spokesperson Megan Merino.

Officials at St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard did not respond to questions about the impact of immigration enforcement fears. Dr. Neil Canby, an emergency medicine doctor at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, said ER numbers were actually a little higher than normal in July. Ambulance calls across the county haven't changed significantly, said Steve Carroll, administrator for Ventura County Emergency Medical Services.

'Long-lasting consequences'

Some health care professionals are reluctant to talk publicly about the impact of immigration enforcement on patient visits. But a petition being circulated by doctors and employees in the county health system contends increased immigration enforcement has brought widespread fear.

“We have seen patients cancel appointments, forgo preventive care, and avoid seeking medical attention altogether—out of fear that accessing healthcare could lead to detention or deportation,” the petition reads. “These disruptions to daily life will have long-lasting consequences on both physical and mental health.

The petition calls on county leaders to declare county hospitals, clinics and their parking lots ICE-free zones where immigration enforcement is not allowed without a judicial warrant. The document also calls for posting signs that tell visitors immigration status is never asked about or shared.

“Our goal is a (medical) center without drama,” said Dr. Carlos O’Bryan-Becerra, the family practice physician who initiated the petition. “We want a safe space to focus on healing.”

Collins, Health Care Agency spokeswoman, said the agency has no comment on the petition.

On the day of the Glass House raids on July 10, people injured in protests outside the farms were taken to St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. The patients included a person who had been apprehended by ICE during the protests. Immigration agents came to the hospital to take the person into custody, triggering a large protest outside the hospital.

Khan of VCMC said the incident and reports of immigration enforcement visits to medical facilities or their parking lots elsewhere in California have created more concern among vulnerable patients. The petition circulated at VCMC calls for more training on what to do if ICE agents come to a medical campus.

Fankhauser said he hasn’t heard of any ICE activity at VCMC. Pawar said Clinicas facilities have also not been visited by ICE.

“We are prepared. We have protocol,” Pawar said, noting that warrants will be required from immigration agents.

Judicial warrants are required for immigration authorities to access private areas of hospitals and medical facilities, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

""In general health centers must allow ICE agents in any area where they would allow general members of the public,"" the ACLU said in a factsheet.

Protecting privacy

Hospital officials across the county emphasized they don’t ask people about immigration status and offer care to everyone who comes to their emergency room.

“We remain committed to safeguarding patient privacy, safety and dignity, no matter the patient’s legal status or situation,” Merino said. “We provide care to all patients who come to our facility in accordance with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), while protecting their confidentiality under the HIPAA privacy rule.”

Advocates still worry. Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of 805 UndocuFund, said she’s been told by clinic leaders in Ventura that more people who have made appointments for care simply don’t show up. She worries too about low-income people who bypass government health insurance because of reports that the federal government disclosed personal Medicaid information with ICE.

“It’s difficult to say if any place is safe at this point the way federal immingration enforcement is being carried out,” Hernandez said. “We take it day by day.”

Ryan Drury works with health care professionals who have joined the VC Defensa organization that monitors immigration enforcement and advocates for undocumented people. He said some people injured in the Glass House raids didn’t seek medical care because of fear they would be detained.

Martita Martinez-Bravo, executive director of Friends of Fieldworkers, worries about farmworkers and others who can’t sleep because of nightmares or have other mental health trauma but are afraid to reach out for treatment. She noted many people are afraid to send their kids to school or to leave home for any reason.

“People are not even going to the grocery store,” she said. “People are afraid to go to the laundromat.”

Doctors said people who don’t seek care will get sicker. They worry about people who bypass vaccinations at a time when measles risks are rising. Some said safety net systems designed to serve all comers now face a barrier in the form of immigration enforcement fear.

“We’re feeling a little bit helpless,” O’Bryan-Becerra said.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District’s police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation’s capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump’s takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city’s law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general’s new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi’s earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump’s mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district’s sanctuary city laws.

In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.”

She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don’t have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president’s administration. Trump’s takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week.

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city’s immigration and policing policies, the district’s right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

A push for compromise

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district’s lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn’t grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can’t control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city’s homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation’s capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city’s police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he’d seek to extend it.

Chief had agreed to share immigration information

Bondi’s Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief’s instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they’re still parsing the legal aspects of the policies.

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation’s capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they’ve seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

Residents are seeing a significant show of force

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world’s most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Friday night along the district’s U Street, a popular nightlife corridor, an Associated Press photographer saw officers from the FBI, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

Families in the neighborhood near the school said the man was sitting in a red car, waiting to pick up his kid from the school. In the video, three ICE agents are seen approaching him.

""They would have needed a federal judicial warrant to enter our campus, so we are quite aware that they weren't on campus or on our property,"" Petterson said. ""What we said is that the father was clearly there for pickup for his student.

Prof. Bheki Mngomezulu

The issue of undocumented migrants in South Africa has caused a stir across various sectors. While some call for their immediate deportation because they deplete the country’s resources at the expense of the nationals, others – including some NGOs – plead on their behalf. They even invoke certain clauses of the Freedom Charter and sections of the country’s constitution to strengthen their argument on why these undocumented migrants should be allowed to stay in this country.

The main question that begs for attention is: where does one draw the line between addressing the challenge of undocumented migrants and upholding human rights? Another question becomes: should the rights of these undocumented migrants supersede those of South African citizens? These are very critical questions. To answer them properly, one must cogently interpret both the Freedom Charter and the Constitution.

Clause five of the Freedom Charter states that ‘all shall be equal before the law.’ Clause 6 states that ‘all shall enjoy equal human rights.’

The reality is that when the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown, Soweto, on June 26, 1955, it did not envision a South Africa that people from outside the country would populate. In that sense, the “all” in both clauses did not refer to foreign nationals. Therefore, if these undocumented migrants were to be allowed to live in South Africa, it would be for other reasons, not because of the Freedom Charter.

Some cite different sections of the Constitution to make a case for these undocumented migrants, especially Chapter 2 on the Bill of Rights. Sec 25 states that “everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing.” Section 27 states that everyone has the right to basic education.

While these sections are relevant to the debate, it is Section 27 that has triggered a serious debate. Sub-section 1(a) states that “everyone has the right to have access to health care services, including reproductive healthcare.”

Some South Africans complain that they are unable to access health care services because they compete with undocumented migrants. It was for this reason that members of Operation Dudula were arrested for checking patients’ identity documents to ascertain if they were South Africans. Others criticise these undocumented migrants for taking their jobs. Whether this is true or not varies from one case to another.

This debate leads us to a broader discussion that we must focus on. In this regard, there are five questions to ruminate about.

Firstly, what role has our government played in creating this situation? For example, had they protected the country’s borders like other countries do, would this problem have arisen?

Secondly, to what extent are the home governments of these undocumented migrants to blame for many of the challenges South Africa is wrestling with? In other words, had these governments ensured political and economic stability in their countries, would these undocumented migrants have come to South Africa?

Thirdly, what role do NGOs play in sustaining this challenge? Do they assist the government on how to address the challenge, or do they use the desperation of these undocumented migrants to make themselves relevant and score cheap points?

Fourthly, how does the international community contribute to the sustenance of this challenge about undocumented migrants? Do they share their experiences with the South African government, or do they use these migrants for political expediency?

Fifthly, what is the way out of this dilemma? In other words, should South Africa simply learn to live with this challenge, or should a solution be found? If the latter is the case, how should the process unfold, and who should be the role-players?

On the first question, our government is to blame for the current situation. The country’s borders are porous. Corruption has become ‘normal’. Some argue that they were in exile in the countries where the undocumented migrants come from. While this statement is factually correct, it is analytically flawed. They lived in camps, were known to the authorities, respected the laws of those countries, and many of them did not compete for jobs with the citizens of their host countries.

On the second question, the home governments of these undocumented migrants are to blame. They created economic and political conditions not conducive to their citizens. As such, some had to find their way out to look for greener pastures in South Africa.

Regarding the third question, NGOs are not a homogeneous group. Some are doing a good job in filling the gaps where the government has failed. Others advance the interests of foreign governments that want to see South Africa fail. They do so under the guise of helping the needy. They take the side of undocumented migrants to paint the country in a bad light.

The fourth question is related to the third one. Some foreign governments are vocal whenever South Africa acts against undocumented migrants. Ironically, they are very tough in their own countries. In that sense, the fate of these undocumented migrants is used to tarnish South Africa’s global image while scoring cheap political points.

The fifth question is the most important. The South African government should demonstrate leadership. This includes teaching South Africans the correct interpretation of the Freedom Charter and the Constitution. Where the constitution has loopholes, these should be filled through constitutional amendments.

The government does not have all the solutions. Instead of claiming the ‘omniscient narrator’ status, politicians should solicit the views of other South Africans – including academics who conduct research and draw lessons from other countries through comparative analyses. Some ordinary South Africans could also proffer ideas on how this situation could be addressed.

Instead of labelling concerns about undocumented migrants as ‘xenophobia’ or ‘Afrophobia’, it is important to approach this issue objectively. Documented migrants and asylum seekers are not the problem. They can be accounted for. They officially contribute to the country’s economy. However, this is not the case with undocumented migrants.

South Africa’s laws should not be used for political expediency!

The Linda Vista ICE arrest was the second at a San Diego-area elementary school in eight days.
On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.","A federal official on Saturday said a man arrested by ICE two days ago had allegedly been using an unauthorized social security number.

The public learned of the arrest outside Linda Vista Elementary School when San Diego schools superintendent Fabiola Bagula held a news conference Friday to reassure the community about the off-campus arrest.

In a emailed statement from the San Diego field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security described the man as an undocumented immigrant who “was fraudulently using an American’s social security number.”

Officers approached him “after he pulled over in a parking lot” on Thursday. ICE arrested him and placed him in removal proceedings, she said.

Other elements of McLaughlin’s statement run counter to those made by Bagula at her news conference.

ICE’s statement opens with the line “allegations that ICE targeted Linda Vista Elementary School are FALSE. ICE was NEVER on school grounds.’

Bagula didn’t say ICE officers were on campus. She specifically explained that the arrest “didn’t happen on school grounds, but it happened close enough to our community to feel its impact.”

That means, the superintendent said, that it “happened to an entire school community.” She also called out ICE officers for their use of masks.

McLaughlin’s statement concluded with this: “Any smears that ICE targeted an elementary school are contributing to the 1000% increase in assaults against our brave ICE law enforcement.”

Those numbers remain in dispute – yet the estimates are rapidly increasing. In June, federal officials said that there has been a 500% increase in alleged assaults of ICE officers since the beginning of the year, according to Rolling Stone. In that report, however, Homeland Security did not release actual assault numbers.

By July, federal agencies on up to the White House – the Trump administration blamed Democrats – were citing a 700% percent rise in alleged assaults on ICE.

Immigration arrests have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump took office in January. The administration often repeats that it is going after the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders, but in a new report, the Marshall Project, which covers criminal justice, found that of those immigrants deported between January and May, just around 12% had been convicted of a crime that was” “either violent or potentially violent.”

To date, ICE has targeted workplaces and public spaces where undocumented workers are thought to gather. The area around schools could be a new front for immigration officers.

The Linda Vista ICE arrest was the second at a San Diego-area elementary school in eight days. On Aug. 6, a woman was taken into custody outside Enrique S. Camarena Elementary School in Chula Vista.

ICE said in a statement that she was arrested after being ordered to be deported in absentia by an immigration judge in 2022.

That statement also noted simply, without accusations of smears or assault allegations, that the situation outside Camarena Elementary was “resolved promptly, safely and not on the school grounds.”",https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1678.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:00:09.166731

The 52-year-old Peruvian asylum-seeker held a valid work permit, paid his taxes, maintained health insurance and had no criminal record. That wasn’t good enough for the Trump administration.

During a routine check-in at an immigration office in July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Vega and now threaten to deport him. Vega is another victim of a broken immigration and asylum system that needs common sense reform.

ICE is reportedly holding Vega in a detention center in Arizona. He is hundreds of miles from his fiancee, his friends and his support network.

If someone who did everything by the book can be arrested and deported, it sends a chilling message to the entire immigrant community. Even those who committed no crime live in fear that masked federal agents could throw them into a van and drive them away at any time.

This harsh enforcement strategy is disruptive not just for families but also for businesses in the North Bay and beyond. The agricultural, hospitality and construction industries rely on immigrant workforces. They now struggle to find workers, and the entire regional economy suffers. In some cases, farmers have left food to rot in fields.

During his presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump talked about targeting immigrants with criminal records. If his administration had done so, he might have broad public support. Instead, 71% of detainees have no criminal record. ICE is sweeping up the sorts of immigrants that most Americans want to keep: longtime residents with jobs, families and community ties. Vega is one of them.

The nation needs comprehensive immigration reform that secures the border and reforms asylum processing but also opens more pathways to legal entry and creates options for permanent legal status.

In 2024, a bipartisan Senate package proposed the most significant immigration reforms in three decades. It combined enhanced border security with updated asylum processing. Republican leaders in Congress supported the changes, some of which could have affected Vega’s case.

Trump opposed those reforms, not because they were bad policy but because he didn’t want the issue taken off the table during the campaign. To their great shame, congressional Republicans obeyed.

The recently introduced Dignity Act (H.R. 4393), which has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, offers them a second chance. It would provide a path to permanent legal status — although not citizenship — for many undocumented immigrants who arrived prior to 2021, something many Democrats support.

The legislation also would overhaul the asylum system, mandate national E-Verify by employers and create new criminal penalties for some immigration violations, all things that Republicans support. Critically, fees paid by participants would fund it all, not taxpayers.

The Dignity Act might not be the comprehensive compromise that the nation needs, but it would take huge steps to address an immigration crisis that entangles people like Vega. With Trump now in the White House and ever eager to take credit for a successful bill, maybe it has a chance of moving the United States closer to overdue immigration reform.

The anchor rally for the nationwide “Fight the Trump Takeover” protests was held in Austin, Texas, where Republicans in the state are poised to become the first in the nation to redraw their maps at the president’s behest.

Progressives in the Lone Star State capital rallied against Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for breaking with historical precedent by carrying out congressional redistricting in the middle of the decade. Independent experts have estimated that the Texas gerrymandering alone could yield the GOP five additional seats in the US House of Representatives.

Speaking before a boisterous crowd of thousands of people, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) charged that the Texas GOP was drawing up “districts set up to elect a Trump minion” in next year’s midterms. However, Doggett also said that progressives should still try to compete in these districts, whose residents voted for Trump in the 2024 election but who also have histories of supporting Democratic candidates.

“Next year, [Trump is] not going to be on the ballot to draw the MAGA vote,” said Doggett. “Is there anyone here who believes that we ought to abandon any of these redrawn districts and surrender them to Trump?”

Leonard Aguilar, the secretary-treasurer of Texas AFL-CIO, attacked Abbott for doing the president’s bidding even as people in central Texas are still struggling in the aftermath of the deadly floods last month that killed at least 136 people.

“It’s time for Gov. Abbott to cut the bullshit,” he said. “We need help now but he’s working at the behest of the president, on behalf of Trump … He’s letting Trump take over Texas!”

Aguilar also speculated that Trump is fixated on having Texas redraw its maps because he “knows he’s in trouble and he wants to change the rules midstream.”

Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) went through a litany of grievances against Trump and the Republican Party, ranging from the Texas redistricting plan, to hardline immigration policies, to the massive GOP budget package passed last month that is projected to kick 17 million Americans off of Medicaid.

However, Casar also said that he felt hope watching how people in Austin were fighting back against Trump and his policies.

“I’m proud that our city is fighting,” he said. “I’m proud of the grit that we have even when the odds are stacked against us. The only answer to oligarchy is organization.”

What they're saying:

The San Bernardino Police Department responded to a call of a shooting near Acacia Avenue and Baseline Street a little after 8:45 a.m. on Saturday, August 16. Upon arrival, federal agents tied to ICE told San Bernardino PD that an officer-involved shooting broke out and the man they were looking for had drove off from the scene.

A little after the police spoke with the federal agents, the driver wanted by ICE had called 9-1-1 saying a group of masked men tried to get him to pull over, broke his car window and shot at him.

The driver told 9-1-1 he did not know who they were and was looking to get help from the police. An organization called Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice shared a video believed to be of the San Bernardino incident on social media. The video showed a driver and at least two passengers refusing to get out of a car and a CBP agent smashing the car's window, prompting the driver to take off from the scene.

As local police in San Bernardino heard both sides of the incident – federal agents and the driver wanted by ICE – SBPD officers found the car tied to the driver in the 1000 block of Mt. View Drive.

At the time of the car being found, SBPD got a hold of the driver, but left the scene without an arrest because it was not formally known what the driver was wanted for.

Around 1:15 p.m., federal officials called SBPD asking for help in addressing a large crowd. SBPD was told that federal agents tied to ICE had tried to arrest the driver for alleged assault on a federal officer. In a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, the driver was accused of hitting two Border Patrol officers with his car.

The Department of Homeland Security added in the same statement that the driver was briefly taken into custody before letting him go.

San Bernardino Police Department said it responded to that scene for crowd control purposes, not necessarily to go out and arrest the man for immigration reasons.

Below is a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security:

""During a targeted enforcement operation in San Bernardino, CBP officers were injured during a vehicle stop when a subject refused to exit his vehicle and tried to run them down.

In the course of the incident the suspect drove his car at the officers and struck two CBP officers with his vehicle. Because of the subjects forcing a CBP officer to discharge his firearm in self-defense. The subject escaped the scene.

After the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department located the subject at a residence and briefly had him in custody, he was set free. This decision was made despite the subject refusing to comply and wounding two officers — another terrible example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies in action that shield criminals instead of protecting communities.""

What we don't know:

The cause of the shooting remains under investigation.

Officials have not released the identity of the driver wanted for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. As of 8 p.m. Saturday, no videos were released by federal officials showing the driver allegedly running CBP officers over.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2025/08/1280/720/generic-web-main-3-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-08-17 07:56:28.275917

The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.","SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- As the Trump administration looks to increase the number of deportations of undocumented immigrants, a new battle has opened inside the nation's immigration courts.

Immigration judges and lawyers are being targeted for following established procedures.

""I think there is a valid fear among the immigration community of attorneys and legal service providers that we are putting ourselves at risk, putting our careers at risk, our license at risk if we're too vocal about the work that we do,"" said Millie Atkinson of the San Francisco Bar Association's Immigrant Legal Defense Program.

The fear intensified in March when President Donald Trump issued an executive order that accused immigration lawyers of coaching their clients to lie in asylum petitions.

The president then directed the U.S. Attorney General to identify misconduct ""such as filing frivolous litigation or engaging in fraudulent practices"" and sanction attorneys who ""violate professional conduct rules.""

""The language in that executive order was very threatening, that by helping someone apply for asylum we're violating our ethical rules as attorneys and that we will be investigated and could be charged and lose our licenses if we continue to help people seeking asylum,"" said former immigration judge Ilyce Shugall.

Shugall was an immigration judge between 2017 to 2019. She resigned after then Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented case quotas during the first Trump administration.

""The executive order is written in such a way that it suggests that even attorneys who are acting as zealous advocates to help individuals pursue relief and are presenting truthful claims may be targeted for their zealous advocacy,"" said Shugall, who is now the managing attorney at Immigrant Legal Defense.

She expressed concern about the large number of people being arrested in immigration courts since Trump began his second term.

Shugall said many of those being targeted were allowed to enter the country under humanitarian parole when large caravans of migrants were flooding the border with Mexico during the last two years of Biden's presidency. These migrants were then able to asylum. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates 2.8 million immigrants were granted humanitarian parole.

Trump ended that program in January, exposing these migrants to deportation if Department of Homeland Security lawyers can convince immigration judges to close their cases.

""DHS is moving to dismiss the removal proceedings so that DHS can pursue something called expedited removal,"" Shugall said..

Immigrants put into expedited removal can still present an asylum claim with the Department of Homeland Security, but it has to be done while they are in detention, where they don't have the same protections they have in immigration court. If DHS denies their claim they can be deported immediately.

""Representation matters in terms of individuals being granted relief. So by putting them into detention, it reduces the likelihood of representation and reduces the likelihood of being granted relief,"" Shugall said.

There's been an ongoing purge of immigration judges since Trump took office.

On Inauguration Day, the Justice Department fired the acting head of the immigration court system and three top officials. Since then, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired.

Many were hired in the past two years and were still in their probationary period, but others -- like Jennifer Peyton, who oversaw Chicago's immigration court as assistant chief judge -- were also fired with no reason given. She got a three sentence email from Sirce Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), that simply stated ""your removal is effective today.""

EOIR, which oversees the nation's immigration courts, has declined to comment on the firings.

Immigration judges are different than criminal court judges. They are not appointed or elected. They're civil servants and can be fired like other federal employees. In San Francisco, four judges have been fired in the past three months.

A review of Tracreports, a website run by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, shows several of those fired were approving more than 90% of asylum cases. For comparison, just 4% of asylum seekers are being approved at Adelanto ICE Detention Center in San Bernardino County. Immigration judges have gotten policy memos pressuring them to reject more asylum cases.

""They can't flat out say if you don't do this, you will get fired. But it kind of puts pressure on the judges, knowing if they don't follow the advice in that memo, they might be putting themselves at risk for being fired or being targeted or being reassigned,"" Atkinson said.

As a result of the firing, immigration courts are now down to 600 immigration judges out of the 800 authorized by EOIR. It's expected the judges that will be hired will be more focused on the Trump administration's goals.

The rise in detentions at the country's immigration courts has mobilized immigration advocates to camp out in front of San Francisco's immigration courthouse to keep an eye out for ICE agents.

""We're doing protective presence at the immigration court. The idea is that if enough people are here, ICE won't bother abducting people out of the communities,"" said one demonstrator who did not want to be identified.

The activists hand out informational leaflets and offer to accompany immigrants to their appointments. Others are regularly going inside immigration courtrooms to watch over the proceedings and recording people's names and relevant information in case they get detained.

""Immigration courts are open to the public, and it's very important that we have observers there to make sure that due process is being followed and that the immigrants are aware of their rights,"" said Eric Leenson, who co-founded the Friends of La Peña Immigrant Rights Committee.

He said he has seen teenagers without a lawyer attend hearings and forced to make decisions about their asylum case.

Leenson said court watchers are also attending hearings in case ICE agents try to detain someone.

""We like to have more people there in case someone needs to go outside the room to accompany an immigrant out, and then we like to have more people there in case there is an incident in which someone does feel intimidated,"" Leenson said.

Detentions in the hallways of immigration court have become contentious.

In June, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was arrested while trying to hold onto a person being detained by immigration agents.

Despite the risk, more than 100 people turned out recently for a court observer training at La Peña in Berkeley.

""It's important to kind of follow people's whereabouts, because once they're picked up, they get lost in the system. And if we know who they were and what time they were picked, it's much easier subsequently to follow them within the system to look out for their rights,"" Leenson said.

Court observers noted that since the courthouse arrests began there's been an increase in the number of immigrants who are too afraid to show up for a hearing.

""There are a lot of no shows now. People are really scared,"" said one observer.

Immigrants who don't show up for an appointment could have their case dismissed, making them immediately deportable.

""If you don't show up, you basically abandon any claim that you have to stay in the United States legally,"" Atkinson said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17504097_AP_IMMIGRATIONCOURT.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-17 01:56:57.507222

Efforts are underway to try to get the family out of ICE custody.

Mom and daughter sent to Texas detention center, son to N.J.

Mariposa Benitez, a founder of the grassroots organization Mi Tlalli, says on Tuesday, ICE agents detained a woman named Martha, her daughter Dayra and her 19-year-old son Manuel at 26 Federal Plaza.

""They came together as a family escaping the violence that they have experienced in Ecuador,"" Benitez said.

Manuel just graduated from high school in June, and Dayra is believed to be the youngest student detained by ICE in New York City. She is at least the fourth city public school student to be detained by ICE this year.

Benitez says Martha and Dayra are now at an ICE detention center in Dilley, Texas, and Manuel was transferred to the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey.

""I'm a licensed clinical social worker, and the impact of family separation on their mental health is something that they will not be able to recover from in many years to come,"" Benitez said.

The Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying, in part, that Martha and her children entered the U.S. illegally in December 2022.

""They have all received final orders of removal from an immigration judge,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Loved ones feel helpless as family is held by ICE

Another of Martha's sons, who lives in Queens and did not want to share his name, said he felt destroyed when he found out his mom, his sister and his brother were detained.

In Spanish, he told CBS News New York his mom admitted she was afraid of going to court, and he feels helpless.

He said his mother's hugs brought him joy and peace, and his sister inherited that warmth and reassurance.

Martha's boyfriend said he spoke with her recently, and she told him she's afraid of being deported and of the gangs and danger back in Ecuador.

Martha's son said he feels powerless and the most painful part is not knowing when he'll be reunited with the rest of his family again.
