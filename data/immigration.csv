Given the backlog of pending removal cases, it’s time the immigration courts got some relief, but ignore any complaints you may hear about how complex immigration law is or any potential threats this plan may pose to “due process”.

A Historical Perspective on the Backlog

Having been an immigration judge myself, I am intimately familiar with this system.

When I left the bench to return to Capitol Hill in FY 2015, there were 254 immigration judges handling a docket of 659,000 cases — roughly 2,600 cases per immigration judge.

When Donald Trump took office in FY 2017, there were 84 more immigration judges on the bench, and they were handling nearly 896,000 cases — just about 2,650 cases each.

The then-president and his attorneys general (Jeff Sessions, Matt Whittaker, and Bill Barr) prioritized immigration judge hiring, and when Trump left office in FY 2021, the cadre of immigration judges had risen 65 percent to 559.

So far, so good, but the problem was that the immigration court backlog rose by 85 percent during that same period, to more than 1.655 million cases.

Immigration court shutdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the increase, but other factors, including a rush of alien adults travelling illegally with children to take advantage of misguided court decisions (mis)interpreting the Flores settlement agreement, drove the problem.

Then came the Biden administration, with its (illegal) quick-release policies for migrants who entered illegally and weren’t expelled under Title 42.

Most were placed into removal proceedings, and by FY 2024, the immigration court backlog had grown to more than 3.88 million cases — a 135 percent increase in just three years.

I’ll note Biden continued that first Trump-era hiring spree, but still, the 735 immigration judges on the bench at the end of FY 2024 faced average dockets of 5,286 cases each.

Keep in mind also that the backlog would have been even worse had the Biden administration not cooked the books by dismissing, terminating, or closing 700,000 pending cases involving facially removable aliens, a move the House Judiciary Committee termed a “quiet amnesty”.

That may have been good on paper, but it was plainly not in the best interests of the American people.

Impact of the Trump II Border Shutdown

Trump returned to office vowing to shut the border down, and assigned two veteran officials — “border czar” Tom Homan and CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott — to accomplish that task.

And by July, Homan, Scott, and thousands of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers attained “operational control” of the Southwest border, as agency encounters dropped 92 percent compared to December.

That decline in illegal entries took some of the heat off the immigration courts, and by the third quarter of FY 2025, the backlog had declined for the first time in 17 years (since FY 2008) as immigration judges completed more than 588,000 cases while receiving just more than 448,000.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”

The immigration courts have been under-resourced for all 33-plus years that I have been involved in this area, but Congress acted in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) to address that gap.

In section 100054 of the OBBBA, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the DOJ component that administers the immigration courts, received $3.33 billion designated for the hiring of immigration judges and necessary support staff “to address the backlog of petitions, cases, and removals”.

That appropriation, however, came with an inexplicable restriction in paragraph (1)(B): “Effective November 1, 2028, [EOIR] shall be comprised of not more than 800 immigration judges, along with the necessary support staff.”

I say “inexplicable” because nobody can explain why there’s any cap on immigration judges. If anything, Congress should put a floor on hiring EOIR adjudicators, but for now, that limitation is the law.

“Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”

As noted above, the backlog has declined in the past nine months, but the average immigration judge must still juggle a docket of more than 5,500 cases — a herculean task given that each can complete, at best, only 1,000 cases per year.

In response, EOIR on August 28 published a final rule in the Federal Register captioned “Designation of Temporary Immigration Judges”. As the office explains, under that rule: “the EOIR Director ... with the approval of the Attorney General, may designate or select TIJs, which have the authority of an IJ to adjudicate assigned cases and administer immigration court matters”. (TIJs are not counted toward the inexplicable 800-judge cap in the OBBBA.)

The appointment of TIJs has been permitted by regulation since the Obama administration, but prior to the current rule, the only attorneys eligible were former immigration judges, members of the appellate Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), ALJs — administrative law judges — from DOJ and other agencies, and DOJ attorneys with at least 10 years of immigration law experience.

That latter requirement really didn’t make any sense, given that full-fledged immigration judges only need seven years of post-bar experience — not 10 — and any lawyer could apply and be appointed, not just one with immigration experience.

The thought in 2014 when that earlier provision took effect was that many TIJs would want to become immigration judges.

But as the rule explains: “EOIR’s experience with its retired adjudicators, only a handful of whom have indicated a willingness to return as either TIJs or rehired annuitants with limited workloads since the 2014 [regulation] was promulgated indicates that pool is insufficient to address its TIJ needs”.

Consequently, the August 28 rule drops both the immigration-law experience requirement and expands TIJ-eligibility to attorneys from other departments — not just DOJ.

“Pentagon Authorizes Up to 600 Military Lawyers to Serve as Temporary Immigration Judges”

Which brings me to the September 2 AP article, headlined “Pentagon authorizes up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges”.

The outlet reports: “The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department ‘as soon as practicable,’ and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week.’”

Once on the bench, that assignment would boost the current number of immigration judges by about 22 percent, but don’t expect any of them to start hearing cases before late October.

As the August 28 rule notes, DOJ must first approve any would-be TIJs, and once they’re selected, they’ll “receive the same ‘comprehensive, continuing training and support’” that full-time immigration judges already get.

In my case, that meant a week-long course in immigration law and courtroom demeanor, followed by two weeks of in-court experience supervised by a full-time immigration judge.

Trust me — it was more than enough, and attorneys in my class who came in with no immigration-law experience have gone on to have distinguished careers.

“Makes as Much Sense as Having a Cardiologist Do a Hip Replacement”

Nonetheless, AP quoted a critic who complained Defense Department TIJs would “gut[] due process” and that the plan “makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement”.

Spare me. First, though immigration law experts compare the subject to tax law in its complexity, in most cases it’s straightforward and commonsensical.

Aliens enter illegally or they don’t, overstay nonimmigrant visas or they don’t, are telling you the truth about the horrors they faced back home or the relationship they have with their “spouses”, or they aren’t.

By and large, rules of evidence don’t even come into play in immigration court, and when it comes to bond hearings, multiple layers of hearsay and innuendo are fair game.

And if immigration judges — full-time or temporary — have any questions about the law or the facts, they can tell the parties to brief them. When I was an INS trial attorney, I usually hated such requests, but as an immigration judge I thought they were swell — and immensely helpful.

As for “due process”, immigration judges are first adjudicators, not the last. Every alien can have an immigration court decision reviewed by the BIA, and if they aren’t happy there, can ask the local federal circuit court to weigh in — and both tribunals are more than happy to send a wrongly decided case back or reverse a decision.

Even the cariologist/hip surgeon comparison is inapt.

The doctor’s adage “see one, do one, teach one” was coined by Dr. William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the late 19th century when he was training young, would-be surgeons. Under the latest rule, TIJs will see many immigration cases — and likely do many under supervision as well — before the training wheels come off.

Moreover, while it’s true that I wouldn’t grab cardiologists from the cath lab and have them cut on me, immigration law isn’t surgery — and if I thought I was having a heart attack, I’d trust an orthopedist to diagnose my symptoms.

Respectfully, there are plenty of Article III, federal court judges with no experience at the outset in the varied areas of the law they are expected to adjudicate. To the best of my knowledge, no Supreme Court justice in history ever practiced immigration law, but they have the final word in interpreting it.

Finally, as the August 28 Federal Register notice notes, “Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success as an” immigration judge; trust me when I tell you from experience, truer words have never been spoken.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/judge-gavel-warrant-social.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:20.070722

Support for Mr. Trump’s plans for Chicago has been quiet in the city, relative to the opposition.","The Trump administration is expected to begin a large-scale crackdown on illegal immigration in the coming days in Chicago, a push that could bring hundreds of additional federal agents to the city and ignite tensions in Latino communities.

President Trump has been mentioning the effort for weeks as part of his broadening immigration enforcement across the country, which aims to arrest people in cities including Chicago that typically don’t coordinate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Recently, Mr. Trump has described Chicago as a “mess,” the latest volley at a city that he has long criticized for its Democratic leadership and crime rate. He has already sent federal agents and troops to Los Angeles and Washington, and has said the moves are necessary to fight street crime and enforce immigration laws.

An internal document obtained by The New York Times indicated that Department of Homeland Security officials would arrive at the Naval Station Great Lakes this week and that there would be 30 days of operations in the Chicago area. In recent weeks, ICE officials have sought significant resources for the operation, including thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses, according to an official with knowledge of the plans.

In Chicago, at least 150,000 people in the city of 2.7 million are undocumented, estimates show, making up about 8 percent of households.

Both political leaders and residents say they are uncertain what exactly is about to take place.

Hundreds of Chicago residents have vowed to gather in protest downtown at the first sign of ICE raids, and metal barricades were placed around the federal courthouse on Thursday night in the heart of the Loop.

In the suburbs north of Chicago on Friday morning, protesters unfurled banners in opposition to ICE along on a highway that leads from a naval station that is being used as a staging ground for the federal government’s operations.

Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said that his administration was ready to fight Mr. Trump in court if the president expanded the operations beyond immigration and ordered National Guard troops to enter the city. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to send troops to Chicago, saying that policing in the city needs federal help. But violent crime has dropped there in the last several years, and city officials said this summer recorded the fewest homicides since 1965.

Chicagoans, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, have been anxiously monitoring news of the federal involvement. Some say they fear they could be arrested and deported.

“We are all afraid, but we also feel a sense of resignation,” said Francisco, a Mexican man who asked that his full name not be used because he was not authorized to be in the country. He said he had been working in Chicago as a janitor, cleaning offices and stadiums since 2010.

Immigration officials have been under increasing pressure to make more arrests and deport a growing number of people to fulfill Mr. Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

In Illinois, ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests since Mr. Trump took office through the end of July, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant-heavy states like New York. More than a thousand of those arrests have been in the Chicago area

The operation in Chicago is expected to be particularly challenging for ICE. ICE officials have found difficulties in the past in progressive communities where advocates have advised people not to answer their doors to immigration officers seeking their arrest. Officials are also on alert for potential protest activity.

The anticipated crackdown coincided with a typically raucous time in the city as celebrations of Mexican Independence Day were to begin on Saturday with a parade in the Little Village neighborhood on the Southwest Side. Most Latinos in Chicago are of Mexican descent, and each year, thousands attend parades, fly Mexican flags from their cars and form caravans, honking horns and causing gridlock around the city.

The holiday was expected to be muted this year because of the prospect of federal law enforcement. Some organizers said they would cancel events altogether. El Grito Chicago, a two-day musical festival set to take place in mid-September in Grant Park, the city’s front yard, was postponed.

“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake, and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” organizers said in a statement.

Chicago Public Schools has also been monitoring the situation with alarm.

Latinos make up nearly half of the city’s public school system’s 325,000 students, and some administrators worry that families will choose to keep their children home out of caution. Most of Chicago’s 800,000 Latino residents are legally in this country, but advocates say they worry that families will still fear being caught up in raids even if they have legal status.

Teachers planned to hold “solidarity walk-ins” on Friday, handing out brochures to parents or passers-by with details on their legal rights, should they be confronted by ICE agents.

In the suburb of Broadview, Ill., on Friday morning, several dozen people showed up at an ICE processing facility in protest.

The group included some holding a prayer vigil and others carrying signs and chanting “all power to the people, no one is illegal.” Some members of the group have been protesting outside the facility weekly for almost two decades

The windows and the front door of the facility, a two-story building on a quiet, industrial street, were recently covered with plywood. Asked about the reason for the plywood, ICE officials did not provide an explanation.

City leaders encouraged protest against what they have described as a military occupation, but urged a peaceful, nonviolent reaction.

Former Representative Luis Gutiérrez, a Democrat, stood in Federal Plaza downtown on Thursday and denounced the Trump administration, while acknowledging that a violent response from the public could spur the president to bring in the National Guard.

“Lift your voice but not your hand,” Mr. Gutiérrez said. “The only one who wins when there is violence is Donald Trump, because he wins by saying that the people of the city of Chicago need the National Guard because it is a city of violence.”

Protests and incidents of arson over ICE arrests in Los Angeles led Mr. Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into the city over the summer.

Support for Mr. Trump’s plans for Chicago has been quiet in the city, relative to the opposition. But some Chicagoans said they would welcome troops to enforce the laws in their neighborhoods.

Wanda Williams, 49, sat on a bench in Federal Plaza on Friday. She said that while she was not in favor of deportations, she would not be upset if Mr. Trump brought in the National Guard to contend with problems other than immigration.

“I say bring them, I’m sick of the crime,” said Ms. Williams, a resident of the Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side, where she said drug sales were common on her block.

On the streets of Pilsen and Little Village — neighborhoods known for sizable Mexican American populations — immigrant residents, some undocumented and others with varying degrees of legal status, said they had closely followed the news of the crackdowns in Los Angeles and Washington and feared that Chicago could become the next target. Many had long ago started limiting their outings to banks and grocery stores and not leaving home without first scanning TikTok or Facebook, or “el Feis,” as most called it, for sightings of immigration agents.

One 14-year-old girl waiting for the bus in the Pilsen neighborhood said her undocumented parents, like those of many of her friends, were scared to go outside over the next few days. Rumors of raids were already proliferating online, some complained, putting only more stress on communities already on edge. The National Guard seemed to be on everyone’s mind.

Maricela, 50, who declined to use her full name because she was undocumented, said the constant sense of worry and nervousness could be damaging to peoples’ health.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw/NAT-CHICAGO-BRACING-1-qpzw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:56:48.492202

“The use of masks,” Mr. Levitsky said, “is without question a bad sign.” And it is extremely rare in functional democracies.
ICE says it wants to hire 10,000 new agents at a time when hiring law enforcement officers has been hard.","One of the defining images of President Trump’s second term so far has been security officers in masks. Whether detaining a Turkish student on the street in Boston, raiding Home Depot parking lots in Los Angeles or, now, arresting immigrants on the streets of the capital, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in tactical gear and with their faces obscured have become a strange new national pageant.

The Homeland Security Department says that in an era of extreme polarization and rising political violence, masks are necessary. “ICE officers wear a mask because they’ve been doxxed by the thousands,” Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar, told my colleagues at “The Daily.” “Their families have been doxxed. ICE officers’ pictures show up on trees and telephone poles. Death threats are sky-high.” Masking, the argument goes, is simply the practical response.

Lawmakers in liberal states say the practice should be banned, and this summer, Democratic elected officials in California, New York and Pennsylvania proposed laws to do just that. At the end of July, Virginia’s Democratic senators introduced a bill to ban the use of masks nationally. The issue also got the attention of a federal judge, who, in a ruling on Tuesday against Mr. Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles, noted disapprovingly that the armed forces’ identity “was often obscured by protective armor.”

As I watched all of this, I found myself wondering about masking by law enforcement and whether it has a history in the United States. Something about it seemed at once familiar and foreign. That’s because I associate the practice with Russia.

In the summer of 2000, when President Vladimir Putin had just taken office, I was living in Moscow and working as a reporter. At the time, the first battle lines were being drawn between the new president and the powerful oligarchs he hoped to tame. Russians began to see raids by government forces on oligarchs and their properties. Men in masks conducted them. They became so ubiquitous that people began referring to them sardonically as Maski Show, or mask shows, after a popular television show involving mask-wearing clowns.

The United States is not Russia. But as I search for ways to understand what is happening in my country today, I am looking to the places I’ve been before. In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era.

The Power and the Danger

Masks became a feature of America’s fiercely polarized political life during the Covid pandemic. Mask requirements enraged conservatives, who saw them as an effort by the government to boss them around on flimsy science. Concerns about the virus’s spread subsided, but the debate seemed to have unlocked something in the American psyche about the power — and danger — of masks.

Over the past several years, states and counties began passing laws against masking that applied to protesters in demonstrations, reasoning that they would be more likely to do something illegal if law enforcement couldn’t see their faces.

Some of those laws echoed statutes passed in the 1940s and 1950s by states and cities that were trying to control the Ku Klux Klan, said Robert Mickey, a political science professor at the University of Michigan. Even though Klan chapters were often “shot through with members of the police,” Mr. Mickey said, those officers, who showed their faces during the day, wore masks when doing the work of the Klan at night.

There are good reasons vigilantes wear masks and police officers don’t. Policing experts argue that masking by law enforcement is wrong because officers are public servants and are supposed to be accountable to the public. Hiding behind a mask makes that harder. Yes, officers’ jobs can be dangerous, but being publicly identifiable goes along with having the right to wield a deadly weapon on behalf of the state.

In recent years in the United States, trends in law enforcement were moving in the opposite direction. Many police departments now use body cameras and require that the officer’s badge, with name and number, be visible.

Michael German, a retired F.B.I. agent who is now a fellow in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program, said that even when he worked undercover, “the period of secrecy ended when charges were brought and I had to defend what I had done in that undercover capacity.”

Masking provides leeway for abuse, he said. People tend to be more scrupulous and vigilant when they can be personally held accountable for their actions. A mask allows more latitude for sloppiness or shortcuts — a punch or a kick, for example.

No one I interviewed could think of an example of American law enforcement masking. Jules Epstein, a law professor at Temple University who worked for decades as a criminal defense lawyer and death penalty litigator, said that in his more than 45 years of practice, he had never seen the police wear masks, including in high-profile gang cases.

‘Without Question a Bad Sign’

Outside the United States, masking by law enforcement has a long history. When it happens, it tends to be in countries with weak central governments, sometimes ones that are fighting insurgencies or drug cartels or, for that matter, political opponents.

In Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s, the government worked with paramilitary groups — forces on the side of the government but not directly employed by it — that often wore masks. They operated at the margins of the law, according to Adam Isacson, a security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, and over time, courts and special tribunals have documented abuses they perpetrated. In Colombia, the state was up against a well-equipped and deadly foe: drug cartels. Anyone obstructing them had reason to fear for their lives. Judges wore masks to avoid reprisal killings, a practice that became known as “judges without faces.”

Law enforcement officers in Mexico sometimes mask, too, Mr. Isacson said, in areas where drug cartels have a strong presence.

In Peru, government forces often wore masks in their war against Shining Path guerrillas in the 1980s and 1990s, said Steven Levitsky, a political scientist who has studied Latin America and written about democratic decline. In areas where Shining Path was strongest, police officers were afraid of reprisals by the guerrillas but also of becoming pariahs in their own communities for abuses they themselves committed, he said.

More recently, Human Rights Watch has documented cases of government forces using masks in Venezuela during the repression that followed the country’s tainted presidential election last year. And in the Philippines, victims of Rodrigo Duterte’s brutal antidrug campaign report that the people doing the killing were sometimes masked.

“The use of masks,” Mr. Levitsky said, “is without question a bad sign.”

And it is extremely rare in functional democracies. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” Mr. Levitsky said. “It just doesn’t happen.”

Stronger, more confident regimes rarely mask. Totalitarian states that have established control over their populations tend to avoid moves that would stir dissent. Masking can draw attention to the fact that the government is up to something it wants to hide, or that it is not powerful enough to protect its own forces. In short, it’s a bad look.

In China, the security forces do not wear masks, said Lynette Ong, a China scholar and professor at the University of Toronto. But something else happens. In her book, “Outsourcing Repression,” Ms. Ong explains that China’s everyday security policing force draws from ordinary people mobilized from the street and paid a daily rate or hired on a contract. The state does not formally employ them, and when they are caught harming someone, the government can plausibly say it was not responsible. China may be authoritarian, she said, but public officials can be held accountable for abuse. They can be fired, for example, if their forces are caught on camera beating people up.

Masks are rare in Iran, too, though they are occasionally used in drug and organized crime operations, said Omid Memarian, an Iranian journalist who is now an Iran expert at DAWN, a Washington-based organization focused on U.S. policy in the Middle East. He said that when he was arrested in 2005, no one, not even his interrogators, wore masks.

“The people who interrogated me, they wanted me to see their faces,” Mr. Memarian said.

The reason was that the government wanted to show that what it was doing was legitimate. They also arrested him discreetly, “without a splash,” Mr. Memarian said. A number of armed men came to his building, but his neighbors had no idea it was happening. They kept it low-key so as not to draw the attention of regime critics.

“Once a mask is involved,” he said, “people understand it as a sign of weakness, that the government has something to hide.”

The Show

In Russia in the early 2000s, Mr. Putin wasn’t trying to hide anything. On the contrary: He was putting on a show that he wanted everyone to see. Russia’s central government had been plagued by weakness throughout the 1990s, with the oligarchs running official agencies and having their way with the state. The Maski Shows were efforts by this new leader to turn the tables.

One of the most famous episodes took place a few days after Mr. Putin was inaugurated in May 2000. Armed men in military fatigues and masks showed up at one of the offices that belonged to the oligarch who had founded the first independent television network, NTV.

Yevgeny Kiselyov, then the director of the channel and its main anchor, remembers being struck by the over-the-top nature of the force. “They were carrying out their operation as if this building was full of heavily armed terrorists,” he said in an interview. In reality, it was middle-aged women working in accounting.

The television station was eventually taken over by the state, and Mr. Kiselyov now lives outside Russia. He said the meaning of the raid was clear even then. It was a public message, not just to that station and its owner, but to anyone who opposed Mr. Putin. “It was an act of intimidation,” he said. “It was saying, ‘We are now in power, and we are going after you.’”

The Trump administration seems to be sending the same message with ICE, except in this case, the targets are not oligarchs, but immigrants and the businesses who employ them.

But there are other audiences. Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas, who helped oversee border security in the George W. Bush administration, said he believes the performance is aimed at would-be migrants around the world. Former President Joe Biden, “no matter what he did, could not change the view of the world that the border was open,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “I knew it was going to take someone who was going to create some heartache, and that they’d have to be very tough and create some fear to change the circumstances.”

And then there’s the domestic audience. Polling suggests that many Americans don’t like Mr. Trump’s tactics around deportations, at least when it comes to immigrants who have not committed violent crimes. But some Americans do approve of it, perhaps drawn to its dark spectacle. The immigrant detention center in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is now tied up in court battles, has its own merch. Americans pose for selfies by the center’s new highway sign and post them on social media. In early August, Indiana announced a partnership with the Homeland Security Department to build the “Speedway Slammer,” its answer to Alligator Alcatraz. A few weeks later, Nebraska announced plans for the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Mr. Levitsky called the highly visible, almost ostentatious use of masks “a performance but with real-world consequences.” “MAGA seems to get something out of playing authoritarian,” he said. “There’s an element of cosplay to it.”

Perhaps the most important audience of all is the agency itself — and its potential recruits. ICE says it wants to hire 10,000 new agents at a time when hiring law enforcement officers has been hard. It got a multibillion-dollar cash infusion from Congress in July. Masking could serve to reassure reluctant applicants, who are worried for their safety or about being judged by people they know, but also to attract more exuberant ones, who see masking as subversive and fun.

The president and his supporters see the influx of agents and soldiers as a means to curb crime and crack down on illegal immigration. Critics say Mr. Trump is using the deployments to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities. The move has prompted lawsuits, demonstrations and a scramble among local officials to respond.

Here’s how the federal presence on the streets has unfolded so far in some cities, and here’s how it may soon play out elsewhere.

Chicago

The Trump administration is making plans for escalated arrests of undocumented immigrants, using hundreds of federal agents who are being sent to the Chicago area. They are expected to use a naval base outside of the city as a staging area for operations. Local officials and immigrant advocacy groups are on high alert, reminding residents of their rights and urging caution.

Whether Mr. Trump will send the National Guard into Chicago is murky.

In Washington, D.C., the president deployed the National Guard as part of his security takeover there. But Washington is a federal district and not a state, and governors normally have control of their state Guard troops. Mr. Trump bypassed state control in California, where he federalized National Guard troops and sent them to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom. In Illinois, however, there has been no civil unrest in Chicago that might require National Guard assistance.

For weeks, Illinois officials have loudly objected to the Trump administration’s rumored plans, holding news conferences and rallies to make their position clear: They do not want the military in Chicago.

Mr. Johnson issued an order saying that the city would pursue “all available legal and legislative avenues” to resist actions by the federal government “that violate the rights of the City and its residents, including the Constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest and the right to due process.”

Advocacy groups are making plans to stage protests in opposition to any escalated immigration arrests, or the potential presence of the National Guard.

Los Angeles

Federal immigration agents carried out large-scale immigration raids in the Los Angeles area on June 6, including one at a clothing wholesaler in downtown Los Angeles that led to the arrests of dozens of people.

Since the raids began, more than 5,000 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The raids have been met with backlash from local leaders and residents. Federal immigration agencies, including the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have said that agents are conducting targeted operations. But videos of many raids taken by bystanders and activists and posted on social media have shown agents chasing down people seemingly at random at Home Depot parking lots, carwashes and other workplaces.

At least two people have died after trying to flee immigration agents in Southern California. One man died in July after falling more than 30 feet from a greenhouse at a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County. In August, another man died after being struck by a vehicle while running onto a freeway near Los Angeles as he was trying to flee agents at a Home Depot.

Protests immediately erupted in Los Angeles on the first day of widespread immigration raids in June. The protests spread from downtown Los Angeles to Compton and across the region.

The protests prompted President Trump to send thousands of National Guard members into Los Angeles. Many of those soldiers have since been withdrawn, but about 300 remain. The deployment has cost taxpayers nearly $120 million so far, Mr. Newsom said.

The raids, protests and military presence have led to several legal battles.

One lawsuit was filed against the federal government over the Guard deployment. Another was filed against the Department of Homeland Security, accusing federal agents of stopping people based on the color of their skin. That lawsuit prompted a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order, barring agents from making indiscriminate stops. The ruling was upheld by an appeals court.

The operations in Los Angeles have been led by Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief known for confrontational tactics and aggressive raids. It was unclear if Mr. Bovino would join the immigration crackdown in Chicago, but in a video posted on Tuesday on social media, Mr. Bovino suggested that Border Patrol officers were headed to a new city.

“We’re going to trade these palm trees,” he said, “for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues.”

Washington, D.C.

President Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington in August in an effort to crack down on crime, despite figures that indicated a recent drop in crime rates in the area.

In two weeks, federal agents helped arrest about 1,000 people. A New York Times review of the arrests found that the operation appeared to be more of a dragnet than a targeted effort. In addition to those arrests, agents also arrested more than 400 other people who were believed to be undocumented in a three-week time frame.

New Orleans, Mr. Trump said, is a city in a state with a “a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that’s become quite tough?”

Mr. Landry, a Republican, welcomed the idea of troops coming to New Orleans. Last year, he helped create a special unit of the Louisiana State Police to focus on public safety in New Orleans. Recent data has shown that New Orleans has recorded a drop in violent crimes this year.

Other Cities

The Trump administration has also suggested sending the National Guard or a surge of immigration agents to other cities, including Baltimore and Boston.

Mr. Trump has said he had an “obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore,” adding that the city is a “very unsafe place.”

The Trump administration has also threatened to send immigration agents to Boston. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the city over its sanctuary policies. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in a statement that Boston was “among the worst sanctuary offenders in America.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch/05NAT-CITIES-EXPLAINER-top2-qlch-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:23.937740

Enes Hocaogullari, who took part in a March meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, as one of Turkey’s youth delegates, was arrested last month after he criticized the detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and other opposition figures.

The 23-year-old activist also spoke out against alleged police violence during protests that erupted following Imamoglu’s arrest.

Marc Cools, president of a delegation of the Council of Europe’s local and regional authorities congress, said there was no legal justification for Hocaogullari’s prosecution or detention.

“Silencing Enes is silencing youth — and silencing youth is silencing democracy itself,” Cools said after visiting Hocaogullari in prison Friday and meeting a day earlier with Turkey’s deputy justice minister and other officials in Ankara.

Hocaogullari was taken into custody at Ankara’s Esenboga airport in August and later charged with “publicly disseminating misleading information” and “inciting hatred and enmity among the public.”

The first hearing of his trial is scheduled for Sept. 8.

“We hope that justice will prevail, that all charges will be dropped, that he will be immediately released,” Cools said.

Imamoglu, a popular opposition figure seen as the main rival to Erdogan in the presidential elections, was arrested in March over allegations of corruption, which he strongly denies. He was officially nominated as the presidential candidate for the main opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, following his imprisonment.

Several other CHP mayors and municipal employees have also been arrested as part of investigations into alleged corruption. The CHP denies the accusations.

Critics view the arrests as a politically motivated crackdown on the CHP, which made significant gains in local elections last year. The government denies the accusation, asserting that the judiciary operates independently and that the investigations target serious corruption allegations.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk.","My time as an Equal Justice Works Fellow at CAC began and ended with Supreme Court cases with major consequences for our multiracial democracy. A few months before I started, voting rights litigators obtained significant victories at the Court that upheld bedrock protections for the right to vote. But threats to voting rights lingered, and two years later, on the last week of my fellowship, CAC filed an amicus brief in the latest challenge to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and its ability to ensure equal opportunity for voters of color. Much can change in a few years, and I feel exceptionally fortunate that I’ve spent these years at CAC.

Two Supreme Court decisions from June 2023 affected the course of my Fellowship. First, in Moore v. Harper, the Court soundly rejected the so-called independent state legislature theory (ISLT). At the same time, however, the Court created a small potential opening for ISLT proponents, writing that, under the Elections Clause, the Court has the power to review state court decisions on state election law when those courts “transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review.” During the first half of my fellowship, I delved into historical and legal research to combat any future invocations of ISLT and demonstrate that federal court review of state court decisions in this area is only appropriate in extremely rare and unlikely circumstances. This project culminated in an article published in the Boston College Law Review in April 2025 that I co-authored with my colleagues David Gans and Brianne Gorod. As legal scholarship plays a critical role in developing and promoting pro-democracy arguments, I am thrilled that CAC was able to contribute to the important academic discourse on ISLT and support future litigation against the doctrine.

The second case was Allen v. Milligan. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the longstanding legal framework governing Section 2 of the VRA’s protection against vote dilution, which is critical to ensuring that voters of color have an equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. After the Court’s decision in Milligan, several lower court vote dilution cases resumed, and new challenges to the VRA were raised in courts of appeals. I worked on two amicus briefs in the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits defending the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA and another amicus brief in the Fifth Circuit arguing that Section 2 protects coalitions of voters of color who jointly bring vote dilution claims.

These were not the only voting rights cases that I had the privilege to work on. CAC filed three amicus briefs in litigation challenging state election laws under the Materiality Provision of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits laws that disenfranchise voters for minor errors in voting paperwork. And in Florida state courts, I worked on briefs defending against efforts to weaken the Florida Constitution’s voting rights protections.

During the last year of my fellowship, however, new threats to democracy emerged, including several actions taken by the Trump Administration to weaken bedrock constitutional rights and principles. And as case after case has been filed to challenge the Trump administration’s lawlessness, CAC has been there defending democracy and the rule of law, and I am grateful to have contributed to the fight as a Fellow. For example, after President Trump purported to curtail birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants, CAC filed several amicus briefs in the Supreme Court and federal courts of appeal on behalf of an ideologically diverse group of scholars of constitutional law and immigration in which we explain that the Fourteenth Amendment means what it says: all children born in the United States are citizens of the United States, and no executive order can change that. I have also worked on amicus briefs CAC has filed in cases challenging the administration’s efforts to unilaterally dismantle executive departments and agencies, including an amicus brief filed on behalf of members of Congress in litigation challenging the administration’s attempt to dismantle the CFPB.

Now, as the next Supreme Court Term looms, the VRA is once again at risk. In Louisiana v. Callais, the Court is considering a challenge to a congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature passed to remedy a Section 2 violation. I worked on the amicus brief CAC filed in the case in December 2024 and wrote a piece in Slate in March 2025 recapping the oral argument. This summer, however, the Court scheduled the case to be reargued this upcoming Term and ordered supplemental briefing on the constitutionality of the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-Black district. During the last week of my fellowship, I worked on another amicus brief that CAC filed in the case, arguing that the drawing of majority-minority districts to remedy vote dilution is consistent with the text and history of the Fifteenth Amendment.

My fellowship started with significant wins for democracy and is ending with a case that could radically undermine the VRA’s ability to protect voters of color and advance the goals of the Fifteenth Amendment. But while the threats to voting rights and democracy may have changed over the past two years, CAC’s steadfast commitment to promoting the progressive promise of the Constitution has not. At the Supreme Court and lower courts, CAC and our brilliant team of attorneys have been there to explain to courts that the Constitution’s sweeping protections for democracy and voting rights cannot be undermined, whether by states seeking to weaken the voting strength of voters of color or a President taking unlawful unilateral executive action. I feel immensely privileged to have been a member of the CAC team over these two years, and I am very grateful for all the opportunities I have had and the lessons I have learned. As I finish my fellowship amidst unprecedented threats to the rule of law and democracy, I am heartened by the fact that CAC will be here to take on these challenges in the months and years to come.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-09-05 14:57:33.270425

This move attempts to criminalize immigrants seeking green cards, naturalized citizenship or those seeking approval under humanitarian programs. Historically, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services operated separately from immigration arrests and enforcing deportations because the agency primarily functions as a naturalization agency.

“Within months, the Trump administration has eroded every avenue for legalized immigration, making the process virtually impossible. Cruelty is the only motivating factor in these current policy decisions,” said Tieffa Harper, deputy legal director, SPLC. “This administration simply does not want immigrants to feel safe and is using any means to make it more difficult to become an American citizen.

“With the hiring of armed agents, the fear of deportations and arrests increasingly becomes an everyday reality for immigrants seeking naturalization services. Under Trump, America is no longer a haven for those seeking hope, prosperity and refuge. The SPLC stands in solidarity with immigrants and our partners fighting on their behalf to demand that the US fulfill the promise of liberty, equality and justice a reality guaranteed by our Constitution.”

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site.
""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.","An appellate court temporarily allows the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center to remain open.

Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the appellate court's decision, stating the facility is ""open for business.""

Environmental groups challenging the facility have vowed to continue their legal fight.

Gov. Ron DeSantis hailed a Sept. 4 appeals court ruling allowing — for the moment — operations to continue at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration detention center.

""The mission continues on immigration enforcement,"" the governor said in a videotaped statement on social media. ""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.""

The order from the11th Circuit Court of Appeals, however, simply allows the state to continue detaining people at the facility until the judicial panel issues a final ruling on the matter.

On Aug. 21, a federal judge agreed with the plaintiffs alleging the state failed to conduct proper environmental assessments and impact studies before opening the facility, and effectively ordered the closing of the detention center.

DeSantis and state officials immediately appealed that ruling.

Plaintiffs: Fight against detention camp and for the Everglades goes on

The groups that challenged the existence of the facility on environmental grounds vowed to continue their legal battle, however, after the latest decision.

In a prepared statement, Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said the ruling imposing a ""limited stay"" on the closure decision is ""disappointing,"" but added that the case is far from being decided.

“We’re hopeful the preliminary injunction will be affirmed when it’s reviewed on its merits during the appeal,” Samples said.

“In the meantime, if the DeSantis and Trump administrations choose to ramp operations back up at the detention center, they will just be throwing good money after bad because this ill-considered facility — which is causing harm to the Everglades — will ultimately be shut down.”

Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, also a plaintiff in the case, said the ruling was ""heartbreaking"" but not a conclusion.

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Bennett said in a prepared statement. “The Eleventh Circuit’s order only puts a pause on the district court’s injunction, and we’re confident we will ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

Talbert Cypress, chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, said he was not surprised by the ruling but lauded the dissenting opinion he said steadfastly backed the plaintiffs' position.

“We are disappointed in the majority’s decision to stay the injunction,"" Talbert wrote in a statement. ""We were prepared for this result and will continue to litigate the matter. We find some solace in the dissent’s accurate analysis of the law and will continue to fight for our Mother Everglades.”

Immigration advocates also decry use of Alligator Alcatraz center

The legal battle in federal court is focused on the impact of the facility on sensitive wetlands and wilderness, and potentially on the hydrology that supplies millions of people across South Florida with drinking water.

But the detention camp is also at the center of a bitter debate over the handling of the apprehension, detention and deporting of people in Florida.

The Trump and DeSantis administrations have made the pursuit and removal of people seeking permanent status in the state, as well as those living under temporary protection, a centerpiece public policy issue.

The president has often touted the top priority is public safety by removing foreigners who have committed crimes from U.S. communities, including ""the worst of the worst always first"" as he said when he toured Alligator Alcatraz on July 1. But federal officials have also flatly stated that anyone in the United States without permission is a ""criminal,"" as Madison Sheahan, the Immigration Customs Enforcement deputy director, said in Miramar on May 1.

That position has placed countless of people living and working in the United States at risk of detention and deportation, even though they have otherwise abided by laws, including those who were paroled into the country at the southern border and regularly checked in with authorities while their asylum or status claim was adjudicated through the immigration court system.

Lawyers and advocates for immigrants have decried that feature of the immigration crackdown, as well as the conditions in which people being held in the detention center are suffering.

Renata Bozzetto, deputy director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a September statement that the appellate ruling will permit ""atrocities to happen"" at the Alligator Alcatraz site. Bozzetto said the ""thousands of men in tents"" at the location are being held in unsuitable conditions and are being deprived of their human and legal rights.

""The Everglades Detention Camp isn’t just an environmental threat; it is also a huge human rights crisis,"" she wrote in a prepeared statement.

""This is a place where hundreds of our neighbors were illegally held, were made invisible within government systems, and were subjected to inhumane heat and unbearable treatment.

This guest post does not necessarily reflect the views or expertise of Human Rights First.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), enacted in 2000, marked the United States’ first sweeping federal commitment to confront human trafficking. By offering a clear legal definition of both sex and labor trafficking, the TVPA pioneered a comprehensive national strategy encompassing three key priorities: protection for survivors, prosecution of traffickers, and prevention of future exploitation. The law transformed not only criminal sanctions, but also the landscape of support and hope for survivors.

In the late 1990s, human trafficking was increasingly recognized as not only an international atrocity but a domestic one as well. Awareness campaigns, survivor advocacy, and bipartisan congressional leadership converged to push the issue into the public eye. Heather Pagan from South Carolina, who endured 18 years of sex trafficking after meeting an abuser at 14, would later testify to lawmakers: “This label that had been stuck to me my whole life: ‘You’re just an addict… You’re just a prostitute. You’re a criminal.’ Now had just been stripped off me.”. Stories like hers underscored the urgency of a law that could provide survivors with a clear path to justice and support.

The TVPA laid down a legal framework that defined trafficking and introduced the “3 P’s” approach: protection, prosecution, and prevention. Within its original language were transformative tools: T visas, which permit survivors to remain in the U.S. while cooperating with investigations; federal funding for shelters, counseling, legal aid, and job training; enhanced penalties for traffickers; and support for anti-trafficking initiatives abroad. Shyima Hall of California, who was sold into domestic servitude at eight and smuggled to the U.S. at age ten, benefitted directly from these protections. Her rescue, prompted by a neighbor’s report, led to the first federal trafficking prosecution in Orange County. She vividly recalls: “No one, not a single person, ever deserves to have their life, their freedom, stolen.” Hall later became a U.S. citizen, authored Hidden Girl, and now advocates widely for survivors.

Since 2000, the TVPA has been reauthorized multiple times, in 2003, 2005, 2008, 2013, 2018, and most recently in 2022, each time extending protections and expanding coverage to domestic victims, especially minors, with greater emphasis on labor trafficking. Pamela Lynn Hock of Virginia, trafficked from age 13 to nearly 18, reflects the importance of these expansions. “We were children… we believed everything that they told us. When they said, ‘We are going to murder you if you don’t do what we tell you to do,’ we believed them.” Today, Hock serves on the state’s Commission on Human Trafficking Prevention and Survivor Support, ensuring that survivor-led insight shapes trauma-informed policy.

Federal implementation through the Office on Trafficking in Persons provides grants that fund NGOs, shelters, legal clinics, and prevention education programs in schools. Local task forces unite law enforcement, social services, and healthcare workers to identify and assist survivors. Community awareness campaigns help shift public perception and provide survivors with a clear path to report exploitation and access help. Pagan’s work as Survivor Support Director for Lighthouse for Life demonstrates how these systemic supports can enable survivors not only to heal but to lead, guiding others to reclaim their lives and dignity.

Despite progress, advocates highlight persistent gaps. Funding and resources have often favored sex trafficking over labor trafficking. As Jenny Footle, a survivor and activist, notes, “It is incredibly important to have equal representation of both labor and sex trafficking in all levels of programming, including the lived experience you are engaging with. For too long, survivors of labor trafficking have been forced to the margins in the sector, despite the fact that labor trafficking is the most prevalent form of trafficking here in the United States.” Undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ survivors still face barriers in accessing services. Some survivors, particularly those forced into commercial sex, continue to face criminalization rather than support. While survivor leadership is growing, it remains underrepresented in the design and governance of anti-trafficking policy.

The future must center survivors in every way: as leaders in policy, educators in prevention, and decision-makers in service systems. As survivor leader Emily Warfield emphasizes, “Survivors deserve to decide what happens after they escape a trafficking situation, whether or not that’s prosecution. They deserve a seat at the table, and they deserve to feel safe in anti-trafficking spaces.” Advocates press for more balanced funding between labor and sex trafficking and for anti-trafficking efforts to intersect meaningfully with immigration reform, labor rights, racial justice, and mental health. Communities must stay engaged through prevention education, survivor-led programming, and inclusive legislation, building on TVPA’s legacy with integrity and equity.

Since its enactment, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act has transformed how the U.S. defines and responds to trafficking, from legal frameworks to community interventions. Its tools have opened pathways to safety, healing, and justice for survivors. Yet the fight continues. Individuals and communities can contribute by supporting survivor-led organizations, advocating for inclusive policies, educating others, and promoting systems that empower rather than punish survivors. The TVPA didn’t end trafficking, but it made sure survivors could finally be seen, heard, and fought for. The question now is whether we’ll keep fighting.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/35289026265_9acee79bc3_o-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:48.965784

Since his arrest by immigration officials on Aug. 25, Mr. Abrego Garcia has been held in a detention center in Virginia.
“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.","The Trump administration warned in immigration court on Thursday that if Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s recent attempt to open an asylum case in the United States is successful, government officials will seek to deport him back to El Salvador, according to a copy of the court filing obtained by The New York Times.

The filing indicates the administration is opening another front in its efforts to expel Mr. Abrego Garcia from the United States for a second time — this time back to his homeland, where a court already ruled that he cannot be sent because he could face threats or persecution there.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly maintained that they will not allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to go free in the United States. And last month, after he was released from custody in the separate criminal case he is facing and then quickly rearrested, they originally said they were considering expelling him to Uganda.

But in a filing in immigration court in Baltimore linked to his asylum request, Trump administration officials seriously raised the idea that sending him back to El Salvador was also an option. They said that opening an asylum case would essentially nullify the earlier ruling that he could not be sent back to his home country.

“Should the Immigration Court grant the respondent’s motion to reopen, D.H.S. will pursue the respondent’s removal to El Salvador,” the Trump administration argued in its filing. It said the earlier ruling “will no longer be valid” if the asylum case moves forward.

The asylum request, which was filed in late August, was the latest twist in the legal cases surrounding Mr. Abrego Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who was deported in March to a notorious terrorism prison in El Salvador because of an administrative error. That removal, officials eventually acknowledged, violated a court ruling issued in 2019 that had expressly barred his being sent to the country where he feared his life could be in danger.

But since then, he has become a symbol of the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration tactics. U.S. officials insist he will never go free in the United States, while his attorneys accuse the administration of trying to make an example of him, regardless of the rule of law.

In its filing to the immigration court in Baltimore, Trump officials said that they would seek to overturn the decision barring Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador, claiming it was no longer valid.

When Mr. Abrego Garcia obtained that order, he had also applied for asylum. But while the immigration judge who considered his initial application found the asylum request to be “credible,” he pointed out that Mr. Abrego Garcia had not filed within a year of arriving in the United States as required under the law.

Since his arrest by immigration officials on Aug. 25, Mr. Abrego Garcia has been held in a detention center in Virginia. He is fighting the government’s efforts to expel him from the country again on two tracks — through his asylum request and through a separate civil case that would prevent officials from sending him to Uganda, a country to which he has no ties.

“The government’s campaign of retribution continues because Mr. Abrego refuses to be coerced into pleading guilty to a case that should never have been brought,” Sean Hecker, one of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers, said at the time of his arrest.

After his arrest, Homeland Security Department officials maintained that he would be removed from the United States.

“President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,” Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement.

The judge hearing the Uganda deportation case, Paula Xinis, has barred the administration from sending Mr. Abrego Garcia anywhere outside the United States for at least the next few months. Judge Xinis intends to hold a hearing on the possible expulsion to Uganda on Oct. 6 and issue a decision no more than 30 days later.

Even as he fights re-deportation, Mr. Abrego Garcia and his lawyers have been fending off the criminal charges that were brought against him in June in the Federal District Court in Nashville. Those charges, filed in coordination with his return from El Salvador, accuse him of having taken part in a conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States from 2016 until this year.

His attorneys deny those charges and say the government brought them only in a vindictive effort to punish him for having mounted a legal challenge against his initial deportation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/05dc-immig-qpct/05dc-immig-qpct-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 14:56:39.444142

Kennedy and HHS to link Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism - report

Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr plans to announce that use of Kenvue’s popular over-the-counter pain medication - Tylenol – in pregnant women is potentially linked to autism, without including evidence for the claims, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter.

Kennedy, in a report, will also suggest a medicine derived from folate called folinic acid can be used to treat symptoms of autism in some people, the WSJ reported.

Tylenol, whose active ingredient is acetaminophen, is a widely used pain reliever, including by pregnant women.

The report, expected this month from the US Department of Health and Human Services, is likely to highlight low levels of folate, an important vitamin, and Tylenol taken during pregnancy, as well as other potential causes of autism, the report said.

Both HHS and Kenvue did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

It is not the first time Kenvue or J&J have faced questions about the link between Tylenol and the condition. In 2023, a judge rejected claims the drug causes autism if mothers take it during pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says Tylenol is safe to use in pregnancy, though it recommends pregnant women consult with their doctors before using it, as with all medicines.

Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group formerly headed by Kennedy, has posted several times in recent weeks on social media site X about the potential link between Tylenol and autism.

Georgia to send National Guard troops to Washington

Georgia is about to become the eighth state to send National Guard troops to Washington, DC, to support Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement big foot operation there, as the US capital sues the administration over its actions.

Georgia governor Brian Kemp announced today that he’s sending 316 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington later this month, in the latest indication that Trump’s law enforcement action there will drag on, the Associated Press reports.

The Republican Kemp said he will mobilize the roughly 300 troops in mid-September to take part in Trump’s D.C. operation to relieve soldiers from elsewhere who deployed earlier.

Georgia is proud to stand with the Trump administration in its mission to ensure the security and beauty of our nation’s capital,” Kemp said in a statement.

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his unilateral action to impose federal resources on DC with the stated goal of cracking down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, seven other Republican-led states have sent troops — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.

The nationwide debate over gerrymandered redistricting has come to Kansas, as the Topeka Capital-Journal wrote on Thursday.

Republicans initiated efforts, on Donald Trump’s urging, to engineer mid-decade redistricting in Texas, to gerrymander district maps and gain an edge in next year’s midterm elections.

In Kansas, Democratic congresswomen Sharice Davids, who sits in the house with three Republicans to represent the state’s four seats in the lower chamber, could be in difficulty if the district map is gerrymandered by the GOP.

Davids spoke out on Friday, saying: “Under pressure from Donald Trump, Kansas state politicians are pushing an unprecedented mid-decade redraw to make the already gerrymandered maps even more extreme – breaking their promises and putting their own political power ahead of Kansans.”

She added: “Their goal is clear: stack the deck in their favor because they know their policies aren’t popular, including their disastrous budget that rips 79,000 Kansans off their health care just to give billionaires massive tax breaks. Voters, not politicians, should choose their representatives. This potential gerrymander is clearly political, threatens our democracy, and deepens division in our country.”

Donald Trump plans to announce executive orders today in the Oval Office, with the theme we know most about so far being an instruction to rename the Department of Defense the “Department of War”.

Trump was initially expected to issue first orders at 2pm ET then more at 4pm ET, but the media has since been informed that a single event at the White House is now due to take place at 4pm ET.

Some context from my colleague Hugo Lowell: The US president is expected to sign an executive order authorizing the rebrand of the Defense Department, the White House said, as part of an attempt to formalize a name change without an act of Congress.

The order will designate “Department of War” as a “secondary title”, an administration official said, as a way to get around the need for congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency.

But the order will instruct the rest of the executive branch to use the “Department of War” name in internal and external communications, and allows the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to use “secretary of war” as his official title.

Summary

Hello, US politics live blog readers, it’s another busy Friday and there is much more to come, so stay with the Guardian for all the relevant news as it happens. Here’s where things stand:

Most of the 475 people arrested in a massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid at a Hyundai factory construction site in southern Georgia are Korean nationals.

The federal Ice raid is being described as the biggest single Department of Homeland Security (DHS, the parent agency of Ice) enforcement operation at one side in the department’s history. The DHS was created after 9/11.

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank.

Vladimir Putin has said any western troops placed in Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for Russian strikes, upping the stakes for Kyiv as Donald Trump’s efforts to forge a peace deal show little sign that are any closer to success.

Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region. The action to send jets to be based in the US territory follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat that the administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers.

US jobs report. Our sister live blog run by the business team in London has closed now, so here’s our story on the big economics news of the day, that the US added just 22,000 jobs in August, continuing the slowdown amid Trump tariffs.

Reuters notes that the arrests could exacerbate tensions between Washington and Seoul, a key ally and investor in the US, as the countries remain at odds over the details of a trade deal that includes $350bn of investments.

Just last month, South Korea pledged $150bn in US investments – including $26bn from Hyundai Motor – at a summit for the nations’ leaders.

Homeland security officials said the workers it arrested at the Hyundai facility in Georgia were barred from working in the US after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas.

The investigation took place over several months, Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of investigations for Georgia, said during a press briefing.

“This was not an immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses,” he said in comments reported by Reuters.

Schrank said there was a network of subcontractors on the site.

A spokesperson at Hyundai’s battery joint venture partner, South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solutions, said in a statement it was cooperating and had paused construction work.

The facility, a joint venture between LGES and Hyundai Motor, was due to start operations at the end of this year, according to LGES.

Treasury secretary Bessent calls for 'entire' review of Fed

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent earlier called for renewed scrutiny of the Federal Reserve, including its power to set interest rates, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to exert control over the US central bank, whose insulation from short-term political pressures is widely seen as key to its effectiveness.

“There must also be an honest, independent, nonpartisan review of the entire institution, including monetary policy, regulation, communications, staffing and research,” Bessent wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

He called for the Fed to leave bank supervision to other governmental authorities and to “scale back the distortions it causes in the economy”, including by bond purchases made outside of true crisis conditions.

“This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,” the spokesperson said.

Trump administration will enforce foreign worker laws, White House says after Hyundai raid

Following on from my last post, the White House said today that the Trump administration will enforce laws that require foreign workers have proper authorization to be in the United States, after immigration authorities raided a Hyundai facility in Georgia.

“Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, quoted by Reuters.

“President Trump will continue delivering on his promise to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

Councilmember Bob Kettle, a military veteran and chair of the Public Safety Committee, said the city is working to address crime without help from Washington, D.C.

""We're up to 24 pieces of legislation."" Kettle said. ""The real time crime center, the CCTV, also the automatic license plate readers, they help system. This is making a difference for our city.""

Kettle, who criticized the Trump administration’s militarization of the National Guard in Los Angeles this summer — a move a judge struck down this week — called the federal tactics “junior varsity” compared to Seattle police.

“No face mask, no face coverings. They have to announce who they are … They don’t come in all dressed tactical, dressed with face coverings. That’s not law enforcement,” he said.

Council President Sara Nelson also criticized federal actions, saying they undermine Seattle’s approach to building trust in policing.

“Not on our watch will ICE agents undermine our efforts to ensure everyone in every community across our city feels safe,” she said in a statement this week.

RELATED: ICE arrests dip in July but remain high in Washington

Advocates with the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN) say they’ve tracked ICE arrests at hotspots such as 3rd Avenue and Pike Street in downtown Seattle, often involving agents in unmarked cars. They warn the activity is creating fear that keeps immigrants from working in both urban and rural communities.

“It’s terrible because we can’t do anything without them trying to do something,” said Naomi Bailey, a White Center coffee stall manager who said she feared for her freedom after witnessing an ICE arrest in a drive-through in July. “I mean, I almost got arrested just yelling at them.”

Kettle argued federal agencies should instead focus on cutting off the flow of drugs and weapons into the city along the I-5 corridor.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director.
“I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals.","Federal land managers have had a rough time implementing contentious plans to eliminate roughly 3,600 free-roaming horses from 2.1 million acres of southwest Wyoming, where private and public land are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern.

Although U.S. District Judge Kelly Rankin of Wyoming concluded last year that the Bureau of Land Management’s whole-herd removal plan is legal, his decision was appealed and roundups were postponed, and then in July the plan was declared at odds with the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The federal appellate judges out of Denver sent the case back to the Wyoming court to remedy legal deficiencies. The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.

But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.

“[T]he BLM Rock Springs Field Office still plans to proceed with the permanent removal of wild horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town Herd Areas, with operations expected to begin on or about Oct. 13, 2025,” Jacqueline Alderman, a spokesperson for the agency’s ​High Desert District, wrote in an email.

It remains unclear how the agency will address the three-judge panel’s concerns. “The BLM cannot comment on ongoing litigation,” Alderman wrote.

Pro-horse plaintiffs aim to stop the mid-October roundups from happening.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Adobe-Town-2-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 15:58:27.738301

Mexican nationals Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian; U.S. citizen Dianne Guadian; and Manuel Valenzuela, a lawful permanent resident residing in El Paso, were charged with conspiracy to transport aliens and bringing aliens to the United States for financial gain. According to the complaint, between on or about May 1 through Oct. 17, 2024, the defendants were part of an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought unaccompanied alien children between the ages of five and 13 illegally into the United States from Juarez, Mexico. The complaint alleges that Susana Guadian and Daniel Guadian recruited drivers to transport the children by car from Mexico to a port of entry at the U.S. border. The drivers and their co-conspirator would then present U.S. documents to inspecting officers falsely claiming the documents belonged to the children, and that they were the parents of the children. During at least one smuggling event, the alien children were given gummy candies containing marijuana to sedate them. One of the children was taken to a local hospital and later diagnosed with marijuana poisoning. Once inside the United States, the children were then transported to El Paso, where, according to the complaint, Dianne Guadian and Manuel Valenzuela would pick up the children and provide payment to the drivers. The drivers were paid $900 for each minor that they brought into the United States.

U.S. Border Patrol agents in Alpine arrested a Mexican national for being an illegal alien present in the United States. Ever Ortega-Uranga was previously removed for the second time in July 2021. Ortega-Uranga has multiple felony convictions, having been sentenced in Midland to two years confinement for cocaine possession in 2010, followed by three years for public order crimes in 2016. He was also sentenced in 2018 to 46 months confinement in Spring for illegal re-entry.

Otoniel Lopez-Tellez, a Mexican national, was taken into ICE custody in Williamson County, where he was serving a 40-day jail sentence for assault causing bodily injury to a family member. Lopez-Tellez has been removed from the U.S. twice, the last being in 2018, in addition to four voluntary returns.

Mexican national Juan Eduardo Villanueva-Mancilla was taken into ICE custody in Bastrop County, where he was serving a 180-day jail sentence for evading arrest with a vehicle. Villanueva-Mancilla has been removed from the U.S. twice, most recently in April 2023.

Angel Eduardo Moreno-De La Rosa was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents near Normandy on Aug. 27. The Mexican national was allegedly guiding two Pakistani illegal aliens to a pick-up location, where the two Pakistanis would then be transported to San Antonio. According to a criminal complaint, Moreno-De La Rosa claimed he would be paid $1,000 for his role, while the Pakistanis alleged that they paid around $30,000 each to be smuggled further into the U.S.

Mexican national Emanuel Ruiz-Alcantara was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 29 and charged with illegal re-entry after being previously removed to Mexico on Jan. 7. In August 2023, Ruiz-Alcantara was convicted for a smuggling of persons felony in Gonzalez, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail.

Cristian Jiovanni Chavez-Sanchez, also a Mexican national, was charged with illegal re-entry after he was arrested near Maverick on Aug. 26. Chavez-Sanchez has been twice deported, most recently in January through San Ysidro, California. In 2024, he was convicted of four misdemeanors in Utah, including a DUI, marijuana possession, and two weapon offenses.

Honduran national Brayan Alexander Villanueva was arrested near Val Verde on Aug. 30 and charged with illegal re-entry. Villanueva was just removed to Honduras through El Paso on June 28, after being convicted and sentenced in March to two years confinement for possession of a controlled substance. Villanueva was also convicted in 2022 for burglary of a vehicle in Georgetown.

Also in the Del Rio Sector, four Indian nationals—Vikash Vikash, Mehakpreet Singh, Aditya Sharma, and Harsh Singh—were each detained in separate incidents and charged with improper entry after they allegedly crossed the Rio Grande River into the U.S. near Eagle Pass between Aug. 28 and Aug. 30.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States.","Federal and immigration agents arrested 475 people while executing a judicial search warrant at a Hyundai facility in Georgia as part of a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.

Everyone arrested, most of them South Korean nationals, were ""illegally present in the United States or in violation of their presence in the United States, working unlawfully,"" Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, said at a news conference Friday morning.

It was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, Schrank said, adding it “underscores our commitment to jobs for Georgians and Americans.""

A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.

Videos on social media showed agents lining up hundreds of workers at the construction site. Schrank said they questioned everyone about their immigration status, reviewing their documents and conducting background checks.

""This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multimonth criminal investigation,"" Schranck said.

No criminal charges in connection to the investigation had been filed as of Friday.

On Friday afternoon, a judge in the Southern District Court of Georgia unsealed the 15-page search warrant allowing federal agents to go into “the lithium battery cell manufacturing plant” on the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America campus “that is currently under construction.”

The warrant authorized federal agents to seize employment records and immigration documents as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site.

According to the warrant, authorities were also looking for four individuals, but the reasons why the federal government was specifically interested in them remains under seal.

U.S. Attorney Margaret E. Heap said in a statement that more than 400 agents participated in the massive enforcement action, which is part of the broader nationwide initiative “Operation Take Back America,” described as an effort “to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations.”

The South Korean government responded to the detentions of many of their nationals in a statement Friday.

“In the course of U.S. law enforcement, the economic activities of our investment firms and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed upon,"" said Lee Jae-woong, a spokesperson for South Korea's foreign ministry. ""We conveyed our concern and regret to the U.S. Embassy today and urged them to take special care to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of our nationals are not violated.”

Jae-woong added that an on-site task force will be established in Georgia with the help of the South Korean consulate in Atlanta.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News that President Donald Trump remains committed ""to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

“The United States is proud to be a home for major investments and looks forward to continuing to build on these historic investments and partnerships that President Trump has secured,"" Jackson said in a statement. ""Any foreign workers brought in for specific projects must enter the United States legally and with proper work authorizations.""

A Hyundai spokesperson told NBC News in a statement Friday that the company is ""closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances.""

""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate,” the statement reads.

An LG Energy Solution spokesperson also said in a statement that they “are closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.""

""Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the statement reads.

According to Schrank, the workers arrested at the construction site were employed by a network of various contractors and subcontractors, which investigators are looking into.

They all remain in ICE custody after most were brought to the Folkston immigration processing center in Georgia following their arrests, Shrank said.

South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy, is a major automotive and electronics manufacturer whose companies have multiple plants in the United States. In July, Seoul pledged $350 billion in U.S. investment in an effort to lower Trump’s threatened tariffs on its products, which he ended up setting at 15%.

In March, Hyundai said it would invest $21 billion in U.S. onshoring from 2025 to 2028, a number it said last month had increased to $26 billion.

It said the initiatives involved in the investment — including a new $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana, expanded U.S. auto production capacity and a state-of-the-art robotics facility — were expected to create about 25,000 direct jobs in the U.S. over the next four years.

Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Georgia, where the raided construction site stands, is one of the largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites in the state.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have said that the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,400 people, is the largest economic development project in the state’s history.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250905-Hyundai-atf-raid-2-se-1056-7a0c39.jpg",N,,2025-09-05 16:57:13.120164

UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.” “For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk.
Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.
“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns.
“This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”","The U.S. State Department is facing heavy criticism after it announced on Thursday it is imposing sanctions on three major Palestinian human rights groups over their participation in the International Criminal Court’s case (ICC) against top Israeli officials.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he’s adding Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) to the list of “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,” as part of President Donald Trump’s executive order sanctioning the ICC.

The three groups are leading human rights organizations in the occupied Palestinian territories, operating out of the West Bank and Gaza. They have been instrumental in monitoring Israel’s genocide in Gaza and annexation of the West Bank, serving as a key voice of Palestinians amid Israel’s assaults. Sanctions could have a vast chilling effect on their work.

“These entities have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent,” Rubio said. “We oppose the ICC’s politicized agenda, overreach, and disregard for the sovereignty of the United States and that of our allies.”

The groups decried the sanctions in a joint statement calling on states to pressure the U.S. to lift the sanctions. They noted that this is part of a longtime effort by Israel to silence Palestinian voices, by law or by force.

“Threatened by the impact and role of our advocacy, legal research, and documentation in exposing Israel’s ongoing international crimes, the United States has resorted to punishing individuals and organisations seeking to uphold the legal system upon which the international community was founded,” the groups said.

“The implications go beyond Palestine: by protecting Israel from accountability, they are dismantling the international legal order and undermining the possibility of justice for victims of grave crimes anywhere,” the groups went on. “But we will not give up nor be silenced. We will not bend to any State apparatus or system fuelled by violence and oppression.”

The sanctions come after the U.S. sanctioned another Palestinian human rights group, Addameer, which focuses on Palestinian prisoners’ rights, and UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese.

Rubio’s announcement was widely condemned. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement that the sanctions are “completely unacceptable.”

“For decades now, these NGOs have been performing vital human rights work, particularly on accountability for human rights violations,” said Türk. “The work of civil society in documenting violations and engaging with international accountability mechanisms is all the more important when international humanitarian and human rights laws are being violated systematically in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.”

A coalition of Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, including major organizations like B’Tselem, called the sanctions “violent.”

“This is yet another move aimed at erasing fundamental norms of protecting human beings, designed to enable Israel to continue harming Palestinians without restraint,” the coalition said.

Other major international human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also denounced the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration’s decision to impose sanctions against three prominent Palestinian human rights organizations is a deeply troubling and shameful assault on human rights and the global pursuit of justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for Research, Advocacy, Policy and Campaigns. “This appalling move constitutes a brazen attack on the entire Palestinian human rights movement, and a callous attempt to fracture and weaken the whole global human rights community.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025_09-05-marco-rubio.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 16:57:01.379000

Mbayo is a former high-ranking member of the National Provisioning Ruling Council, a military junta that ruled Sierra Leone after overthrowing President Joseph Momoh in a coup on April 29, 1992.

Following the coup, the National Provisioning Ruling Council struggled to control Sierra Leone against invasion from the Revolutionary United Front, and news of coup plots spread across the capital of Freetown. On Dec. 29, 1992, the National Provisioning Ruling Council extrajudicially killed approximately 29 victims, including former government officials and others accused of planning a coup against the regime. Victims who were not already detained in prison were arrested; several were tortured, and all were summarily executed and their bodies buried in a mass grave.

Following several changes in government, Mbayo entered the United States on Jan. 9, 1998, on an F-1 student visa. He later applied to become a permanent resident, but his application was denied in July 2023.

“Our officers continue to effect the removal of alleged human rights violators to their home country,” said ERO Detroit Field Office Director Kevin Raycraft. “ERO officers are committed to public safety and national security and removing this individual from the United States serves both those priorities.”

Mbayo has been in ICE custody since ICE Homeland Security Investigations arrested him on June 30, 2025.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump has initiated a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, acting on his campaign promise to enact the largest mass deportation of such persons in U.S. history.

Immigrants in the country with both legal and illegal residency have been caught up in the crackdown, raising concerns about the scope and impact of the initiative.

Such impacts include several negative effects on the economy, such as the overall monetary and labor cost of the deportation, with documented and undocumented immigrants making up around 20 percent of the U.S. workforce at the start of the year. That number has dropped to 19 percent by June, representing a decline of more than 750,000 workers, according to the Pew Research Center.

What To Know

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Atlanta office participated in the raid, which included Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Georgia State Patrol (GSP), and other partner agencies.

Troopers blocked the roads leading to the Hyundai site, and operations at the plant continued without interruption, according to CBS News.

In an emailed statement to Newsweek, a Hyundai spokesperson said, ""We are aware of the recent incident at the HL-GA Battery Company construction site in Bryan County, Georgia.""

""We are closely monitoring the situation and working to understand the specific circumstances,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company. We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.""

The company has made significant investments in the U.S. in recent years, including in Georgia, where it is building facilities related to electric vehicle and battery production.

Hyundai Motor Group started producing EVs a year ago at its $7.6 billion plant, which employs roughly 1,200 workers.

What People Are Saying

A Department of Homeland Security official told Newsweek: ""ICE Homeland Security Investigations, in coordination with our law enforcement partners, executed a judicial search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy, and protecting workers from exploitation,"" the spokesperson said. ""This investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law.

""Complex cases like this require strong collaboration and extensive investigative efforts, and we extend our gratitude to the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, FBI, DEA, Customs and Border Protection, ATF, IRS, and the Georgia State Patrol for their invaluable support,"" the spokesperson added.

ATF Atlanta wrote on X: ""Today, [ATF Atlanta] joined HSI, FBI, DEA, ICE, GSP and other agencies in a major immigration enforcement operation at the Hyundai mega site battery plant in Bryan County, GA, leading to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.""

""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades.","Protesters Friday morning will gather outside an ICE facility in west suburban Broadview, calling for its closure after the village said it would be used as a processing center for a ""large-scale"" immigration enforcement campaign led by the Trump administration.

The protest, from groups citing the Illinois Way Forward Act, are expected to gather as early as 7 a.m. Days earlier, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village's roughly 8,000 residents that federal officials said the two-story building, at 1930 Beach St., will be used for the operation for approximately 45 days.

The letter also warned residents that protests and demonstrations near the building, ""like those seen earlier this year in Los Angeles, where property damage and assaults against law enforcement were reported,"" could occur.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,"" village administrator LeTisa Jones told the Associated Press. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

As of 7:15 a.m., several protesters had begun to gather in front of the center, with more arriving as the morning went on, some with signs, and a small police presence.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

ICE stationed in Lake County

According to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, increased ICE enforcement in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs could begin as early as this weekend.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said during a press conference Tuesday. ""Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago.""

At least 300 federal agents expected to come to the Great Lakes Naval Base in North Chicago as part of the Trump Administration's enhanced operations from ICE, Customs and Border Patrol and the Department of Homeland Security, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said.

A joint statement from the Lake County Government and the City of North Chicago Wednesday called the planned federal operations at the Naval Station ""unprecedented.""

""If the agents are stationed here in Lake County and they say they're going to be in Chicago, who's to say they won't come in to our community?,"" Rockingham Jr. said, who added that the community is approximately 40 percent Latino.

During his Tuesday press conference, Pritzker also said he was ""deeply concerned"" that ICE will target Mexican Independence Day.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

In Chicago, organizers with El Grito, a popular Mexican Independence Day event slated for Sept. 13 and 14 in Grant Park, moved to cancel the festival due to the concerns.

""This was a painful decision; however, with the heightened political tensions and given our location in downtown Chicago, we need to keep our community safe,"" organizer German Gonzalez said in a statement Thursday. ""To proceed in spite of the advice we've received directly from city and state officials and potentially expose our community to becoming collateral damage would be irresponsible. That's a risk we are not willing to take.""

A similar festival in Waukegan was also postponed until November over fears of the increased ICE presence.

Pritzker said agents could be fully assembled by Friday, with operations beginning Saturday, though his office hasn't received official communication from the White House.

Last week, a report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Mayor Rockingham said the agents will not be staying at the base, and will be housed at hotels in Lake County.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/Image-from-iOS-11.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:44.433524

Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and the looming Chicago deployment have faced criticism and legal challenges from law experts, officials and residents.","Officials in the US city of Chicago were bracing for a possible deployment of the United States National Guard on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump’s wider crackdown on crime and immigration – notably, many point out, in Democratic strongholds.

Last week, CNN, citing unnamed officials, reported that the controversial military deployment could take place by Friday and that the National Guard might be ready to patrol the city on Saturday.

At the same time, a major federal immigration operation involving officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is also expected to begin in the city.

Last Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, claimed the Trump administration had not informed him of the deployment plans, and that such a move would amount to an “invasion” of the state.

On Saturday last week, Chicago’s Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing Chicago police not to collaborate with National Guard troops or federal agents. The order also urged federal agents to wear body cameras and reveal their faces rather than wear masks, as they have done during previous, “military-style” immigration raids under Trump.

Trump deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles in June, and in Washington, DC, in August, purportedly to fight surging crime rates, but residents and state officials have complained that such moves are undemocratic and say that over-policing will erase trust between local police and communities.

What is the National Guard?

The National Guard is a state-based reserve force totalling 430,040 soldiers and airmen who are serving part-time, rather than full-time. It includes the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard units. National Guard members often hold a civilian job in addition to their military duties.

Each US state and entity has its own National Guard unit, and all together make up the US National Guard. The Guard can be activated for federal missions, such as under Trump’s recent directives, meaning it is dually-controlled by states and the federal government.

The National Guard’s origins go back to colonial-era militias that formed during British rule, with the first colony-wide militia forming in Massachusetts in 1636. Those militias later evolved into an organised, national structure following US independence.

What happened in Los Angeles?

In June, Trump deployed nearly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to Los Angeles to quell public protests against ICE raids. California Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as “political theatre”.

A court ruled on Tuesday that the deployment was illegal. It was the first time since 1965 that a president had federalised National Guard troops to address unrest in a state without a governor’s permission. President Lyndon B Johnson, at the time, sent troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect civil rights protesters from violence.

What happened in Washington, DC?

On August 12, Trump announced at a White House press conference that he was temporarily taking control of Washington, DC’s Metropolitan Police Department under Section 740 of the rarely invoked District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows federal control of police during an emergency.

Government officials said the DC force would be in place till November, according to a report on Thursday from ABC News.

Trump additionally deployed 800 National Guard troops to the city to “rescue” it from what he said was a crime and homelessness surge.

“I’m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,” Trump said in his announcement. “This is Liberation Day in DC, and we’re going to take our capital back.”

Trump has also said that his administration will seek the death penalty for murder cases in the city.

Washington, DC, is classified as a unique federal district and is a Democratic stronghold. As US president, Trump has direct control over the District of Columbia National Guard and can use the DC police force for 48 hours, or up to 30 days if he notifies Congress. However, Congress has not been formally notified of the recent moves.

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser initially criticised the deployment, describing it as “unsettling and unprecedented” on August 11. She added that although violent crime had spiked in the city in 2023, recent data shows crime rates have been falling and that violent crime is at a 30-year low.

Bowser has since tried to cooperate with federal agents by setting up an operations centre to coordinate communications between federal agencies and local law enforcement. The centre was established under Bowser’s “Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center” (SBEOC), which is a play on Trump’s lingo.

One of the centre’s tasks is to ensure federal agents maintain policing practices that instil confidence in residents, such as not wearing masks, identifying their agencies and providing identification when interacting with people.

Despite that, on August 27, Bowser told reporters that there was a “break in trust” between communities and the police due to the presence of federal agents who wore masks and were not always identifiable. Bowser said she was “devastated” because some residents in the city said they were living in fear.

Why does Trump say it is necessary to deploy troops to cities?

Trump has argued that it is essential to combat crime in Los Angeles, DC and other cities. Despite widespread criticism and legal challenges, he has defended his decision, saying some troublemakers have to be handled by soldiers.

“Frankly, they were born to be criminals,” Trump said on Wednesday, when he confirmed the Chicago deployment would happen but did not give dates. “And they’re tough and mean, and they’ll cut your throat, and they won’t even think about it the next day. They won’t even remember that they did it. And we’re not going to have those people.”

The president has also pointed to what he says are the positive results from the DC federal takeover. Speaking at a conference on Tuesday, Trump said the city was now safe and that restaurants were enjoying booming businesses.

“We have no crime,” Trump said. “You’re not going to be shot.”

Republican lawmakers have backed Trump’s actions, especially in DC, where some are proposing a “Make Our Streets Safe Again Act” to target crime and address homelessness.

“President Trump’s unyielding leadership and strength, coupled with proper congressional oversight, ensures that Washington, DC, will reclaim its rightful place,” US Representative Harriet Hageman, a Republican, said at a news conference on Tuesday.

Where else has Trump threatened to deploy the National Guard?

Trump and officials from his administration have floated possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Democratic-led cities including Chicago, Baltimore, Boston and New York.

On Tuesday, Trump stated at a conference that he has “an obligation to protect this country, and that includes Baltimore”.

On August 22, he told reporters in the Oval Office that “Chicago is a mess”, and that his administration “will help with New York”.

The day before, ICE’s acting director said agents would “flood” Boston to remove immigrants in the so-called “sanctuary city”, referring to municipalities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration issues.

Officials in Baltimore and Chicago, meanwhile, insist that crime rates have fallen in their cities.

In July, Baltimore’s police department said there had been a significant drop in gun violence compared to last year. The city’s Mayor Brandon Scott also told reporters on Monday that by September 1, 2025, 91 homicides and 218 non-fatal shootings were recorded. He said it was the lowest yearly homicide rate in over 50 years.

Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said at a conference that overall crime rates had fallen in the city by 21 percent. “We will not have our police officers, who are working hard every single day to drive down crime, deputise to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” he said.

How bad is crime in Chicago?

With a population of 2.7 million, Chicago has long had a national reputation linked with high crime rates, particularly gun violence. Legal experts say that reputation has some basis, but that crime rates are not unconnected to the era of racial segregation.

In reality, however, crime rates in Chicago vary depending on the crime type, and generally mirror those in other major cities, according to analysis by CBS News, which cited data from the Chicago Police and the FBI.

Last year, the city had 18,327 reported cases of violent crime, which translates to 695 per 100,000 people. In comparison, Oakland had 1,925 cases per 100,000; Detroit, 1,781; Little Rock, 1,672; and Baltimore, 1,606. Houston, which has a smaller population of 2.3 million, recorded a total of 26,628 violent crimes or 1,148 crimes per 100,000.

According to data from the DC-based Council on Criminal Justice (CJC), Chicago did see a 369 percent [nearly fivefold] increase in violent crime, property and drug offences between 2019 and 2023, driven mainly by a surge in vehicle thefts that was recorded in several other large cities in the same period. Many US cities similarly recorded high crime rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More recently, the CCJ reported that overall crime in Chicago by June 2025 was down compared to 2024.

In a year-on-year analysis, the CCJ noted that violent crimes such as homicides had reduced by 33 percent compared to last year. Aggravated assaults fell by 16 percent, gun assaults by 27 percent, robberies by 35 percent, carjacking by 51 percent and domestic violence by 10 percent.

An exception to the downward trend was sexual assault cases, which only reduced by one percent between June 2024 and June 2025.

What do critics of Trump’s hardline approach say?

Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and the looming Chicago deployment have faced criticism and legal challenges from law experts, officials and residents. Some say it constitutes the formation of a “police state”, the sidelining of state authorities, and overreach. Others say it is over-policing that could have an adverse impact on relations between communities and local law enforcement.

“This is an active military takeover of the capital,” protesters who assembled outside Congress in DC on Thursday wrote in an open letter to lawmakers, which they handed out.

“It is a textbook indicator of backsliding democracy and intensifying authoritarianism … This might come off as alarmist, but in the last 100 years of history, the pattern is clear and we are witnessing it in real time,” the letter stated.

California Governor Gavin Newsom and the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta have also argued that Trump’s decision to deploy federal military agents violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.

This week, US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Los Angeles deployment was unprecedented, an overstep of presidential authority, and ultimately, illegal. The case had been filed in June by the state of California.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer wrote, referring to Trump’s insistence that the anti-immigration-raid protests constituted a “rebellion” that needed to be quashed.

“Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law,” Breyer wrote in his judgement.

“Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act willfully,” Breyer wrote of the Trump administration, adding that the troops deployed failed to adhere to their training materials by carrying out 12 functions that the military is barred from, such as making arrests, carrying out searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_68b36cb776b3-1756589239.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:26.734962

What they're saying:

""They are insulting the service and the honor and integrity with which my husband has served this country and broken his body in that service,"" said Melissa Chaudhry, wife of Zahid Chaudhry.

She says DHS' latest press release reads ""like a political hit job"" and is a ""smear campaign"" against her husband who was at an appointment to get U.S. citizenship when he was detained by ICE.

Melissa Chaudhry is disgusted with what she says is DHS's ""cherry picked information"" about her husband's past in Australia and his service in the United States Army.

""[Zahid] was activated for Operation Iraqi Freedom and when you're a solider, you are under orders to go where you're told,"" said Melissa. ""He was ordered to go for Iraqi Freedom to Germany and other places within the United States for training; it was during that training to be deployed that he was injured,"" said Melissa.

She says as her husband's 9th circuit appeals moves through the court system, his children cry for him as he remains locked up at the Northwest Ice Processing Center in Tacoma.

""[Zahid] is sick. He is deprived of medication for his thyroid, for the burning in his chest that keeps him up day and night,"" said Melissa. ""He's kept in conditions that qualify as animal abuse if they were inflicted on pets.""

The Council on American-Islamic Relations - Washington (CAIR - WA) released this statement to FOX 13 Seattle:

""We’ve seen a pattern of DHS under this administration engaging in smear tactics to high profile detainees, in order to shore up public opinion to back up their aggressive decisions. There is no need for the Department of Homeland Security to target Mr. Chaudhry’s personal life, especially while he is detained and separated from his family. Every person deserves dignity.""

Micaela Romero, a Digital Organizer and Communication Associate with the Washington Community Action Network (WACAN) sent this statement in response to DHS' press release:

""I am appalled and disgusted by this baseless ""rebuttal"" to our community’s unrest, heartache, and attacks on our family members and loved ones. We’ve known Zahid as a member of WashingtonCAN for over 10 years, and in that time, and since his detainment, we have encountered hundreds of individuals with stories of how Zahid has impacted their lives and been a public servant to their communities. As we continue to show up in our other issue areas, people recognize us as being the organization fighting to bring their loved one and community member, Muhammad ""Zahid"" Chaudhry, home.

""It is on the duty of this administration to do a far better job than they’ve done to prove that Zahid Chaudhry is a worst fraudster and criminal than the Commander in Chief that sits at the helm of these cruel decisions tearing apart families. The community is tired of these deceptive attack on immigrants to silence the tangible gaps left when ICE abducts fathers from their children.""

Melissa is urging supporters to reach out to elected leaders about her husband Zahid.

""Call out this beginning of a Gestapo that is forming in this country — that is ICE agents with very little oversight coming out with masks and grabbing people either off the street or out of their immigration hearings when they are complying with the rules,"" said Melissa.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress.","The recent release of 1,800 internal budget documents shows just how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to illegally withhold or restrict funding. The documents detail how the Trump Administration has abused its authority by adding new layers of political interference and control over agency spending to impose its policy priorities and preferences, even when doing so conflicts with the law.

Until a court intervened, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had been illegally hiding agency “apportionments” — a crucial aspect of financial management whereby OMB grants agencies access to the funds appropriated in statute — actively and intentionally frustrating Congress’s ability to provide oversight over the Administration’s compliance with spending laws. Yet an apportionment is meant to be a routine plan for agencies’ use of funding intended to ensure that the federal government does not violate the restrictions on spending established in law.

Though delaying the spending of lawfully provided funds for policy reasons is illegal, the Trump Administration has seemingly sought to do so through three tactics. First, it is delaying apportionment approvals well past when they are required by law, or withholding them altogether. Second, it is establishing further conditions for an agency’s actual receipt of funds that are hidden from public view. Third, it is designating significant funding amounts as “unallocated” — apparently making it unavailable for agency use for the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement between OMB and the agency. In each instance, it is creating an opportunity for abuse that the public disclosure of apportionments was meant to prevent.

Congress gave OMB the power to apportion funds for good reasons: to ensure that spending laws are faithfully followed and that agencies do not overspend the resources available to them and prematurely run out of funding. Congress voted on a bipartisan basis to require these apportionments be made public after President Trump used the apportionment process to illegally withhold military assistance intended for Ukraine during his first term.

With the documents’ recent release, we do not yet know the depth to which the Trump Administration abused the apportionment process, or the full scope of the effects on programs — and people. But what we have seen is more troubling evidence of its efforts to illegally “impound” — not spend — the funds Congress provided.

To take just one example, the Administration leveraged its apportionment power in its effort to illegally withhold billions of dollars in National Institutes of Health (NIH) support for medical breakthroughs and treatments in cancer, diabetes, and other critical health research fields (see “Apportionment as a Tool of Impoundment: NIH as a Case Study” below).

Similarly, it abused its apportionment power to illegally freeze Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support for public health programs until late into the fiscal year, when the funds would be at risk of going unused. With these types of abuses, the Trump Administration has ignored Congress and the law to undermine critical programs that people count on.

Delaying Apportionment Approvals

The Trump Administration is waiting longer than in past administrations to apportion funds for certain programs to delay obligations. Although apportionment plans must be approved within 30 days of enactment of appropriations, OMB consistently provided approvals much later in 2025. For instance, in 2024 OMB approved over 100 apportionments for Department of Health and Human Service accounts in the 30 days following the enactment of full-year appropriations, compared with fewer than ten over the same period in 2025.

The Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, designed to generate economic growth and opportunity in some of the nation's most distressed communities, has faced an enormous delay in gaining access to the funds provided by Congress in March. The Trump Administration only apportioned funds for the administration of the CDFI program on July 30 — more than four months after full-year appropriations had been enacted — and still has not apportioned the funds for making awards. By comparison, in 2024, those funds were apportioned roughly two weeks after the funds were appropriated.

Notably, the July 2025 apportionment of CDFI’s administrative funds came the day after 26 senators sent a bipartisan letter to OMB expressing concern over delays in making awards. That the Trump Administration has proposed severe cuts to the CDFI Fund for 2026 raises the clear possibility that its actions to illegally restrict congressionally provided support in 2025 through the apportionment process are an effort to unilaterally advance its desired policies despite the funding enacted into law.

Requiring Agency Spending Plans

OMB also conditioned many apportionments on its approval of a separate “agreed-upon spending plan” with the agency, above and beyond approval of the apportionment itself. These requirements can be found in over 100 apportionments approved by the Trump Administration between March and August of 2025, which affect at least six cabinet departments, as well as the Social Security Administration and other smaller agencies. Similar requirements — conditioning the availability of funds on OMB approval of an agency spending plan — have been used only rarely in prior administrations.

Further, in over half of those more than one hundred instances, OMB explicitly required the agency to provide a “detailed description” of how the spending plan “aligns with Administration priorities,” illegally delaying funds from being used for the purposes established in law in order to effectuate the Administration’s own spending priorities. In some cases, OMB laid out in the apportionment the minimal purposes for which it would allow an agency to spend funds in the absence of an approved spending plan — making clear that approval of the spending plan had not yet been given at the time an apportionment was approved.

With no transparency about what was required for a spending plan to meet OMB approval, the process is ripe for abuse and misuse. The Administration’s approach provides no way for the public to know if the information being required of agencies is merely an excuse to delay making funding available, or if agencies are required to give other unrelated policy assurances to OMB to gain access to their statutorily provided funds. It is at least possible that approval of some spending plans was conditioned on agencies providing assurances that they would not fully spend some portion of the lawfully provided funding. Arguably, given that the apportioned funds cannot be made available until these “agreed-upon” spending plans were approved, the plans themselves constitute “documents apportioning an appropriation,” which OMB is required to make publicly available under the law.

In the case of funding for the CDC’s public health programs targeting health promotion and chronic disease and injury prevention, no apportionment was received until July 29. But even worse, the apportionment stated that CDC could only “continue to make obligations for salaries and related administrative expenses” until OMB approved its spending plan, suggesting that had not yet occurred. This was confirmed in reporting on August 1 that CDC awards continued to be frozen, with an OMB spokesperson saying that “the CDC money is undergoing a programmatic review because the office is still waiting on CDC’s spending plan.” Thus, CDC still could not make awards with two months remaining in the fiscal year, leaving it unclear whether CDC can responsibly award all its lawfully provided funding before the September 30 deadline at the end of the fiscal year.

Using “Unallocated” Accounts

Finally, in at least a handful of instances, the Trump Administration apportioned significant funds as “unallocated” — apparently making them unavailable for use to execute the purposes Congress outlined in law, pending some later agreement — in accounts where that is uncommon, if not unprecedented. For example, at the Department of Education, over $600 million in Innovation and Improvement funds and roughly $500 million in Institute of Education Sciences funds were, and remain, apportioned as “unallocated.” The Trump Administration has proposed significant budget cuts for both in 2026. Further, apportionment footnotes reveal OMB plans to “automatically” re-apportion these unallocated funds once OMB agrees to their planned use — meaning that whether these impounded funds are ever released, or the purpose to which they are to be put if released, may remain hidden until after the fiscal year ends.

The apportionment data the Administration tried to illegally hide, and was ultimately forced to divulge, reinforces that the Trump Administration acted with the intention of illegally delaying and restricting funds lawfully provided by Congress. But it will take some time for auditors, Congress, public interest groups, and reporters to comb through all the recently released documents to fully understand the extent to which the Trump Administration has been abusing the apportionment process to advance its policy goals and aid in its illegal impoundments.

""No matter what I said, ChatGPT was gentle, caring and affirmative. No, I hadn’t done anything wrong. But in a separate conversation with a new 'Harry,' I flipped the roles. Rather than being the depressed ex-girlfriend, I roleplayed as an ex-boyfriend in a similar situation.""

Goldberg's finding? Unlike a real therapist, it refused to critique or investigate her behavior — regardless of which perspective she shared or what she said. It's evidence of how easy we can slip into “AI psychosis” — which isn’t a medical term, but is an evolving descriptor for AI’s impact on individuals vulnerable to paranoid or delusional thinking, such as those who have or are starting to develop a mental health condition.

Now, a handful of residents are coming together to push for change in local immigration policy.

The Proposal

Verónica Martínez is one of the latest to join Cleveland Heights for Immigrant Rights – a grassroots movement that wants city council to pass a nine-page resolution. The proposal includes a $200,000 pilot program for providing free legal counsel over the next two years. It is one of several of their demands.

“The other points are also very important,” Martínez said. ""One of them asks for the respect of the human rights that are in the Constitution.”

Her family is from Mexico and has been living in Cleveland Heights for nearly two years. Martínez said, for her, this project is personal.

“This country could not have been built without those brave people who were our predecessors and who were also here building and collaborating for this country,” Martínez said. “... It is very significant for us now to raise our voices for all those who cannot do so today.”

Karly Whitaker also joined the movement following the Cilantro ICE arrests. She’s taken on canvassing local businesses for support.

“We got over 70 businesses in our community that signed that pledge and then expressed some interest in ‘Know Your Rights’ training,” she said.

Following ICE arrests

Cilantro Taqueria said three of their workers who were detained in February self-deported while others are still in the process of obtaining citizenship.

Martínez said she has close connection to several of the restaurant workers, including one young, single mother. In her address to Cleveland Heights city officials, Martínez said the mother was released by ICE officers after discovering she had an 11-month-old baby.

“The people who were caring for her baby, frightened by what had happened, no longer wanted to care for him, so she was practically forced to flee. Today we do not know her whereabouts,” she said.

Looking Forward

The movement has received support from several councilmembers, Whitaker said, but, they’re hoping to create solidarity across the entire community.

“Our motto is, I believe, “all are welcome,” Whitaker said. “And like, it should be a community that embraces that diversity and make sure that all feel welcome and safe.”

Still, Martínez said, presenting the proposal is only the beginning of their fight.

“Our plans for the future it is to continue gathering, to continue uniting and to continue working,,” Martínez said. “We’re going to continue preparing people so they know their rights.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/cilantro-folo-main-photo,N,,2025-09-05 11:58:30.095364

“There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.” Immigrants' Medicaid under attack National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The Trump administration is taking its immigration crackdown to the health care safety net, launching Medicaid spending probes in at least six Democratic-led states that provide comprehensive health coverage to poor and disabled immigrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is scouring payments covering health care for immigrants without legal status to ensure there isn’t any waste, fraud or abuse, according to public records obtained by KFF Health News and The Associated Press. While acknowledging that states can bill the federal government for Medicaid emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status, federal officials have sent letters notifying state health agencies in California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington that they are reviewing federal and state payments for medical services, such as prescription drugs and specialty care.

The federal agency told the states it is reviewing claims as part of its commitment to maintain Medicaid’s fiscal integrity. California is the biggest target after the state self-reported overcharging the federal government for health care services delivered to immigrants without legal status, determined to be at least $500 million, spurring the threat of a lawsuit.

“If CMS determines that California is using federal money to pay for or subsidize healthcare for individuals without a satisfactory immigration status for which federal funding is prohibited by law,” according to a letter dated March 18, “CMS will diligently pursue all available enforcement strategies, including, consistent with applicable law, reductions in federal financial participation and possible referrals to the Attorney General of the United States for possible lawsuit against California.”

The investigations come as the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress slashed taxpayer spending on immigrant health care through cuts in President Donald Trump’s spending-and-tax law passed this summer. The administration is also pushing people living in the U.S. illegally off Medicaid rolls. Health policy experts say these moves could hamper care and leave safety net hospitals, clinics and other providers financially vulnerable. Some Democratic-led states — California, Illinois and Minnesota — have already had to end or slim down their Medicaid programs for immigrants due to ballooning costs. Colorado is also considering cuts due to cost overruns.

At the same time, 20 states are pushing back on Trump’s immigration crackdown by suing the administration for handing over Medicaid data on millions of enrollees to deportation officials. A federal judge temporarily halted the move. California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, who led that challenge, says the Trump administration is launching a political attack on states that embrace immigrants in Medicaid programs.

“The whole idea that there’s waste, fraud and abuse is contrived,” Bonta said. “It’s manufactured. It’s invented. It’s a catchall phrase that they use to justify their predetermined anti-immigrant agenda.”

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

The Trump administration appears to be targeting only states with full Medicaid coverage for both kids and adults without legal status. Utah, Massachusetts and Connecticut, which provide Medicaid coverage only to immigrant children, have not received letters, for instance. CMS declined to provide a full list of states it is targeting.

Federal officials say it is their legal right and responsibility to scrutinize states for misspending on immigrant health coverage and are taking “decisive action to stop that.”

“It is a matter of national concern that some states have pushed the boundaries of Medicaid law to offer extensive benefits to individuals unlawfully present in the United States,” CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said about the agency’s probe of selected states. The oversight is intended to “ensure federal funds are reserved for legally eligible individuals, not for political experiments that violate the law,” she said.

Health policy researchers and economists say providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants for preventive services and treatment of chronic health conditions staves off more costly care for patients down the road. It also tamps down insurance premium increases and the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals and clinics.

Francisco Silva, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association, said the Trump administration is threatening to drive up health care costs and make it more difficult to access care.

“The impact is emergency rooms would get so crowded that ambulances have to be diverted away and people in a real emergency can’t get into the hospital, and public health threats like disease outbreaks,” Silva said.

California has taken a health-care-for-all approach, providing coverage to 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. The expansion, which was rolled out from 2016 to 2024, is estimated to cost $12.4 billion this year. Of that, $1.3 billion is paid by the federal government for emergency and pregnancy-related care.

As California rolled out its expansion, the state erroneously billed the federal government for care provided to immigrants without legal status — details that have not previously been reported and that former state officials shared with KFF Health News and the AP. The state improperly billed for services such as mental health and addiction services, prescription drugs and dental care.

Jacey Cooper, who served as California’s Medicaid director from 2020 to 2023, said she discovered the error and reported it to federal regulators. Cooper said the state had been working to pay back at least $500 million identified by the federal government.

“Once I identified the problem, I thought it was really important to report it and we did,” Cooper said. “We take waste, fraud and abuse very seriously.”

It’s not clear whether that money has been repaid. The state’s Medicaid agency says it does not know how CMS calculated the overpayments or “what is included in that amount, what time period it covers, and if or when it was collected,” said spokesperson Tony Cava.

California has an enormously complicated Medicaid program: It serves the largest population in the nation — nearly 15 million people — with a budget of nearly $200 billion this fiscal year.

Matt Salo, a national Medicaid expert, said these types of mistakes happen in states throughout the country because the program is rife with overlapping federal and state rules. Salo and other policy analysts agreed that states have the authority to administer their Medicaid programs as they see fit and root out misuse of federal funds.

And Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Trump administration’s actions “persecute a minority that’s unpopular with the powers that be.”

“The Trump administration cannot maintain that this effort has anything to do with maintaining the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid program,” Cannon said. “There are so much bigger threats to Medicaid’s fiscal integrity, that that argument just doesn’t wash.”

Immigrants' Medicaid under attack

National Republicans have targeted health spending on immigrants in different ways. The GOP spending law, which Trump calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” will lower reimbursement to states around the country in October 2026. In California, for example, federal reimbursement for immigrants without legal status will go to 50% for emergency services, down from 90% for the Medicaid expansion population, according to Cava.

The Trump administration is also scaling back Medicaid coverage to immigrants with temporary legal status who were previously covered and announced in August that it would provide states with monthly reports pointing out enrollees whose legal status could not be confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security.

“Every dollar misspent is a dollar taken away from an eligible, vulnerable individual in need of Medicaid,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement. “This action underscores our unwavering commitment to program integrity, safeguarding taxpayer dollars, and ensuring benefits are strictly reserved for those eligible under the law.”

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

Records show Washington Medicaid officials have been inundated with questions from CMS about federal payments covering emergency and pregnancy care for immigrants without legal status.

Emails show Illinois officials met with CMS and sought an extension to share its data. CMS denied that request and federal regulators told the state that its funding could be withheld.

“Thousands of Illinois residents rely on these programs to lawfully seek critical health care without fear of deportation,” said Melissa Kula, a spokesperson for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, noting that any federal cut would be “impossible” for the state to backfill.

Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.
The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.
""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.
The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress.","Mayor Michelle Wu said Boston ""will not yield"" as the U.S. Department of Justice sues the city over its policy to restrict police cooperation with non-criminal federal immigration enforcement.

The DOJ announced Thursday that it had filed a civil suit against Boston, Wu and Police Commissioner Michael Cox seeking to have a federal judge invalidate ""Boston's sanctuary city laws that interfere with the federal government's enforcement of its immigration laws.""

At issue is the so-called Trust Act, which bars city police from honoring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to keep a person in police custody for longer than required while the federal agency considers the person's immigration status. Wu has said the city continues to work with federal law enforcement on criminal cases and the DOJ lawsuit echoes that.

""The City of Boston and its Mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America – they explicitly enforce policies designed to undermine law enforcement and protect illegal aliens from justice,"" U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. ""If Boston won't protect its citizens from illegal alien crime, this Department of Justice will.""

Wu, who has repeatedly defended the city as it has attracted the ire of the Trump administration, said the latest ""unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise.""

""Boston is a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country — but this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda,"" she said in a statement. The mayor added, ""This is our City, and we will vigorously defend our laws and the constitutional rights of cities, which have been repeatedly upheld in courts across the country. We will not yield.""

Massachusetts has not declared itself a ""sanctuary state,"" but the state and its capital city have been popular targets of the Trump administration amid pushback against policies that federal officials see as lenient towards immigrants.

Boston's Trust Act explicitly tells local law enforcement they ""shall not detain an individual solely on the basis of a civil immigration detainer request or an ICE administrative warrant after the individual is eligible for release from custody, unless ICE has a criminal warrant, issued by a Judicial Officer, for the individual.""

The Trust Act was first passed by the Boston City Council in 2014 and amended in 2019.

In its 2017 Lunn decision, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts state law ""provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody.""

The DOJ's lawsuit says Boston police ""honored all civil immigration detainer requests from ICE"" throughout 2015, but has since stopped doing so ""as the national crisis with illegal immigration reached its peak.""

The suit claims that Boston ""singles out the Federal Government for disfavored treatment"" with its policy but also notes that the city does still work with the feds on criminal and homeland security matters.

""While the City of Boston enjoys federal cooperation with the Boston Police Department— including with ICE-HSI—in criminal enforcement, the Boston Trust Act expressly shuts out substantially all cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement,"" the suit says.

The DOJ argues that ICE is carrying out its mission to enforce the country's immigration laws following directions and using methods provided by Congress. And by resisting what Congress has authorized, the suit says the Boston policy ""requires federal immigration officers either (1) to engage in difficult and dangerous efforts to re-arrest aliens who were previously in local custody, endangering immigration officers, the particular alien, and others who may be nearby, or (2) to determine that it is not appropriate to transfer an alien to local custody in the first place, in order to comply with their mission to enforce the immigration laws.""

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Boston called the DOJ lawsuit a scare tactic and said she does not want the city to be intimidated by the Trump administration ""as they continue terrorizing our communities.""

""Nothing the Trump Administration has done since taking office has been about public safety. From the militarization of our cities, to abducting our neighbors off the street, to sham, baseless lawsuits like this one—it has always been about sowing fear, punishing dissent, and tearing apart hardworking immigrant families,"" Pressley said.

The many changes to immigration enforcement policies introduced by the Trump administration since the president’s inauguration in January has led what some Catholic dioceses are calling “terror” to take hold of Spanish-speaking parishioners throughout the United States.

CNA asked dioceses around the country what effects, if any, the administration’s changing policies have had on Spanish Mass attendance. While responses varied — some dioceses have noted declines while others have seen increased attendance — one theme appeared throughout: Immigrants are filled with fear.

‘It’s more than fear — it’s terror’

The Archdiocese of Atlanta has not collected data on Mass attendance, and any changes in attendance, if any, are “very small,” according to Yolanda Muñoz, the director of Hispanic and Latino ministries for the archdiocese.

She told CNA that although people are “very afraid,” their “faith is strong and they find ways around” their fears. Some carpool with people who have legal status. Many have created WhatsApp chats “to inform one another if there are areas of danger to avoid.”

Muñoz said some priests are even going to places where “there is a heavy concentration of immigrants, like trailer parks” to say Mass.

The archdiocese has held informational meetings in parishes at which immigrants are educated in their rights as well as in ways to plan and protect themselves and their families if they are deported.

Although the current “situation is very difficult and very sad, we must keep on reminding ourselves that Christ is in the boat in the middle of the storm,” Muñoz said.

Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller of the Archdiocese of San Antonio told CNA he had not heard from priests that people were avoiding going to church, although on the day he spoke with CNA, he said he had just heard from a local priest about three families that were taken into custody.

He stressed that “fear is there. It’s more than fear — it’s terror.”

Nevertheless, he said that at least in San Antonio, people “trust the Church and their communities” because they have faith.

García-Siller said he thinks San Antonio is unique because there is more acceptance of immigrants there due to integration that has been ongoing for decades in the city.

“In San Antonio, we have Spanish Masses in almost all parishes … Hispanics here go to any parish,” he said.

According to the archbishop, the federal government has, until February of this year, asked the Church in San Antonio to help immigrants, and the Church responded, through Catholic Charities, with humanitarian aid, medical and legal assistance, counseling, and spiritual support.

“What is beautiful to see in San Antonio is that these services are not done only by professionals but also people from the parishes, laity, religious men and women, brothers, religious nuns and diocesan priests,” he said.

“I have seen in the last few months more people in need. People are eating less, they are avoiding getting health care, and some even avoid going to school,” he said.

(Story continues below)

“We don’t ask them if they have papers or not,” he continued. “Because of the rhetoric in the country, people are very damaged, very scared. We avoid divisive narratives.”

The prelate said that immigrants “know that we as the Church, the body of Christ, we are for them.”

‘Less likely to linger after Mass’

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Las Vegas told CNA the archdiocese had noted a decline in participation at some Hispanic parishes, “particularly in Mass attendance and religious education enrollment.”

“One parish that would typically see around 1,500 children in its first Communion program has closer to 860 this year,” according to the archdiocese. ”In addition, families seem less likely to linger after Mass for community activities and socializing.”

Parishioners expressing ‘apprehension and fear’

Secretary for Communications and Public Affairs for the Archdiocese of Boston Terrence Donilon told CNA that the climate of “uncertainty” has resulted in “a stressful time for ethnic communities in the Commonwealth” of Massachusetts, with parishes rescheduling or seeking “alternatives” for summer festivals used for parish fellowship and fundraising.

“Anecdotally some pastors, though not all, have noticed Mass attendance among non-Anglo parishioners decline during this period of concern,” Donilon said.

Alayna Fox of the Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, told CNA that “while the Diocese of Burlington does not have a large population of native Spanish speakers, it has been reported that attendance at the Masses offered in Spanish have experienced a drop in attendance.”

The communications director for the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, Tara Bishop, noted that there had been a decline in attendance recently, though she said the diocese could not “definitively attribute” it to immigration policies.

She went on to say that many parishioners had “expressed apprehension and fear about participating in various parish events.”

However, Bishop said that “it is common to see a significant drop in attendance at Eucharistic celebrations during the summer months, so this decline may be part of a seasonal trend rather than a direct result of immigration policy changes.”

Need for a ‘spiritual dimension in this time of stress’

Echoing Bishop, Father Will Banowsky of Holy Spirit Catholic Church located in the southwest part of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City said that seasonal effects on attendance rather than fear of immigration enforcement seemed to explain declines in Spanish Mass participation throughout the summer.

“A lot of people went back to their countries in the summer, or they went on vacation,” he said.

Many returned for the start of the school year, he said. There were 920 people at a recent Spanish Mass at Holy Spirit, whose congregation is about 50% Hispanic and where the average is closer to 650-800.

Banowsky told CNA that the higher-than-average attendance numbers in August could be attributed to people knowing they need that “spiritual dimension in this time of stress.”

While he said his parish and others in the archdiocese have not been “hurting” regarding attendance, he said there is still a lot of fear among Hispanic parishioners, and “social media doesn’t help.”

“We try to make sure people can find a refuge from their fears here, whatever those fears may be,” he said.",https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Immigrants_Credit_Diego_G_Diaz_Shutterstock_CNA.jpg?jpg,N,,2025-09-05 13:57:38.084635

(AP) — U.S. immigration authorities on Thursday raided the sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in southeast Georgia, conducting a search that shut down construction on an adjacent factory being built to produce EV batteries.

The operation targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by the governor and other officials as the largest economic development project in the state’s history. Hyundai Motor Group began manufacturing EVs a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities were conducting an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre (1,214-hectare) site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents executed a search warrant “as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes.” It did not say whether anyone was detained or arrested.

Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.

Video posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: “We’re Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.”

“We need construction to cease immediately,” the man says. “We need all work to end on the site right now.”

President Donald Trump's administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

In addition to making electric vehicles at the site facing Interstate 16 in Bryan County, Hyundai has also partnered with LG Energy Solution to build the battery plant. It's slated to open sometime next year.

The joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, “is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities,” the company said in a statement. “To assist their work, we have paused construction.”

The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.
But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.
“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director.
“I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals.","Federal land managers have had a rough time implementing contentious plans to eliminate roughly 3,600 free-roaming horses from 2.1 million acres of southwest Wyoming, where private and public land are interspersed in a checkerboard pattern.

Although U.S. District Judge Kelly Rankin of Wyoming concluded last year that the Bureau of Land Management’s whole-herd removal plan is legal, his decision was appealed and roundups were postponed, and then in July the plan was declared at odds with the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act by the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The federal appellate judges out of Denver sent the case back to the Wyoming court to remedy legal deficiencies. The lower court is set to regain jurisdiction over the matter on Friday, according to an involved attorney.

But BLM, in advance of those legal next steps, has already made a plan to move forward.

“[T]he BLM Rock Springs Field Office still plans to proceed with the permanent removal of wild horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town Herd Areas, with operations expected to begin on or about Oct. 13, 2025,” Jacqueline Alderman, a spokesperson for the agency’s ?High Desert District, wrote in an email.

It remains unclear how the agency will address the three-judge panel’s concerns. “The BLM cannot comment on ongoing litigation,” Alderman wrote.

Pro-horse plaintiffs aim to stop the mid-October roundups from happening.

On Tuesday, BLM’s decision to proceed with roundups this fall was challenged by Connecticut-based Friends of Animals, one of the groups engaged in a legal fight that’s dragged for years, in the U.S. District Court for Wyoming.

“The default remedy would be to vacate the illegal decision,” said Jennifer Best, Friends of Animals’ wildlife law program director. “There doesn’t seem to be any justification for keeping this illegal resource management plan in place.”

Friends of Animals’ lawsuit, first covered by E&E News, asks the district court to force BLM’s hand.

“We’re seeking to have the removal decision vacated,” Best said. “I would think the proper course of action would be to allow the district court to rule on the appropriate remedy, before going forward with any removals. Unfortunately … they don’t have any plans to stop the removals right now.”

The nonprofit animal advocacy group may seek an additional emergency injunction if the court doesn’t rule before roundups begin, she said.

And there may be yet more lawsuits. Although Friends of Animals acted alone in its latest filing, in earlier stages it’d been part of a coalition of plaintiffs that included the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson, among others.

Erik Molvar, who leads Western Watersheds Project, said that he could not speak to the coalition’s legal plans. But he confirmed that the coalition is concerned about the BLM’s signaled actions.

“The circuit court found the plan amendments to be illegal,” Molvar said. “So it stands to reason that the BLM has no business implementing illegal plan amendments before the process is fully resolved before the courts.”

Joanna Grossman, who directs the equine program for the Animal Welfare Institute, said the coalition of plaintiffs is watching to see what BLM does next.

“I’m hoping that the BLM will rethink this course of action,” Grossman said. “Oct. 13 is coming up soon.”

If BLM stays the course, she said, more litigation is possible.

“We are carefully weighing our options and are strongly considering filing a lawsuit,” Grossman said, “but things can change day by day.”

Federal land managers have spent a decade and a half attempting to rid much of southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region of free-roaming horses. In 2010, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for the equines to exist on its property.

“We can’t fence it, because of the basic nature of the checkerboard,” said Brad Purdy, a BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made.”

But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals faulted BLM for not explaining how removing all horses would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” — a requirement of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

“The reason they want to remove horses is essentially to minimize conflict with private landowners, even though this covers over a million acres of public land,” said Best, the Friends of Animals attorney. “The bottom line is there’s a mandate to protect horses — and that ‘ecological balance’ should be considered in decisions about horses — and that is repeatedly being ignored.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/adobe-town-2-scaled1757024666.jpeg?h=7207289a&itok=DqPUhB-9,N,,2025-09-05 10:56:52.091202

Officials say as many as 300 federal agents are expected to operate out of Naval Station Great Lakes each day to conduct operations in Chicago.

Naval Station Great Lakes is serving as a logistical hub for the agents.

The president has argued the operations are to increase safety in Chicago though community leaders have doubts about those claims.

Protests expected at Broadview ICE facility

Its expected demonstrators will descend on the location because it's expected to be the main processing hub for those detained by ICE as a part of their upcoming operation.

Village officials said federal authorities informed them that as a part of a large scale enforcement operation, the facility would serve as a primary processing location. It will operate seven days a week for the next month-and-a-half.

Broadview's mayor adds that the village is coordinating its efforts with local law enforcement including the illinois state police and the Cook County Sheriff's police to help ensure safety and order.

While touring a school in west suburban Berwyn to listen to concerns from residents about the ICE operations, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stressed that protests must remain peaceful, so as not to give the trump administration any excuse to deploy the National Guard.

""But part of their kinda nefarious plan is: begin with ICE. Cause mayhem on the ground. And by doing that, say that there's a need for military troops on the ground to protect ICE,"" Pritzker said. ""That's why I've talked a lot about for the people that are going to protest they've gotta protest peacefully. Not give them any reason to call in the National Guard or military troops of other types.""

Village officials said they have also been working to help prepare local businesses for any demonstrations. Protests could begin Friday morning.

Concerns about an increase in ICE activity has caused the postponement Chicago's El Grito Festival.

The festival in Grant Park is meant to celebrate Mexico's Independence.

The postponement was announced after organizers got a call from Governor Pritzker.

The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia. The operation marks one of the latest examples of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown at workplaces across the country.

All 475 people taken into custody were illegally present in the US, Schrank said. He said some had overstayed their visas.

The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.

The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported. The facility has been touted by Georgia’s governor as the largest economic development site in the state’s history, the AP said.

Hyundai is cooperating with law enforcement and is “committed to abiding by all labor and immigration regulations,” spokesperson Michael Stewart said.

The same day, hundreds of miles away in upstate New York, dozens of workers at a family-owned plant that makes nutrition bars were also apprehended during an ICE raid, officials said, drawing the ire of Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

ATF Atlanta said the operation led “to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.”

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has touted the Hyundai Metaplant as a boon for the Georgia economy.

In 2022, Hyundai announced an agreement with the state of Georgia to build Hyundai’s “first dedicated fully electrified vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States” in Bryan County, the company said.

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

The group estimates that “upwards of 70 employees” were questioned and “nearly all” were then arrested and taken to the nearby Oswego Detention Center. A spokesperson for the group told CNN they’re still waiting to hear from authorities about exactly how many were detained.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

ICE confirmed to CNN affiliate WSTM that it carried out a “court-authorized enforcement action” in Cato. Employees told WSTM that around 60 workers were detained. CNN has reached out to the agency for further details.

Mark Schmidt, the owner of Nutrition Bar Confectioners, told the New York Times that all his workers had legal documentation to work in the US. “We’ve done everything we can to vet people we hire,” he said.

Schmidt described the ICE raid as “overkill.” His son Lenny Schmidt, the company’s vice president, told the Times the scene was “almost theatrical,” describing police dogs and all-terrain vehicles involved in the operation.

“It could have been handled so much more humanely and decently,” he said. “This kind of raid, you feel like it’s a drug bust or a human trafficking situation.”

NEW BEDFORD – Federal immigration agents arrested a Guatemalan man on Thursday morning while he was checking on a property he owns in the South End, according to family members.

Jose Bonilla, 58, who lives in Everett, was stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the intersection of Roosevelt Street and Cove Road. He had traveled to check on one of his three properties in New Bedford, a building he owns on Cleveland Street.

Carolina Zavora, a relative who was accompanying Bonilla in the car, said the agents had been waiting at the property and followed them when they left. She saw at least two SUVs, additional vehicles, and five agents. According to Zavora, the agents showed Bonilla a photo of one of his former tenants when they pulled them over.

“He told them it wasn’t him in the photo,” she said in Spanish. “Then they asked for his license.”

Zavora said Bonilla explained to the agents that he came to New Bedford only to check on his property. He also told them he had an open petition for a visa through his wife, Norma Umana, a green card holder. After looking at his license, Zavora said, the agents told him the petition had been rejected.

“How is that possible?” said Kimberly Samanta Portillo Umana, Bonilla’s daughter, who drove from Everett to pick up her father’s car. “When we checked, it was still processing.”

Portillo Umana said that after the arrest, she called their lawyer, who confirmed via the USCIS website that the petition is still processing.

According to Massachusetts court records, Bonilla had a misdemeanor charge for unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in Chelsea District Court, which was dismissed in 2007.

Bonilla’s wife, who is from Guatemala, said she is a volunteer with Latinos Unidos en Massachusetts (LUMA), an immigrant advocacy group. She left for El Salvador on Wednesday and had planned to stay for a few weeks, but is now trying to return early.

“I’m checking flights now to come back and be with my family,” she said. “This is stupid. People are working, but they don’t have freedom anymore.”

As she spoke with The Light, Umana received an incoming call. “My son is calling me,” she said. “I don’t even know how to tell him.”

Lucy Pineda, founder and director of LUMA, said the call she received from Umana on Thursday about Bonilla’s arrest was one of five she got that morning.

“It’s sad because this is another case, and it’s close to us, and we have many cases every day, every hour,” she said.

Since the start of the current administration, Pineda said, LUMA has been keeping track of arrests across the state based on calls they receive from family members.

“We’ve been helping families because they don’t know how the process works,” she said. “So we help them to find where they’ve been detained.”

As of Thursday afternoon, the ICE detainee locator did not list Bonilla’s location. ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The Light has confirmed that ICE has arrested more than 50 people in the Greater New Bedford area since February.

Bonilla’s arrest in New Bedford comes more than a month after the most recent reported local immigration arrest. On July 26, Jhovani Duvan Leiva Cornejo was arrested in the Port of New Bedford after returning from a fishing trip. On July 23, ICE, alongside the U.S. Coast Guard, detained Luis Guillermo Castro Alvarez. Two days before, ICE detained an undocumented Salvadoran man, Juan Carlos Abarca-Jovel.

In other ICE actions today, agents questioned another man in New Bedford’s North End about his residency status about four hours before they arrested Bonilla.

Dashcam video provided to The Light by the man, who asked not to be identified due to concerns around his asylum process, shows a masked agent wearing military garb exiting a large vehicle with New Jersey plates at 6:10 a.m. The agent approached the man, who is from Guatemala, and asked: “¿Tienes documentos?” [Do you have documents?] Shortly afterward, another masked agent who had parked farther down the street is seen walking toward the scene.

The man told The Light that agents let him go shortly after they noticed that he wore a GPS monitor around his ankle.

“I have no problem with ICE,” he said in Spanish. “I have my papers in order.”

(AP) — Immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided the sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where Korean automaker Hyundai makes electric vehicles.

Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday that the raid resulted from a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site and was the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The Thursday raid targeted one of Georgia’s largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai Motor Group a year ago began manufacturing electric vehicles at a $7.6 billion plant west of Savannah that employs about 1,200 people. Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials have touted it as the state’s largest-ever largest economic development project.

Agents focused their operation on an adjacent plant that’s still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries batteries that power EVs.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Lee said the ministry is dispatching diplomats from its embassy in Washington and consulate in Atlanta to the site, and planning to form an on-site response team.

Schrank told reporters in Savannah that while some of the detained workers illegally crossed the U.S. border, others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working. He said some of those detained worked for the battery manufacturer, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site.

Schrank said he didn’t know precisely how many of the 475 detained were Korean nationals, but that they made up a majority. No one has yet been charged with any crimes, he said, but the investigation is ongoing.

“This was not a immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks, and put them on buses,” Schrank said. “This has been a multi-month criminal investigation where we have developed evidence and conducted interviews, gathered documents and presented that evidence to the court in order to obtain a judicial search warrant.”

He said most of the detainees were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line.

President Donald Trump’s administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.

The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

The Hyundai site sits on 3,000 acres (1,214 hectares) in a largely rural area of Bryan County, drawing in workers from several surrounding counties and communities including the city of Savannah, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.

Hyundai began producing electric vehicles at the site last September. A few months later, Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chairman Euisun Chung during a White House appearance with Trump credited the president with the company’s decision to create more American jobs by building an EV factory in Georgia.

“Our decision to invest in Savannah, Georgia, creating more than 8,500 American jobs, was initiated during my meeting with President Trump in Seoul in 2019,” Chung said at the March event.

The battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is slated to open next year.

In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was “closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.” It said it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

“Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,” the company said.

Operations at Hyundai’s EV manufacturing plant weren’t interrupted by the raid, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson. Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday it was “working to understand the specific circumstances” of the raid and detentions.

“As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,” the company’s statement said. “We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.”

HL-GA Battery Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. In a statement Thursday, the company said it’s “cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities.”

About 20,000 of those employees came from outside ICE, the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, found, including some agencies that have sent significant portions of their workforces to the deportation effort. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations, which is responsible for investigating transnational crimes including drug and human trafficking, has sent more than 12,000 employees to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division. HSI as of the most recent data on ICE’s website had “more than 10,000 employees,” meaning it has both grown and sent nearly its entire workforce to assist with immigration enforcement.

ERO itself has around 6,000 officers on staff.

Many of the other employees detailed to ICE come from the Justice Department, including the Bureau of Prisons, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, U.S. Marshal Service and Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The State Department has sent nearly 300 Diplomatic Security staff to ERO to aid in deportation efforts, while the Internal Revenue Service has around more than 1,700 employees assisting ICE. That marks a significant ramp up from June, when Government Executive reported IRS had 250 of its agents detailed to the Homeland Security Department.

Other DHS components are also contributing to ICE’s immigration enforcement crackdown: Customs and Border Protection has detailed more than 5,000 employees toward the effort, while U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has sent more than 4,000. Government Executive previously reported USCIS staff working on refugee operations in the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations Directorate were pushed by their leadership to accept details to ICE to demonstrate their ""adaptability"" and to “justify our continued employment.” About one-quarter of the refugee office was detailed to ICE as of June.

The responsibilities of the detailees have varied. IRS agents have been authorized to make arrests for civil violations of immigration law, while USCIS employees were largely working on administrative matters like verifying an immigrant’s status or correcting information for ICE.

Some employees temporarily assigned to ICE are serving for limited periods, such as 60 days or six months, while others, such as those from CBP, are working for the enforcement agency indefinitely.

DEA has assigned nearly 40% of its total employees to ICE, according to Cato’s data, while the ATF has sent nearly 30% and USMS around 20%.

Some new details that did come up, however, revealed that the state initiated conversations with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the potential of converting the McCook center to ICE use.

Most of the Nebraska Legislature’s Judiciary Committee attended a closed-door meeting Thursday to discuss the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp.

Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style prison into a 300-bed immigration detention facility over the next 45 days.

While several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee have said they were notified of the plan shortly before the public announcement, Democrats on the committee were excluded. A group of 13 progressive lawmakers then submitted a letter requesting a public hearing to cover questions about the proposal. The Governor’s Office and Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln then organized the briefing.

Several state officials reportedly attended to answer questions, including Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys and Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, former prosecutor in Lancaster County and a former chief of the criminal bureau for the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Neither were available to answer questions after. They took a separate exit down the hall from where reporters had gathered.

Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature who did not sign the letter requesting a public hearing, said state officials were not able to provide many answers to her questions, including whether the McCook facility has the capacity to house the ICE detainees or the funds to cover the expected costs of the conversion.

During the meeting, DeBoer said officials did share that Nebraska reached out to Homeland Security about repurposing the McCook center — and not the other way around — following a social media post by President Donald Trump inquiring about states with space to house such a facility.

She did not specify which Nebraska official reached out. But Pillen has made several trips to Washington, D.C., and to the White House.

DeBoer said she was told there is currently no agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services to convert the McCook facility into a detention center, but she expects one to be completed within the next 60 days.

This contradicts or clarifies Pillen’s estimates last month that the repurposed facility would be operational within 45 days. Bosn said her understanding is that the ICE center would open around 45 to 60 days after the agreement is finalized.

DeBoer said she was told that the existing employees at McCook would remain state employees through the transition and that the repurposed center would house “low-level” inmates, or inmates that meet an ICE-specific classification.

The new center will house only adults, according to Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, who also attended the briefing. He said officials were unable to clarify whether detainees will be only men, or a mix of men and women, but noted that there won’t be any mixing of Nebraska inmates with ICE detainees.

As for what will happen with the state inmates currently housed in McCook, DeBoer said some will go to various community corrections centers, where they may have been transferred naturally. Others will be reabsorbed into other prisons, and DeBoer said there was talk that some of the other eastern Nebraska prisons may need to expand their low-level security housing areas, as the McCook center currently has a large share of those available beds.

Bosn said she was reassured at the briefing when Jeffreys said no existing inmates should lose access to resources or lose progress in their programming as a result of the transition. She said Jeffreys told her he has an employee dedicated to ensuring the transition goes smoothly.

Jeffreys reportedly told meeting attendees that Nebraska’s overall prison bed capacity was at 98%. Rountree said an engineer is currently examining the capacity of the McCook prison.

The Work Ethic Camp currently houses 168 inmates, and DeBoer noted the facility was originally designed for 100. Pillen’s press release claimed the center is currently at 84% of bed capacity. Either way, DeBoer said the repurposed center would likely be crowded.

With Nebraska having one of the most overcrowded prison systems in the country, some have expressed concerns about how a new ICE center might exacerbate the problem by eliminating one of the state’s existing prisons.

Corrections is already dealing with displacing 387 inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln after an August windstorm tore the roof off of two buildings, which are currently under repair. DeBoer said Jeffreys told senators the penitentiary is also dealing with a new water problem that occurred this week.

Bosn said she “disagrees with the narrative” that Nebraska’s prisons are overcrowded. She argued that since the overall system’s capacity is below 100%, that means there’s still room. But DeBoer said the combination of capacity concerns and the quick timeline for the project has her worried about what the conditions will be like in the repurposed center.

“My confidence is a little shaken about whether or not the Department of Homeland Security will live up to the standards that I would want Nebraskans to have,” DeBoer said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

DeBoer visited the McCook facility Wednesday and said she met with people who were considering modifications that may be needed to transform the building into an ICE detention center. She mentioned that they were considering installing a second fence but said officials at the briefing did not share other details about what modifications would be necessary.

She said she asked if the new center would have space for detainees to consult with attorneys and got no answer. The current center has little need for such meetings, DeBoer said, as most of the inmates are there late in their sentences. During her visit, she said she didn’t see any space that could be used for that purpose.

Rountree said state officials also were unsure about how much it would cost to make this transition, although he got the indication that hosting the center might be helpful toward state finances.

Repurposing the Work Ethic Camp won’t just reduce bed space within Nebraska’s prison system, DeBoer said, but it would also eliminate a facility with a specific mission that was set by the Legislature in 1997.

Though it is crowded, DeBoer said WEC appears to have better conditions for its inhabitants relative to other Nebraska prisons, including offering better food and overall more humane treatment.

“I took the time to look out the windows, and they look over a meadow,” DeBoer said.

Of the questions asked in the letter that prompted the briefing, one that was not addressed was whether the executive branch has the authority to initiate this project. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

DeBoer said she purposefully didn’t ask about this because she didn’t think it would be a “productive” conversation. She believes her opinion on the topic differs from that of the governor’s team and said the question is better left for the courts.

In Pillen’s press release, he argues that state statute gives him the authority through the creation of the Department of Correctional Services, as well as an article in the Nebraska Constitution that states that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”

DeBoer said there may be enough reason to justify the Legislature filing a lawsuit to challenge Pillen, though she said she had no details on whether such a lawsuit is coming.

The meeting was closed to the press and lawmakers outside the Judiciary Committee. Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln tried to attend, but was quickly kicked out.

Conrad said Bosn told her the meeting was meant to be for Judiciary Committee members only. But she countered that in Bosn’s own words from her letter responding to progressives, the committee “has no more extraordinary authority than any individual senator, or group of senators, to seek answers” to their questions.

“Senator Bosn’s public statements, and now private actions, stand in sharp contradiction to each other,” Conrad said.

Bosn countered that committees commonly hold private meetings open only to committee members and said Conrad has the same ability to call a meeting of her own. DeBoer declined to comment on Conrad’s exclusion.

As Congress and the country reconvene after summer break, and as we take stock of what has happened and what is to come, we again ask “at what cost” is the Trump administration willing to go to pursue its mass deportation agenda?

Below, we highlight the costs to children and communities; the costs to our economy, and the costs to our democracy due to the mass deportation crusade on display – as well as the potential political costs citing the growing opposition among most Americans witnessing the mass deportation agenda in action:

Costs of mass deportation on children, families, schools and communities

Recent heartbreaking stories of Dreamers detained, moms and dads deported, and, literally, prioritizing the detention of firefighters over the fighting of a fire remind us of the human toll – and screwed up priorities – of the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda. But the fears and traumas associated with Back to School season this year perhaps most viscerally captures the costs on real people and communities.

Trauma on kids this back to school season: At an America’s Voice virtual press conference held in late August, educators, child psychologists, and immigration experts discussed how the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda is harming kids and changing educators’ focus this back-to-school season. Watch a recording of the Back to School virtual event here.

During the virtual event, following remarks from leaders from AFT, NEA and a Washington, DC-based child psychologist, Alberto Carvalho, Superintendent, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) said:

“Schools must always be safe havens for learning, free from fear or disruption. Immigration enforcement activities have no place on or around our campuses, as they create an atmosphere of anxiety that harms every student, regardless of background.”

Costs of mass deportation on key American industries and our economy

From worries about crops rotting in fields due to labor shortages to Americans’ paychecks shrinking due to immigration restrictions, the economic cost of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda on key American industries and all of us has been a major storyline this summer.

Economists, farmers, workers’ advocates and new analysis on the costs of mass deportation: At an August virtual event convened by America’s Voice, economists, farmers, and workers’ advocates gathered to assess the costs to key American industries and their workforce of the mass deportation agenda. As we noted, “Trump’s mass deportation assault disrupts our economy and drives up prices on groceries and housing for all Americans. This isn’t just bad immigration policy – it’s economic sabotage that hurts working families and damages entire communities.” Read the post event release here and watch a recording of the virtual event here.

During the event, Chris Gibbs, President, Rural Voice USA, and Rural Voices Network, noted:

“As a farmer, this immigration report only verifies what I already knew and it’s intuitive to my fellow farmers know as well is this ham-handed immigration enforcement action is by this administration just adds one more layer of uncertainty to the environment created by the tariff debacle, no new real trade deals to market my corn and soy beans and continuing rise in input cost of doing business on the farm.”

The event also featured the release of new analysis by Economic Insights and Research Consulting detailing the economic damage already underway on our economy and the ag, construction, and leisure/hospitality industries. Read “Warning Signs of the Economic Harms from Deportations“

Costs to our democracy of the mass deportation agenda

Using the pretext of immigration and crime concerns, the Trump administration is taking aim at core American rights and protections and advancing a brand of authoritarianism that is at odds with core democratic ideals. Meanwhile, Trump/Miller are building his own personal police force. Given the unprecedented funding for ICE, and the administration’s disdain for law and order – will there be any hiring standards beyond fealty to MAGA?

Immigration is the “tip of the spear” in broader dangerous agenda: Denying people the right to bond hearings, targeting political opponents, firing immigration judges and fast tracking the removal of individuals without due process are all interrelated parts of the mass deportation crusade and elements that threaten all Americans’ basic rights and protections. Read the recent AV statement: “Trump’s Escalating Attacks on Democracy”

As Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) noted about the deployment of military against American communities:

“Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves one important question: Once they get the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?”

New task force and ICE recruitment – creating Stephen Miller’s private army? Included in a late August executive order was the creation of a new task force, helmed by Stephen Miller, that will “create an online portal for ‘Americans with law enforcement or other relevant backgrounds and experience’ to apply to join federal agents in enforcing Mr. Trump’s ‘crime emergency’ order” per the NYT. Meanwhile, much about the unprecedented ICE hiring spree should raise alarms – from cash bounties for arrests and hiring teenagers to the disturbing motivations of potential applicants. Read more on the topic here and read a related assessment in The Bulwark here.

The public opposition and political costs to mass deportation agenda

The more Americans witness the Trump/Miller mass deportation agenda, the more they reject it. A strong majority of the public, including Latino voters, are consistent in what they want: order at the border, enforcement targeted at actual public safety threats, legal channels for hardworking individuals and a process for Dreamers and long-settled immigrants to become U.S. citizens – not targets for detention or deportation. And a range of recent polling on the administration’s militarization of American communities similarly finds broad opposition.

Concluding thoughts

The high costs of the mass deportation agenda are growing more clear. They also are being used as a pretext and excuse – the “tip of the spear” – for the broader and dangerous assault on our democracy. We’re in a perilous moment, not just for immigrant communities but for all Americans concerned with our basic conceptions of self-governance, our rights and core pillars of democracy.

It is fully within the power of Congress – including some of the Republicans selectively speaking out about the harms and excesses of mass deportation- to push for a new path forward on immigration and to defend our democracy. They are on the wrong side of voters and the wrong side of history.",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RedFence-1200x800.png,N,,2025-09-05 15:57:52.628864

475 arrested at Georgia Hyundai site in biggest single-site operation in Homeland Security Investigations history

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia.

A multi-agency immigration raid at the Hyundai Metaplant site in Georgia led to the apprehension of 475 people, a Homeland Security Investigations official said Friday.

The majority are Korean nationals, said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of HSI in Alabama and Georgia. He said no charges have been filed.

The raid marks the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history, he said, though a host of other federal agencies were also involved.

Previously, federal officials estimated 450 people were apprehended at the massive site in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, Georgia. The operation marks one of the latest examples of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown at workplaces across the country.

All 475 people taken into custody were illegally present in the U.S., Schrank said. He said some had overstayed their visas.

The sprawling, 2,900-acre Metaplant has two parts: a Hyundai electric vehicle manufacturing site, and an EV battery plant that’s a joint venture between Hyundai and LG.

The raid halted construction of the EV battery plant, the Associated Press reported. The facility has been touted by Georgia’s governor as the largest economic development site in the state’s history, the AP said.

Hyundai is cooperating with law enforcement and is “committed to abiding by all labor and immigration regulations,” spokesperson Michael Stewart said.

The same day, hundreds of miles away in upstate New York, dozens of workers at a family-owned plant that makes nutrition bars were also apprehended during an ICE raid, officials said, drawing the ire of Gov. Kathy Hochul.

The raids come as Chicago leaders are preparing for a possible National Guard deployment in step with an expected immigration enforcement operation in the city.

GOP governor promoted the Metaplant

At the Georgia site, masked and armed agents gave orders to construction workers wearing hard hats and safety vests as they lined up while officers raided the facility, video footage obtained by CNN showed.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations were accompanied by the Georgia State Patrol, the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies in executing a search warrant as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into “allegations of unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”

ATF Atlanta said the operation led “to the apprehension of ~450 unlawful aliens, emphasizing our commitment to community safety.”

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has touted the Hyundai Metaplant as a boon for the Georgia economy.

In 2022, Hyundai announced an agreement with the state of Georgia to build Hyundai’s “first dedicated fully electrified vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States” in Bryan County, the company said.

The Metaplant was expected to create 8,500 jobs.

“With the first 500 employees trained, and more soon to join them, this is another major milestone as we continue our momentum towards the full opening of the Hyundai Metaplant!” Kemp posted on social media last year.

CNN has asked Kemp’s office for comment about Thursday’s immigration raid at the Metaplant.

Dozens apprehended in New York raid

In New York Thursday morning, federal agents arrived at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners plant in Cato and questioned “virtually the entire workforce,” according to Rural & Migrant Ministry, whose staff witnessed the raid.

The group posted a video on its Facebook page showing law enforcement leading people into a van marked “Border Patrol.” During the raid workers were taken into the kitchen area of the plant and “questioned one by one over the course of many hours,” the group said in the post.

The group estimates that “upwards of 70 employees” were questioned and “nearly all” were then arrested and taken to the nearby Oswego Detention Center. A spokesperson for the group told CNN they’re still waiting to hear from authorities about exactly how many were detained.

Hochul condemned the ICE operation in her state.

“I am outraged by this morning’s ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized — including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning from school to an empty house,” Hochul said in a statement.

Hochul said such operations “will not make New York safer” and will “shatter hard-working families who are simply trying to build a life here.”

ICE confirmed to WSTM that it carried out a “court-authorized enforcement action” in Cato. Employees told WSTM that around 60 workers were detained. CNN has reached out to the agency for further details.

Mark Schmidt, the owner of Nutrition Bar Confectioners, told the New York Times that all his workers had legal documentation to work in the U.S. “We’ve done everything we can to vet people we hire,” he said.

Schmidt described the ICE raid as “overkill.” His son Lenny Schmidt, the company’s vice president, told the Times the scene was “almost theatrical,” describing police dogs and all-terrain vehicles involved in the operation.

“It could have been handled so much more humanely and decently,” he said. “This kind of raid, you feel like it’s a drug bust or a human trafficking situation.”

The new camp is believed to hold about 1,000 people, with expansion to 5,000 in the near future.

According to official statements, the facilities there will be used as short-term processing centers for people in the process of removal, under the responsibility of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Defense only provides the land and logistics.

Funding contracts included $231.8 million, awarded to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a company with no prior experience in such work. The new camp, named Camp East Montana, is temporary on paper, offering even a prayer area for those inside — but in reality it is the largest immigration detainment facility in U.S. history.

Housing migrants on a military base entails a lack of transparency in detention. Fort Bliss is a restricted-access site where journalists, independent observers, and human rights advocates will not be admitted. This creates a “black zone” where those in custody are left without witnesses and without oversight.

For many, it brings back repeated trauma — people who fled wars and prison abuse now return to the sight of barracks, barbed wire, and military vehicles around them. Such placement erases the line between a civilian immigration system and a military prison, creating a model ready for scaling up.

But to house migrants on military bases fits perfectly into the Trump 2.0’s strategy on immigration enforcement. The point is that a show of strength and resolve at the border shifts the immigration issue from a civilian to a militarized domain.

This is first and foremost a signal to voters, especially Republican voters, of “uncompromising and tough control.” Republican governors, especially in Texas and Florida, support the idea, seeing it as a way to bypass restrictions and speed up deportations.

The danger is in making such measures the norm. When military infrastructure starts working for domestic politics, it stops being a crisis-response tool and becomes a permanent element of governance and intimidation. Its further development will only make it harder to return immigration control to civilian institutions.

All this is looking less and less like a tent camp in the desert and more like the birth of a new system. The lack of resistance to it will create a blueprint for national networks of military camps, where law and transparency give way to the discipline of the garrison.

ICE announced in July that immigrants who arrive in the United States illegally will no longer be eligible for bond.

A new class action lawsuit, with the help of immigration attorney Hans Meyer, claims this is not legal.

""Immigration law for 30 years has clearly outlined that people who've lived in the country for a long period of time, if picked up by ICE, are eligible for bond,"" Meyer said. ""What we see now is a new policy by the government with a complete reversal of that position after three decades without any explanation or reason.""

The legal question a judge will need to decide is: ""Should immigrants who are in our country illegally be allowed to ask for bond?""

The lawsuit isn't arguing to release detainees, but that they should have the chance to ask for bond.

""This problem is impacting thousands of people in Colorado. Anybody who lives in this state who entered at any time, no matter how long ago. So, for example, someone who came in when they were two or three years old, grew up here, maybe got DACA status as a young person, and has now been arrested by ICE, for over three decades, that person would be eligible for bond,"" Meyer said.

Class action lawsuit challenges ICE's ""no bond"" policy for detained immigrants

That includes Nestor Mendoza Gutierrez.

He became one of the first to file a case claiming his detention is unlawful, according to Meyer. Now he's the face of the class action lawsuit.

""He's lived in this country for nearly 27 years. He's married, he has children, he's a hard-working person, he pays taxes, so he's fully stable in our community, and he's lived in Colorado, frankly, more than most people who live in this state,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit could be decided on in a matter of weeks, according to Meyer.

""So the class action lawsuit is designed to address one legal question that applies to 1000s of people. That way, 1000s of people don't have to file separate petitions for Habeas Corpus in the federal courts, and the court can address one legal issue that applies to several 100 and in this case, what will actually be several thousand people,"" he explained.

Denver7 reached out to ICE to ask about the agency's take on the policy change, and what the plan is if detention centers become overcrowded.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments in the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

President Trump is expected to unilaterally reinterpret the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime treaty in order to sell advanced military drones abroad, according to a U.S. official and other sources. Under the plan, the United States will designate drones as aircraft, rather than missile systems, the U.S. official said, adding that the effort is the first part of a planned “major review” of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. Mike Stone reports for Reuters.

The United States will continue to unilaterally “blow up” foreign drug traffickers if needed, but also hopes to do so in collaboration with “friendly governments” that will help the U.S. forces “find these people and blow them up,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday. Separately, Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello described the recent U.S. strike on an alleged drug smuggling vessel as an “extrajudicial killing.” Ione Wells reports for BBC News; John Hudson and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

Rubio also announced that the United States has designated two Ecuadorian gangs, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, as foreign terrorist organizations. According to Rubio, the designation brings “all sorts of options” for Washington to work with Ecuador to crack down on the groups. Matthew Lee, Regina Garcia Cano, and Jacquelyn Martin report for AP News.

Two Venezuelan military aircraft yesterday flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters in a “highly provocative move” that was “designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations,” the U.S. Defense Department said in a social media statement. Rashard Rose reports for CNN.

The United States has violated the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by being responsible for an Afghan man’s two-year-long arbitrary detention in Abu Dhabi, a U.N. Human Rights Council Working Group found in an opinion published this week. The man, a former police force colonel who had worked with U.S. forces, was evacuated to the United Arab Emirates during the hurried U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. The Group held the United States and United Arab Emirates jointly responsible for breaching the Covenant. Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

The Trump administration is preparing to start renegotiating the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Sources familiar with the administration’s thinking say the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is scheduled to begin public consultations on the free trade agreement within the next month. Gavin Bade, Santiago Pérez, and Vipal Monga report for the Wall Street Journal.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump is expected to nominate Lt. Gen. William Hartman to lead the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, sources say. Hartman has been the acting leader of both agencies since Trump fired Gen. Timothy Haugh from the role in April. Daniel Lippman and Maggie Miller report for POLITICO.

Trump is also set to sign an executive order changing the Department of Defense’s name to the Department of War later today, a senior administration official confirmed. A separate source suggested that the White House is exploring ways to implement the name change without an act of Congress. Paul McLeary, Jack Detsch, Connor O’Brien, and Joe Gould report for POLITICO.

In a pair of whistleblower complaints, two prominent scientists on Wednesday said that they had been removed from National Institutes of Health leadership positions after objecting to the Trump administration’s policies, including efforts to undermine vaccines, evade court orders, withhold research money, and politicize the grant-making process, according to the New York Times. Benjamin Mueller reports.

Trump yesterday expressed support for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, telling leading tech CEOs gathered for dinner at the White House that Kennedy “got some little different ideas” and “we want to listen to all those things.” Ben Johansen reports for POLITICO.

The Justice Department has opened a criminal mortgage fraud investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, U.S. officials say. Brian Schwartz, C. Ryan Barber, and Will Parker report for the Wall Street Journal.

DOJ officials have discussed ways to block transgender individuals from buying guns by leveraging laws that restrict mentally ill people from owning arms in the wake of last week’s Minneapolis shooting, sources say. However, the Justice Department has since assured at least one influential gun rights advocate that it would not be moving forward with the plan, a source adds. Zusha Elinson and C. Ryan Barber report for the Wall Street Journal.

FBI agents seized computers, phones, and a range of documents during their search of the home and office of former national security adviser John Bolton, according to court papers unsealed yesterday. Some of the folders seized by the FBI were labeled “Trump I-IV” and “statements and reflections to allied strikes,” the records suggest. Jeremy Roebuck reports for the Washington Post.

Trump’s pick for the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve’s Board, Stephen Miran, yesterday told the Senate Banking Committee he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his position as the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors while serving out the Fed Governor’s term, which expires Jan. 31, 2026. Yun Li reports for CNBC.

Trump is in preliminary stages of exploring ways to take federal control of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, two White House officials suggest. Tyler Pager and Graham Bowley report for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Any Western troops in Ukraine would be legitimate targets for Moscow to attack, especially if they appeared now, Russian President Vladimir Putin said today, adding that he does not “see any sense in their presence” in Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday announced that 26 countries had formally committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, including through the deployment of troops “by land, sea or air” as part of an international peacekeeping force. Vladimir Soldatkin reports for Reuters; Paul Kirby reports for BBC News.

Sweden’s Transport Agency yesterday issued a statement accusing Russia of being responsible for a significant rise in instances of GPS signal jamming over the Baltic Sea, with the disruption of aviation and shipping communications now being an almost daily occurrence. Aoife Walsh reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Trump yesterday told European leaders they are “funding the war” by purchasing Russian oil and must cut Russia off and put economic pressure on China to do the same, according to a White House official. In a press conference after the call, Macron said that if Putin continues to reject peace talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the EU would impose more sanctions in coordination with the United States. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report for Axios.

The Trump administration will not request money to extend security assistance programmes that train and equip armies of Eastern European states bordering Russia, sources say. The spending for the Defense Department programmes is regulated by section 333 of the U.S. Code, and must be approved by Congress. Senate aides estimate that the program currently has a worldwide budget of more than $1bn. The Trump administration has not requested money that would extend the measure beyond the end of September 2026. Amy Mackinnon, Steff Chávez, Abigail Hauslohner, Demetri Sevastopulo, and Henry Foy report for the Financial Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Hamas late on Wednesday expressed readiness for concluding a comprehensive deal to end the Gaza war and release all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, after Trump called on the militant group to release all living hostages remaining in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the statement as “spin” and “nothing new.” Adam Rasgon reports for the New York Times.

The death toll of the Israel-Hamas war has passed 64,000 dead, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday. Separately, an Israeli military spokesperson said yesterday that the Israeli military now controls 40% of Gaza City amid an intensifying offensive. According to local hospitals, Israeli strikes killed 53 people, mostly women and children, overnight into and on Thursday. Wafaa Shurafa, Kareem Chehayeb, and Julia Frankel report for AP News; Steven Scheer and Nidal Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The U.S. State Department yesterday announced it is imposing new sanctions on Al Haq, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, three non-governmental organizations that in 2023 asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel’s actions in Gaza. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

The United States “told all these countries … if you guys do this [Palestine] recognition stuff it’s all fake, it’s not even real, if you do it you’re going to create problems,” State Secretary Marco Rubio said yesterday. Reuters reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Lebanese government is running out of time to disarm Hezbollah before risking losing U.S. and Gulf Arab financial support, or a renewed Israeli military campaign, the Trump administration said yesterday. Michael Crowley reports for the New York Times.

The Thai parliament today elected Anutin Charnvirakul as the country’s new prime minister, handing a defeat to the ruling party candidate Chaikasem Nitisiri. Panarat Thepgumpanat and Chayut Setboonsarng report for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Charles McGonigal, a former senior FBI official, “intentionally” compromised a major criminal investigation by tipping off the executives of a Chinese company of their arrests, according to a report released by the FBI Inspector General’s Office yesterday. The new report adds damaging new detail to accusations against McGonigal, who in 2023 pleaded guilty to crimes, including secretly working for a Russian oligarch, and is presently serving a six-year sentence. Tom Winter reports for NBC News; Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

A State Department employee yesterday was sentenced to 48 months in prison for conspiring to collect and transmit national defense information to people who he believed were working with the Chinese government, according to a DOJ press release.

Elias Rodriguez, accused of killing two Israeli embassy employees in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, yesterday pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Holmes Lybrand reports for CNN.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is planning to train several hundred armed law enforcement agents to investigate immigration application fraud and arrest those involved, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the agency’s new director, Joe Edlow, the formation of such a team is necessary because ICE does not have the capacity to pursue all cases of immigration fraud. Until now, USCIS was explicitly kept separate from immigration enforcement. Michelle Hackman reports.

The Defense Department has approved the Naval Station Great Lakes base to be used as a staging ground for the Homeland Security Department’s immigration enforcement operations, according to two defense officials. Dan Lamothe and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

The United States and Ecuador are working out the final details of a “safe third country” agreement that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers to Ecuador, a senior State Department official said yesterday. Kylie Atwood reports for CNN.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday issued a stay to a lower court’s order to end operations indefinitely at the ”Alligator Alcaraz” immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, ruling that it was in the public interest for the facility to continue its operations while proceedings are pending. Mike Schneider reports for AP News.

A different federal appeals court yesterday issued a temporary stay on a district judge’s order imposing restrictions on the activities of National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, pending a detailed hearing on the issue. The appeals court’s order in effect maintains the status quo, as the lower court judge delayed the entry of his order into force to give the administration time to appeal. Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A joint venture between Danish renewable energy giant Orsted and Revolution Wind LLC yesterday filed a lawsuit arguing the Trump administration’s move to halt a nearly finished wind farm off Rhode Island was unlawful and “issued in bad faith.” The Rhode Island and Connecticut Attorneys General indicated they would also file a challenge against the decision. Brad Plumer and Karen Zraick report for the New York Times.

In an emergency filing, the Trump administration yesterday asked the Supreme Court to allow him to fire the Federal Trade Commission’s Rebecca Slaughter. The dispute will likely lead the Supreme Court to consider the vitality of a 1935 ruling that affirmed the constitutionality of a Congress decision to limit the president’s power to dismiss FTC members to cases of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday filed a lawsuit against Boston, arguing the city’s “sanctuary” policies that limit police cooperation with immigration enforcement officials are unlawful. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Or even the one above it, which says:

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament...

They are highlighting, correctly, the misrepresentations that immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, based on the European Convention on Human Rights, rather than the reality that a very small number of immigrants are not being deported because of rulings by UK-based tribunals, applying UK laws - often not even including the Human Rights Act.

To quote the report:

UK immigration law therefore already clearly restricts the application of Article 8 ECHR to the set of circumstances described in [the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002], as set out by Parliament.

i.e. it is misleading to blame the ECHR, and doubly misleading to blame the ECtHR, when the test being applied is a statutory one, separate to the ECHR, passed by Parliament in 2014.

Which you would know, if you read the article or the report.

I'm going to assume you just didn't get around to reading either, and that you weren't deliberately making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration in a thread by some experts calling out people for making misrepresentations around human rights and immigration.

I don't think this article is aimed at them. The report is mostly going through the news reporting in this area, over several months earlier this year, and making a note of all the misrepresentations and errors included.

Obviously if people believe the world is flat telling them they are wrong isn't going to convince them - nor will almost any amount of evidence. At the same time, we shouldn't be listening to what they have to say about anything that relates to the shape of the Earth, because we know it will be based on fundamentally flawed premises.

But a report like this - which helps show why they may believe something that is wrong, what their sources of misinformation are, what lies they are being told - can help us understand where they are coming from and, hopefully, how to fix it (although I'm not sure shutting down the Telegraph is that easy an option).

I constantly see claims that ""if Labour tackle immigration they'll win by a landslide"".

Yet despite them constantly talking about it, they have been going nowhere in the polls. Every time a bit of news comes is released showing a reduction or improvement it is met with cynicism or calls that it is not enough.

I'm not sure what can be done about perception as the mainstream and social media constantly talking about it really warps perspective. We see this with crime, where it is lower now than it was in the past, yet no one seems to believe it.",,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:30.053096

“This ruling is a setback for human rights. “Alligator Alcatraz” is a monument to cruelty and just one of the latest expansions of the Trump administration’s racist, anti-immigrant agenda. “Alligator Alcatraz” should have never existed and since its opening, we’ve been advocating for it to be shut down.

“Beyond the environmental concerns brought in the lawsuit, this facility, carried out in coordination with the state of Florida, is a human rights disaster. The people who have been caged there have gone through hell. Within weeks of starting to detain people, horror stories emerged about dangerous and inhumane conditions including maggot-infested food, overflowing toilets and no working showers, lack of medical care, and virtually no access to lawyers. These conditions are not isolated failures — they are part and parcel of the system designed for cruelty and meant to dehumanize our immigrant friends and neighbors.

“Florida taxpayers are footing the bill for this despicable detention center to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. That money could be going to disaster preparedness or other programs to keep Florida’s communities safe and healthy.

“This federal-state relationship sets a dangerous precedent that invites other states to potentially collaborate with the Trump administration in expanding the reach of his cruel agenda. We’ve already seen this with the likes of “Louisiana Lockup” and “Cornhusker clink” in Nebraska. The very nicknames given to these facilities trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s cruel agenda. Governors in these states must stop being a player in President Trump’s cruel games.

“Like the rest of President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, expanding immigrant detention centers is a solution in search of a problem. These facilities are as expensive as they are cruel, and do absolutely nothing to keep our communities safe. Our immigrant family members, friends, and neighbors, many of whom came to the U.S. seeking safety and dignity, make our communities stronger and more vibrant. The U.S. government should be meeting them with compassion and support instead of terrorizing entire communities, tearing families apart, and locking them in cages.

“Immigration detention in the U.S. has long been plagued by systemic abuse and a failure to uphold human rights. But President Trump has doubled down and made it his mission to demonize and attack immigrants – he has made cruelty the point. But, he’s out of touch. Recent polling shows that an increasing number of Americans believe his deportation machine has gone too far.

“This ruling is a setback, but we will not stop fighting until the mass detention and deportation machine is dismantled, and immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.”

Trump—who reportedly signed a secret order directing the Pentagon to use military force to combat cartels abroad—said that Tuesday's US strike in international waters killed 11 people. The attack sparked fears of renewed US aggression in a region that has endured well over 100 US interventions over the past 200 years, and against a country that has suffered US meddling since the late 19th century.

""It appears that US forces that were recently sent to the region in an escalatory and provocative manner were under no threat from the boat they attacked,"" Omar cotended.

Omar continued:

They're now using the failed War on Drugs to justify their egregious violation of international law. The US posture towards the eradication of drugs has caused immeasurable damage across our hemisphere. It has led to massive forced displacement, environmental devastation, violence, and human rights violations. What it has not done is any damage whatsoever to narcotrafficking or to the cartels. It has been a dramatic, profound failure at every level. In Latin America, even right-wing presidents acknowledge this is true.

Trump has already asked the supreme court to overturn the lower court ruling in the tariffs case. Almost certain to follow are Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, his hostile conflict with Harvard University and his deployment of the national guard and marines to Los Angeles. All have been deemed unlawful in lower courts.

“It’s simple: the president and his administration continue to do illegal things at an astonishing pace, and so the courts are finding that these things are illegal,” said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

“The president is committed to pursuing his agenda regardless of whether it’s legal or not, and is seeing what he can get away with.”

The ultimate arbiter of that will be the supreme court, which is stacked 6-3 in favor of conservatives, many of whom Trump has appointed. The court has already dramatically limited the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions to pause Trump administration policies across the country.

That has not stopped them from issuing more targeted blocks. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled in a 2-1 decision that the president had unlawfully invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men he alleged were members of a criminal gang. Its preliminary injunction blocked the administration from removing a group of Venezuelans.

The seldom-used act gives the government expansive powers to detain and deport citizens of hostile foreign nations, but only in times of war, or during an “invasion or predatory incursion”. Circuit judge Leslie Southwick rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had engaged in a “predatory incursion” on US soil.

“This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts,” said Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented the Venezuelans.

The Trump administration, however, could ask the entire fifth circuit to rehear the case – and it is expected to eventually reach the supreme court.

Also on Tuesday, a federal judge found that Trump had illegally deployed thousands of military troops to Los Angeles in June, and barred the Pentagon from using national guard members and marines to perform police functions, such as arrests and crowd control.

About 300 troops are still on the streets of Los Angeles and Trump is threatening to send more to other Democratic-led cities, including Chicago and Baltimore. Last month, he deployed the national guard to Washington DC, where he has direct legal control, supposedly to crack down on violent crime, which is at a 30-year low in the city.

The judge’s order, set to take effect on 12 September, condemns Trump’s apparent goal of “creating a national police force with the president as its chief”. It was a victory for the California governor, Gavin Newsom, who sued the administration in June, arguing Trump had violated the 1878 law – the Posse Comitatus Act – prohibiting the use of US military troops in domestic law enforcement.

Newsom called Trump’s actions an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism” and an alarming abuse of power. The administration countered that troops were protecting federal officers, not enforcing laws – but the judge disagreed, ruling the deployment illegal.

A day later, a different federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully terminated about $2.6bn in grants awarded to Harvard University, and ordered it to reverse funding cuts to the prestigious Ivy League school. It marked a major legal victory for the nation’s oldest university. The judge said the administration’s actions constituted illegal retaliation after Harvard refused the White House’s demands to change its policies and governance.

In a separate case, the judge had already barred the administration from halting Harvard’s ability to enrol international students, who comprise about a quarter of its student body.

Just as Trump used the Alien Enemies Act in the context of a wider move to deport millions of people, and used troops on US soil as part of a wider authoritarian crackdown, Harvard was another test case – this time as part of Trump’s effort to leverage federal funding to force ideological changes at American universities.

Each of the cases, Sherman said, attempt to push the boundaries of what’s allowable by “brazenly violating the law”.

“He’s attempting to do things knowing that it’s illegal, knowing it would have to go to court to be challenged,” he said. “It is monumentally stupid.”

But it also presents a significant challenge for individuals and organizations forced to sue, Sherman adds – and for the courts themselves, which must keep up with the volume of lawsuits.

“They are breaking laws that are clearly written and understood, and it’s creating strain on other institutions who are struggling to keep up.”

Now Trump has asked the supreme court to review the tariff defeat after the ruling that he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country. In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that, while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes.

The ultimate decision on many, if not all, of these cases will probably be made by the supreme court. With its rulings on presidential immunity and other key conservative opinions, Trump has “indications from the supreme court that, despite what the law says, he can do what he wants,” Sherman said.

“That has informed his approach since he’s been back in office,” he added. “He seems to be unencumbered by what the law is and what the law requires.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95ebe248f92ff84bc04801a5e296e346e92c01f/337_176_2417_1934/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcfe36b3d0ba21fd3da237620281c270",N,,2025-09-05 07:57:11.429080

Officials confirmed on September 3 that 51 male immigrant detainees had already been transferred to Angola, with plans to exceed 200 by month’s end. The immigrant detention facility within Angola can hold up to 400. According to the governor, those held there will be kept “completely isolated” from the general prison population, under the control of ICE contractors.

In remarks to the press made on Wednesday, September 3, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the Trump administration deliberately picked one of Louisiana’s most infamous prisons to cage immigrant detainees as a scare tactic to push undocumented immigrants into “self-deporting.”

“Angola prison is legendary, but that’s a message that these individuals that are gonna be here, that are illegal criminals, need to understand,” Noem told press in front of the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary, speaking behind a podium bearing the sign “Louisiana Lockup Angola”.

Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola prison is the nation’s largest maximum-security lockup. It sits on the grounds of the former Angola slave plantation, from which it takes its name.

As Noem described, Angola does indeed have a “legendary” reputation, one which includes human rights abuses and slave-like conditions. In September 2024, prisoners launched a class-action lawsuit over Angola’s brutal forced farm labor. The prison’s mostly Black inmates are still compelled to pick cotton in the same fields once worked by enslaved people – often under sweltering, dangerous heat.

“If you don’t think that they belong in somewhere like this,” said Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana at the news conference on Wednesday, referring to the immigrants to be detained at Angola – “you’ve got a problem.”

Prisoners forced to work farm labor at Angola have raised the alarm about their grueling labor conditions. “It is the only job that you are forced to have a gun pointed at you,” Patrick Jones said in a testimony in a federal courtroom back in April of this year. “You are forced to be talked to like you are less than a human being.”

Trump expands mass deportation machine with new ICE prisons and raids

The conversion of Angola prison into an immigration detention site is part of a major goal of the Trump administration: an aggressive expansion of the deportation system through both state-run and privately operated facilities, as Trump seeks to meet mass deportation goals. In 2024, Trump made a central campaign pledge to launch the largest mass deportation operation in US history, vowing to remove an estimated 15 to 20 million people.

In May, the Trump administration set an aggressive new goal for immigration enforcement arrests: Axios reported that during a May 21 meeting, Trump advisor Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pressed federal immigration agents to ramp up enforcement, setting a target of 3,000 arrests per day.

Since then, the Trump administration has ramped up militarized ICE raids, igniting mass protest and opposition across the country as immigrant workers are violently ripped from their families and communities.",https://peoplesdispatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/louisiana-state-penitentiary.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 12:57:36.754425

NPR asked immigration law experts to explain what we know is and isn't legal when it comes to immigration enforcement.
Immigration agents can, and have, made arrests in those types of areas, such as the lobby of an apartment building that's open to the public or parking lots.
However, ICE agents have used deceptive practices to gain entry into a person's home or business to make arrests without a warrant, according to a lawsuit filed in 2020 against DHS.
ICE had not responded to NPR's question on this tactic or questions on whether their use of force policy has changed.","Masked, plain-clothed agents are grabbing people they believe are undocumented immigrants off the streets, pulling them into unmarked vehicles and swiftly detaining them.

In other cases, masked agents are running checkpoints in the middle of Washington, D.C., and in L.A., and questioning people in their cars.

And in some situations, agents are smashing the windows of those cars in order to pull a person out.

Immigration agents are often given wide latitude in their work. That means a lot of what the public has been witnessing since President Trump took office — and may be shocked by — is likely legal.

But what is allowable is becoming more unclear as these tactics test the limits of the law, according to immigration law experts.

""In that sense it is a very confusing time for lawyers and the public alike,"" says Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA School of Law's Center for Immigration Law & Policy.

NPR asked immigration law experts to explain what we know is and isn't legal when it comes to immigration enforcement.

Q. Federal law gives immigration officials power to arrest and question immigrants. What are those powers? Can they make arrests without warrants?

U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement, the agency in charge of immigration enforcement, was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Congress gave the burgeoning agency wide power to question, search and arrest immigrants, or those believed to be immigrants, without a warrant.

In the past, that has looked like investigative police work and arresting specific targets in specific locations, says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, a policy attorney and strategist at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit that advocates for immigrants' rights.

The Immigration and Nationality Act states that in order to arrest someone without a warrant, officers must have cause, or reasonable suspicion, to believe that a person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.

""Leaving aside border checkpoints, immigration officers have power to consensually question anyone, just like a police officer does; but to detain someone even briefly they require individualized suspicion that the person is violating the immigration laws,"" UCLA's Arulanantham says.

In the past, immigration officers would look for specific people who had, say, a final removal order issued against them or someone who was convicted of a crime – something that would render an individual deportable, Arulanantham says.

Now, in some cases immigration officers are executing major dragnets and arresting large groups of people and then determining if each person is in the U.S. illegally by interrogating them after they've been stopped.

That happened in Los Angeles this summer, when immigration agents stopped people based on their perceived race or ethnicity, according to a lawsuit filed by ACLUSoCal, among others. The plaintiffs argue these actions violate the Fourth Amendment's right to privacy against unreasonable searches and seizures.

A federal court agreed, ruling that agents can't rely on factors such as race, speaking Spanish, wearing workman-like clothes, and location (being present at places such as carwashes or Home Depot parking lots) to meet the standard of ""individualized suspicion.""

What is supposed to happen and what is happening are two different things, however.

""In the last few weeks it seems that immigration enforcement officers appear to be flouting the judge's order, perhaps because the case is now at the Supreme Court,"" Arulanantham says.

ICE didn't respond to NPR's questions on how it addresses the individualized suspicion metric.

Q. Are immigration enforcement agents allowed to wear masks or otherwise refuse to identify themselves?

The widespread masking of immigration agents in the streets and even in federal courthouses has stoked fear among immigrant communities and strong objections from civil rights groups. But acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, has said it's a necessary response to what he describes as efforts to dox and threaten these agents and their families. ICE has said there has been a dramatic increase in the doxing of agents but has not said how many cases there have been or provided any details. The agency has not provided any information to support their assertion of an increase in agent doxxing.

But Nathan-Pineau says this violates a federal requirement that immigration agents identify themselves as agents as soon as it is ""practical"" and ""safe"" to do so during an arrest. (They are not, however, required to provide their personal names.) She says the regulation is interpreted as agents are allowed not to identify themselves during emergency situations where they have to work fast. But she says she doesn't think the current situation constitutes an emergency that would justify agents not identifying what agency they work for.

At the time of publication ICE had not responded to NPR's question on how the ""emergency"" element had been defined previously, or whether it has changed, or whether agents not identifying themselves is consistent with policy.

While ICE leadership has endorsed agents' use of masks, and the federal law doesn't mention the use of masks explicitly, there are efforts by lawmakers across the country to bar federal agents from hiding their faces outside of medical or tactical reasons or for undercover work. But there are no current laws requiring agents to show their faces.

Q. Where can officers make arrests? Can they arrest people in their home or a private business?

Immigration officers must have a warrant to arrest people at private businesses or homes. However, there are areas outside homes or in and around apartment buildings and businesses that can be considered public spaces. Immigration agents can, and have, made arrests in those types of areas, such as the lobby of an apartment building that's open to the public or parking lots.

Private businesses have the right to decline entry to ICE.

However, ICE agents have used deceptive practices to gain entry into a person's home or business to make arrests without a warrant, according to a lawsuit filed in 2020 against DHS. This has included ICE agents wearing vests that say ""POLICE"" and misrepresenting themselves as police or probation officers to trick people into allowing them into their homes or businesses. Four years later, a federal court ruled against this practice called 'knock and talk,' putting a stop to it.

Adding to the confusion, by both subjects of investigations and bystanders, is the fact that ICE agents occasionally take part in broader criminal investigations Similarly, there are rules governing law enforcement's right to search and question a person.

At border checkpoints, like at airports or land crossings, agents have wide latitude to ask questions, search people and detain individuals, Arulanantham says. Otherwise, it's important to understand the difference between a consensual encounter with immigration agents, where people have the right to leave the conversation, and actual detention.

""The first question anyone should ask if they feel uncomfortable when approached by any officer is 'Am I free to leave?' If the officer says they are, then they should exercise their right to leave,"" Arulanantham says. ""If the officer tries not to answer, the individual should repeat the question until they get a response.""

""If the officer says 'No,' then the person should not resist, but need not cooperate in any other way,"" he continues. ""So they need not answer any questions.""

In general, a person doesn't need to cooperate in any search if officers do not have a warrant, Arulanantham says.

Q. What are the rules on use of force?

Immigration agents are allowed by law to use force when they have ""reasonable grounds to believe that such force is necessary,"" according to DHS policy.

However, the law states an immigration officer should ""always use the minimum non-deadly force necessary to accomplish the officer's mission and shall escalate to a higher level of non-deadly force only when such higher level of force is warranted …""

And DHS policy encourages agents to use de-escalation techniques, less-lethal force and less-lethal devices, such as pepper spray and flashbang grenades, in achieving their goals. And they are to only use force that is ""objectively reasonable.""

It's unclear what the agency considers ""objectively reasonable,"" says Nathan-Pineau.

There have been dozens of recorded instances where agents have smashed car windows in order to pull out suspects. ProPublica reported nearly 50 such instances across the country in the first six months of President Trump's second term.

The government keeps ""no relevant statistics"" on how common this tactic was previously, according to the outlet. ICE had not responded to NPR's question on this tactic or questions on whether their use of force policy has changed.

""The tremendous use of force that is being used to arrest people is honestly really disturbing to watch,"" Nathan-Pineau says, citing the incidents of window smashing and agents tackling people in public.

And it's been difficult to determine whether ICE has made changes in its use-of-force policy, she says. ""Because the most recent policy that we can find certainly says that the type of force that we're seeing is for emergency situations.""

On May 16, 2023, Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) announced the implementation of the Family Expedited Removal Management (FERM) Program. This program created a streamlined process for certain families who entered the United States seeking asylum at the Southwest border to be placed in expedited removal proceedings. Under FERM, ICE ERO placed the head of the household for the family unit into a GPS ankle monitor and set a “home curfew” to ensure families attended their credible fear interviews . By the end of the Biden administration, the FERM program was operational in 45 cities nation-wide.

The Council submitted a request for records under FOIA on November 21, 2023, and a subsequent lawsuit under FOIA on April 5, 2024. For more information on the request and lawsuit, see the text below.

Key Developments

The Council obtained these important records:

FERM Concept Operations Report

Includes information stating that some people enrolled in FERM were granted parole under a “significant public benefit.”

If individuals enrolled in FERM were paroled, they may be covered under the benefits of CHIRLA v. Noem.

FERM Processing Memo

Includes: References to units that maintained FERM data. The government in the FOIA litigation claimed it did not maintain data on the program.

FERM Participant Guide

Redacted in its totality because the program was run by BI, and the government claimed that the materials included in the guide were exempted under Section 552(b)(4), which applies to trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.

Obtaining the Information

November 21, 2023 – The Council and AILA File FOIA Requests Seeking Information on FERM Program

The lack of transparency from the government prompted the Council and AILA to file a FOIA request seeking further information about FERM and the agency’s goal to place families on expedited removal track. The agencies involved failed to publicize the criteria to place families in the program.

The FOIA request sought both ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) information about the program and data about the families enrolled. Specifically, the requesters asked for:

Records on the criteria the agencies use to enroll families in the FERM program, including the list of nationalities who may be subject to FERM and the cities where it operates.

Documents and information given to families about the program, including information about access to legal representation.

Demographic data on the families placed in FERM.

April 5, 2024 – The Council Files Lawsuit to Get Records about FERM

Since neither ICE nor CBP responded to the request the Council filed a lawsuit on April 5 to compel disclosure. In December 2024, ICE began providing the Council with productions on FERM.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/logo-aic-social.jpeg,N,,2025-09-05 07:57:17.960870

Here’s what you can do:

Write to the ICE Atlanta Acting Field Office Director urging her to use her prosecutorial discretion to:

Release Timofei now so he can get the urgent medical care he needs.

Seeking safety in the U.S.

Timofei Kocheshkov, 21, is a Russian national who fled Russia with his parents and older brother, Vadim, in 2024 to seek political asylum. Timofei and Vadim entered the United States in May 2024 through California with a CBP One appointment. Despite following the process, both brothers were detained immediately and sent to the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, California.

In the fall of 2024, the brothers were transferred to the Folkston Detention Center in Georgia. Their parents remain detained in Arizona.

Denial of medical care

Timofei was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of five. Since being transferred to Folkston, he has not received proper glucose monitoring, insulin, or adequate food. This neglect has had a severe impact on his health.

In his affidavit and incident reports, Timofei detailed repeated misdiagnoses, being given the wrong type of insulin, and long delays in accessing medical care. He explained:

“Every time I ask for medical help, I have to wait weeks to see a doctor. Doctors have told me that they cannot treat me properly in here. My life every day is closer to hell. My limbs might be amputated; I may fall into a coma and die.”

His brother Vadim added: “I don’t know how to encourage him anymore, every day it is breaking him down both mentally and physically.”

History of abuse at Folkston

Folkston Detention Center has a troubling record. In November 2021, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general visited the facility after complaints about conditions. Their investigation included interviews with staff and detained individuals, as well as a review of medical records.

The report to Congress documented numerous abuses “that compromised the health, safety, and rights of detainees.”

Growing detention system

Folkston is run by the private prison company GEO Group, which was recently awarded a $47 million contract to expand operations. The expansion will turn the facility into part of a nearly 3,000-bed complex, making it the largest immigrant detention centre in the United States.

This comes amid a broader surge in immigration detention. From June 2024 to June 2025, the number of people in ICE custody increased by 40 percent, reaching an average of 56,000 people per day — the highest in U.S. history.

The passage of the 2025 Reconciliation Bill, also known as Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” increased ICE’s budget to $150 billion. This expansion is fuelling mass detention and deportation at the expense of people’s health and human rights. It is vital to hold facilities accountable and to release people like Timofei so they can access the medical care they need to survive.",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/urgent-action-network-graphic.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 07:57:06.446488

Last week, the White House told Congress that it intended to cancel $4.9 billion that lawmakers had appropriated for foreign aid programs, invoking a little-known and legally untested power to cut spending without their approval. The move, known as a “pocket rescission,” is essentially a last-minute attempt to claw back money at the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Mr. Trump’s long-running effort to freeze foreign aid has plunged programs aimed at responding to humanitarian disasters and disease prevention into chaos. Deprived of funding, foreign aid groups that fight starvation, run medical trials and help war refugees have been forced to freeze services, lay off essential employees or shut down altogether.

On Wednesday, Judge Amir H. Ali of Federal District Court in Washington, a Biden appointee, said he was deeply skeptical of the administration’s arguments that it had the power to not spend money appropriated by law. Judge Ali wrote that the government had changed its stated rationale for canceling foreign aid several times over months of court battles, and did so again in arguments for this case.

“Even having changed their position,” Judge Ali wrote in his 43-page opinion, “there is not a plausible interpretation of the statutes that would justify the billions of dollars they plan to withhold.""

He continued: “Whatever the reason, defendants have given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress’s appropriations must be followed.”

Judge Ali’s ruling comes just days after the federal appeals court in Washington declined to block Mr. Trump’s effort to withhold foreign aid spending, but then remanded the case to the district court for further consideration. Writing that the case “raises questions of immense legal and practical importance,” Judge Ali ruled that the Trump administration must unfreeze the money appropriated for foreign aid and spend it unless Congress acts first to claw the funds back.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/31/multimedia/04trump-news-foreign-aid1/31usaid-world-1-kbtg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 06:57:22.150087

President Trump signed an executive order in April targeting sanctuary cities that don't comply with his agenda of cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

Driving the news: The lawsuit accuses Boston officials of refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, resulting in the release of ""dangerous criminals"" from police custody who would otherwise be subject to removal.

Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement accused the city of Boston and Wu of being ""among the worst sanctuary offenders in America"" by explicitly enforcing policies that she said were ""designed to undermine law enforcement"" and protect undocumented immigrants from justice.

The Boston Police Department and Police Commissioner Michael Cox are also named in the suit.

The other side: ""This unconstitutional attack on our city is not a surprise. Boston is a thriving community, the economic and cultural hub of New England, and the safest major city in the country — but this administration is intent on attacking our community to advance their own authoritarian agenda,"" Wu said in a statement posted to Instagram.

Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311970929.html,"Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her.
Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10.
However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there.
Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether.
In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.","In Venezuela, Cecilia was a veteran government worker who loved working in the tax department and training future generations of civil servants. But she opposed Nicolás Maduro’s government, she says, and assisted the local opposition from the shadows. When a pro-Maduro paramilitary group saw her at a protest, they began stalking her outside her home and on the streets.

Cecilia’s teenage daughter fled to South Florida in April 2018 after the so-called colectivos and the National Guard assaulted her. Cecilia followed eight months later, after finishing treatment for breast cancer and hiding out in family members’ homes.

When the Biden administration granted deportation protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in 2021, Cecilia had already applied for asylum. ButTemporary Protected Status was a welcome relief.

“It’s like when it rains and you have boots and a poncho. It’s another layer of protection for your immigration process,” she said.

Unless a court intervenes, those protections are now set to disappear in just a few days for Cecilia and hundreds of thousands of other Venezuelans living in the United States. President Donald Trump set the TPS protection to end on its original expiration date on Sept. 10, after rolling back a Biden-era extension through October 2026. The decision, coupled with others targeting Venezuelan immigrants, leaves scores of people to face an uncertain future, particularly in South Florida, home to the largest number of TPS recipients in the entire country.

In South Florida, Cecilia – whom the Miami Herald is identifying by her middle name because she is afraid she’ll be kidnapped or disappeared in Venezuela if deported – has continued working in public service. She’s a hotline operator that connects the recently-arrived to social services and helps immigrants do their taxes. She recently bought a home in the Homestead area and aspires to become a financial coach that helps vulnerable communities develop financial literacy. But the possibility of being sent back to a country where she fears her life is at risk has weighed heavily on her mind since President Donald Trump began his second term.

“There’s no justice system over there.There is too much risk of ending up in the dungeons,” she said.

Since 2015, over 7 million people have left Venezuela. Many landed in Florida, where 57 percent of TPS recipients are Venezuelan.

Wednesday’s announcement sets the expectation that, barring a judge’s intervention, about 253,000 Venezuelans will lose their TPS protections by Sept. 10. The decision follows an action by the Trump administration in February to strip another 352,000 Venezuelans of their protected status, granted in 2023, based on the argument that it wasn’t in American interests to keep the program in place.

“We have paid our taxes, we have maintained a completely clean record, and we have worked hard to move forward,” said Carlos Briceño, a TPS beneficiary and project manager in the roofing industry who came to Miami from Venezuela nearly a decade ago. He’s the father of eight-year-old twins, born here. “We have two American daughters who are extremely worried.”

A fierce legal battle

Congress created Temporary Protected Status in 1990 for nationals of countries in turmoil, like ongoing wars or natural disasters. To be eligible, people must already be in the United States before a certain cutoff date, be fingerprinted, have no felonies on record and pass background checks.

President Joe Biden granted Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in 2021, citing the acute poverty, economic contraction, repressive governance, human rights abuses, collapsing infrastructure, inadequate healthcare, widespread crime, food insecurity and lack of basic services in the country. In 2023, he expanded the designation so more Venezuelans could qualify for the benefit.

But only days after Trump’s return to the White House, the Department of Homeland Security announced that “notable improvements” in areas like the economy, public health, and crime made it possible for Venezuelans to be safely returned to their home country. However, the Trump administration has said it’s too dangerous for Americans to go there. A “Do not travel” advisory from the State Department warns of wrongful detentions, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and more.

The National Alliance, along with several TPS recipients from Venezuela, sued the Trump administration in San Francisco after it first announced it would end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans under the 2023 designation in February. In March, federal judge Edward M. Chen of the Northern District of California issued a preliminary order upholding TPS for the group, whose protections were set to expire in April, and restored TPS for Venezuelans until October 2026. Chen wrote in his decision that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had made “sweeping negative generalizations” when ending Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status, and described “acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype” as a “classic example of racism.”

READ MORE: Judge stops Trump administration from ending TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans

The Trump administration submitted an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to intervene in the case. The nation’s highest court ruled in May that the administration could end TPS but did not stop ongoing litigation or weigh in on the merits of Chen’s case However, the Supreme Court decision left the vast majority of Venezuelans under the 2023 designation without any TPS protections. Last week, an appeals court affirmed Chen’s authority, upheld his March order and ruled that Homeland Security had improperly ended the protections.

Advocates and TPS holders told the Herald they never expected a positive decision from the Trump administration, and had expected Noem to end the protections altogether. Homeland Security said that it had weighed public safety, national security, migration patterns and other factors, and concluded the deportation protections for Venezuelans did not benefit the United States. A DHS spokesperson said TPS had a “clear magnet effect” for Venezuelans, though people who come after designation cut-off dates cannot benefit from TPS.

Now, the fate of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans depends on how Chen rules on the case.

“We’re waiting on that decision to come out any time now,” said Jose Palma, co-coordinator and spokesperson of the National TPS Alliance.

Over the last year, the Trump administration has also moved to revoke Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras — all countries whose difficult conditions on the ground have led to the settlement of sizable immigrant communities in South Florida.

“We’re talking about long-term contributors to our community who are being targeted. It’s deeply concerning,” said Sui Chung, executive director for Miami-based Americans for Immigrant Justice.

“An existential crisis”

To understand how the Trump administration’s posture toward Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is playing out in South Florida, the Herald spoke with attorneys, advocates and immigrants, several of whom asked that their names be withheld for fear of persecution.

David — who asked to be identified by his first name because of the delicate situation with TPS in the United States and the possibility of repercussions in Venezuela — came to the United States in February 2021 to visit friends and family in the United States on a tourist visa. While he was here, Biden issued the first TPS designation for Venezuela. A long-time engineering professor, he said he decided to stay. In South Florida, he could give his 15-year-old daughter a better education and a brighter future.

David, who works in the tourism industry, said he understands why Trump wants to crack down on irregular immigration. But he told the Herald that there are hard-working professionals getting tangled in the wider immigration enforcement net his administration has cast for immigration enforcement. Already, the Miami resident said he’s been having difficulties renewing his license, which is vital for his job. Ahead of the expiration of his TPS next week, he fears being separated from his daughter, who has a pathway to permanent residency and is applying.

“Please give us another opportunity, evaluate who is doing things wrong and who is doing things right in this country. And those who are doing things right want to continue contributing to society and to the world,” he told the Herald. “Los buenos somos más.” The good people are the majority.

JB Pritzker said Thursday all indications continue to show federal agents fully assembling Friday in Chicagoland, with immigration enforcement possibly beginning as early as Friday or Saturday.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports as many as 300 ICE agents could be deployed to take part in the operation.

Pritzker fears President Donald Trump’s strategy of sending federal troops to Chicagoland is to cause “mayhem” on the ground, which could lead to expanded operations.

“Part of their nefarious plan is to begin with ICE, causing mayhem on the ground and by doing that, say that there’s a need for military troops on the ground to protect ICE,” Pritzker said.

Despite the looming threat, the governor said he is not telling people to stay home, but to be aware of their surroundings as Chicagoans hold and attend Mexican independence celebrations.

“Don’t play into their hands, but if you have the opportunity please protest. Pull out your phone. Video everything they’re doing,” Pritzker said, adding that Illinois will fight the battle in the courts. “I’m not intimidated. No one should be.”

Like the governor, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is urging the public to protest or interact with ICE agents peacefully.

“Why would we allow someone who is auditioning to be a dictator of a democracy to intimidate the soul of America, the city of Chicago? We should celebrate. I’m going to celebrate,” Johnson said.

Pritzker also recently went to Berwyn and met with administrators and teachers and Prairie Oak Elementary School in an effort to establish school action plans in the event ICE agents show up at their door.

According to the governor’s office, schools should establish a point person or department where ICE personnel should be directed. School officials should track and review all records requests or subpoenas arriving from ICE or other related authorities.

Faculty, staff and administrators should be trained to implement school policy in case of immigration enforcement action.

Parents are also encouraged to keep their child(ren)’s emergency contacts updated and accurate.

Both Pritzker and Johnson scoffed at Trump’s campaign fundraising email, saying, “Chicago will be liberated.”

“It just shows you how politicized this is being made. Trump and his Republicans don’t want to solve issues in our country,” Johnson said.

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington ruled Wednesday that the Republican administration's decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal. He issued a preliminary injunction ordering the release of $11.5 billion that is set to expire at the end of the month.

“To be clear, no one disputes that Defendants have significant discretion in how to spend the funds at issue, and the Court is not directing Defendants to make payments to any particular recipients,” wrote Ali, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden. “But Defendants do not have any discretion as to whether to spend the funds.”

The administration filed a notice of appeal on Thursday.

“President Trump has the executive authority to ensure that all foreign aid is accountable to taxpayers and aligns with the America First priorities people voted for,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.

Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, president and CEO of Global Health Council, one of the groups in the case, said in a statement the decision was a victory for “the rule of law"" and reaffirmed that “only Congress controls the power of the purse.""

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That is when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years that a president has used the tactic. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the administration to withhold the money.

The law is “explicit that it is congressional action—not the President’s transmission of a special message—that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations,” he wrote.

The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. Trump has portrayed the funding as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals, and in January, he issued an executive order directing the State Department and USAID to freeze spending on foreign aid.

Nonprofit organizations that sued the government said the freeze shut down funding for urgent lifesaving programs abroad.

A divided panel of appeals court judges ruled last month that the administration could suspend the money. The judges later revised that opinion, reviving the lawsuit before Ali.

In his ruling, Ali said he understood that his decision would not be the last word in the case, adding that “definitive higher court guidance now will be instructive.”

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

Donald Trump is on a losing streak this week. Just look at the latest judicial decisions challenging his policies, from mass deportations to tariffs to his troop deployments to US cities. The courts are proving to be a significant check on Trump’s thirst for absolute power.

These cases illustrate the point:

Immigration

Over Labor Day weekend, ICE attempted to begin deporting up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. In the dead of night, the first children were loaded onto planes in south Texas. “These are unaccompanied children who do not have a parent or a guardian with them,” Efrén Olivares, an attorney representing the minors, said on the Democracy Now! news hour.

At 1am on Sunday morning, Olivares and his colleagues filed an emergency complaint with the federal court in Washington, DC. Judge Sparkle Sooknanam was woken after 2am, and by 4am she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportations until the children had the immigration hearings to which they have a legal right.

Meanwhile in Texas, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, considered the nation’s most conservative, ruled that Trump’s use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport people was illegal.

Tariffs

The Appeals Court in Washington DC ruled that Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs were illegal and unconstitutional, noting that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs. The ruling was “a sweeping decision that unequivocally rebukes President Trump’s idea that he can impose tariffs on American consumers on his own,” Neal Katyal, the attorney who argued the case, said on Democracy Now!

Domestic Deployment of the Military

Trump says, “We’re going in,” threatening to invade Chicago using, among other forces, the Texas National Guard.

But in California, a federal judge, invoking the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act that bars the use of military in domestic law enforcement, ruled in favor of Governor Gavin Newsom, finding Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles, along with several hundred US Marines, was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of retired US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, issued an injunction barring the Trump administration from “deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops [from] engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

These are just a few of the recent court cases that have rebuked Trump as he attempts to subvert the US Constitution.

We recently got a personal glimpse into what judicial wins over Trump look like. In the high mountain air of Telluride, Colorado, we had a chance to spend time with E. Jean Carroll, the renowned advice columnist and journalist. She was at the Telluride Film Festival for the premier of the new documentary, “Ask E. Jean.”

Carroll had a long and storied career as the advice columnist for Elle Magazine, and has published several books. In recent years she became known as one of the most prominent women to accuse Donald Trump of sexual abuse, saying he raped her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s, in Manhattan.

Carroll sued Trump in civil court, and a jury found him guilty of sexually abusing her. Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, “Trump did in fact ‘rape’ Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood.” She was awarded a $5 million settlement from Trump. After the verdict, he called her a liar. She then sued for defamation, and won an additional jury award of $83.3 million.

Carroll cut an elegant figure, walking along Telluride’s main avenue with the sweeping Continental Divide as a backdrop. Her film premiered to rave reviews, and, should there remain a film distributor in this country not cowed by threats of lawsuits from Trump, it should be available for viewing by a wide audience. The film highlights the story of one courageous woman refusing to be defined as a victim of Donald Trump, providing inspiration, no doubt, to the hundreds of survivors of Trump’s old friend, the now-dead sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. Many of them spoke this week outside the US Capitol, demanding the full release of the Epstein files. The Trump administration, which controls the files, is resisting.

Behind each lawsuit are impacted people, whether immigrant children pulled from their beds in the middle of the night and thrown on planes, or people standing up in the streets of LA confronting illegally deployed troops, whether sexual abuse survivors banding together, or federal workers fired en masse.

The courts are playing a central role in opposing the lawless Trump administration, but the core of the resistance are people–people at every level organized in opposition, defending democracy.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/blog_posts/16/78816/full_hd/trumpfrown-83f7w8dpxjd6fk5u98yk9m3fua.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 04:57:35.375995

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a letter to the village’s roughly 8,000 residents this week that the Trump administration told village officials that a two-story building used to temporarily hold immigrants before they’re detained or deported will serve as the “primary processing location” for the expected operation.

She said local leaders were told the operation will last approximately 45 days, but she didn’t say when it might start.

Officials in the village just west of Chicago declined to elaborate Thursday, saying they were focused on the safety of residents, police and businesses.

“We will defend the constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest and will accept no interference with that right,” said LeTisa Jones, the village administrator. “Simultaneously, we will reject any illegal behavior that puts Broadview police officers’ safety or the safety of local businesses and residents at risk.”

President Donald Trump has targeted Chicago and other Democrat-led cities for expanded federal intervention. His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in the Windy City, as he did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops to help fight crime. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.

Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, local opposition is already widespread and is building in the suburbs. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.

Activists, church groups and schools in the nation’s third-largest city have been preparing for the operation, during which the Department of Homeland Security intends to use a naval station north of Chicago for logistical support.

In Chicago, organizers postponed a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival scheduled for later this month because of fears in the community about the planned immigration crackdown. They did not set a new date.

In suburban communities, officials also tried to quell concerns.

“We understand that these developments have created anxiety and uncertainty for many in our community,” read a statement from the city of North Chicago and Lake County. “While these developments may feel unsettling, please know this: you are not alone.”

Others issued reminders of Illinois’ sanctuary laws, which are among the strongest in the country and generally bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a frequent critic and target of Trump, visited a school Thursday in Berwyn, a largely Latino suburb of roughly 55,000 people, to assess the impact of the expected operation.

The Broadview processing center, which draws frequent protests, has been under fire recently for allegations that immigrants have been held for days instead of hours and forced to sleep on floors. The complaints led four Democratic members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to attempt an unscheduled visit to the site in June.

“That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action.","The federal government under Prime Minister Mark Carney must change course and reverse the declining state of human rights protection in Canada, Amnesty International Canada warned on Thursday.

Reacting to the first 100 days of Canada’s 45th Parliament, the human rights watchdog called on the federal government to enact policy changes in three priority areas — Indigenous rights, refugee rights, and upholding international law — where the need to correct course is especially urgent

“Since the opening of Parliament on May 26, the Canadian government has championed legislative changes that undermine the rights of Indigenous Nations and threaten to put refugees at risk, while failing to stop the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section. “One hundred days later, the most vulnerable are at greater risk.

“Economic recovery is a clear priority for this government, but it cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights,” she said. “A just economy creates opportunity and protects those at the margins of society. This has not been the case in the past 100 days, but it is not too late for the government to backtrack and lead on human rights. Doing so will require urgent, decisive action.”

Pushing back against escalating threats to Indigenous rights

Canada’s response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war has sidelined Indigenous Nations’ territorial rights. Pro-development bills passed in British Columbia and Ontario this spring gave provincial leaders new powers to push through major infrastructure and mining projects without meaningful community consultation and environmental assessments. Indigenous leaders have rightly denounced the bills, which undermine Indigenous Nations’ right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) over building projects that affect their territories. The right to FPIC is enshrined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The federal government exacerbated the crisis by passing the Building Canada Act. The legislation gives cabinet the power to designate projects such as ports, pipelines and dams as being in the “national interest,” allowing them to speed through or bypass environmental assessments and consultation processes. Indigenous leaders across the country have also condemned the bill and the government’s failure to adequately consult Indigenous Nations on its development.

“Ontario’s Bill 5, British Columbia’s Bill 15, and Ottawa’s Bill C-5 represent an orchestrated attack on Indigenous Nations’ rights,” said Nivyabandi. “They are interwoven, interdependent, mutually reinforcing, crafted from the same painful colonial pattern that has, for centuries, dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of their lands and denied their sovereignty.”

Amnesty International Canada calls on the federal government to repeal the Building Canada Act without delay; or substantially amend the legislation to ensure the respect of FPIC and other protections. Any replacement must: embed FPIC as a binding precondition; restore independent environmental assessments and cumulative effects analysis; mandate the publication of clear criteria and reasons for “national interest” designations; and guarantee judicial review and public participation, including Indigenous-led review mechanisms. In addition, Amnesty urges the government to, to the best of its ability, ensure that provinces do not undermine constitutional protections of Indigenous rights, UNDRIP obligations, or international human rights standards and instead actively support Indigenous jurisdiction and decision-making as the foundation of reconciliation.

“Upholding Indigenous rights is not a barrier to shared prosperity — it’s foundational to it,” said Nivyabandi. “If we are serious about confronting climate change and securing a brighter future for everyone, the path forward must be rooted in respect for Indigenous Peoples, environmental responsibility, and human rights. Canada cannot build a just and sustainable economy while sidelining the very Nations that have stewarded these lands for centuries.”

Upholding refugees’ rights

During the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Mark Carney campaign vowed to “[maintain] Canada’s global leadership in prioritizing the world’s most vulnerable, including human rights defenders and refugees.” In practice, the government has proposed sweeping legislation that would prevent some people from having their claims for refugee protection fairly assessed. If passed as is, Bill C-2 would effectively prevent a person who, for example, entered Canada three years ago as a child, from having a refugee claim heard by Canadian immigration two decades from now – even if the person’s life circumstances had changed radically and they found themselves in grave danger in their home country.

Moreover, Canada is already imperiling refugees’ rights by sending people back to the U.S. knowing they will face detention and the risk of deportation to countries where they will be persecuted. Amnesty International has repeatedly condemned the U.S. government’s vicious crackdown on refugees and their rights. Through a series of executive orders and other measures, the Trump administration has made it virtually impossible for people to seek asylum in the United States. Refugee claimants already in the U.S. find themselves hunted by ICE, arbitrarily arrested and thrown into inhumane detention facilities, or sent back to countries of origin where they face persecution, torture or even death.

On Thursday, Nivyabandi repeated Amnesty’s call for the government to stop the passage of Bill C-2 and to withdraw from the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. She also reiterated that Canada must stop using provincial jails and federal prisons for administrative immigration detention.

“Canada cannot continue sending people back to the U.S. to face the cruelty and racism of President Trump’s mass deportation campaign,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must end its complicity in the United States’ attacks on refugees, stop attacking refugee rights here in Canada, and strongly counter false anti-refugee narratives that have crept into the political discourse.”

Upholding international law and the Genocide Convention in Gaza

Since the new session of Parliament opened 100 days ago, Canada has issued gradually escalating condemnations of Israel’s campaign of mass destruction and starvation in Gaza. However, Canada’s words and, crucially, its actions fall short of fulfilling its human rights obligations under international law.

“Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and as a long-time ally of Israel, Canada has an imperative duty to stop it,” Nivyabandi said. “Across the country, Canadians are horrified by the devastation Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and are desperately calling for the government to act, while Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism rise to alarming levels at home.”

In December 2024, Amnesty International released a landmark report determining that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza — marked by the indiscriminate killing of civilians, the denial of basic supplies such as clean water and electricity, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including health care facilities and schools — met the legal definition of genocide. A growing body of international and Israeli human rights organizations and genocide scholars have since reached the same legal conclusion.

The situation in Gaza has grown more catastrophic since Amnesty International released its genocide report nine months ago. On August 22, five UN agencies announced that more than 500,000 people were trapped in a man-made famine marked by widespread starvation, destitution and preventable deaths. Evidence gathered by Amnesty International demonstrates how, since the launch of its militarized “aid” distribution system in May, Israel has continued to use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip. On multiple occasions, Israel Defense Forces soldiers have also opened fire on the crowds, killing dozens of people, and creating a booby trap for desperate and already starved Palestinians.

Using the term “genocide,” Nivyabandi noted, does not politicize the crisis; it is a statement of fact. Under international law, a determination of genocide has a strict legal definition and imposes upon states a duty to act. Notably, the Genocide Convention obligates states, including Canada, to prevent genocide — in other words, to act as soon as the risk of genocide has been identified. Failing to do so risks complicity under international law.

“Canada’s halting response to the genocide in Gaza will be scrutinized for decades to come,” Nivyabandi said. “This government must be unequivocal and do what the world failed to undertake in Rwanda 30 years ago: use all means at its disposal and stop a genocide underway.”

Reiterating Amnesty International Canada’s urgent calls to action on Gaza, Nivyabandi demanded that the government, without delay: 1) Sanction Israeli officials suspected of perpetrating the genocide in Gaza and cooperate with the International Criminal Court; 2) ban all arms transfers to Israel; 3) ban all other trade linked to Israel’s genocide, apartheid or illegal occupation against Palestinians; and 4) protect individuals and organizations sanctioned by the U.S. for their advocacy on Palestinian rights.

Asserting Canadian leadership in tumultuous times

The first 100 days of Canada’s new Parliament indicate a decline on human rights, marked by legislative choices and policy inaction that risk turning back the clock for the most vulnerable. However, it is still early enough to change course. This government’s ambition to strengthen Canada’s standing abroad — combined with Canadians’ collective calls to stand firm against Trump’s tariff threats and push toward authoritarianism — provides a sturdy foundation for positive chang“Canada must seize the moment to ensure the next 100 days look profoundly different from the last,” said Nivyabandi. “That means using a human rights approach to public policy, protecting the most vulnerable, and matching words with action. That is the fastest and surest way to a secure future for all.”",https://amnesty.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2220434387-scaled-e1757003141683-768x502.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 00:57:02.747626

(WSAV) — WSAV has confirmed with the spokesperson from Homeland Security that Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting a sting operation at the Hyundai plant.

Hundreds of undercover law enforcement vehicles and Humvees were reportedly seen on Kia Road Thursday morning.

Large buses were also seen entering the site. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm (ATF) confirmed Thursday night 450 people were apprehended during the sting operation.

Parts of the Hyundai Megasite were shut down, according to reports.

Workers began sharing video and pictures from inside of the operation after the raid began.

Homeland Investigations (HSI) have not released details on this operation and said the information is sealed under indictment.

WSAV was given the following statement from Mary Beth Kennedy, senior public relations specialist with the HL-GA Battery Company, a Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution company:

“HL-GA Battery Company is cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities regarding activity at our construction site. To assist their work, we have paused construction. We do not have further details at this time.”

Thursday afternoon, Yvonne Brooks, president of the Georgia American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) issued this statement in response to the ICE raids at the Hyundai metaplant:

“Georgia’s labor movement is outraged by ICE’s escalating presence at workplaces across the state. This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living. Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers. And when multiple workers have died during the construction of this very plant, the only federal action that could possibly be justified is to strengthen enforcement of occupational safety and health protections and other labor rights—a far cry from ICE raids.

The Georgia AFL-CIO stands with every worker who has been targeted by these politically motivated raids. Our movement will do everything we can to support all working families. That’s what solidarity looks like, and it cannot be broken. Workers in our state will not be pitted against each other.”

The Georgia AFL-CIO is the state’s largest labor federation, representing hundreds of thousands of union members statewide.

Georgia State Patrol (GSP) is reported on the scene.

There are also reports of road closures in the area.

There is no strict definition for sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describes places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.

“The Trump administration’s decision to partner with Louisiana to use the notorious Angola prison to detain immigrants is just the latest move in President Trump’s shameful attack on immigrants.

“Angola prison, a notorious facility built on a former plantation used to enslave people, is steeped in a legacy of racism and brutal conditions. It is appalling that this facility is now being used to detain immigrants, some of whom are seeking safety in the U.S., and others who have lived in the U.S. for years.

“This new partnership follows the dangerous model set by Florida’s Everglades Detention Center, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” Like “Alligator Alcatraz,” the federal use of Angola reflects a disturbing trend of states using public resources to advance President Trump’s inhumane immigration agenda. The very nicknames given to these facilities, “Alligator Alcatraz” and “Louisiana Lockup,” trivialize the suffering of people who are caught up in President Trump’s mass detention and deportation agenda.

“Louisiana is already the second largest state for immigration detention. Thousands of people are already detained in Louisiana in some of the cruelest facilities, with long records of abuse, lack of access to legal counsel, and such a heinous track record of human rights violations the state is referred to as a “black hole” of immigration detention.

“The “Louisiana Lockup” lays bare the racism behind the Trump Administration’s mass detention and deportation machine, being the latest iteration of U.S. policies that prolong and profit off Black, brown, and Indigenous communities. The history of Angola reminds us that the cruelty is the point.

“We must dismantle this racist detention and deportation machine Immigrants are our neighbors, colleagues, family members, and our friends.

Among the issues needing to be sorted out in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was how the ruling in the separate environmental case was going to impact the lawsuit, which claims detainees have been denied the right to meet with their attorneys privately in violation of the First Amendment.

WATCH BELOW: Civil rights case plays out in Fort Myers courtroom

ACLU predicts gov't 'will bring more people' to Alligator Alcatraz

In the environmental lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction last month ordering operations at the facility to be wound down by the end of October, with detainees transferred to other facilities and equipment and fencing removed.

However, a federal appeals court on Thursday put on hold a lower court judge’s order to wind down operations, saying the faclity can continue to operate while the case plays out.

WPTV chief investigator Jamie Ostroff was inside the Fort Myers courtroom for the separate civil rights case related to ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

The U.S. Attorney's Office said in court that there are between 120 and 125 detainees at the Everglades facility.

The number of detainees has been shrinking from its peak of about 1,000 just before the judge's ruling to dismantle the facility. The state said it was complying with that order, but if the appeals court reversed it, Florida would continue to operate the detention facility.

In this case, attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union say the First Amendment rights of detainees and their immigration lawyers are being violated because they can't meet in a timely and confidential manner.

ACLU lawyer Eunice Cho said Thursday that even though these meetings are taking place more than they were when this lawsuit was filed, the issue remains.

""The government made clear that if the stay was granted by the 11th Circuit, they would continue to reuse the facility, that they were gonna populate it again,"" Cho said. ""I think what we expect is that the government will bring more people to be detained at Alligator Alcatraz, and of course, that raises all of the same questions that we've had throughout this litigation and since this facility was started.""

Emails reveal questions about 'Alligator Alcatraz' reimbursement

The state and federal governments declined to comment on Thursday.

Because the circumstances have changed substantially in this case following the appeals court ruling, the judge asked the ACLU to file a new, amended complaint.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration in late June raced to build the facility on an isolated airstrip surrounded by wetlands to aid President Donald Trump's efforts to deport people in the U.S. illegally. The governor said the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the island prison in California that Republicans named it after.

Thursday's courtroom meeting was also the first hearing since the legal rights case was transferred from Miami to Fort Myers, with one of the counts tossed out. U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz in Miami last month said that the claim that detainees were denied hearings in immigration court was rendered moot when the Trump administration designated the Krome North Processing Center near Miami as a site for their cases to be heard.

Ruiz also ordered the rest of the case to be heard in Florida's middle district, granting the state defendants a change of venue motion. The remaining counts address allegations of delays in scheduling meetings between detainees and their attorneys and an inability for the detainees to talk privately with their attorneys by phone or videoconference at the facility, whose official name is the South Detention Facility.

Attorneys for the detainees argued in court papers filed Tuesday that the preliminary injunction in the environmental case has no impact on their case since the detention center continues to house detainees.

The state and federal governments have appealed Williams' ruling, asking that it be put on hold. If their request for a stay is denied, and the facility eventually ceases operations, it could render the legal rights lawsuit moot, according to the federal government in court papers.

On the other hand, if the stay is granted and Williams' order is put on hold, the state of Florida plans to resume accepting detainees at the facility, state officials said in court papers for the legal rights case.

'Deportations are continuing' at Alligator Alcatraz, Gov. Ron DeSantis says

As part of their appeal of the environmental case, state officials said that only four U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at any given time are at the Florida-run detention center. The Florida officials said in court papers that the ICE agents ""do not control the site.""

The question of who controls the facility is at the heart of the state and federal government's appeal of Williams' ruling. Her decision was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Miccosukee Tribe, who accused the state and federal defendants of not following federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

The federal government claims that it isn’t responsible for the detention center since it hasn’t spent a cent to build or operate the facility, even though Florida is seeking some federal grant money to fund a portion of it. Florida claims that the environmental impact statement required by federal law doesn't apply to states.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revealed that an illegal migrant from Pakistan, who served in the U.S. military, has an extensive history of criminal activity paired with ""lies about his military service.""

Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry originally entered the U.S. in 1998 on a B-2 visa after intentionally leaving out criminal history related to convictions in Australia for stealing goods, falsifying passports and committing financial misconduct, according to DHS. DHS told Fox News Digital that Chaudhry also claimed he was deployed to Iraq, though Department of Defense records show he was never actually deployed.

An official with the Department of Defense told Fox News Digital that illegal migrants cannot serve in the military and an individual must have some form of legal status in order to serve. Green card holders (permanent legal residents) are able to join a branch of the U.S. military.

Immigration officials at the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) determined Chaudhry’s falsified forms and omitting of criminal history were grounds for removal in 2008, but the Pakistani native has been repeatedly appealing the decision for roughly 17 years.

DHS RAGES OVER WHAT IT CALLS A NYT 'SOB STORY' ABOUT CONVICTED JAMAICAN MURDERER DEPORTED BY TRUMP

""Sanctuary politician Bruce Harrell and the media are peddling a FALSE sob story on this serial fraudster,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital. ""President Trump and Secretary Noem’s message is clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.""

""Why do sanctuary politicians and the media continue to peddle sob stories of criminal illegals and smear our brave ICE law enforcement officers?"" McLaughlin added. ""Make no mistake, these types of lies are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults.""

According to an Inspector General’s report obtained by Fox News Digital from 2021, Chaudhry collected $449,459.82 in taxpayer dollars from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran’s Benefits Administration (VBA) and currently owes the federal government $81,080 for a mortgage reduction grant from the VBA.

Sources at the Department of Homeland Security told Fox that Chaudhry entered the country on a B-2 tourist visa and then was granted a green card. After officials discovered he previously lied to immigration officials about his criminal past, the green card was revoked — making him an illegal migrant in the U.S.

Chaudhry remains detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being arrested during a citizenship appearance in Tukwila, Washington, on Aug. 21, 2025. He has been placed into removal proceedings after an immigration judge ruled he was in violation of federal immigration law.

Protests in Seattle have since erupted as hundreds of demonstrators stood outside the ICE detention center demanding Chaudhry’s release last week.

PILSEN — Organizers of upcoming Mexican Independence Day celebrations are bracing for federal immigration agents to target the festivities.

Gov. JB Pritzker has warned Chicagoans to prepare for an immigration crackdown planned around Mexican Independence Day — which is Sept. 16 — saying federal agents are expected to arrive this week. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to send hundreds of immigration agents here as soon as Friday and has threatened to also send the National Guard.

Some organizers of Mexican Independence Day events said they will not cancel plans, and they will stand united to celebrate the culture, history and heritage of Mexican and Mexican American communities. Others are working with local officials to determine next steps, they said.

Among the celebrations being planned for this month is El Grito Chicago, which is set for Sept. 13-14 in Grant Park. The event will feature live entertainment and music, sports clinics, carnival rides, art workshops and a lineup of food, drinks and vendors.

“In response to recent news, we are working closely with elected officials, community leaders and key stakeholders to determine the best path forward for our annual El Grito celebration,” German Gonzalez, organizer of El Grito Chicago, said in a statement Wednesday.

Last year’s two-day El Grito attracted about 24,000 people and recorded no festival-related incidents, organizers previously said.

“While the targeting of Mexican Independence Day celebrations underscores the vital importance of our mission to uplift our community, it also requires us to carefully consider how we can best serve our community,” Gonzalez said.

In Pilsen, the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade is set to start noon Saturday on West 18th Street. Organizers have been working with the city and police and will have volunteer marshals to serve as “the eyes and ears” throughout the parade to alert participants if the National Guard or immigration agents show up, said Vicky Lugo, whose United Merchants Pilsen Chamber of Commerce organizes the parade.

“People are ready to lift our voices, to celebrate our culture, our heritage and our history,” Lugo said. “We’re not causing any chaos. We’re not causing any problems. It’s a celebration of unity, of our heritage and our culture.”

Pritzker said this week that he’s been notified federal immigration agents will soon be deployed in Chicago, saying his administration believes the timing is tied to the city’s annual Mexican Independence Day festivities. That potentially puts Latino communities at particular risk of being targeted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

“It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful gatherings,” Pritzker said Tuesday.

In Little Village, the 54th annual 26th Street Mexican Independence Day Parade is set for noon-3 p.m. Sept. 14 under the theme “Pride and Power: Our Strength, Our Legacy.” In past years, the parade has drawn hundreds of thousands to Little Village, dubbed by some officials as the Mexican capital of the Midwest.

Organizers said that they are working with elected officials and community organizations to “determine the best next steps that will ensure our community’s safety while honoring our cherished traditions.”

“The Little Village Chamber of Commerce is fully committed to upholding our 54-year tradition of celebrating Mexican Independence Day and supporting our local business community,” Jennifer Aguilar, executive director of the Little Village Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement Wednesday. “We will provide further updates as we work through these considerations with all of the stakeholders involved.”

Earlier this year, organizers of the Little Village Mexican Independence Day Parade said they would not halt plans to celebrate Mexican and Mexican American culture despite fears of immigration raids.

Hosting the parade this year is “almost like an act of resistance” amid the federal administration’s crackdown on immigration and its anti-immigrant rhetoric, Aguilar previously said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services played a key role in the investigation.

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“Through diligent investigation, USCIS and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million-dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

The superseding indictment charges:

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Marianny Lucia Lopez-Torres, 25, residing in Cuba, (formerly Hialeah, FL);

Frandy Aragon-Diaz, 33, of Cuba, (formerly unlawfully residing in Tampa, FL);

Erik Ventura-Castro, 23, residing in Hialeah, FL;

Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Walbis Pozo-Dutel, 30, residing in Katy, TX ;

Emanuel Martinez Gonzalez, 28, unlawfully residing in Hialeah, FL;

Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, 31, of Tampa, FL;

Layra Libertad Treto Santos, 31, of Tampa, FL; and

Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra, 40, of Tampa, FL.

According to the superseding indictment:

All defendants except Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra are charged with conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The alien smuggling operation promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The operation also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security, has been elevated and expanded by the attorney general with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs, among others.

JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

Homeland Security Investigations Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’ Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

Trial Attorney Jenna Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Courtney Derry for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Project Safe Neighborhoods.

An indictment is merely an allegation. The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Speaking at a virtual news conference Thursday, Fernández and the attorneys say state officials acknowledged in court last month that municipalities are not obligated under law to sign the so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The city of South Miami had filed a lawsuit against the state to clarify whether the agreements are mandatory for municipalities under Florida law. It is mandatory for counties that run jail systems.

During court testimony last month, attorneys representing the state told the judge municipalities are not required by law to enter into the 287(g) agreement.

The agreement deputizes and trains local law enforcement as ICE agents, and gives them authority to carry out federal immigration laws.

No decision has been made in the ongoing court case, but Fernández told reporters Thursday that he and his attorney “felt validated” by the state’s acknowledgement that it's not mandatory for cities to sign.

“These admissions should provide a clear relief to cities that have not signed an agreement; cities that have been under extreme, unwarranted, and unlawful pressure,” said Alana Greer, Director at the Community Justice Project, during the press conference.

Said Tallahassee City Commissioner Jacqueline ""Jack"" Porter: “Local elected officials are being threatened for even questioning these agreements; we know now that the state itself has admitted that it is not a legal requirement.”

Porter said her city may explore options to withdraw from the agreement with ICE.

Numerous municipalities across the state have joined the partnership under pressure from Gov. Ron DeSantis as the state works closely to help the Trump administration's aggressive deportation efforts.

South Miami is the only Florida city actively to challenge the state position in court that all cities must enter into immigration enforcement agreements with ICE.

The city is not subject to state law requiring law enforcement agencies partner with ICE because they do not operate a jail. All 67 Florida counties have signed on to partner with ICE because they operate jails.

DeSantis and other top state officials have pushed cities, including Fort Myers and Key West to enter into the agreements by threatening to remove city commissioners from office and cut state funding.

Law enforcement agencies, like Tallahassee Police Department, that have active 287(g) agreements, must get approval from the State Board of Immigration Enforcement to terminate their agreements.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced.
The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power.
It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one.
And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302.","Challenges to particular methods of execution have become a standard part of the litigation strategy in many death penalty cases, even though, in recent years, the Supreme Court has made them much more difficult to win. But for any of those challenges to occur, death row inmates have to know which method a state intends to use to put them to death.

That is why states like Arkansas and Florida have revised the laws governing execution to grant unchecked discretion to the people in charge of carrying out executions to choose the method. They make it hard for death row inmates to know, in a timely manner, the method that will be employed in their cases.

This mystery not only complicates litigation strategies, but it adds a layer of cruelty to the heavy psychological toll already associated with the death penalty process. And it runs afoul of Supreme Court rulings about the things legislative bodies can and cannot delegate to executive agencies, like the departments of corrections that are responsible for putting the condemned to death.

Whether courts will recognize that problem in the context of capital punishment remains to be seen. But a suit filed last month in Arkansas will test their willingness to do so.

This first-of-its-kind suit was filed on August 5 in the Circuit Court of Pulaski County on behalf of ten of the twenty-three inmates currently on Arkansas’s death row. It alleges that legislation enacted earlier this year, Act 302, which does not specify whether they will be executed by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia, is unconstitutional because it violates the state constitution’s separation of powers.

Act 302 changed the existing law, which read “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death by lethal injection or by life imprisonment without parole….” The new law deletes the reference to lethal injection as a necessary part of the punishment of death.

It now says, “A person convicted of a capital offense shall be punished by death or by life imprisonment without parole….”

Act 302 allows the Division of Corrections to “carry out the sentence of death either by intravenous lethal injection of…[a] drug or drugs…in an amount sufficient to cause death or by nitrogen gas.” That’s it.

The law offers no guidance as to the factors that the DOC must consider or the standards that should govern its choice. There is nothing to prevent it from choosing one or another method because correctional officials dislike a prisoner or want to pay back those who have been troublesome while on death row.

And there is nothing in the new law to prevent them from choosing an execution method because of the race of the inmate or of their victim, factors that we already know play a role in death sentencing and decisions to seek death warrants. If Arkansas’s new law survives judicial scrutiny, race may play a role in determining whether an inmate is put to death by lethal injection or nitrogen hypoxia.

What a nightmarish possibility.

As the prisoners’ lawsuit lays out, all ten of the litigants were sentenced under the old law and knew they would be executed by lethal injection from the moment they were sentenced. No more.

The power to designate the execution method used in Arkansas is, they say, a legislative power. They argue that the legislature cannot “delegate to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director absolute, unfettered discretion to choose between lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia as the means for executing [them].”

And while Act 302 gives detailed instructions about lethal injection procedures, it “provides no standards to the Department of Corrections and ADC Director to constrain and guide the use of nitrogen hypoxia…”

Standardless delegations of authority by legislative bodies to executive agencies, of the kind contained in Act 302, have drawn the ire of the current majority on the United States Supreme Court. As the Court explained last June, “To distinguish between the permissible and the impermissible…[delegation of authority], this Court asks whether Congress has set out an ‘intelligible principle’ to guide what it has given the agency to do.”

“Under that test,” the Court said, “Congress must make clear both ‘the general policy’ the agency must pursue and ‘the boundaries of [its] delegated authority.’”

Justice Neil Gorsuch put it simply, “the Constitution…command[s] that Congress ‘may not transfer to another branch ‘powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.’”

The Arkansas suit is premised on exactly that understanding.

It asks the court to recognize that a state’s choice of an execution method is by no means merely a technical one. It is instead a profound political and moral one, appropriately left to the people and their elected representatives and subject to the constitutional requirement that the method not be cruel or unusual.

The lawsuit’s critique of the delegation of that choice contained in Act 302 seems to align perfectly with Gorsuch’s understanding, though there is some irony in seeing the doctrine developed by a death penalty enthusiast like him, now applied in an effort to invalidate a statute enacted to make executions easier.

The Arkansas lawsuit also says that Act 302 “impairs the judicial function by imposing and modifying prior sentences” and that a new punishment like nitrogen hypoxia for capital murder cannot be inflicted retroactively “without violating the Arkansas Constitution’s due process protections and prohibitions on bills of attainder.”

In the end, Arkansas is a somewhat unexpected place for such a consequential death penalty lawsuit to occur. It has not carried out an execution since 2017, and not seen a new death sentence since 2018.

And the Arkansas litigation is not the usual method of execution challenge since it does not question the constitutionality of either of the methods mentioned in Act 302. It just insists that people sentenced to death can’t be left in the dark, until the last minute, about which method will be chosen to kill them.

The fate of the litigation filed this month in the self-proclaimed “Natural State” may go a long way in determining whether other more active death penalty states can keep not only the condemned, but the people as well from knowing in advance how executions will be carried out in their name.",https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/shutterstock_156003992.jpeg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-04 19:57:33.066027

In a petition filed late on Wednesday, the administration asked the justices to quickly intervene to rule that the president has the power to impose such import taxes on foreign nations.

A divided US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit last week ruled 7-4 that the tariffs Trump brought in through an emergency economic powers act did not fall within the president's mandate and that setting levies was ""a core Congressional power"".

The case could upend Trump's economic and foreign policy agenda and force the US to refund billions in tariffs.

Trump had justified the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president the power to act against ""unusual and extraordinary"" threats.

In April, Trump declared an economic emergency, arguing that a trade imbalance had undermined domestic manufacturing and was harmful to national security.

While the appellate court ruled against the president, it postponed its decision from taking effect, allowing the Trump administration time to file an appeal.

""The stakes in this case could not be higher,"" Solicitor General John Sauer said in Wednesday night's filing.

He wrote that the lower court's ""erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign policy crisis"".

Lawyers representing small businesses challenging the tariffs said they were confident they would win the case.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardising their survival,"" said Jeffrey Schwab of Liberty Justice Center. ""We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients.""

If the Supreme Court justices deny the review, the ruling could take effect on 14 October.

What tariffs has Trump announced and why?

How much cash is the US raising from tariffs?

In May, the New York-based Court of International Trade declared the tariffs were unlawful. That decision was also put on hold during the appeal process.

The rulings came in response to lawsuits filed by small businesses and a coalition of US states opposing the tariffs.

In April, Trump signed executive orders imposing a baseline 10% tariff as well as ""reciprocal"" tariffs intended to correct trade imbalances on more than 90 countries.

In addition to those tariffs, the appellate court ruling also strikes down levies on Canada, Mexico and China, which Trump argues are necessary to stop the importation of drugs.

The decision does not apply to some other US duties, like those imposed on steel and aluminium, which were brought in under a different presidential authority.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ff7e/live/a309f100-891d-11f0-b663-f3bb91f7a7fe.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 21:57:39.964139

Green",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/04/us/trump-news,"So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges.
Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers.
Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime.
Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.
Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed.","“It’s a difficult job that each of us has,” he said, as he opened remarks during a luncheon panel at the annual Sixth Circuit Judicial Conference in Memphis, “particularly the trial judges who operate alone.” (In the federal system, district courts are the trial courts.)

He called trial-court judges “the front lines of American justice” and thanked them for helping to “preserve and protect the Constitution and the rule of law of the United States.”

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came at a time of increased strain on the Supreme Court’s relationship with district court judges, who have often moved swiftly to block President Trump’s policies with sweeping preliminary orders, issued before a case has been heard in full. The Supreme Court in turn in June imposed new limits on the lower courts’ power to issue orders that affect the whole country, known as universal injunctions.

The justices have also intervened in more than a dozen individual cases in ways that at least temporarily lift blocks imposed by lower court judges that would have stopped Mr. Trump’s policies from being implemented while their legality is litigated.

Justice Kavanaugh, whose mother is a retired state-court judge, told the judges gathered in Memphis that she had often impressed on him how difficult the job of a trial-court judge could be.

“It’s kind of like having the referee on the field, and then we’re sitting up in the replay booth, dissecting every frame of the replay,” he said. “Respect for the role of the trial judge as a single person who has to make quick decisions is something that I saw firsthand,” he added.

In the case on universal injunctions, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the new limitations on district-court judges’ powers “will help bring substantially more order and discipline” to lawsuits over executive orders.

In a case late last month, he joined Justice Neil M. Gorsuch in rebuking judges who “defy” the Supreme Court by failing to apply its emergency orders, which, Justice Gorsuch wrote, “carry precedential weight.” That criticism, issued in a case dealing with cuts to National Institutes of Health grant funding, prompted a pointed apology from the bench by Judge William G. Young of Massachusetts, the Reagan-appointed judge at whom it was directed.

The increasing number of emergency orders issued by the Supreme Court have come in response to a flurry of executive orders issued by the Trump administration, which have then been challenged in court. The administration has sought the intervention of the Supreme Court in a series of cases, asking the justices to remove temporary blocks imposed by lower-court judges.

Critics call this growing segment of the Supreme Court’s caseload the “emergency docket” or “shadow docket,” because it involves less briefing, usually no oral arguments and generally less deliberation by the justices. On Thursday, Justice Kavanaugh said that “interim docket” was a more accurate term, as not all of the matters under review were actual emergencies, nor were the court’s orders necessarily its final word on the issues.

The interim docket’s rise, Justice Kavanaugh argued, has been driven by factors outside the Supreme Court’s control. In what he called “structural separation of powers,” presidents seek to advance their agenda despite inaction by Congress. That dynamic, he said, is “totally bipartisan,” predating Mr. Trump’s presidency.

So far, the Trump administration has filed about 20 emergency applications, many of which seek to remove blocks imposed by district-court judges. That total over the last seven and a half months exceeds the number of applications filed by President Joseph R. Biden’s administration during his four-year term.

Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks came in response to questions from Judge Joan L. Larsen and Judge Andre B. Mathis, who both sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

While he was careful to present the executive branch’s current relationship with the courts as more of a continuation than a rupture, Justice Kavanaugh appeared to acknowledge that the degree of political rancor in the Trump era was unusual. He suggested that judges, especially when writing dissents, should do what they could to lower the temperature.

“We’re modeling behavior for everyone,” he said, adding that that made civility and neutrality especially important “when the tone around us, in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud.”

The latest ruling was a victory for Florida, which pushed the boundaries of traditional immigration enforcement when it opened the facility in July. It became the first state to run an immigrant detention center — normally a federal role. Other states have since announced plans to house federal immigration detainees in state-owned facilities.

The ruling was also significant for the Department of Homeland Security, which had argued in court that it was not running the Everglades detention center.

In granting the stay, the appeals panel found that the lower court had misinterpreted a federal law requiring a review of potential environmental harms before building a major project in the ecologically fragile Everglades. It found that because the detention center had so far been entirely funded by Florida, and because the state operated the center, the National Environmental Policy Act would not apply.

Florida has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the detention center, an outlay that Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has repeatedly said will be reimbursed by the federal government. Even if that should happen, the appeals panel ruled, it would be “insufficient” grounds to consider the detention center a major federal project subject to environmental review.

“Alligator Alcatraz is, in fact, like we’ve always said, open for business,” Mr. DeSantis said in a video posted to X shortly after the appellate ruling. “The mission continues, and we’re going to continue leading the way when it comes to immigration enforcement.”

Elise Bennett, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that environmental groups hoped to “ultimately prevail in defending the heart of Florida from this brutal and destructive facility.”

“This is a heartbreaking blow to America’s Everglades and every living creature there, but the fight isn’t even close to over,” Ms. Bennett, the center’s Florida and Caribbean director, said in a statement.

Mr. DeSantis, whose administration has taken an aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, recently announced plans to open a second detention center at an empty state prison west of Jacksonville. This week, he also floated the idea of opening a third such center, in the Florida Panhandle.

Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami ruled on Aug. 21 in favor of environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, which had sought to halt construction on the center and its operations because of the lack of environmental review. Since then, the number of immigrant detainees at the facility has dwindled.

Between 120 and 125 detainees remain, a lawyer for the federal government said on Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Fort Myers. The hearing was on a different case regarding the Everglades detention center.

During that hearing, Nicholas J.P. Meros, an attorney for the state, told Judge Sheri Polster Chappell that Florida was not bringing any additional detainees to the Everglades detention center, but intended to keep it running, and to bring in more detainees, if Judge Williams’s ruling were reversed.

The appeals panel found that the state and federal governments would suffer “irreparable harm” if the Everglades detention center were shut down while the case played out in court.

“Florida will undoubtedly be harmed if it cannot ‘apply its own laws’ to respond to an immigration crisis and serve the public interest,” Judge Barbara Lagoa wrote in the 2-to-1 ruling. She was joined by Judge Elizabeth L. Branch. Both were appointed by President Trump.

Among the reasons the appeals panel cited for allowing the detention center to remain open was that the state said it would cost $15 million to $20 million to dismantle much of the facility — and then the same amount to rebuild if it were to succeed in its appeal.

In his dissent, Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote that the appeals panel had overstepped its limited role in ruling for the state and federal governments and dismissing the lower court’s findings that the sensitive Everglades ecosystem could be harmed.

“The district court properly balanced the equities and the public interest,” Judge Jordan wrote. “The court considered the significant ongoing and likely future environmental harms to the plaintiffs from the detention facility, as well as the importance of immigration enforcement to the state and federal defendants.”

But with Republicans pushing for deep cuts and Democrats resisting, a broad spending agreement will be exceedingly difficult. And even a short-term measure is likely to be challenging, with the two parties divided over key details. Such a package would also pose a political challenge for Democrats, who weathered a backlash from their voters in March when they allowed the current stopgap spending bill to move forward.

“We don’t want a shutdown,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader. “We want bipartisan negotiations and a bipartisan bill. If Republicans want to keep the government open, they’ve got to work with us.”

Back in March, Democrats agonized for days over whether to supply the votes needed to allow the G.O.P.-written temporary spending measure to move ahead. Mr. Schumer and nine other members of his caucus ultimately voted to let it advance, arguing that a shutdown would only empower Mr. Trump to tighten his grip on federal agencies and to unilaterally decide what money to spend.

Democrats have said they would find it extremely difficult to back future funding measures without some kind of assurance that Republicans would not continue to allow the Trump administration to cancel spending after Congress approves it. In order to clear a Senate filibuster, government spending deals have historically been bipartisan products.

Instead, the Trump administration last month advanced a new effort to unilaterally claw back $4.9 billion that lawmakers approved for foreign aid programs, infuriating Democrats.

“It almost seems like they want a fight,” Senator John Hickenlooper, Democrat of Colorado, said of the gambit, known as a pocket rescission.

At the same time, Republicans appear poised to change the rules of the Senate to fast-track the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s nominees, an attempt to overcome Democratic insistence on holding formal roll call votes on every executive branch nominee.

The Republican efforts have riled Democrats, who for months have seethed at the president’s escalating campaign to undercut congressional spending authority.

“I’m not going to go along with keeping the government open unless they change course,” Senator Chris Coons of Delaware told NPR.

“Trump has made it clear that the budget is not worth the paper it’s written on,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut. “There can’t be any good-faith negotiation when the implementer of the budget is refusing to implement it.”

For now, Democratic leaders have said they are willing to vote for a spending package, as long as they get a say in the contents.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said at a news conference on Wednesday that she would support negotiating bipartisan versions of three of the least divisive spending bills the Senate and the House have already separately approved, then passing them with a stopgap bill.

Any short-term spending agreement “needs to reflect Democratic values and principles, and needs to be a real bipartisan compromise,” Ms. Murray said.

Efforts to find a compromise on spending levels could be difficult. House Republicans have largely rejected the deepest spending cuts proposed by the White House, but they are advancing funding bills setting drastically lower spending levels than their counterparts in the Senate. Their bills would slash spending across the board, including an 11 percent cut to the bill that funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.

“Following the president’s clear direction, we have taken a critical look at every program, and in several cases had to make hard decisions on some ‘nice-to-have’ programs,” said Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama, who leads the spending subcommittee in charge of labor and health. “Americans must prioritize resources at the kitchen table, and we should be doing the same here in Congress.”

The question of how long a stopgap bill would last could also divide Republicans. More conservative House Republicans have long chafed at yearlong temporary bills because the bills traditionally keep spending flat and do not make cuts.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican majority leader, said lawmakers would “inevitably” need a stopgap measure “for some time.”

He added: “What that looks like and how long that might extend, I think, probably, is a matter of discussion.”

Some Democrats have privately said that they are negotiating against a backdrop that is more politically favorable to them than the one they encountered in March, an argument that Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made publicly this week.

“One thing that’s different from back then: Donald Trump at the beginning of this year was 9 points up,” Ms. Klobuchar said. “He’s 9 points under.”

That has created a political environment, she said, that has allowed Mr. Schumer and Democrats to recruit strong candidates to run for the Senate in next year’s crucial midterm elections, she said.

“It is a very different situation,” she continued, “and they know it.”

It is not clear which U.S. attorney’s offices are involved in the inquiry, but Ms. Cook previously reported in disclosures that she had owned homes in Georgia, Massachusetts and Michigan, according to court records. Federal prosecutors have begun issuing subpoenas, one of the people briefed in the investigation said.

The opening of the investigation, earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as little surprise. Mr. Martin, who leads the department’s vaguely defined weaponization task force after Senate Republicans scuttled his nomination to be the permanent U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, signaled his intention to do so as the White House stepped up its attacks on Ms. Cook.

The saga began when Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said his office had investigated Ms. Cook and found that she appeared to have falsified bank documents to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage. Mr. Pulte later referred the matter to the Justice Department for a criminal inquiry, before Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook from the Fed.

Ms. Cook initially responded in a statement that she would not be “bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.” But she said she would take “questions about my financial history seriously” and gather the facts. She then sued the administration over its attempted firing, and in a hearing last week, her lawyers depicted her potential ouster as an illegal bid to undermine the traditional independence of the Federal Reserve.

In a statement Thursday, Abbe D. Lowell, the lawyer representing Ms. Cook, said the reports suggested the Trump administration was “scrambling to invent new justifications for its overreach,” describing the Justice Department as “perhaps the most politicized” in American history.

“The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this D.O.J. to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again,” Mr. Lowell continued.

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Martin, who has been given few staff but broad latitude to team up with U.S. attorney’s offices around the country, flouted the department’s procedural norms last month by suggesting to the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, that Ms. Cook step aside.

Ms. Cook’s case “requires further examination” Mr. Martin wrote in a letter to Mr. Powell, suggesting that the department could be pursuing an investigation.

“At this time, I encourage you to remove Ms. Cook from your board,” Mr. Martin wrote. “Do it today before it is too late! After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”

The administration, led by Mr. Pulte, has increasingly scrutinized the mortgage applications of Mr. Trump’s political adversaries to seek retribution against his enemies. The Justice Department, under the leadership of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has acted on referrals from other government agencies by proceeding with mortgage fraud investigations of the New York State attorney general, Letitia James, and Senator Adam B. Schiff, two prominent Democrats who are known as critics of Mr. Trump.

On Thursday, Revolution Wind LLC, a joint venture between Orsted and Skyborn Renewables, asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to prevent the administration from enforcing the stop-work order. The complaint alleges that the order was arbitrary and capricious in part because it appeared to be carried out under political pressure from the White House.

The attorneys general of Connecticut and Rhode Island also said that they would file a separate lawsuit Thursday in the United States District Court for Rhode Island to overturn the stop-work order.

The 65-turbine Revolution Wind project had obtained financing as well as all necessary permits from the Biden administration. Construction began in 2023, and the developers had said it was on track to produce enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next spring.

In their complaint, the developers said that they had already spent $5 billion on the project and would incur another $1 billion in financial penalties from failing to complete it, while also losing billions of dollars in future revenue if the project was canceled.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, the parent agency of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said it did not comment on pending litigation.

President Trump has been a vocal critic of wind firms for years, calling them ugly and inefficient. His administration has sharply escalated its attacks on the wind industry in recent months, moving to block not just future wind projects but also projects that have already been permitted and under construction.

The White House has also enlisted a half-dozen federal agencies to find new ways to thwart offshore wind as part of a governmentwide effort to suppress the industry. That includes asking the Health and Human Services Department to probe the health effects of wind turbines and the Department of Defense to find any national security concerns.

“President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.

In April, the Interior Department ordered that work be stopped at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of New York that had received all necessary approvals from the Biden administration and was already being built. After several weeks of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration allowed Empire Wind to proceed.

White House officials suggested they had done so only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. She denied that any such deal had been made.

Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant that was building Empire Wind, never ended up suing the administration over the monthlong pause. The company had warned that it was losing nearly $50 million per week while the project was halted and that it might have to abandon it altogether if the stop-work order continued for much longer.

Orsted is taking legal action more rapidly. The Danish government owns a 50.1 percent share in the company, which saw its stock price plunge to record lows last month after the stop-work order.

Denmark and the United States have repeatedly been at odds under the Trump administration, with Denmark rejecting Mr. Trump’s insistence that the United States take over Greenland. Last month, Denmark summoned the head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen after allegations that three Americans with ties to President Trump were running “covert influence operations” in Greenland.

In a statement, the developers behind Revolution Wind said that “the project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step.”

Gov. Ned Lamont, Democrat of Connecticut, said he was willing to work with the administration but it had not justified its decision to halt construction and that the state was acting “to preserve this vital project and protect the energy future of Connecticut and the entire New England region.”

Before it obtained federal permits, Revolution Wind went through a multiyear review process that included the Defense Department, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service and several other agencies.

Some legal experts have said that there is little basis for blocking projects that have already received permits.

Elizabeth Klein, who led the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management during the Biden administration, said the agency did have the ability to halt projects for national security reasons. But even in those cases, the agency is required to follow a process that includes a written notification describing the basis of its concerns. And the regulator would typically discuss issues with the developer rather than abruptly stop work without warning.

“Even under the most generous interpretation of what is happening here, if there were some issue that arose that suggested a threat, there would be a dialogue between the regulator and the proponent,” Ms. Klein said. “There’s no actual justification to stop the project.”

The administration is also pursuing other strategies for blocking offshore wind. On his first day in office, Mr. Trump ordered a sweeping halt to all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms. And it has sought to revoke permits for projects that have already been approved but are facing litigation by opponents.

On Wednesday the Trump administration said in another court filing that it planned to revoke federal approvals for the New England Wind project, about 20 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Construction has not yet begun, but if completed it would be one of the largest offshore wind projects in the country.

A group in Nantucket that is opposed to offshore wind, ACK for Whales, had filed a lawsuit to challenge New England Wind’s permits, saying that the project posed a danger to the endangered North Atlantic right whale. Scientists have said there is no evidence to link wind farms to whale deaths. In a filing, the Justice Department said that the lawsuit no longer needed to proceed since the administration was rescinding the project’s permit.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have sued the administration over Mr. Trump’s halting of federal approvals for wind projects.

The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts federal court, argued that the move violated the Administrative Procedure Act and harmed the efforts by states to secure energy and fight climate change while jeopardizing billions of dollars in investments. The Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a coalition of environmental and clean energy industry groups, later joined the suit as a plaintiff.

Administration lawyers countered that the injuries to New York were hypothetical rather than imminent and that the pause in federal permitting was necessary “based on concerns over potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews,” according to a memo signed by Michael K. Robertson, a trial attorney in the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Justice Department.

In July, Judge William G. Young narrowed the case but allowed it to proceed. A hearing was set to be held on Thursday afternoon.

Lisa Friedman contributed reporting.

The expenses, Mr. Newsom said, included $71 million for food and shelter, $37 million in payroll, more than $4 million in logistics supplies, $3.5 million in travel and $1.5 million for demobilization.

The Pentagon initially estimated that the activation would cost $134 million and last about 60 days. As of Thursday, the deployment has lasted 89 days, with about 300 troops remaining on orders that have been extended into November. Because the troops were commandeered by the White House, the deployment costs are a federal obligation.

In a statement, Mr. Newsom condemned the Los Angeles deployment as “political theater” that has sent “millions of taxpayer dollars down the drain” and corroded the readiness of the National Guard.

Mr. Newsom’s public-records request to military officials last month called on them to tell American taxpayers “how much this folly has cost them.” His office still has not formally received a response from the Defense Department to that request. The governor also requested cost calculations from the California National Guard, which supplied his office with the data.

The nearly $120 million figure is consistent with standard pay and support costs for the Marines and the National Guard. The total cost matched data supplied to the federal government, according to a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the deployment costs with the press.

At the height of the deployment, thousands of National Guard soldiers were being housed in a sprawling and hastily erected tent city south of Los Angeles at a military facility near Long Beach. Only a few hundred troops were assigned any duties away from the base. Many of those who were given outside assignments — largely to assist federal agents arresting undocumented immigrants in workplaces — were used illegally, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

Federal law generally prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement, and military officials who testified in court described an ongoing struggle to ensure that troops were not used by federal agents in ways that violated their authority or endangered the public. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the National Guard, including infantrymen and two officials in leadership roles, spoke of low morale during the deployment. They described troops who were demoralized, bored and questioning the mission. On the upside, they said, the federal activation meant better benefits and higher pay.

Most of the troops have since been released, with the remainder scattered across several federal facilities in Southern California. The Trump administration extended their activation last month, saying the troops are needed to protect federal buildings and personnel.

This week, Mr. Newsom asked the federal court to order their removal, saying that the extension amounted to an “intimidation” tactic in advance of a November special election on redistricting that could impact control of Congress in 2026.

Mr. Newsom’s announcement of the deployment costs came as other Democratic-led cities across the United States have braced for the presence of federal troops.

Mr. Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Washington, D.C., saying the military is needed there to fight crime. And he has suggested that the National Guard could be sent into Chicago, New Orleans and other cities.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power over the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s elected attorney general, who brought the suit, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

In the suit, Mr. Schwalb asks the court to declare that the orders sending the National Guard troops to Washington were illegal.

The lawsuit comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The key argument in the suit is similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been patrolling Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some have been picking up trash.

Many if not most of the National Guard soldiers have been deputized as U.S. Marshals. That gives the soldiers the power to detain people, the lawsuit asserts, establishing “a massive, seemingly indefinite law enforcement operation in the District subject to direct military command.”

The suit is the second the attorney general has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police. The judge’s comments during the initial court hearing suggested the city was likely to prevail, but after several hours of negotiation, the U.S. Attorney General agreed to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington was an outspoken supporter of that earlier lawsuit. While the mayor has expressed a willingness to work with federal law enforcement agents in addressing violent crime, she has criticized the presence of out-of-state National Guard troops in the city, saying they are not helping.

Still, the mayor deferred questions about Thursday’s lawsuit to Mr. Schwalb’s office. “My 100 percent focus is on exiting the emergency, and that’s where all of our energies are,” Ms. Bowser said to reporters at a school-related event.

The emergency that Mr. Trump declared in early August ends next week if Congress does not vote to extend it, and any authority that the Trump administration holds to direct local police actions expires with it.

But much of the federal intervention in D.C. in recent weeks, including the presence of National Guard troops, is not subject to the emergency declaration. Barring a judicial ruling, many of the soldiers and federal law enforcement agents now on the ground could remain indefinitely.

Republicans in Congress have applauded the intervention, and many are pushing to bring an even heavier federal hand onto Washington’s affairs.

The House Oversight Committee, whose jurisdiction includes D.C., is expected next week to take up a bill that would toughen the District’s crime laws with regard to juvenile offenders. It is also weighing a slate of bills to reshape Washington’s criminal justice system by adding tougher penalties for some offenses and rolling back sentencing reforms passed by local lawmakers, according to a draft summary that was shared with congressional offices and viewed by The New York Times.

Among the bills being considered are legislation that would lengthen or establish mandatory minimum sentences for many crimes and repeal second-chance legislation meant to allow some people to have their criminal records sealed or expunged. Another measure under discussion would impose a $500 fine or a prison sentence of up to 30 days on people who camp outdoors on public property in the District, a measure that appears designed to target homeless encampments that Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited in justifying his efforts in Washington. The legislation was reported earlier by The Washington Post.

There is also a measure that would significantly increase congressional oversight of D.C.’s elected government, giving federal lawmakers the authority to veto local regulations and mayoral executive actions, as well as broadening the veto power Congress already has regarding laws passed by the D.C. Council. That piece of legislation, which expands on a similar bill proposed last year, is tentatively called “The District of Columbia Home Rule Improvement Act.”

Rather than resign from his position as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Miran told lawmakers on the powerful Senate Banking Committee that he would take an unpaid leave of absence to fill a term on the Fed’s Board of Governors that is set to expire at the end of January. He cited the short tenure of the position and said the decision reflected the advice of counsel.

Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, called the arrangement “ridiculous.”

“Your independence has already been seriously compromised by your statement,” he added.

Senator Andy Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, suggested that the decision made it very likely that Mr. Miran would continue to be beholden to the president while serving at the central bank.

“You could very well be continuing to act in a way that is in the political interests of the president, because you know he is going to be your future boss again at the White House,” Mr. Kim said. “Why do you even want this job at the Fed for four months, if you’re just hedging your bets and just continuing to hold your position at the White House?”

The law stipulates that members of the Fed’s board “shall devote their entire time to the business of the board.”

The issue dominated a hearing that gave Republicans and Democrats their best opportunity yet to dig into the Trump administration’s plans to overhaul the central bank amid a relentless pressure campaign from the president, who wants the Fed to slash interest rates.

Mr. Miran’s hearing was hastily scheduled so that he could possibly be in place before the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 16 and Sept. 17. He was selected to fill the temporary position in August, after Adriana Kugler abruptly stepped down from her post five months before her term ended.

Mr. Miran sought to head off questions about his ability to make policy decisions free of political influence from the start of the hearing. In opening remarks, he said the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on major policy decisions, was an “independent group with a monumental task, and I intend to preserve that independence and serve the American people to the best of my ability.”

As the hearing got underway, he repeatedly pushed back on the idea that he would function as a “puppet” of Mr. Trump’s, as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, accused him of being on Thursday.

“No one — not the American public, not investors here at home, not the worldwide financial markets — will trust him as an independent voice,” she said. “Every claim he makes and every vote he takes will be tainted with the suspicion that he isn’t an honest broker, but that he is Donald Trump’s puppet.”

Mr. Miran said he had not been asked to make any pledge to lower interest rates and said his views would be determined by the economic data and his own analysis.

While Republicans appeared ready to confirm Mr. Miran, his assurances rang hollow for many Democrats on the committee, given the extent of the attacks being waged on the Fed.

Mr. Trump is already embroiled in a legal battle with Lisa Cook, a governor he is trying to oust over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Ms. Cook, who has not been charged or convicted of any wrongdoing, has sued to prevent her removal, teeing up what is expected to be a prolonged fight over the president’s ability to remove a Fed official “for cause.” That is typically interpreted to mean professional neglect or wrongdoing.

“Your nomination is getting rushed because the president is frustrated with the Fed for not cutting rates, and he wants loyalists on the Fed board,” said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota.

Mr. Miran did not talk about Ms. Cook’s case directly, but he did clarify when asked that he had not made false statements on any mortgage applications.

If Ms. Cook loses her case, Mr. Trump will have yet another opening on the Fed’s board to fill, tipping the balance of support further in his favor. The president will also get to nominate a new chair once the term of the current head of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, ends in May.

If Mr. Trump has a majority of governors in his corner, he is likely to command greater sway over an institution that is supposed to operate independently from the White House.

As a governor, Mr. Miran would be able to vote on every major policy decision the Fed makes, including on interest rates and the rules that govern Wall Street. He would also be involved in deliberations related to the inner workings of the Fed and its staff.

Lawmakers repeatedly brought up a paper that Mr. Miran co-wrote in 2024. The paper sharply criticized the central bank and concluded that its institutional setup made it prone to policy errors and that it was unaccountable to the very people it was supposed to serve. The paper also included a series of profound reforms for the central bank. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Miran called for an end to the “revolving door between the executive branch and the Fed” — the exact journey that he now finds himself taking.

As part of a radical reset, he called for shorter terms for top officials and the ability for the president to remove policymakers for any reason. Mr. Miran wanted the 12 regional reserve bank presidents to have more say in interest rate decisions, but to come under the control of state governors. He also sought to subject the central bank’s budget to the congressional appropriations process rather than maintaining the Fed’s autonomy.

Before joining the administration, he also floated the idea of weakening the value of the U.S. dollar in a bid to make American exports more competitive, a proposal known as the Mar-a-Lago Accord. He also highlighted the costs of the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, a position that stands in sharp contrast to how the Fed sees it.

The Fed, which is overseen by Congress, is obligated to set monetary policy in pursuit of low and stable inflation as well as a healthy labor market. The central bank’s longstanding inflation target is 2 percent, a level it has exceeded since consumer price growth accelerated in the pandemic.

Before Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on effectively all of the country’s major trading partners, inflation was easing. But price pressures have intensified again, leaving a divided Fed in a difficult spot in terms of what to do about interest rates. The labor market, meanwhile, has started to show more obvious signs of softening.

Officials are getting ready to restart cuts that were put on pause in January in recognition that the risks posed to the labor market are outweighing the risk of a persistent inflation problem. But policymakers are likely to move slowly once they get going again, keeping them at odds with the president’s demands for borrowing costs that are three percentage points lower than the current range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent.

Mr. Miran has been a vocal cheerleader of the president’s economic policies and is expected to press for what Mr. Trump wants at the Fed. But he would also have to be careful about alienating himself from his soon-to-be colleagues. Decisions related to interest rates and the balance sheet, for example, are made by a 12-person committee of the governors and a rotation of five regional Fed presidents.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to decide by Sept. 10 whether to review the case and to schedule oral argument for the first week of November — just one month after the court’s new term begins. If the justices accept the case, it would be the first to reach the court in Mr. Trump’s second term that directly tests the legality of one of the administration’s signature initiatives rather than addressing the president’s actions on a temporary emergency basis.

Since taking office, Mr. Trump has relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 as a central part of his efforts to force companies to invest in the United States.

Without the emergency powers, the president and his advisers have warned of major damage to the nation’s economy, military power and diplomatic relations, particularly if the government were forced to pay back some of the billions of dollars it has already collected in tariffs.

The lower court’s “erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the president’s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,” the solicitor general told the justices in his request for highly expedited review. The petition had not yet been publicly docketed on the court’s website late Wednesday, but its filing was confirmed by both sides in the litigation.

Other presidents have invoked the emergency statute, typically to issue sanctions, but Mr. Trump is the first to try to use the emergency powers to impose broad levies of 10 to 50 percent on trading partners.

In April, five small businesses and a dozen states sued, saying Mr. Trump’s actions were unlawful.

Lawyers for the coalition expressed confidence in their legal arguments late Wednesday.

“These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,” Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement.

A divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington last week upheld a lower court decision invalidating the tariffs and finding the president’s actions were not authorized by the emergency statute.

In its 7-to-4 ruling, the appeals court said the tariffs were a core constitutional power given to Congress and noted that the statute at issue did not include the word “tariffs” nor synonyms such as “tax” or “duty.”

“The power of the purse (including the power to tax) belongs to Congress,” the appeals court said in an unsigned opinion.

Mr. Trump used the emergency law early last month to tax imports from 90 countries. He previously invoked it to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico in response to what he said were those countries’ roles in the fentanyl trade.

The administration’s filing on Wednesday emphasized the importance of the tariffs to the president’s agenda and a need for the justices to act urgently.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers characterized the tariffs as the administration’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative,” which the president has “determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.”

A coalition of prominent conservative and libertarian lawyers, scholars and former officials filed a brief in June opposing Mr. Trump’s tariffs and emphasizing that the powers to tax must remain with Congress.

Under the act at issue in the case, the president can take certain steps in response to a declared emergency arising from an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” The law says that includes the power to regulate imports, language the Trump administration says means tariffs.

But the appeals court said the statute’s grant of power to the president to regulate imports did not authorize the particular tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump’s executive orders.

The majority did not address whether the president’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or whether the law ever permits a president to unilaterally impose tariffs.

In dissent, four judges nominated by presidents of both parties said the challengers had failed to show that the tariffs are not among the tools Congress permitted when it passed the 1977 law.

The statute “embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under nonemergency laws,” wrote Judge Richard G. Taranto, a nominee of President Barack Obama, who was joined by three other judges.

Harvard’s case centered on its research funding, and the university contended that the administration had compromised its First Amendment and due process rights when it sought to strip it away. The judge’s decision could give Harvard new leverage in its settlement talks with the White House.

Although the ruling was a milestone for Harvard, the only university to sue over the administration’s targeted assault on its research funding, President Trump had vowed to appeal any decision that went against him. His administration has spent months seeking to pressure Harvard in ways beyond research money, and while Judge Burroughs’s ruling may not put an end to that campaign, her opinion was a bracing rebuke.

“We must fight against antisemitism, but we equally need to protect our rights, including our right to free speech, and neither goal should nor needs to be sacrificed on the altar of the other,” Judge Burroughs wrote in an 84-page ruling. “Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs to take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be.”

She added, “Now it is the job of the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as required by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.”

As a part of the decision, Judge Burroughs said the Trump administration could not issue new blockades on Harvard’s federal research funding “in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on any purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms” of civil rights law.

The White House condemned the ruling.

“To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years,” said Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman. “Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future.”

She added that the government would “appeal this egregious decision, and we are confident we will ultimately prevail in our efforts to hold Harvard accountable.”

Hours after the White House’s statement, Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, said the university would “continue to assess the implications of the opinion, monitor further legal developments and be mindful of the changing landscape in which we seek to fulfill our mission.”

But, he said, Judge Burroughs’s ruling “affirms Harvard’s First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the university’s academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision came on the second day of classes for the new academic year and after both the government and the university asked her to issue what is known as summary judgment — a ruling on the case’s claims without a trial. She largely ruled for Harvard, relying on voluminous filings, a select batch of evidence and oral arguments in her Boston courtroom on July 21 to reach a decision.

Harvard brought the case in April, after the Trump administration insisted that the nation’s oldest university had become a wellspring of bigotry. On April 11, it sent the school a letter trying to condition Harvard’s access to federal research money on its acquiescence to a range of demands.

Those terms included audits, the establishment of “merit-based” admissions and hiring policies, the shutdown of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and an examination of “programs and departments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.”

Harvard refused on April 14. The administration took only hours to announce it would begin cutting off funding that Harvard, like other prominent universities, had long relied on to pay for research. The university sued a week later, accusing the government of ignoring its First Amendment protections and hastily barreling past the thicket of laws and regulations that govern how federal funding can be revoked.

“All told, the trade-off put to Harvard was clear: Allow the government to micromanage your viewpoints and your academic institution or jeopardize your ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries and innovative solutions,” lawyers for Harvard wrote in a court filing in June.

They added that the administration’s “content- and viewpoint-based attempt to coerce and control Harvard is blatantly unconstitutional.”

The Trump administration had insisted that it had the authority to cancel grants and contracts because, in its view, Harvard had not done enough to counter what it argued was rampant campus antisemitism. Federal research funds, the Justice Department asserted in one of its submissions to Judge Burroughs, were “not charitable gratuities.”

“Rather, the federal government grants funds to universities through contracts that include explicit conditions,” the Justice Department wrote, adding: “If they fail to meet these conditions, the grants are subject to cancellation.”

But the administration also hoped that Judge Burroughs would not issue much of a ruling at all. Its lawyers argued that an 1887 law meant that the suit, which the Justice Department depicted as a contractual matter, needed to be heard by a specialized court in Washington.

More recently, it urged the judge to consider the implications of an August decision by the Supreme Court in a different case. In that case, which also concerned federal grants, the court ruled that challenges to individual terminations should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. But it was a muddled ruling that left the door open for policy challenges in federal district courts.

Judge Burroughs acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision on Wednesday and said she was “endeavoring” to follow it, but she largely asserted her own court’s jurisdiction.

“The First Amendment claims here are about speech and whether the federal government is improperly infringing on the free speech rights of an academic institution and its employees,” she wrote. “The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is fundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of contract terms.”

And Judge Burroughs, as she had in her courtroom in July, resisted the government’s efforts to tie research money to accusations of civil rights violations.

Judge Burroughs wrote on Wednesday that it was “difficult to conclude anything other than that defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

But Harvard leaders have privately fretted over the potential fallout of a protracted fight with the federal government, even if they won in Judge Burroughs’s court, and chose months ago to start parallel settlement talks.

That did not keep the government from intensifying its pressure campaign against the school, including by issuing cumbersome subpoenas and opening new investigations, like one focused on Harvard’s patents.

The New York Times reported in July that the university was open to spending $500 million to resolve the matter, but that Harvard was seeking an array of provisions to protect its independence.

Although the university and the administration have continued to move toward a potential agreement, they have not reached a settlement. Mr. Trump, who has taken a special interest in the financial terms of pacts his administration has reached with universities, said last week that he wanted “nothing less than $500 million from Harvard.”

“They’ve been very bad,” Mr. Trump told the education secretary, Linda McMahon, during a televised cabinet meeting. “Don’t negotiate.”

But Harvard officials had anticipated that a favorable decision from Judge Burroughs could help the university’s approach to the negotiations in two essential ways.

Such a ruling, they have reasoned, gives them a new way to pressure a government that might not wish to fight the university all the way to the Supreme Court.

And school officials, ever mindful of the university’s internal politics, have hoped that a legal victory would help them to portray any deal with the White House as part of a surrender by the administration.

Joseph Sellers and Corey Stoughton, lawyers for other organizations that also sued the administration over the attack on Harvard, including the American Association of University Professors, said they welcomed Wednesday’s ruling as “a decisive victory for academic freedom and research in the public interest.”

But, they added, “We hope this decision makes clear to Harvard’s administration that bargaining the Harvard community’s rights in a compromise with the government is unacceptable.”

Judge Burroughs’s decision arrived at a moment of high tension for Harvard. Federal regulations had the university preparing to submit “closeout” paperwork for some terminated grants on Wednesday.

Without a ruling by Wednesday, the university had warned the judge, it feared that “the government will take the position that no restoration of funds is possible.”

According to court documents, the defendants operated a prolific alien smuggling operation (ASO) that facilitated the unlawful entry of Cuban nationals into the United States by preparing visa applications, laundering millions of dollars in payment, and exploiting the immigration process.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“This indictment exposes a criminal organization that smuggled people into the United States on a massive scale, and then fraudulently secured immigration benefits for them,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R.

The Criminal Division and our law enforcement partners will continue to dismantle these schemes, protect vulnerable people from exploitation, and safeguard the integrity of the U.S. immigration system.”

“The defendants in this case conspired with others to deliberately violate our nation’s immigration laws while personally seeking to enrich themselves,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe for the Middle District of Florida. “Because of the interagency coordination and diligence of our dedicated law enforcement agencies, their crimes have been thwarted. We will continue working with our partners to protect our national borders.”

“This superseding indictment exposes the depth of a multi-year conspiracy of alien smuggling, asylum fraud, and money laundering that preyed on vulnerable individuals and weakened public trust in the immigration system,” said Acting Director Todd M. Lyons of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “This highlights the critical role ICE has in dismantling these criminal networks, combating immigration fraud, and ensuring criminals who abuse our systems are held accountable. We are absolute in our resolve to protect the integrity of our immigration system and safeguard our national security.

“It is because of the unfettered Department of Justice support we charge criminals with every available statute to provide consequences to those that erode the moral fabric of our society,” said Chief Jeffrey J. Dinise of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Miami Sector. “The message is clear, the United States is closed to illegal immigration and terrorist organizations, and those that make an attempt, will be met with fierce consequences. We are committed to protecting our Florida communities and safeguarding our nation.”

“Through diligent investigation, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and our partners exposed a multi-national, multi-year, multi-million dollar criminal conspiracy operated by aliens that attempted to undermine our immigration system and flood our country with illegal aliens — none of whom had any intention of following our laws,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow. “This criminal organization operated a front for fake asylum claims, churning out frivolous applications around the country. To criminals who seek to exploit our immigration system: we will find you, shut down your schemes, and you will face justice.”

The superseding indictment charges:

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, 27, of Hialeah, FL (unlawfully residing in the United States);

Yuniel Lima-Santos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, 26, unlawfully residing in Lebanon, TN;

Marianny Lucia Lopez-Torres, 25, residing in Cuba, (formerly Hialeah, FL);

Frandy Aragon-Diaz, 33, of Cuba, (formerly unlawfully residing in Tampa, FL);

Erik Ventura-Castro, 23, residing in Hialeah, FL;

Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, 30, of Tampa, FL;

Walbis Pozo-Dutel, 30, residing in Katy, TX ;

Emanuel Martinez Gonzalez, 28, unlawfully residing in Hialeah, FL;

Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, 31, of Tampa, FL;

Layra Libertad Treto Santos, 31, of Tampa, FL; and

Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra, 40, of Tampa, FL.

According to the superseding indictment:

All defendants except Gisleivy Peralta Consuegra are charged with conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos and Frandy Aragon-Diaz are also charged with alien smuggling for financial gain.

Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Layra Libertad Treto Santos, and Gisleivy Peralta Consuerga are charged with conspiracy to commit asylum fraud.

Lazaro Alain Cabrera-Rodriguez, Yuniel Lima-Santos, Liannys Yaiselys Vega-Perez, Frandy Aragon-Diaz, Erik Ventura-Castro, Miguel Alejandro Martinez Vasconcelos, Luis Emmanuel Escalona-Marrero, and Layra Libertad Treto Santos are charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

From January 2021 through June 2025, the defendants promoted bogus visa services online, claiming Cuban nationals could secure U.S. entry through false claims of European citizenship. They filed hundreds of fraudulent Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) applications with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, using fake addresses and fabricated documents.

The ASO promoted its services on social media accounts and encrypted messaging platforms, including a WhatsApp group titled, “TRÁMITE DE ESTA Y VISA DE TURISMO A USA PARA CIUDADANOS ESPAÑOLES” (Processing of ESTA and tourist Visas to the USA for Spanish citizens). One promotional video advertised the scheme by showing stacks of passports, airline tickets, and visa approvals.

What began as a small operation grew into a commercial enterprise. The defendants charged clients between $1,500 and $40,000, sometimes even chartering private planes to move groups of aliens. Records show they spent over $2.5 million on flights alone and funneled more than $7 million through payment apps such as Zelle. Based on a financial analysis conducted of 27 known accounts associated with the defendants and their co-conspirators, the alien smuggling organization took in over $18 million during the course of the conspiracy.

The ASO also smuggled unaccompanied minors. In one case, a teenage girl was told to pose as the lifelong friend of an unrelated adult man when crossing the border.

The defendants operated a sham immigration business, ASESORIA Y SERVICIOS MIGRATORIOS LLC, which promised asylum filings, work permits, and residency applications. In reality, the company churned out boilerplate asylum claims without clients’ knowledge or consent and even blocked them from accessing their own USCIS online accounts.

ASESORIA marketed itself on Instagram with flashy ads for immigration services while simultaneously posting videos of aliens being smuggled into the country.

The investigation and superseding indictment were coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along southern and northern borders. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 410 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 355 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

HSI Tampa, U.S. Border Patrol Miami Sector, and USCIS’s’ Fraud Detection and National Security led U.S. investigative efforts, with substantial assistance from HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C. and CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force. Authorities in the Cayman Islands provided valuable assistance.

Trial Attorney Jenna Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Courtney Derry for the Middle District of Florida are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.

A Michigan woman has been indicted for her role in an international alien smuggling conspiracy which brought aliens, including children, from Central America into the United States across the northern border.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“The defendant is charged with conspiring to smuggle families, including young children, across our northern border for profit,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Smuggling organizations threaten the security of our borders and undermines public safety. The Criminal Division is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to disrupt smuggling networks wherever they operate and bring their members to justice.”

“Those who promote and profit from smuggling migrants into the country take advantage of vulnerable individuals without regard for the safety of others,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael P. Drescher for the District of Vermont. “The prosecution of Ms. Lozano should send a message that those who commit these offenses will be investigated and held responsible, not only for their own criminal acts but also for facilitating illegal border crossings by others. Thank you to our law enforcement partners at the U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for their collaborative investigative work to keep our communities and country safe.”

“Human smuggling is a ruthless criminal enterprise that exploits vulnerable individuals for profit without regard for their life and safety,” said Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Krol of HSI New England. “HSI remains steadfast in combating alien smuggling organizations and upholding the integrity of our borders.”

“I commend the unwavering dedication and vigilance of our agents in combating the dangers posed by smuggling operations along our northern border,” said Chief Robert N. Garcia of U.S. Border Patrol Swanton Sector. “Smuggling, whether it involves people, contraband, or other illicit activities, poses a significant threat to public safety and national security. The alleged actions of Norma Linda Lozano underscore the risks associated with these criminal enterprises and the critical need for robust enforcement efforts. I would also like to extend my appreciation to all of our partners in the investigation and indictment of Lozano. Their efforts are vital to ensuring that those who engage in these dangerous and illegal activities are held accountable.”

A federal grand jury charged Norma Linda Lozano, also known as Norma Linda Quintanilla Lozano, 53, of Ypsilanti, Michigan, with one count of conspiracy to smuggle aliens and six counts of bringing aliens to the United States for profit.

According to the indictment, from February through November 2024, Lozano participated in an alien smuggling organization (ASO) that brought and attempted to bring aliens from Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, including children, illegally into the United States from Canada. The ASO instructed the aliens to cross the border on foot, provided GPS coordinates and a description of Lozano’s vehicle, and coordinated their pick-up once inside the United States.

Lozano allegedly drove from Michigan to Vermont to meet the aliens at prearranged locations near the border. She then transported the aliens further into the United States, delivering them to residences, businesses, or airports. The aliens or their family members allegedly paid Lozano for smuggling services.

In one smuggling event, Lozano allegedly transported three aliens from Guatemala and El Salvador in her car, with a five-year-old girl. The child rode in the front passenger seat, and Lozano falsely claimed the child was her granddaughter. In another smuggling event, she allegedly transported six adults along with an eight-year-old girl and a 12-year-old boy. The girl was placed in the cargo area of the hatchback on top of luggage.

The investigation and indictment are the first brought in the District of Vermont coordinated under Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi.
“This case demonstrates the ability of Joint Task Force Alpha and its domestic and international law enforcement partners to dismantle the most lethal human smuggling networks.
Human smuggling organizations profit by exploiting the vulnerable, putting lives at grave risk for financial gain.
They allegedly recruited Guatemalan aliens, collected payment, and arranged for the aliens to travel by foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks, and tractor-trailers.","The Justice Department announced today that three Guatemalan nationals charged in connection with the Dec. 9, 2021 mass casualty event in Chiapas, Mexico, have been extradited from Guatemala to the United States to face prosecution. The crash of a tractor-trailer packed with at least 160 illegal aliens – many of them Guatemalan – killed more than 50 people, including unaccompanied children, and injured over 100 more.

Yesterday’s extraditions are the result of sustained coordination between the Justice Department and Guatemalan authorities following an international enforcement operation carried out on Dec. 9, 2024, the third anniversary of the tragedy. The extraditions mark yet another significant step in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring those responsible to justice.

“This DOJ is investigating and prosecuting human smuggling more aggressively than ever before, and Joint Task Force Alpha is the tip of the spear,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “We will not rest until those who profit from the suffering of vulnerable people — including many unaccompanied children — face severe, comprehensive justice.”

“Five Guatemalan smugglers charged in the Chiapas mass casualty incident are now in U.S. custody,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This case demonstrates the ability of Joint Task Force Alpha and its domestic and international law enforcement partners to dismantle the most lethal human smuggling networks. Human smuggling organizations profit by exploiting the vulnerable, putting lives at grave risk for financial gain. Even those smugglers who try to hide beyond the reach of the U.S. will be brought to justice for the death and suffering they have caused.”

“Human smugglers do not care if the people they transport live or die,” said U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei of the Southern District of Texas. “They do not care if unaccompanied children have food, water, or even air to breathe. They respect neither the law nor basic principles of decency. They care for only one thing — the blood money they make from the suffering of others. But these extraditions show that the United States will never tire in pursuing them. There is no border, no refuge that can shield these criminals from justice.”

Tomas Quino Canil, 37; Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino also known as Osvaldo ZQ, 25; and Josefa Quino Canil De Zavala, 43, were arrested in Boquerón, Guatemala on Dec. 9, 2024, pursuant to U.S. extradition requests, and were surrendered to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2025. A fourth Guatemalan national, Daniel Zavala Ramos also known as “Dany ZR,” 41, was arrested on Aug. 7, 2025 in Boquerón and is pending extradition.

Two additional defendants were also arrested during the coordinated operation. Alberto Marcario Chitic also known as Alberto De Jesus, 32, was also arrested in Boquerón on Dec. 9, 2024, and extradited to the United States in May 2025. Jorge Agapito Ventura also known as Jorge Ventura, George Ventura, and El Raitero, 33, was arrested at his residence in Cleveland, Texas.

All six defendants are each charged in the Southern District of Texas with conspiracy to bring undocumented aliens to the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injury, and resulting in death. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

According to court documents, from Oct. 2021 to Feb. 2023, the defendants conspired with other smugglers to transport undocumented aliens from Guatemala though Mexico to the United States. They allegedly recruited Guatemalan aliens, collected payment, and arranged for the aliens to travel by foot, inside microbuses, cattle trucks, and tractor-trailers. In some instances, including the smuggling of unaccompanied minors, the defendants provided scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended. Some of the aliens recruited by the defendants died or suffered serious bodily injury as result of the Dec. 9, 2021, crash.

HSI’s Counter Proliferation Investigations Group in Washington D.C. investigated the case in partnership with HSI Guatemala and HSI Mexico. Valuable assistance was provided by HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit; HSI Houston; HSI Laredo; U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center; Operation Sentinel; U.S. Border Patrol; Liberty County Constable, Precinct 6; ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Houston; U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas, Beaumont Division; and the Criminal Division’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT). The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs (OIA) provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions of the defendants. Guatemalan prosecutors and Mexican prosecutors from the Republic of Mexico’s Federal Prosecutions Office also known as Fiscalía General de la República (FGR), with the support of law enforcement officials from both countries, were also instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Senior Trial Attorney Danielle Hickman of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mary Lou Castillo and Jennifer Day for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case, with substantial assistance from HRSP Latin American Specialist/Historian Joanna Crandall.

The indictment of these defendants is the result of the coordinated efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders.

The data released by ICE also gave an insight into the criminality of the immigrants deported between the end of January and end of July.
Tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app, and 1.6 million illegal immigrants have left the United States population since January 20.""","New data from the Trump administration suggest a steady rise in immigrants self-deporting, after officials strongly encouraged those without legal status to voluntarily leave.

Newsweek has analyzed numbers released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, which provided recent records of immigrants to depart the U.S. through July 31, 2025.

Since President Donald Trump took office on January 20, ICE had deported 145,419 illegal immigrants from its detention centers, peaking in June with a total of 27,970.

A Small But Rising Number of Self-Deportees

The chart above details the different categories ICE gives for remoivals, including deportation on the grounds of inadmissibility and voluntary departure.

In February, the first full month of Trump's second term, confirmed voluntary departures were at 592, the data showed. By July, that number had climbed to 4,241.

The beginning of the increase roughly aligns with the repurposing of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) app. Under former President Joe Biden, CBP One was a tool for immigrants to book appointments with officials at the southwest border. The Trump administration transformed it into the CBP Home app, a tool for those without legal status to report self-deportation.

It was not immediately clear how many of those whom ICE marked as voluntary departures had used the CBP Home app to depart the country, and CBP has not published figures on the app's usage as of September 2025.

""One caveat on making judgements about use of this disposition is that it may or may not entirely reflect ICE policy, because [voluntary departure] is commonly offered by immigration judges too,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies told Newsweek.

Vaughan said it was important to note that 38 percent of voluntary departure cases under Trump came from the border, compared to 20 percent under Biden.

Has Trump Increased Deportations?

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has repeatedly touted high deportation numbers, but the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE have not published consistent data on removals.

Under Biden, DHS shared monthly updates on immigration enforcement, with ICE data for July 2024 showing around 25,000 removals by ICE. That number was 23,250 this July, according to the data released under FOIA.

""More generally, there has been a significant increase in interior enforcement and in corresponding removals under Trump compared to the exact same period under Biden,"" Vaughan said.

""Most notably, under Trump, ICE has removed nearly double the number of aliens with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, which will result in safer communities across the country. Part of the reason for this has been the much greater engagement with state and local law enforcement agencies under Trump.""

This data gives some insight into how ICE has moved to deport its detainees since inauguration day, totaling more than 145,000 removals in six months. The number marks an increase in ICE deportations from within the U.S. compared to the same period last year under Biden, but then more immigrants were being turned around and sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border instead.

""I'd say that total removals are not much higher than they were last year—which could mean that there is a hard capacity limit on total removals,"" David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek.

""Nonetheless, that the number of removals of recent border crossers have fallen because fewer people are entering, while the number of removals of people here for more than six months has increased threefold.""

What Do We Know About Deportees?

The ICE data provides a breakdown of each individual immigrant to have officially left the U.S. under its jurisdiction, meaning there are also details on their nationality and whether they committed any crimes while in the U.S.

The majority of those deported since late January were from Mexico, with monthly totals far outpacing other nationalities. In May, 12,211 Mexicans were deported or left voluntarily, with Guatemalans, Venezuelans and Hondurans following in the low-thousands.

Not all immigrants are sent back to the country they came from, often because the U.S. does not have agreements with those nations, or countries do not accept repatriation flights.

In June, 240 Chinese nationals were deported, though China itself took 235 of them. Venezuela, a country with which the U.S. has a strained relationship, also saw fewer repatriations.

The Trump administration has also touted its efforts to arrested and deport the ""worst of the worst"" – that is, illegal immigrants who have either been convicted of serious crimes, or face criminal charges.

The data released by ICE also gave an insight into the criminality of the immigrants deported between the end of January and end of July. While more than 60,000 had no criminal convictions or pending charges, the vast majority of those deported by ICE were suspected or known criminals.

Though data publishing remains inconsistent under the Trump administration, these figures suggest a marked increase in removals of known criminals compared to previous years. However, recent detention data has suggested most of those being held in ICE facilities do not have any criminal convictions or pending charges.

""After successfully ending the invasion of our country and securing our southern border, President Trump established the visionary Project Homecoming in May to create a smooth, efficient process for illegal aliens to return home,"" a senior DHS official told Newsweek.

""By using the CBP Home App, illegal aliens will receive a complimentary one-way plane ticket home, a $1,000 exit bonus, and forgiveness of any fines previously assessed for failure to depart. Tens of thousands of illegal aliens have utilized the CBP Home app, and 1.6 million illegal immigrants have left the United States population since January 20.""

The challenge for ICE now, coming up on nine months into Trump's second term, is to dramatically increase its enforcement numbers, from arrests through to deportations, as the president and his top advisor, Stephen Miller, are said to be demanding.

Under Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the agency has seen its budget supercharged, but more officers and expanded detention space will both take time to get online.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715839/immigration-enforcement.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 22:57:46.543889

That breaks down to $71 million for food, $37 million for pay, $4 million for logistics supplies, $3.5 million for travel and $1.5 million for ""demobilization costs,"" according to Newsom's office, which released the numbers Thursday, citing the California National Guard.

The Trump administration sent in the military in June after federal immigration raids sparked protests across the region. At the height of their deployment, around 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines were on the ground in Los Angeles.

Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled for the second time that Trump's deployment of the National Guard in L.A. was illegal. District Judge Charles R.

In the ruling, Breyer wrote that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are ""creating a national police force with the President as its chief.""

Trump appealed that ruling. He has also threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco.

Human Rights and Global Wrongs

Donald Trump appears fixated on “creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer wrote, holding that Trump’s deployment of federal troops to Los Angeles to enforce the immigration laws was illegal. Trump has already sent troops to Washington, D.C., and has also set his sights on Oakland, San Francisco, Chicago, and Baltimore.

Trump will appeal the ruling. The appellate courts will determine whether he will be allowed to use the military as his personal police force, notwithstanding the clear command of the Posse Comitatus Act.

In his 52-page decision, Breyer ruled that defendants Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “willfully” violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a 1878 law that prohibits the use of the military to enforce domestic laws. The act now forbids the willful use of “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus [power of the county] or otherwise to execute the laws.” It only allows exceptions that are expressly authorized by the Constitution or act of Congress, such as the Insurrection Act, which Trump did not invoke.

Breyer concluded that, “at Defendants’ orders and contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws” in and around Los Angeles. “Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence.”

On June 7, without the consent of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump issued an edict under 10 U.S.C. section 12406 to activate National Guard units for “the enforcement of Federal law and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”

In his edict, Trump also wrote that “To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws, they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

Not limiting his order to California, Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles for 60 days at the discretion of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. That number was later increased to 4,000 and the defendants also mobilized 700 Marines to deploy to Los Angeles. Three months later, 300 members of the National Guard remain stationed in L.A.

“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” Breyer noted. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”

Newsom and the State of California filed this case on June 9, and Breyer then found that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense illegally deployed federal troops to L.A. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled Breyer and held that the defendants had properly mobilized the troops under 10 U.S.C. section 12406, But the appellate court didn’t weigh in on the plaintiffs’ assertion that defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

Facts Adduced at Trial

Breyer presided over a trial from August 11 to August 13 that dealt with the merits of the plaintiffs’ Posse Comitatus claim.

It was established at trial that in early June 2025, “ICE targeted ‘several locations in downtown LA and its immediate surroundings’ that are ‘known to have significant migrant populations and labour-intensive industries’ … Public protests quickly followed.” Breyer wrote that the L.A. Police Department and the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department “responded to these protests and maintained control of the situation.”

Nevertheless, the defendants deployed military forces to L.A. and they were put under the control of Task Force 51, which received training on the permissible scope of their activities under the Posse Comitatus Act. Their training materials said that “active-duty military personnel may not provide ‘direct, active assistance to civilian law enforcement authorities by performing law enforcement functions,’ unless a Constitutional or an Act of Congress exception specifically permits it.”

Task Force 51 was given a list of “Prohibited Law Enforcement Functions,” which included “active, direct”: (1) Pursuit, (2) Arrests, (3) Apprehension, (4) Search, (5) Seizure, (6) Security patrols, (7) Traffic control, (8) Riot control, (9) Crowd Control, (10) Evidence collection, (11) Interrogation, and (12) Acting as Informants. But Task Force 51 troops were orally instructed that 4 of 12 listed functions that were highlighted in red — security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, and riot control — “were subject to a so-called constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer noted.

Moreover, the Defense Department instructed the Northern Command and Task Force 51 “that the President and Secretary’s June 7 memoranda created a constitutional exception to the Posse Comitatus Act and thereby authorized Task Force 51 to engage in the four functions listed in red,” Breyer added.

Task Force 51 troops and some Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wore camouflage uniforms, which made it difficult to differentiate them at a distance. Task Force 51 troops carried weapons with live ammunition.

“The presence of Task Force 51 deterred engagement by the public, especially by those who might have attempted to hinder or protest an arrest by ICE agents,” Breyer noted.

Breyer Rejects Trump’s Invention of a “Constitutional Exception” to Posse Comitatus

The defendants argued that there is a “constitutional exception” to the Posse Comitatus Act, which gives the president inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, personnel, and functions.

“Under this ‘constitutional exception,’ as Defendants call it, the President has inherent constitutional authority to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions, so any actions that can be construed as such ‘protection’ are lawful in spite of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Breyer wrote. “This assertion is not grounded in the history of the Act, Supreme Court jurisprudence on executive authority, or common sense.”

The judge cited the defendants’ knowing contradiction of their own training manuals and their refusal to coordinate with state and local officials. Breyer noted that Trump, Hegseth, and the Department of Defense “‘coach[ed]’ federal law enforcement agencies as to what language to use when submitting requests for assistance in an attempt to circumvent the Act … These actions demonstrate that Defendants knew that they were ordering troops to execute domestic law beyond their usual authority. Whether they believed that some constitutional or other exception applied does not matter; ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse.’”

During the trial, Breyer was incredulous at the defendants’ arguments. “Are you saying because the president says it, therefore it is?,” the judge asked. “In other words, we’re going to see federal officers everywhere if the president determines there’s some threat to the safety of a federal agent.”

Breyer Issues a Narrow Injunction

Breyer issued an injunction forbidding the defendants from using the National Guard troops currently deployed to Los Angeles from enforcing the law. Defendants are not required to withdraw the 300 National Guard troops from L.A. And they are not prevented from using the troops for purposes consistent with the Posse Comitatus Act, such as protecting federal property.

Under Breyer’s order, Hegseth and the Department of Defense are enjoined from:

deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops heretofore deployed in California, to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until Defendants satisfy the requirements of a valid constitutional or statutory exception, as defined herein, to the Posse Comitatus Act.

This order applies only to the defendants’ use of the National Guard in California, not nationally. Breyer stayed his injunction until September 12, 2025, ostensibly to provide the defendants an opportunity to appeal his ruling.

True to form, Trump reacted to the ruling by calling Breyer “a radical left judge.”

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who filed the lawsuit, applauded Breyer’s decision. The ruling “affirms that President Trump is not King, and the power of the executive is not boundless,” Bonta said in a news release. He added:

For more than two months, the President has engaged in political theater, using National Guard troops and Marines as pawns to further his anti-immigrant agenda. In doing so, he trampled on one of the very basic foundations of our democracy: That our military be apolitical and the activities of troops on U.S. soil be extremely limited to ensure civil liberties and protect against military overreach.

But in light of the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision giving presidents monarchical powers, a ruling that reverses Breyer’s decision would not be surprising.

“The stakes are huge,” Eric J. Segall, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law, told the Los Angeles Times. “If this District Court decision is reversed by either the 9th Circuit or the Supreme Court or both … the Trump administration would go hog wild.”

Trump, who is already going hog wild on a near daily basis, could then militarize cities across the country and terrorize us all.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232800010-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 15:57:06.797635

It was recently reported by Jack Poulson on Substack that ICE has reactivated its 2 million dollar contract with Paragon Solutions, a cyber-mercenary and spyware manufacturer.

The reactivation of the contract between the Department of Homeland Security and Paragon Solutions, a known spyware vendor, is extremely troubling.

This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses

Paragon's “Graphite” malware has been implicated in widespread misuse by the Italian government. Researchers at Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and with Meta found that it has been used in Italy to spy on journalists and civil society actors, including humanitarian workers. Without strong legal guardrails, there is a risk that the malware will be misused in a similar manner by the U.S. Government.

These reports undermine Paragon Solutions’s public marketing of itself as a more ethical provider of surveillance malware.

Reportedly, the contract is being reactivated because the US arm of Paragon Solutions was acquired by a Miami based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, and then merged into a Virginia based cybersecurity company, REDLattice, allowing ICE to circumvent Executive Order 14093 which bans the acquisition of spyware controlled by a foreign government or person. Even though this order was always insufficient in preventing the acquisition of dangerous spyware, it was the best protection we had. This end run around the executive order both ignores the spirit of the rule and does not actually do anything to prevent misuse of Paragon Malware for human rights abuses. Nor will it prevent insider threats at Paragon using their malware to spy on US government officials, or US government officials from misusing it to spy on their personal enemies, rivals, or spouses.",https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/mobile-privacy.png,N,,2025-09-04 15:57:16.330297

Ms. McIver, 39, was charged in May with assaulting and interfering with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after a confrontation involving the city’s mayor, Ras J. Baraka.

She has pleaded not guilty. And on Wednesday afternoon seven Republicans joined with Democrats to block a resolution that would have led her to be censured and removed from the Committee on Homeland Security.

Ms. McIver, a first-term House member from Newark, was outside the detention center on May 9 when agents, wearing masks and camouflage gear, moved in to arrest Mr. Baraka on trespassing charges, leading to a volatile scrum. Video showed her pushing toward the gates and being pushed from behind after Mr. Baraka was handcuffed.

Ms. McIver was there for a House oversight visit and, immediately after the incident, was invited into the facility and led on a tour with two of her Democratic colleagues, Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez.

Ten days later, Alina Habba, New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, announced in a news release that she was dropping the trespassing charge against Mr. Baraka — but would pursue charges against Ms. McIver. A grand jury later handed up an indictment that accused Ms. McIver of “forcibly grabbing” one agent and “using her forearms” to strike a second agent as she sought to block the mayor’s arrest.

Representative Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, moved to censure Ms. McIver and remove her from Homeland Security — a committee he quit last week, noting that he was no longer in sync with fellow Republican committee members who were “more in alignment with the less conservative factions of our conference.”

Mr. Higgins’s resolution argues that Ms. McIver’s actions “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that the charges she faced presented a conflict of interest on a committee that oversees federal immigration enforcement.

The House clerk who read the resolution aloud on Wednesday afternoon was repeatedly interrupted by a chorus of boos, only to be told: “Read over them.”

Then, Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, moved to table the resolution, drawing supportive votes from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans and two Republican members of the Ethics Committee, who might eventually be asked to consider ethics violations tied to the incident.

The resolution could be reconsidered at a later date.

In a statement, Mr. Higgins called out the Republicans who either supported Ms. Clark’s motion or abstained from taking a position by voting “present”: Representatives Don Bacon of Nebraska; Mike Flood of Nebraska; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Mike Turner of Ohio; David Valadao of California; Andrew Garbarino of New York; and Nathaniel Moran of Texas.

“Talk to these guys,” Mr. Higgins said. “They’re the Republicans who failed to stand with federal law enforcement.”

Ms. McIver reacted with trademark defiance on Tuesday night when it became clear that Mr. Higgins’s effort to oust her from the committee would reach the House floor.

“Instead of making life any better for the people he represents, he’s seeking to punish me for doing what he and his caucus are too cowardly to do: conduct real oversight, stand up to this administration and do our jobs,” she said in a statement. “If House Republicans think they can make me run scared, they’re wrong.”

At the center of the controversy is the Newark detention center, which is known as Delaney Hall and is run by one of the country’s largest private prison companies, GEO Group. It has a contract with ICE to hold as many as 1,000 migrants at risk of deportation in its two-floor jailhouse.

In the weeks before Mr. Baraka’s arrest, he had argued in court and in visits to Delaney Hall that it had not been fully inspected and was operating without a valid certificate of occupancy.

His concerns about the safety of the facility proved prescient when, weeks later, unrest over food portions and crowding ended only after four men escaped through a jailhouse wall. The men lowered mattresses to the ground on June 13 and then lashed bedsheets together to escape, according to court records. The last of the four men was located and rearrested five weeks later.

Ms. Habba, a former personal lawyer to Mr. Trump, has led the U.S. attorney’s office since late March, courting controversy as she pursued high-profile cases against New Jersey Democrats. After district court judges declined to extend her tenure, the Justice Department resorted to an extraordinary series of legal maneuvers to keep her in office. That drew immediate legal challenges to her authority from several defendants in pending criminal cases.

Last month, a federal judge concluded that Ms. Habba has not been the lawful leader of the office since July 1, but he delayed the effect of the ruling until after the matter is reviewed by an appeals court, leaving the federal courts in New Jersey at a virtual standstill.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/03MET-McIVER-pckw/03MET-McIVER-pckw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 17:56:51.796154

In President Trump’s August 11 emergency declaration, he invoked Section 740 of the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to declare an emergency in D.C. and require the “services” of the Metropolitan Police Department for “Federal purposes,” which is the one statutory exception to local control of MPD.

Even under Section 740, Congress reserved day-to-day control of MPD to D.C.’s local elected officials, not to the federal government. And under Section 740, MPD services are to be used for “Federal purposes” under emergency conditions. By attempting to give the federal government full operational control of MPD, including its local law enforcement efforts, for the purpose of addressing crime in the city, which is at a 30-year low, President Trump has far exceeded his statutory authority under Section 740.

The Trump administration’s attempted D.C. takeover is a frightening step in President Trump’s ongoing weaponization of government against his perceived political opponents. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has used federal law enforcement to seemingly threaten and intimidate his critics, and is now encroaching on D.C. local affairs to intimidate the city’s residents. This aggressive use of law enforcement stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s conduct during the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump group, when he failed to promptly mobilize federal law enforcement as violence persisted in the Capitol for hours, resulting in the death of a Capitol Police officer and injuries to approximately 140 other law enforcement officers.

President Trump’s interference in local law enforcement matters is not limited to just D.C. In June, the Trump administration sent the California National Guard into Los Angeles to quell protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policy without the consent of the state’s governor, and the Pentagon is reportedly preparing to send the Illinois National Guard into Chicago despite the opposition of the state’s governor. Attempting to take over law enforcement in those cities disrupts the delicate balance of state and federal power established by the Constitution.

The attempted D.C. takeover highlights the city’s precarious legal status and the need for statehood. It also may be a testing ground for more extreme authoritarian action in the future. Congress must stand up against this unjustified attack on D.C. and the Constitution by passing H.J. Res. 115 to end the D.C. takeover.",https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DCDeployment-1200x630.png,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:02.969239

Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week.","Guatemalan migrant children say they remain “traumatized” and “depressed” after the Trump administration attempted to quietly remove them from the United States during the holiday weekend despite having pending immigration cases, according to new court declarations.

A declaration by a 16-year-old describes how multiple Guatemalan children at a Texas shelter were awoken in the middle of the night Saturday and told they would be returned to their native country in a matter of hours.

“I am afraid to return to Guatemala,” said the teen, who fled Guatemala last year following their sister’s murder, according to a court declaration. “I was worried that I would be killed.”

“At around 2:30 a.m., I called my mother to tell her I might be deported to Guatemala. My mom started crying,” states the declaration from the teen, who is only identified by the initials A.J.D.E. in court records.

The mother, who lives in Guatemala, was not aware of any plan to have her child removed from the U.S., according to the teen’s declaration. “She does not want me to return. She does not have the resources to care for me. My father is not a part of my life. I have no other family who could receive me.”

Thirteen other declarations from teens like A.J.D.E, most of whom are 16 and 17, were filed in court Wednesday as part of the ongoing legal challenge that on Labor Day weekend temporarily blocked the removals of any unaccompanied Guatemalan child in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement who does not have a final removal order.

In the documents, the teens describe fearing gang recruitment in their home country as well as violence from relatives, criminal organizations and even the Guatemalan government.

A.J.D.E.’s declaration said he still feels “totally traumatized. ... I don’t even know how to explain it.”

A 17-year-old at another Texas shelter woke up at 2 a.m. Sunday so scared that “I felt like I lost my breath for a second.” In a declaration, the teen, identified in court records by the initials A.R.M.D., stated: “I just keep thinking about them trying to return me to Guatemala. I feel depressed.”

The U.S. government and Guatemalan officials have said their efforts to remove unaccompanied Guatemalan children in ORR custody are “repatriations” and “reunifications of children,” according to court transcripts and public statements. The removals are part of an agreement reached between the two nations following Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to Guatemala in July.

But legal advocates representing the minors dispute that the attempted removals were “repatriations” and not attempted deportations, stating there’s no indication that ICE is complying with obligations “to provide access to counsel or with the mandated safeguards it must implement before children agree to voluntary departure,” according to the lawsuit.

“If these are benign repatriations, that’s not how they happen,” said Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, the organization that filed the lawsuit blocking the minors’ removal to Guatemala. He spoke at a virtual congressional briefing on Tuesday.

Dozens of advocates and organizations providing legal immigration services to many of these minors have characterized the attempted removals as “unlawful” because they disregarded a series of legal protections Congress granted to unaccompanied migrant children who are in federal custody as they go through immigration proceedings.

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 outlines some of these protections. It generally requires children be placed in the “least restrictive setting possible” throughout the duration of their immigration proceedings. It also establishes protocols for safe repatriations and family reunifications to ensure the safety of these unaccompanied minors, who are considered among the most vulnerable migrant children.

Under these protocols, a child can request a voluntary departure that must be authorized by an immigration judge to ensure the child is not being coerced to return or a parent can come forward to claim their child.

In their court declarations, the unaccompanied children said they don’t want to go back to Guatemala or that their parents never requested their return.

Other declarations submitted by the attorneys representing the minors also included statements from some of their parents in Guatemala saying they never asked for their children to be returned.

Jennifer Anzardo Valdes, director of children’s legal services at the International Rescue Committee, told NBC News that two unaccompanied Guatemalan teenage girls her organization represents in Texas went before an immigration judge last Friday and were told their names were on a list of children who wanted to return to Guatemala.

“The children told the judge that was not true and that they were scared to go home,” Anzardo Valdes said. “So the judge continued the case for them to be able to continue their immigration application.”

Still, both girls and a third unaccompanied minor that IRC represents were picked up from their foster homes in the middle of the night and put on a bus. They were kept for over 12 hours Sunday before being returned to an ORR facility without the ability to say goodbye to their original foster families, according to Anzardo Valdes.

“All of them were really sad to be pulled away from their foster home,” she said.

They were also “terrified,” Valdes said, pointing out that one of the girls is Mayan, which is the largest Indigenous group in Guatemala. The girl said she comes from “a community where kids disappeared” and thought “that was going to happen to me.”

It is estimated that the federal government intends to remove up to 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children from the U.S., according to whistleblower reports cited by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon in a letter he sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement last week.

Court records show immigration authorities placed at least 76 minors in planes to Guatemala that were later grounded. Another judge in Arizona blocked the removals of 53 other Guatemalan minors in the state last week. Court declarations and accounts from organizations providing legal immigration services to the children show that minors in ORR custody across at least eight states are at risk of being removed under these circumstances.

“Children who are in ORR custody have fled difficult circumstances. Some have been orphans, some have been persecuted, abandoned, trafficked or sold,” said Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, during the virtual congressional briefing Tuesday.

“All of them have experienced significant trauma that remains ongoing,” Aber said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250904-guatemalan-children-ch-0955-727857.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 14:58:05.984593

(WTVO) — As Chicago prepares for a surge of immigration enforcement agents, the city of Rockford issued a statement Wednesday in solidarity with its noncitizen community, with the warning that ICE operations could extend to the Forest City.

The City posted a notice to its Facebook page in both English and Spanish, saying, “We are aware that Homeland Security recently confirmed plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago. While there is no confirmation that these operations will extend to Rockford, we recognize it is a possibility. And, we also recognize the fear and uncertainty this news may cause.”

“It’s also important to be clear – the Rockford Police Department follows the Illinois Trust Act. We do not participate in ICE raids, nor will we,” the statement continued. “To our immigrant neighbors: please know this — you are valued, you are cared for and you are an important part of who we are.”

Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd also released a statement, saying, “It is important for our community to know that the enforcement of civil immigration laws is the responsibility of federal agencies, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as stated in the Illinois Trust Act. Our duty is to protect and serve everyone in our community, regardless of immigration status.”

The TRUST Act, signed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) in 2017, prevents state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

According to ICE, those arrested as part of the nationwide effort had criminal histories, including sexual assault, robbery, drug and weapons charges, and domestic violence, the agency said.

The Department of Homeland Security conducted operations in Rockford in mid-June, but it has not been confirmed whether the agents were from ICE.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said federal troops will be coming to Chicago as part of an immigration enforcement effort, but did not give a timeline for the operation.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker held a news conference later that day, saying the head of the Illinois State Police had received a call from Customs and Border Protection’s chief patrol agent Gregory Bovino on Saturday.

The governor said the White House began positioning armed federal agents and military vehicles at the Great Lakes Naval Base on Monday.

“Unidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they’re targeting violent criminals,” Pritzker said, adding that he expects to see videos of “them hauling away mothers and fathers traveling to work or picking up their kids from school.”

“We have reason to believe that [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,” he continued.

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said undocumented immigrants should “prioritize your health, mental wellness, and safety above all else.”

Pritzker characterized undocumented immigrants in Chicago as “law-abiding individuals who pay taxes and pay taxes and contribute to the communities.”

“In other words, they’re following the law,” Pritzker said.

U.S. federal law (8 U.S. Code § 1325), makes it illegal for someone to enter the United States at any time or place between an official port of entry.

Pritzker also said he believed “Trump and his team will be looking for any excuse to put active duty military on our streets, supposedly to protect ICE,” and said “We have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois.”

Chicago is home to a large population of undocumented immigrants, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with Trump‘s mass deportation agenda.

The Governor said the Chicago surge is expected to last 30 days.",https://www.mystateline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/09/Rockford-welcome-sign.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:54.265024

Training to become an immigration judge Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).
Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.
But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.
There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges.","There is no precedent in peacetime for using military lawyers in civilian courtrooms — the last time U.S. military officers exercised judicial authority over civilians was under martial law during World War II, a practice the Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional. Now, the Pentagon’s plan to use its military lawyers as immigration judges is setting a precedent with no clear limits that could fundamentally reshape civil-military relations in the United States.

“Whatever happens here is going to establish some precedent for future administrations, and if we normalize using military resources to address civilian government staffing challenges, which is ultimately what this is, we are fundamentally altering the nature of American governance,” Ira Rushing, an associate at the Tully Rinckey law firm, told Federal News Network.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week approved a plan to detail up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges — an effort aimed at easing a backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has grown in recent years.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told Federal News Network the Defense Department is currently identifying Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details; these attorneys will “augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.” These military lawyers will serve as immigration judges for about six months, but their assignments can be renewed.

It is unclear what authority the DoD is using to lend its attorneys to the Justice Department. Rushing said the administration appears to be relying on Title 10 authority, which allows the Defense Department to provide support to civilian agencies as long as it does not violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of active-duty military forces for domestic law enforcement.

At the same time, there are other laws, such as the Economy Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act, that allow interagency support.

But immigration judges are not just federal employees performing administrative functions — they hold judicial power that directly affects individual liberty interests.

“There’s really never been this question of military personnel themselves serving in a quasi-judicial civilian role, I know what the mindset is — we want to use these military lawyers to do these administrative law roles and that’s not law enforcement. It’s just administrative law. But it really threads this needle by arguing that adjudicating civil immigration cases doesn’t constitute law enforcement, because immigration enforcement itself involves detention, removal proceedings and determinations that directly affect personal liberty,” Rushing said.

“While the immigration proceedings are technically civil rather than criminal, the Supreme Courts recognize this quasi-criminal nature of immigration proceedings, given the severe consequences. We are theoretically doing administrative law, but the effect is in law enforcement,” he added.

In addition, if the National Guard and Reserve members are involuntarily called up for this duty under Title 10 rather than Title 32, it is unclear what funds would be used to pay them.

“Can you have an appropriation under Title 10 that pays National Guardsmen to act as a civilian judicial officer? I don’t know. Those are going to be some questions that will probably be flashed out pretty heavily here in the next couple of weeks,” Rushing said.

There is also the issue of judicial independence that comes from putting military officers into judicial roles. U.S. judges are supposed to be free from outside pressures and make impartial decisions based solely on facts and law, but military lawyers remain in a chain of command that could expose them to unlawful command influence.

“What’s going to happen to a Judge Advocate who makes several decisions in favor of the people going through the immigration proceeding? What’s going to be the effect on their career if they make a bunch of decisions that this administration doesn’t like?” Rushing said.

In the end, detailing military judges to the Justice Department is a decision the administration has every right to pursue, Rushing said. But ultimately the question is not whether this is legal or practical — it is whether this is the precedent the U.S. wants to set for the relationship between military and civilian authority.

“Using military officers to adjudicate civil proceedings involving lawful permanent residents in some cases, and asylum seekers on U.S. soil during peacetime — it’s just going to be the Wild West. We’ve always maintained this clear separation between military and civilian spheres. And that’s not tradition. It’s fundamental to democratic governance. But once you start using military personnel to perform what are inherently civilian governmental functions, you erode that boundary,” Rushing said.

“I think a lot of concern from some people is, ‘Today it’s immigration judges. Tomorrow, could it be administrative law judges for social security claims? What about the tax court?’ The principle being established here that military personnel can be deployed, essentially to address civilian judicial backlogs, really has no natural limiting principle. And how does this look internationally? We’ve always criticized other nations for military involvement in civilian justice systems,” he added.

Training to become an immigration judge

Traditionally, immigration judges are appointed by the Attorney General and serve within the Department of Justice’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR).

Until recently, the qualifications for immigration judges included admission to a state bar, several years of post bar legal experience and demonstrated knowledge of immigration law.

“A lot of people say immigration law is second only to tax law in its complexities,” Rushing said.

Immigration judges are part of the excepted service, meaning they fall outside the competitive civil service system, but they still require specific qualifications and vetting.

But the administration said it would waive those requirements to allow military lawyers to fill the roles.

“Some people have said it is like going to a cardiologist for hip surgery,” Rushing said.

Over the course of their careers, military lawyers usually gain experience as prosecutors, trial counsel and defense attorneys — they handle cases ranging from minor offense such as absence without leave to serious crimes including sexual assault, murder or espionage. They also get experience practicing international and operational law. But they get little to no exposure to immigration law during their military service.

“You theoretically could get all of the training and instruction you needed, but it’s going to be really hard, because a lot of these people who are really good at immigration law have been doing it for years and years and years, and most military lawyers typically do a little bit of everything, but really not immigration,” Rushing said.

Parnell said the Defense Department is “committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skills and dedication of America’s service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order and protect the American people.”

What’s next

Rushing said it is unclear who would even have standing to challenge this decision in courts.

“We would have to wait for, say, an asylum seeker to not like their decision and sue based on the lack of qualifications of the judge that handled their case,” he said.

“If you think of this purely as a federal administrative personnel move, I don’t know if we’ll see it in the courts as quickly as we’ll see it just having to kind of play out in a fumbling sort of manner over the next few weeks,” Rushing added.

There are also no standard operating procedures or guidelines for how military lawyers should operate as immigration judges. “It’s going to fall on a lot of military lawyers themselves to figure out what it looks like,” Rushing said.

The lawsuit alleges the president’s unilateral deployment of National Guard troops from other states to patrol the city without the mayor’s consent violates the Home Rule Act, which gives Washington residents control over local affairs, with Congress retaining ultimate authority over the district.

The lawsuit, filed by city Attorney General Brian Schwalb, argues that President Donald Trump “disregarded Congress’s decision, half a century ago, to afford the residents of the District ‘the powers of local self-government,’ including the authority to police the District as they see fit. In so doing, he has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy—that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Schwalb said in a statement to NBC News. “It’s DC today, but could be any other city tomorrow. We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

The city’s lawsuit comes the same week that a federal judge ruled the federal government illegally deployed National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in June in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, the federal law that generally prohibits the U.S. military from acting as domestic law enforcement.

At the same time as the city is pushing back on the deployment of the National Guard, D.C.

The agreement, known as 287(g), was signed by the City Manager and Police Chief without a commission vote.

Some commissioners expressed concern over potential retaliation from Gov. Ron DeSantis if they oppose the agreement.

Should it stay, or should it go?

The Tallahassee City Commission is biding its time in determining what to do about the immigration enforcement assistance agreement between the Tallahassee Police Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In a unanimous vote Sept. 3, commissioners followed the lead of Mayor John E. Dailey, who asked that the city wait for further judicial review in connection to an ongoing case in South Florida before moving forward with any resolutions.

That case questions whether Florida cities and towns are required to enter immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. The specific agreement in question, known as 287(g), allows ""ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to partner with state and local law enforcement to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S.,"" according to the ICE website.

The city's 287(g) agreement with the feds never reached commissioners but was instead signed by City Manager Reese Goad and Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell, who are both appointed.

The issue was a continuation from the commission's August meeting. Commissioners once again expressed concern over retaliation threatened by Gov. Ron DeSantis in regards to threats made to sitting local elected officials that they will be removed from office if they oppose the agreement.

""Diverting our law enforcement to help ICE ... take immigrants, who serve a major purpose in Florida, off the streets is not only inhumane but not necessary,"" said one public speaker, Sue Massa. ""I'd like to encourage the city to step up like they did during COVID and refuse and rescind the agreement they signed. Simple as that.""

City commissioners talk about commitment to community

Commissioner Jeremy Matlow kicked off discussion by claiming that what was happening with law enforcement was just profiling: ""I had a troubling conversation with a friend of mine since our last meeting. He got pulled over by the Florida Highway Patrol and the first question he was asked was, 'Are you a U.S. citizen?' ""

Matlow, also a mayoral candidate, added: ""To the threat of removal from office: Remove me. I'll be back. The governor didn't send me here.""

Commissioner Jack Porter piggybacked on Matlow's comments: ""We're the last line of defense in a state where we don't have our governor standing up for us, (nor) our attorney general and certainly not our federal government. If we allow ourselves to be silenced, we are allowing ... residents to be silenced.""

Commissioners Curtis Richardson and Dianne Williams-Cox had previously expressed hesitation on sending a message, pointing specifically to threats of losing their seats. While the hesitation remained, they said that it had nothing to do with their beliefs.

""I've taken a stand. I stood when the governor sought to remove black history from our schools. I stood at a press conference and declared that slavery was not good for us,"" Williams-Cox said. ""Don't tell me that I need to take a stand. I'm taking the stand but, unfortunately, I didn't see you standing with me.""

Dailey assured the community the commission would do the best they can.

""I'm extremely concerned about federal agents that are masked in other communities across this country, that are arresting people and carrying them away,"" Dailey said. ""We do have a responsibility to take care and protect this community, and we're going to do everything we possibly can.""","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/29/PTAL/83919803007-img-6477.jpg?crop=4031,2269,x0,y377&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-04 13:57:31.683081

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.","CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago community leaders forged ahead Wednesday with preparations for the influx of National Guard troops and immigration agents the city is expecting, advising residents about their rights and organizing protests with fresh urgency.

Details about the operation are scant, but President Donald Trump has amped up the rhetoric about crime in the nation’s third-largest city, saying an immigration crackdown and National Guard deployment are planned despite the objections of local leaders and a federal court ruling that a similar deployment in Los Angeles was illegal.

The preparations seem familiar in the Democratic stronghold that’s often found itself in Trump’s crosshairs.

Still, leaders of schools, churches and community groups — particularly in the city’s immigrant enclaves and Black and Latino neighborhoods — say there’s increased gravity and coordination in preparing for the expected troop deployment and its accompanying deluge of attention.

Here’s how Chicago is preparing.

Protesters say they’re ready

Even without knowing what will unfold, Chicago’s energetic activist networks circulated “emergency protest” schedules, vowing to demonstrate within hours of federal intervention.

Organizers from immigrant rights groups, unions, clergy and anti-violence organizations said they’re working together more than ever.

“We have a stronger broader movement preparing to mobilize,” said Lawrence Benito, head of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “People still have to go about their lives. We’re making sure folks are prepared and we’re ready to respond.”

Immigrant communities have been on high alert since Trump took office for the second time in January and kicked off a nationwide immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.

Activists say they’ve already offered countless know-your-rights training sessions and have added hours for a hotline where people can report immigration arrests. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order reiterating the city’s longtime sanctuary policies, which bar local police from coordinating with federal immigration agents.

Trump’s plans for Chicago

Trump signaled this week that he’s ready to order federal authorities to mobilize and combat crime in Chicago despite the objections of Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. Trump hasn’t given a timeline for the Chicago operation, and he muddied the outlook again on Wednesday by suggesting New Orleans as the next possible location.

Trump’s administration indicated that it would soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, and the Department of Homeland Security requested limited logistical support at the Naval Station Great Lakes outside the city.

The administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. His administration plans to appeal the California deployment ruling.

Trump has often singled out Chicago and other Democrat-led cities. Recently, his administration started playing up the city’s daily crime log, including using shootings over Labor Day weekend as justification for sending in troops.

“I want to go into Chicago and I have this incompetent governor,” Trump said Wednesday.

He and Pritzker have traded barbs for days about the issue. Pritzker, a two-term governor and frequent Trump critic, has been floated as a possible 2028 presidential contender.

“I can’t live in a fantasy land where I pretend Trump is not tearing this country apart for personal greed and power,” Pritzker posted Wednesday on X. At an event later in the day, he told reporters his office had not received any additional information from the federal government.

There has been little outward support for Trump’s plans in Chicago, with only a handful of Republicans and conservative leaders saying they’d welcome the intervention.

Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly pointed to the city’s drop in crime, and asked for more federal funding for prevention programs instead.

Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.

A damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations

Chicago is home to a large and thriving Mexican community, and the threat of the troop deployment and immigration crackdown has put a damper on Mexican Independence Day celebrations planned over the next two weeks.

Organizers acknowledged the threat of immigration arrests might keep some people at home, but they’re boosting security measures and inviting more allies. It’s a similar tactic that activists tried for annual May Day protests, when fears about public gatherings were also high.

Teresa Fraga, who is organizing an event in the city’s heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood, said the event has hired more security, lawyers and neighborhood patrols.

“It’s a dark cloud that is hanging over our heads,” she said. “But we are planning a safe event.”

Worries in Black neighborhoods

Worries are also high in many of the city’s Black neighborhoods, where organizations have been busy advising residents about what their rights are should they interact with law enforcement.

Dozens of Black churches plan to take part in “Resistance Sunday” this weekend, to disseminate information about legal rights during traffic stops and other encounters.

“We need resources, not troops,” said the Rev. Marshall Hatch, a prominent civil rights activist. “We’re not interested in this charade of troops.”

Johnson and other Black mayors have called Trump’s targeting of Democratic cities racist. And Trump has often used racist narratives about urban crime when talking about the unprecedented deployment of troops in the nation’s capital.

“The president’s threats to send federal troops to Chicago are a clear blatant attack on the Black community and the immigrant community,” the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said in a statement.

City schools prepare

Chicago’s public school system suggested that families create phone trees to quickly share information and organize walk-to-school groups to “provide safety in numbers.”

“We know that the potential of increased federal presence is creating anxiety and fear about safety at school and safety within the broad community,” Chicago Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents.

On January 20, he issued ""Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid,"" pausing U.S. development assistance and directing agencies to review all programs.
What Happens Next The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle.","A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has barred the Trump administration from unilaterally withholding billions of dollars in foreign assistance funds approved by Congress, delivering a major legal setback to the president's efforts to scale back overseas aid.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that the administration's refusal to spend roughly $12 billion in congressionally appropriated funds likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which governs how federal agencies make decisions. The decision follows months of litigation over whether the White House can delay or block spending approved under the 2024 appropriations law, much of which is set to expire on September 30 if not obligated.

Why It Matters

The case goes beyond a fight over foreign aid dollars. At stake is the balance of power between Congress and the presidency, with the courts asked to decide whether a president can effectively override appropriations by letting funds expire. The ruling could set a precedent for how future administrations handle contested spending.

It also carries immediate consequences. Billions in U.S. foreign aid, relied on by nonprofits and global health programs, hang in the balance, with potential ripple effects for American influence abroad and the survival of organizations that depend on federal funding.

What To Know

The ruling came after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sent the matter back to Ali for consideration of statutory claims under the APA.

An earlier injunction based on constitutional separation-of-powers grounds had been struck down by a divided appeals panel, which found plaintiffs lacked a cause of action to bring constitutional claims.

The panel, however, amended its opinion in late August to clarify that lawsuits alleging violations of appropriations statutes could proceed.

The dispute centers on roughly billion in foreign aid appropriated in recent years, though the immediate fight involves about $12 billion set to lapse at the end of this fiscal year.

Plaintiffs include nonprofit groups such as the Global Health Council and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which argue that withholding the funds harms their operations and violates the law.

Ali sided with those organizations, writing that the administration's decision ""is contrary to law in violation of the APA"" and ""arbitrary and capricious"" because it provided no rationale for disregarding Congress' directives or the reliance interests of organizations that depend on the aid.

Pocket Rescission

President Donald Trump has framed the move as part of a broader effort to rein in government spending and realign U.S. foreign policy priorities.

On January 20, he issued ""Executive Order on Reevaluating and Realigning U.S. Foreign Aid,"" pausing U.S. development assistance and directing agencies to review all programs.

More recently, he asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion in funds set to expire this year, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 appropriations law.

The White House has relied on a maneuver known as a ""pocket rescission,"" under which the president proposes cuts late in the fiscal year, betting that funds could expire before lawmakers act. Russ Vought, Trump's budget director, has described the tactic as similar to a ""pocket veto.""

Critics, however, including the Government Accountability Office, members of Congress—including Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Mike Rounds of South Dakota—say the approach effectively allows the president to exercise a line-item veto—a power the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 1998.

Likely Appeal

The Department of Justice is expected to appeal Ali's ruling and could ask the Supreme Court to intervene if it continues to lose in lower courts. The administration has argued that it requires clarity on its obligations before September deadlines for notifying Congress and negotiating agreements with foreign governments.

The stakes extend beyond the current fiscal year. If upheld, Ali's order could restrict the administration's ability to use timing strategies to withhold spending in future budget cycles.

What People Are Saying

U.S. District Judge Amir Ali, in his ruling on September 3: ""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch's decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds.""

The judge emphasized that, absent congressional action to rescind funds, the executive branch ""may not disregard a statutory mandate to spend funds simply because of policy objections,"" and he concluded: ""Defendants have given no justification to displace the bedrock expectation that Congress's appropriations must be followed.""

What Happens Next

The order blocking the Trump administration from withholding about $12 billion in foreign aid sets up an accelerated legal battle. For aid groups, the decision provides temporary relief but not certainty.

The Justice Department is expected to appeal to the D.C. Circuit and, if necessary, the Supreme Court. Because the fiscal year ends on September 30, the administration may also seek emergency relief to prevent the funds from being obligated before then.

At the same time, Trump has asked Congress to rescind $4.9 billion of the aid, including $3.2 billion from the 2024 law. If lawmakers act, those amounts would be permanently cut. If not, agencies must commit the funds quickly or risk losing them when they expire. The outcome will determine not only the fate of this year's appropriations but also the scope of presidential power over spending in the future.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2715911/trump-foreign-aid-cuts-overturned.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 13:57:44.360356

He inquired about access to adequate food and water, availability of legal counsel, and the process for medical evaluations. The inspection was part of the Congressman’s ongoing commitment to holding ICE officials accountable.

These centers handle individuals who may be subject to deportation, are awaiting immigration court proceedings, or are being held for other immigration-related reasons, such as during targeted operations.

Carbajal is a leader in Congress in pushing for commonsense immigration reform and holding federal immigration enforcement officers accountable to the communities they serve.

In July 2025, Carbajal co-led the introduction of the bipartisan Dignity Act, a bipartisan bill that would introduce reforms into our country’s immigration system. The bill includes commonsense reforms to legal status and protections for undocumented immigrants, border security investments, and improved asylum and visa processes.

In the same month, Carbajal reintroduced the Fight for the American Dream Act, legislation that allows participants of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program to serve in the United States military and provides them a pathway toward U.S. citizenship after their service.

The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.
“We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.” Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.
The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.
The first, filed days after the declaration, challenged the authority of the administration to take command of the D.C. police.","The District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in federal court on Thursday, challenging the president’s deployment of National Guard troops in the city.

Thousands of Guard members from the city and seven states were mobilized last month as part of a sweeping federal intervention that has also brought hundreds of federal law enforcement agents to the city’s streets.

The intervention, which President Trump has said is a response to a “public safety emergency,” has prompted criticism and protests from many people in the city who say the president wants to use his power of the federal enclave to roll back the city’s limited self-governance and punish it for policies he objects to.

The lawsuit by Washington comes two days after a federal judge in California ruled that the president’s decision to send National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles was illegal.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the lawsuit was “nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.”

Even as the Guard deployments have faced local pushback and legal challenges, Mr. Trump has been promising to send troops to other cities, including Baltimore and Chicago. Like Washington and Los Angeles, Baltimore and Chicago are led by mayors who are Black and are Democrats.

“No American city should have the US military — particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement — policing its streets,” Brian Schwalb, D.C.’s attorney general, said in a statement. “We’ve filed this action to put an end to this illegal federal overreach.”

Unlike in states, where governors have considerable authority over the deployment of the state guard, the D.C. National Guard is under the president’s direct command.

But the suit argues that the deployment of the local guard for public safety reasons, and without the mayor’s consent, violated Washington’s autonomy under the 52-year-old Home Rule Act.

The suit also makes an argument similar to the one the judge in California based his ruling on: that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city runs “roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy — that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.”

Mr. Trump had made clear that such a role was his intention, saying on Aug. 11 that he was calling out the Guard to “reestablish law, order and public safety” in the city. Since then, even as federal law enforcement officers have been involved in hundreds of arrests and immigration agents have been detaining hundreds of Washington residents deemed to be in the country illegally, the National Guard troops have been posted at Metro stations and around city landmarks. Some soldiers have been seen picking up trash.

The suit is the second the city has filed against the administration since Mr. Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the city.

The city appeared likely to prevail, given the judge’s comments during the initial hearing, but that ended with the U.S. Attorney General agreeing to take a more limited role in compelling local police to cooperate on certain tasks.

Published by the Prison Policy Initiative, the report places Tennessee in the top five states for ICE arrests per capita, with the ranking even higher for arrests occurring inside jails.

“What the data shows in Tennessee is that police are arresting people—either explicitly for ICE pickup or for other offenses—and then holding them until ICE takes them into custody,” said Wanda Bertram, a spokesperson for the Prison Policy Initiative.

Knox County has seen particularly sharp increases, with the number of people held for ICE rising from six in January to nearly 50 by April.

Bertram noted that non-citizens are more likely to face jail time for minor offenses, such as driving without a license. “There are a number of ways immigrants can end up in the jail system for offenses that might be considered minor, but that authorities could treat as serious enough for ICE to intervene,” she said.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January requiring ICE to partner with local and state law enforcement, based on a determination by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.

Denton Mayor Gerard Hudspeth, City Manager Sara Hensley and Police Chief Jessica Robledo were at the meeting last week.

Though Hudspeth couldn’t be reached for comment, Dustin Sternbeck, the city’s chief communications officer, described the meeting as informational.

“The City has not agreed to work with or provide resources to the agency,” Sternbeck wrote in an email Wednesday. “No additional action is necessary.”

ICE contacted Hudspeth in early August to set up a meeting with city leaders to discuss the agency’s 287(g) program. It describes the program as protecting the U.S. “through the arrest and removal of aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

Last month, Sternbeck told the Denton Record-Chronicle that any discussion that comes out of the meeting would be presented to council members.

Mayor Pro Tem Suzi Rumohr said that if Hudspeth wished “to propose anything as a result of the meeting, he would need to bring it before the City Council for discussion and a decision.”

Hudspeth did not respond to a request for comment by Wednesday evening.

Council member Brian Beck last month condemned any kind of collaboration between the city and the federal agency. Beck said a large majority of communication he’d received from community members was in opposition of current ICE tactics and behavior and supportive of the precarious situation many immigrant families — both those with legal status and those without — find themselves in.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Kristi Noem are ending a 2021 designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela, the agency told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Under President Biden, two designations of TPS were established for Venezuela. The first was established in 2021, which is being terminated today, and the second in 2023, which the Trump administration terminated on April 7,2023.

""Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

""Weighing public safety, national security, migration factors, immigration policy, economic considerations, and foreign policy, it’s clear that allowing Venezuelan nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is not in America’s best interest,"" the spokesperson added.

With the termination of the 2021 TPS designation, 268,156 Venezuelan nationals currently in the U.S. will lose their status and will no longer be legally allowed to reside in the United States, according to figures shared by Fox News Digital from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

3,738 pending initial applications to be eligible for TPS and 102,935 pending renewal applications will also be terminated as of today.

USCIS recommends those no longer protected by TPS use the CBP Home Mobile App to facilitate leaving the U.S.

The TPS designation will expire September 10, 2025, and termination will be effective 60 days after the publication of the Federal Register notice.

After the April termination of the 2023 TPS designation, roughly 348,000 Venezuelan nationals lost their protected status and were required to make arrangements to leave the U.S.

“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said.

McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.","In the long history of the U.S. House of Representatives, only 28 members have been formally censured by a full vote of the House. Today, Republicans tried to make Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) into the 29th – and they failed.

A resolution supported by most House Republicans would have censured McIver for her conduct during a scuffle last spring at a Newark immigrant detention center, and removed her from her seat on the House Homeland Security Committee. But unexpectedly, a Democratic effort to kill the resolution succeeded, with five Republican House members voting in support of a motion to table and two voting “present.”

(Every present Democrat supported the motion to table, which passed 215-207; one of the Republicans who voted “yes” later said that was a mistake, but it was too late to change his vote.)

The outcome means that the resolution, spearheaded by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, won’t even come up for a proper vote at all, and McIver will remain uncensured and a member of all of her committees.

McIver said that the outcome came as something of a surprise to her, and that she will remain just as defiantly opposed to the immigration policies put forward by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans as she always has been.

“This whole situation, this whole ordeal, has been a political attack against me since the day I went to Delaney Hall,” she said. “I continue to be a critic of this administration, and I think they just want to find different ways to bully me and intimidate me while I’m here. I’m not going to back down.”

The Newark congresswoman, first elected just last year, became a Republican target after a May 9 incident at the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center, at which McIver and two of her House colleagues were conducting an oversight visit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who had attempted to accompany the three congressmembers on the visit, was arrested for trespassing, setting off a brief scuffle involving McIver, federal immigration officers, and a group of assembled protesters.

The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, but New Jersey’s controversial federal prosecutor, Alina Habba, instead charged McIver with assault, and later obtained an indictment from a grand jury. A trial has been set for November, but McIver has said the charges are politically motivated and asked a federal judge to dismiss the indictment.

Republicans in Congress, however, didn’t wait for the legal battle to come to a resolution before moving ahead with an effort to reprimand McIver. The resolution stated that McIver’s actions at Delaney Hall “do not reflect creditably on the House” and that her continued presence on the Homeland Security Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigrant detention facilities like Delaney Hall, “would represent a significant conflict of interest.”

“Censure is appropriate, and historically is well in line with what has happened,” Higgins said at a Homeland Security Committee meeting in June. “Generally, by this point, a member removes themselves from their committee involvement, certainly from a committee that has direct oversight in the arena wherein the charges are to be prosecuted.”

That was a viewpoint shared even by McIver’s three Republican colleagues in New Jersey, one of whom, Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis), chaired a subcommittee hearing in May that partially focused on criticizing McIver. “If you look at the video, she was pushing and shoving and physically involved, and that’s not acceptable,” Van Drew said prior to today’s vote.

Some congressional Republicans had floated even more extreme punishments such as expelling McIver from the House, but that was never a realistic possibility given that expulsion requires a two-thirds majority and Democrats – including, critically, House Democratic leadership – were staunchly opposed to any effort to punish her.

And they were joined, unexpectedly, by a small cohort of Republicans who said that they wanted to let other processes play out before resorting to censuring McIver and removing her from a committee; “I think it’s best to let Ethics Committee finish its report,” Rep. Don Bacon (R-Nebraska) told Politico. McIver said she hasn’t spoken with the defectors personally, but she did send notes of thanks.

“I do want to thank those Republicans that sided with us to see that this was wrong, and this should be a matter of [the Ethics Committee] and letting this case play out,” she said.

The Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County says there has been a growing number of inquiries related to immigration and national origin received by the Barnstable County Human Rights Advisory Commission.

As of July 1st, 24-percent of the Commission’s intakes involve immigrants, up from about ten percent in the past two years.

According to the report, many of the cases involve public harassment.

Common themes include fear surrounding immigration enforcement activity, reports of aggressive enforcement tactics, family separation, and stress caused by shifts in Temporary Protected Status.

“We continue to hear from families who are anxious about enforcement activity and changes in immigration status. These fears affect daily life — from parents worried about going to work to students uncertain about attending school,” said Leslie Dominguez-Santos, Human Rights Coordinator for Barnstable County.

Illegal immigration enforcement has been a top priority for the second Trump Administration. An ICE operation in May resulted in about 1,500 immigrants taken into custody across Massachusetts, including on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.

On the Cape, there was particular community concern this summer in Falmouth, prompting their Select Board to release this statement on July 1st:

The Town of Falmouth is committed to enabling our residents, businesses, employees, and visitors the opportunity to live, work, and experience our town’s unique charm today, tomorrow, and for future generations. We strive to be an inclusive, welcoming, equitable, and diverse community, and we take seriously our responsibilities for economic prosperity and the health, safety, and wellbeing of residents and visitors.

Trust, including trust that constitutional and civil rights will be upheld by all law enforcement officials, is foundational to the kind of community we strive to be. Our local police work diligently to build trust and relationships – acting as guardians first, enforcers only when necessary.

In contrast, some of the tactics employed by federal immigration and law enforcement officials operating in Falmouth in recent weeks has contributed to a climate of fear that undermines the work that our town staff, including our police department, do each day.",https://www.capecod.com/wp-content/uploads/NWS_County-Seal_BF012423.png,N,,2025-09-04 11:58:45.696405

And third, the Supreme Court has frowned on recent presidents who relied on old laws to justify bold, new, costly regulations.

The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules.","President Trump has asked the Supreme Court for a fast-track ruling that he has broad power acting on his own to impose tariffs on products coming from countries around the world.

Despite losing in the lower courts, Trump and his lawyers have reason to believe they can win in the Supreme Court. The six conservative justices believe in strong presidential power, particularly in the area of foreign policy and national security.

In a three-page appeal filed Wednesday evening, they proposed the court decide by next Wednesday to grant review and to hear arguments in early November.

They said the lower court setbacks, unless quickly reversed, “gravely undermine the President’s ability to conduct real-world diplomacy and his ability to protect the national security and economy of the United States.”

They cited Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s warning about the potential for economic disruption if the court does not act soon.

“Delaying a ruling until June 26 could result in a scenario in which $750 billion-$1 trillion have already been collected and unwinding them could cause significant disruption,” he wrote.

Trump and his tariffs ran into three strong arguments in the lower courts.

First, the Constitution says Congress, not the president, has the power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” and a tariff is an import tax.

Second, the 1977 emergency powers law that Trump relies on does not mention tariffs, taxes or duties, and no previous president has used it to impose tariffs.

And third, the Supreme Court has frowned on recent presidents who relied on old laws to justify bold, new, costly regulations.

So far, however, the so-called “major questions” doctrine has been used to restrict Democratic presidents, not Republicans.

Three years ago, the court’s conservative majority struck down a major climate change regulation proposed by Presidents Obama and Biden that could have transformed the electric power industry on the grounds it was not clearly based on the Clean Air Act of the 1970s.

Two years ago, the court in the same 6-3 vote struck down Biden’s plan to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans. Congress had said the Education Department may “waive or modify” monthly loan payments during a national emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not say the loans may be forgiven, the court said. Its opinion noted the “staggering” cost could be more than $500 billion.

The impact of Trump’s tariffs figures to be at least five times greater, a federal appeals court said last week in ruling them illegal.

In a 7-4 vote, the federal circuit court cited all three arguments in ruling Trump had exceeded his legal authority.

“We conclude Congress, in enacting the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not give the president wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs,” they said.

But the outcome was not a total loss for Trump. The appellate judges put their decision on hold until the Supreme Court rules. That means Trump’s tariffs are likely to remain in effect for many months.

Trump’s lawyers were heartened by the dissent written by Judge Richard Taranto and joined by three others.

He argued that presidents are understood to have extra power when confronted with foreign threats to the nation’s security.

Taranto called the 1977 law “an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm” that said the president may “regulate” the “importation” of dangerous products including drugs coming into this country.

Citing other laws from that era, he said Congress understood that tariffs and duties are a “common tool of import regulation.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/784d34a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4953x2600+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2Fa4%2F52db667641ccbfcecb3d8a35d406%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2208185431,N,,2025-09-04 14:57:45.124215

Final Thought This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders.","In a development that has ignited global scrutiny and domestic legal controversy, the Trump administration recently authorized a U.S. military strike that killed 11 individuals aboard a speedboat in the Caribbean Sea, allegedly tied to Venezuela’s “criminal underworld”. The administration claims the boat was a “narco-terrorist” vessel operating under the umbrella of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the United States designated a terrorist organization earlier this year (Reuters, 9/3/25).

President Trump shared video footage of the strike on his social platform Truth Social, calling it “an incredible win” for national security. But legal experts and immigration advocates are raising serious concerns: not only about the facts of the case but about the precedent this strike sets for the use of lethal force in non-combat, non-judicial international scenarios.

Extrajudicial or Justified? Legal Analysis of the Caribbean Strike

While the Trump administration insists the strike was part of an expanded anti-narcotics campaign, seasoned analysts argue the operation may have violated both U.S. and international law.

According to Reuters, international maritime law allows for the interdiction of vessels suspected of drug trafficking, but lethal force is reserved only for self-defense or under formal wartime engagement. None of the facts released by the administration demonstrate that the 11 passengers posed an imminent threat to U.S. forces or civilians.

“It is unclear whether there was even a lawful basis for targeting these individuals,” said a former senior official at the Department of Justice. “This wasn’t a battlefield. This was open water. Drug smuggling—however serious—is not justification for a drone strike without judicial oversight.”

The U.N. Charter and Law of the Sea Convention, to which the U.S. is a signatory in principle, emphasize due process and the right to life—even in cases involving suspected criminal conduct on the high seas.

Were They Smugglers, or Migrants?

Adding to the confusion is the tactical implausibility of the administration’s account. Why, legal analysts ask, would 11 people be required aboard a speedboat transporting narcotics? Most drug operations rely on minimal crews to limit exposure and cost. The presence of such a large number of individuals suggests a different possibility: that the vessel may have been carrying migrants, not drugs.

“From a migration law perspective, 11 people on a small vessel is consistent with human smuggling, not narcotics,” said Brad Bernstein from Spar & Bernstein. “We’ve represented countless clients who’ve taken similar risks in hopes of reaching safety and reunifying with family. Those individuals deserved arrest, screening, and legal process, not death.”

The lack of confirmed evidence, the absence of verified contraband, and the absence of survivors to testify raise the specter of a politically motivated strike, intended more for show than substance. Even the authenticity of the video Trump shared is being questioned by news analysts, though Reuters has yet to verify any manipulation.

Expanding Executive Power Without Oversight

This event highlights the growing trend of executive overreach in the name of national security, particularly where immigration enforcement intersects with the use of military force.

The Trump administration has previously broadened the legal definition of “enemy combatant” to include drug cartels and smuggling organizations, creating a legal gray zone where constitutional protections are suspended. Legal scholars warn this could open the door to further unilateral military action against civilians, without oversight or accountability.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the strike, saying the U.S. could have interdicted the boat, but chose a “deterrent” approach instead. While the desire to combat transnational crime is understandable, the failure to follow arrest and prosecution procedures should alarm every legal professional and every American.

Human Rights, Immigration, and the Role of Attorneys

For immigration lawyers at Spar & Bernstein, this strike is part of a troubling shift toward the criminalization and militarization of migration. Increasingly, we see undocumented individuals—many of whom are longtime residents, parents, and contributors to our communities—being cast as criminals or terrorists.

“Whether these 11 people were migrants, asylum seekers, or wrongfully accused, they deserved due process,” says Brad. “We are here to protect the rights of the undocumented and to ensure that no one is punished without evidence, without trial, and without justice.”

If your loved one is missing, detained abroad, or possibly affected by this strike or similar military action, our office is prepared to investigate, advocate, and provide legal relief where possible. We have decades of experience litigating complex immigration and humanitarian cases—and we stand firm in the belief that the law must serve people, not politics.

Final Thought

This tragic episode reminds us of the vital role immigration attorneys play in defending constitutional rights, even beyond U.S. borders. While the political rhetoric may be harsh and the military power vast, the law remains clear: due process is not optional. It’s essential.

For those with questions about family members missing at sea, under deportation review, or affected by recent changes to immigration enforcement protocols, we encourage you to contact the attorneys at Spar & Bernstein today.

The letter urges the ACHPR to intervene by issuing a formal resolution in response to the United States of America’s unlawful transfer of migrants and asylum seekers to third countries in Africa. This was done under secretive bilateral agreements and without regard for any claims they may have to protection under refugee and human rights treaties. At least 20 migrants have already been transferred to South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda, and Uganda has recently signed an agreement with the United States to begin accepting more migrants expelled from the U.S. imminently.

Bella Mosselmans, Director of the Council said:

“These illegal transfers violate international and African human rights law and expose forcibly expelled migrants to arbitrary detention and serious abuses of human rights. The United States cannot outsource its obligations under international law, and African governments should resist complicity in these unlawful practices.”

As more agreements are reportedly being negotiated, the Council welcomes the latest press release from the ACHPR strongly calling for transparency of any agreements made with the United States and humane migration policies based in dignity, solidarity and justice.

The Council and its partners are now calling on the Commission to issue a resolution that firmly protects and upholds the rights of migrants and asylum seekers subject to U.S. agreements with African countries, and urges African Union member states not to enter into similar, new agreements that facilitate the unlawful expulsion of refugees and migrants from the United States of America.

Anwen Hughes, Senior Director of Legal Strategy, Refugee Programs at Human Rights First said:

“The Commission’s recent statement is a vital step, but we urge them to go further at this critical moment. With potentially hundreds more migrants expected to be transferred to the region under unlawful U.S. agreements, it is more important than ever for civil society, human rights authorities and states around the world to make clear that adherence to human rights law and due process is a legal imperative and essential to the rule of law globally.

First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.
This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”","Michael O’Flaherty made the remarks today as he published a new report, entitled Externalised asylum and migration policies and human rights law, which highlights the challenges that come with such arrangements.

In the absence of adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, externalisation policies might result in people being subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, collective expulsions and arbitrary detention or may put their lives in danger, it stresses.

Such policies might also hinder effective access to asylum and deprive individuals of legal remedies.

Mr O’Flaherty said: “External co-operation on asylum and migration needs to be designed and implemented with great care, so as not to put human rights at risk.

“Governments developing externalisation policies in this field should carefully assess their potential negative impact on human rights, as such policies can expose women, men and children to significant risks of serious harm and protracted suffering.”

Today’s report identifies three areas in which risks are particularly acute: external processing of asylum claims; external return procedures, including through so-called “return hubs”; and the outsourcing of border control to other countries, some of which have a documented history of serious violations against people on the move.

In view of the human rights challenges that these measures may entail, the commissioner makes four main recommendations to Council of Europe member states, acting individually or collectively, including in the context of membership of the EU.

First, states should adopt a precautionary approach by carrying out comprehensive human rights risk assessments, developing adequate risk mitigation strategies before engaging in external co-operation, and reviewing ongoing activities for their human rights impact.

Second, they should define clear and non-negotiable principles that exclude any cooperation likely to put people at risk of human rights violations, and ensure that children and other vulnerable people are never subjected to externalised procedures.

Third, they should ensure adequate human rights preconditions and safeguards, adapted to each model of co-operation, including preventing the shifting of responsibility to other countries, ensuring no one is transferred to a partner country without a rigorous individual assessment, and limiting any use of return hubs to specific, clearly defined situations.

Fourth, they should strengthen transparency, monitoring and accountability, through robust agreements, transparent information-sharing, independent monitoring, and effective investigations of any alleged violations.

“As European states continue to pursue externalisation, the impact on the human rights and dignity of people on the move must not be overlooked,” Mr O’Flaherty said.

“Member states should assess the risks involved, commit to strong legal guarantees, and ensure scrutiny of their actions. This is crucial for their policies to be in line with their legal obligations to uphold human rights at home and internationally.”",https://www.irishlegal.com/storage/dc6f5fe539924c97331c0bc8cc20761b0e498ada.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:42.815787

On Friday morning, during a trip to Lubbock, Salazar was pulled over by Lubbock Police.

“On August 29, an LPD motor officer viewed multiple traffic violations by the vehicle,” a spokesperson for Lubbock PD told NBC 5. “Once pulled over, Salazar presented a Mexican ID to our officer and did not have a valid license.”

ICE was contacted and arrived at the scene. According to Lubbock Police, the agent confirmed Salazar did not have legal status in the U.S. and took him into custody.

Friends of Salazar took to social media over the weekend to raise awareness on his detention and the need for funds.

As of Wednesday afternoon, nearly 600 people have donated to help cover costs for the release of Omar Salazar from the ICE Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson.

""It's time to step up for him now and put in that work for him,"" Flaka Martinez said. Martinez is a friend of Salazar.

According to mentors and friends of Salazar, he is an advocate of human rights and frequently works with nonprofits.

“He's someone that I look up to,” Martinez said. “Just in his tenacity of always being so resilient.”

Martinez said Salazar is also an entrepreneur in the Artificial Intelligence space.

“He focuses on connecting or putting together data regarding human rights, translating to make sure that we can all understand what the data is speaking about, but building it up through artificial intelligence,” Martinez said. “Whether it's corporate America or nonprofit, he figures out programs to make better decisions for the community.”

According to Salazar's attorneys, Jacob Monty and Veronica Franco Salazar with Monty & Ramirez LLP, Salazar was born in Mexico and brought to the United States in 2008.

""He didn't choose to come here. He came here as an 11-year-old brought by his parents,"" Monty said. ""He didn't choose to cross the border. His parents brought him.""

According to Monty, Salazar focused on his studies and went on to graduate as valedictorian of Trinidad Garza Early College and later SMU.

SMU confirmed Salazar received a Bachelor of Science in Sociology and a Bachelor of Arts in Human Rights on May 18, 2019.

“We're talking about someone that has never had any criminal interaction, no criminal history,” Monty said. “He’s just a contributing member of the Texas society. And he is facing removal from Texas to a country he does not know.”

While attorneys said Salazar does not have a criminal record, they're concerned about the new limitations on immigration bonds announced on July 8.

“Omar might be subject to mandatory detention, meaning that the courts wouldn't even have the jurisdiction to review his case and review if he's eligible for bond,” Franco Salazar said.

“It's not just a theoretical concern. We're seeing DHS take this very same position with cases after July 8. So, our worry is rooted in recent practice that we've seen DHS employ, saying that aliens like Omar are not eligible for bond,” Monty said. “We disagree with that, and we have some legal arguments to show that. We think we're going to be able to show the judge that he is eligible for bond.”

The firm said they have taken up the case pro bono and the money raised by friends and family will be used to cover the bail and any expenses associated with the detention, including psychological support.

“We are worried about that because having to fight this case and be detained for a year is a tremendous amount of suffering, a tremendous hardship that causes many immigrants to just self-deport,” Monty said. “Omar's not going to self-deport and we're going to fight this and get some common sense to prevail on this issue.”

Analysis revealed frequent misreporting of immigration tribunal cases, as well as mischaracterisations of the UK’s system of immigration appeals and the role played by the ECHR in this context. The report aims to support informed public debate by identifying and addressing misconceptions.

Politicians, journalists and commentators may legitimately hold different views on immigration and human rights. But mischaracterising how the law operates does a disservice to the public. Evidence should be the foundation of any debate, whatever view one takes on the policy questions.

Professor Başak Çalı, Bonavero Institute of Human Rights

Co-written by Victoria Adelmant, a doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford and Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, Professor Alice Donald of Middlesex University London, and Professor Başak Çalı of the Bonavero Institute, the study involved a systematic review of media reports that mentioned the ECHR between 1 January and 30 June 2025, analysing 379 news stories and opinion pieces.

Around 75% of these media reports focused on the ECHR’s role in immigration control – particularly appeals by foreign national offenders against deportation orders.

The report finds that immigration tribunal cases are frequently misreported. It highlights several high-profile examples of misleading coverage, including the so-called ‘chicken nuggets’ case – widely reported as the prevention of an individual’s deportation on the basis of his child’s dislike of foreign food, despite the decision not being based on this detail and having already been overturned. These misrepresentations, the authors argue, risk eroding public confidence in the legal system and are fuelling calls to leave the ECHR based on misleading portrayals of the role and operation of the ECHR in the UK.

Professor Donald said: 'Our findings show that much of the public discussion about the ECHR and immigration is not grounded in accurate reporting. For a debate of such importance, it is essential that arguments are based on evidence and a correct understanding of the law. Without this, public trust in the rule of law is placed at risk.'

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

Despite political and media focus on cases involving foreign national offenders, the report highlights that successful human rights-based appeals against deportation are rare. The latest available Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation shows that in the 15 months to June 2021, the number of successful appeals amounted to only 0.73% of the total number of sentenced foreign national offenders.

Over a five-year period to June 2021, the number of successful human rights-based deportation appeals represented about 3.5% of the total number of deportations – and around 2.5% when looking at appeals based solely on private and family life grounds. These figures may be overestimates as they do not account for cases subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal.

Victoria Adelmant, Resident at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, said: 'The absence of systematically published Home Office data on human rights-based appeals against deportation makes it difficult to have a fully informed discussion on this topic. The Home Office has itself recently stated that its data surrounding foreign national offenders is not sufficiently robust. More regular and accessible publication of statistics and disaggregated information would enable more evidence-based public debate.'

The report clarifies that the ECHR does not grant non-citizens a right to live in the UK, and that states are free to set their own immigration policies. In deportation cases, two provisions of the Convention are typically invoked: Article 3 (prohibition of torture or inhuman treatment) or Article 8 (protection of private and family life).

The report shows that reliance on Article 8 in appeals against deportation gained significant attention in media coverage in the first half of 2025. But the possibility of claiming the right to protection of private and family life to prevent deportation is heavily restricted by legislation passed by Parliament. Under UK immigration law, deportation orders are mandatory for foreign national offenders sentenced to 12 months or more in prison, and exceptions apply only in very limited circumstances.

The report also demonstrates that judgments by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK are very rare, and that the Court has only rarely held that the UK government has violated human rights in its immigration-related decisions and policies.

Since 1980, the European Court of Human Rights has found against the UK in only 13 removal cases, and just four of those concerned family life. In relation to immigration rules more broadly, the Court has only three times ruled that the UK’s immigration rules violate the ECHR in the past 45 years.

Suggestions that the European Court of Human Rights ‘hinders’ the UK’s efforts to control immigration, the authors note, do not stand up to scrutiny.

Suggestions that the European Court of Human Rights ‘hinders’ the UK’s efforts to control immigration, the authors note, do not stand up to scrutiny.

The report warns that misconceptions about tribunal cases, the UK’s appeals system and the ECHR have real consequences: sensational coverage can fuel hostility towards migrants and human rights law, and, as senior judges have noted, can even put the safety of members of the judiciary at risk. The authors argue that responsible reporting, combined with better data, is vital for sustaining democratic debate on immigration policy.

Professor Çalı said: 'Politicians, journalists and commentators may legitimately hold different views on immigration and human rights. But mischaracterising how the law operates does a disservice to the public. Evidence should be the foundation of any debate, whatever view one takes on the policy questions.

Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took the fight over tariffs to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the justices to rule quickly that the president has the power to impose sweeping import taxes under federal law.

The government called on the court to reverse an appeals court ruling that found most of President Donald Trump's tariffs are an illegal use of an emergency powers law.

It's the latest in a series of Trump administration appeals to a Supreme Court he helped shape, and one that is expected to put a centerpiece of the president's trade policy before the justices.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press. It was expected to be formally docketed on Thursday.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to take up the case and hear arguments in early November.

""That decision casts a pall of uncertainty upon ongoing foreign negotiations that the President has been pursuing through tariffs over the past five months, jeopardizing both already negotiated framework deals and ongoing negotiations,"" he wrote. ""The stakes in this case could not be higher.""

But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.

""These unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,"" he said.

The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.

Their lawsuit is one of several challenging the tariffs and erratic rollout that have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

But Trump has also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.

Most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, did not let Trump usurp congressional power to set tariffs. The dissenters, though, said the law does allow the president to regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations.

The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

Some Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, weren't covered by the appeals court ruling. It also does not include tariffs Trump imposed on China in his first term that were kept by Democratic President Joe Biden.

Trump can impose tariffs under other laws, but those have more limitations on the speed and severity with which he could act.

JB Pritzker said recently of the rumored Trump administration plans to do in Chicago what they’ve already messily and dumbly done in Los Angeles and Washington, DC: “The intentions here are clear. Nothing to do with actually enforcing the law, nothing to do with actually keeping the peace. They want to inflame something. That is what they want.”

Like all good aspiring dictators, Trump knows if he kicks off trouble with his masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement goons or draws mass protests by militarizing the streets of a major city, it’ll give him an excuse to exert more federal power.

It’s not clever, it’s just the obvious play for a man who sees our democracy as an obstacle.

Trump keeps lying about violent crime as ICE goes after families

For whatever they’re worth in these days of Trumpian dishonesty, the facts are against the president in all regards. He can talk about ICE agents rounding up hardened criminals, but according to the most recent ICE data, 70% of those presently in ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody have no felony conviction.

Trump and his administration toadies can talk about “violent crime in big cities,” but crime in Chicago is down sharply, with a 32% drop in homicides and a nearly 40% drop in shootings.

If they come into my city, it will be for the noise and spectacle of it all, for the sole purpose of manipulating the masses with unfounded fear, not for any valiant reason or with the goal of making anyone’s life better.

Chicago cops won't help ICE, and they won't wear masks either

Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order that Chicago police ""will not cooperate with or enable any unlawful or unconstitutional actions undertaken by federal law enforcement.""

And you can bet the activists, faith leaders and concerned residents of Chicago will be organized and ready to peacefully place wrenches in the gears of Trump’s intimidation machine.

WBEZ Chicago recently quoted the Rev. Tyrone McGowan of Progressive Community Church on the city’s South Side: “We are rising, rising not because of soldiers and military occupation, but because of neighbors and organizers, health care professionals, educators, pastors and parents, young people and elders who decide to choose peace.”

Chicago's history of protest awaits Trump's federal invasion

Chicago has a long history of protest. In the 19th century, German and Irish immigrants were being blamed for crime – sound familiar? – and the city’s mayor targeted German saloon owners, leading German immigrants to rise up and clash with police on the Clark Street Bridge over the Chicago River.

The 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to days of riots involving police, soldiers and throngs of Vietnam War protesters.

In 2006, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Chicago to protest anti-immigration policies, and earlier this year, tens of thousands gathered downtown in Daley Plaza to rail against the Trump administration as part of the nationwide No Kings protest.

Simply put, Chicagoans know how to protest. The city has a massive network of well-organized activist groups and a baked-in intolerance for getting pushed around. People here look out for their neighbors, and they know a con artist like Trump when they see one.

The myth of Chicago as a violent hellscape is red meat for Trump's base

The president and his Republican Party have used Chicago as a culture-war cudgel for years on end, painting this city – my city – as some violent hellhole, statistics and objective reality be damned. We have problems, as do all cities and towns. Ours can seem worse, a multiplicative factor that comes with life in a place of 2.7 million people.

But among cities with a population of more than 100,000, Chicago isn’t even near the top 10 in violent crime per capita.

So Trump should take his fearmongering and false narratives and excuses to sic U.S. troops on U.S. citizens and use them somewhere really violent, like Little Rock, Arkansas, which is No. 4 on the most violent cities list.

'City of the Big Shoulders' will stand strong against Trump

So we’ll wait for Trump’s invasion. But let it be known loud and clear that this isn’t a city you mess with. This is the place that saw regular pizza and said, “Hey, what if we make that about 2 inches deeper and put more cheese on it?”

This is a place of hard work. A place where resistance runs deep.

The poet Carl Sandburg, in 1914, dubbed us “City of the Big Shoulders” and wrote, aptly, “I turn once more to those who sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them: Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.”

So we wait.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/14/USAT/84207745007-20250614-t-194738-z-710988999-rc-2-e-2-fai-1-p-5-k-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpprotestchicago.JPG?crop=5405,3041,x0,y281&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-04 11:59:04.411873

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.","WASHINGTON — Federal judges are frustrated with the Supreme Court for increasingly overturning lower court rulings involving the Trump administration with little or no explanation, with some worried the practice is undermining the judiciary at a sensitive time.

Some judges believe the Supreme Court, and in particular Chief Justice John Roberts, could be doing more to defend the integrity of their work as President Donald Trump and his allies harshly criticize those who rule against him and as violent threats against judges are on the rise.

In rare interviews with NBC News, a dozen federal judges — appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, including Trump, and serving around the country — pointed to a pattern they say has recently emerged:

Lower court judges are handed contentious cases involving the Trump administration. They painstakingly research the law to reach their rulings. When they go against Trump, administration officials and allies criticize the judges in harsh terms. The government appeals to the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority.

And then the Supreme Court, in emergency rulings, swiftly rejects the judges’ decisions with little to no explanation.

Emergency rulings used to be rare. But their number has dramatically increased in recent years.

Ten of the 12 judges who spoke to NBC News said the Supreme Court should better explain those rulings, noting that the terse decisions leave lower court judges with little guidance for how to proceed. But they also have a new and concerning effect, the judges said, validating the Trump administration’s criticisms. A short rebuttal from the Supreme Court, they argue, makes it seem like they did shoddy work and are biased against Trump.

“It is inexcusable,” a judge said of the Supreme Court justices. “They don’t have our backs.”

All 12 judges spoke on condition that they not be identifiable, some because it is considered unwise to publicly criticize the justices who ultimately decide whether to uphold their rulings and others because of the risk of threats.

Judges are increasingly targeted, with some facing bomb threats, “swattings” and other harassment. Judges especially involved in high-profile cases — and their families — have reported receiving violent threats.

As of June, the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects judges, had reported more than 400 threat investigations this year. There has been a steady rise of such threats in recent years, from 224 in fiscal year 2021 to 457 in fiscal year 2023, according to congressional testimony given by the Marshals Service. An agency spokesman declined to provide updated numbers.

When judges issue rulings the Trump administration does not like, they are frequently targeted by influential figures in MAGA world and sometimes Trump himself, who called for a judge who ruled against him in a high-profile immigration case to be impeached. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has said the administration is the victim of a “judicial coup.”

The judge who said the Supreme Court justices are behaving inexcusably has received threats of violence and is now fearful when someone knocks on the door at home.

If major efforts are not made to address the situation, the judge said, “somebody is going to die.”

With tensions so high, four of the judges said they believe the Supreme Court and specifically Roberts, the head of the judiciary, should do more to defend the courts.

The Supreme Court, a second judge said, is effectively assisting the Trump administration in “undermining the lower courts,” leaving district and appeals court judges “thrown under the bus.”

The Supreme Court has an obligation to explain rulings in a way the public can understand, a third judge said, adding that when the court so frequently rules for the administration in emergency cases without fully telling people why, it sends a signal. The court has had strong left-leaning majorities in the past, but what is different now is the role emergency cases are playing in public discourse.

The Supreme Court, that judge said, is effectively endorsing Miller’s claims that the judiciary is trying to subvert the presidency.

“It’s almost like the Supreme Court is saying it is a ‘judicial coup,’” the judge said.

Not all judges who were interviewed shared that view. Some were more reluctant to criticize the justices.

A judge appointed by President Barack Obama said that while the Supreme Court could do more to explain itself, some lower court judges had been out of line in blocking Trump policies.

“Certainly, there is a strong sense in the judiciary among the judges ruling on these cases that the court is leaving them out to dry,” he said. “They are partially right to feel the way they feel.”

But, the judge added, “the whole ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ is a real issue. As a result, judges are mad at what Trump is doing or the manner he is going about things; they are sometimes forgetting to stay in their lane.”

The 'shadow docket'

In 2015, a University of Chicago Law School professor came up with a catchy term for a hitherto obscure part of the Supreme Court’s docket, in which cases are fast-tracked outside the court’s normally monthslong appeals process: the “shadow docket.”

Those are emergency cases handled much more quickly than normal — there are rarely oral arguments, and decisions can come within days with little or no explanation, while argued cases always include some reasoning that varies from a handful of pages to dozens to, in rare cases, the length of a short book.

The shadow docket has exploded in recent years, with the first Trump administration turbo-charging the trend by rushing to the Supreme Court when lower court rulings blocked nationwide policies. An early example was Trump’s travel ban on people entering the United States from mostly Muslim-majority countries, which the Supreme Court allowed to partly go into effect in June 2017.

Before the recent surge, most emergency cases involved death row inmates’ attempts to block their executions at the eleventh hour, and the court would normally handle them via terse orders with no explanation. But the increase in cases in hot-button nationwide disputes, sparked in part by presidents of both parties relying more on executive orders than passing legislation via Congress, has put greater scrutiny on the court’s reasoning.

The growing reliance on the shadow docket has drawn criticism from legal experts about the lack of time and process the Supreme Court spends on what can be incredibly consequential decisions.

Since Trump took office again in January, his administration has asked the Supreme Court 23 times to block lower court rules on an emergency basis.

The court has granted the government’s emergency requests in 17. It rejected the government in two cases, while three other cases were resolved without decisions, and one request is pending.

Notable victories include rulings that curbed lower-court injunctions that had blocked his contentious plan to end automatic birthright citizenship and his efforts to fire federal workers. The Supreme Court has also overturned lower court rulings that would have hindered Trump’s tough immigration policies. It has, though, pushed back against the administration in two other high-profile immigration cases.

By comparison, the Biden administration filed 19 applications during its entire four-year term, with the court granting its requests 10 times, according to Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown Law professor who has written a book about the subject.

An NBC News review of the Trump decisions showed that five of the 17 cases overturning lower court rulings included no substantive reasoning at all. Seven of the others included less than three pages of explanation. That critique extends back to the Biden administration, when the court failed to explain its decisions in eight out of the 10 wins for the government.

“Judges in the trenches need, and deserve, well-reasoned, bright-line guidance,” a judge said. “Too often today, sweeping rulings arrive with breathtaking speed but minimal explanation, stripped of the rigor that full briefing and argument provide.”

Ten of the judges, both Republican and Democratic appointees, agreed the court’s lack of explanation is a problem. Judges must follow Supreme Court precedent, but they can find it difficult to assess what the justices are asking them to do.

That was the situation in which Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox found himself this year after Trump fired three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Like certain other federal agencies, it was set up by Congress to be insulated from political pressures. While the president could nominate members to fixed terms, he could not fire them except for “neglect of duty or malfeasance.”

On paper, Maddox’s job was an easy one: As a district court judge, he has to follow the Supreme Court’s previous rulings. In 1935, in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld a law preventing the president from firing members of the Federal Trade Commission — a setup similar to the CPSC’s — without cause.

The Supreme Court’s current conservative majority has undermined that precedent in recent years, but, crucially, it has not overturned it.

But before Maddox issued his decision, the Supreme Court on May 22 allowed Trump to fire members of two other independent agencies with similar restrictions, the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The Supreme Court’s two-page order was paltry, sending mixed messages by allowing the firings while expressly saying the court would wait to decide whether to overturn Humphrey’s Executor.

Maddox was left to grapple with how that decision applied to his case. He ultimately rejected the Trump administration’s arguments in two separate rulings in June, concluding that he was bound by the 1935 precedent.

“Humphrey’s Executor remains good law,” he wrote.

But Maddox did not have the final word. The Trump administration once again quickly turned to the Supreme Court, which granted its emergency request to allow the firings a month later.

The case was “squarely controlled” by its May decision, the conservative majority said in a one-page decision overturning Maddox.

In both cases, the court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing in the second one that the majority had “all but overturned” Humphrey’s Executor despite never having heard arguments or issued a full ruling on the underlying legal question.

Kagan spoke about the difficulties lower court judges face in such cases at a legal conference in Monterey, California, this summer.

She referred to a different case in which Massachusetts-based Judge Myong Joun issued a ruling that blocked Trump administration plans to downsize the Education Department. The administration quickly appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the government.

Kagan noted that the case raised several legal issues, including what authority Joun had to step in, but the Supreme Court’s terse order did not explain on what grounds it was blocking his decision. The only writing was from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned an 18-page dissent.

“What’s that court supposed to think?” Kagan asked, referring to Joun. “It’s just impossible to know, and that puts the [lower] court in a very difficult situation.”

But there is no unanimity within the Supreme Court about that issue. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion last month when the court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in another emergency case that was scathing about what he perceived as lower court judges’ failure to follow the Supreme Court’s orders.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” he wrote.

A judge who spoke to NBC News expressed frustration that judges’ role in the judicial system is being undermined by the Supreme Court’s frequent interventions, before there has been extensive litigation and, potentially, a trial.

“It’s very discouraging,” the judge said. “We are operating in a bit of a vacuum.”

While agreeing that “it would be nicer” if the court gave fuller explanations in emergency decisions, another judge said it is too early to really cast judgment on how the Supreme Court has responded to the Trump administration, with litigation still ongoing in most cases.

It is up to the Supreme Court whether it wants to issue detailed decisions in emergency cases, the judge added, calling it “entirely a matter of grace.”

Lower court judges know that being overturned by the Supreme Court is part of the job, but the judge who said the justices have an obligation to explain themselves added that they can disagree with a lower court’s legal reasoning while also defending it as a good-faith attempt to address complex legal issues.

The judge suggested the Supreme Court should say, “Let’s be clear, it’s not some crazy opinion, and this judge is not a monster.”

Head of the judiciary

As chief justice, Roberts has a dual role. As well as being one of the nine justices on the Supreme Court, he is head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, the administrative arm of the courts, where he represents the interests of the judiciary as a whole.

Four judges who spoke to NBC News think Roberts, a conservative about to mark 20 years in the position, could do more to speak out when Trump allies complain about judicial overreach.

Roberts did issue a rare statement in March pushing back against Trump’s call to impeach the judge who ruled against the administration in the major immigration case.

“For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” Roberts said.

He also defended the judiciary in his annual end-of-year statement in December, in which he referred to an increase in threats to judges in recent years and called out “illegitimate activity” that seeks to undermine the judiciary.

But the judge who said the Supreme Court's frequent interventions are discouraging added that while Roberts may sometimes step up, “the conduct is undermining it,” referring to the court’s regular unexplained rulings in favor of Trump.

Roberts, who generally does not seek public attention, has long been known as an institutionalist who looks out for the interests of the Supreme Court, but several judges wondered whether that instinct extends to lower courts.

“He should be doing everything he can internally to insist on ordinary process,” the judge who has received threats said in reference to the emergency cases. Roberts' end-of-year report was “not enough,” the judge added.

Another judge said: “He hasn’t been completely absent, and he’s trying to do the best he can. I wish he would be a little bit more assertive and aggressive.”

Other judges are less willing to criticize Roberts.

“I do sympathize with the predicament the court is in, doing a dance with the administration, and particularly I’m sympathetic to Roberts,” the Obama-appointed judge said.

A district court judge indicated it was counterproductive to criticize Roberts or the court when the judiciary as a whole is under attack.

“We need to be united, not divided,” the judge said.

Roberts did not respond to a request for comment.

A federal judiciary employee familiar with Roberts’ institutional role said there are various reasons he is restrained from speaking out more. If he did, the employee said, the force of what he said would be diluted through repetition, and, with litigation pending in lower courts, he could face accusations of bias or calls for his recusal when he comments on specific cases.

“The chief justice has spoken out strongly against attacks on judges in various contexts, but he has been appropriately judicious in his statements, focusing on institutional norms and not personalities,” the employee said.

“The chief justice can’t be the public spokesperson against the administration and still do his job of deciding cases, including matters that involve the administration,” the person added.

So far, the only recent public defense from the court has come from conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who said at a legal conference in Kansas City, Missouri, last month that the court has been “doing more and more process to try to get the right answer” and offers more explanation in such cases than it did in the past. In the birthright citizenship cases, for example, the court heard oral arguments and issued a 26-page opinion explaining the decision.

One reason for keeping emergency decisions short, Kavanaugh said, is that the justices have to make decisions but do not necessarily want to pre-judge how cases will ultimately be decided when they come back to the court via the normal appeals process.

“There can be a risk ... of making a snap judgment and putting it in writing,” even though it might not reflect the court’s ultimate conclusion further down the line, he said.

While the Supreme Court wrestles internally with some of the criticism, lower court judges are increasingly focused on their own safety.

Judges have been calling for increased security in light of the frequent threats facing those who rule against or criticize the Trump administration, with some wondering whether the Supreme Court justices, who have faced harassment and threats, too, realize how vulnerable they are.

While the Supreme Court has its own police department to assist with security, other judges rely solely on the Marshals Service, which is under the control of Trump’s Justice Department, creating what some view as a potential point of vulnerability if tensions between the judiciary and the White House continue to mount.

The judge who reported receiving threats said that even if the Supreme Court is insulated from some of the violent rhetoric and believes the Trump administration will follow its rulings, the rule of law cannot function if it does not defend the lower courts.

“If the entire foundation falls out from under your house, it does no good to have a really well-insulated attic,” the judge said. “It sure would be nice if someone had our backs.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250815SCOTUSvJudgesBernis-jg-ef3ad9.jpg",N,,2025-09-04 05:56:56.808276

The tough penalties usher in an unprecedented era of zero tolerance for people who remain in the country if their asylum claims are denied. As a frontier state, long viewed as a gateway to Europe, Greece has had a surge in migrant arrivals this year.

“We are accountable to Greek citizens, and Greek citizens want to be protected,” the migration minister, Thanos Plevris, told MPs ahead of voting. “The message is clear [for migrants]: if your asylum request is rejected, you have two choices. Either you go to jail or return to your homeland. The Greek state does not accept you … You are not welcome.”

An unabashed rightwinger whose stance has caused ripples among the more moderate members of Greece’s centre-right government, Plevris insisted asylum would continue to be granted to applicants who fulfilled the need for international protection.

But under the new law, asylum seekers who have their claims rejected and do not leave the country within 14 days face prison terms of two to five years. Deterrence measures will also be toughened: people who arrive without the proper paperwork will be detained for 24 months, up from the current 18 months, while unregulated migrants who have been in Greece for seven years will no longer have the right to legalise their status. Those found guilty of illegal entry will be fined €10,000.

The measures come barely two months after the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced a controversial 90-day pause on asylum applications amid a rise in arrivals on the islands of Crete and Gavdos from Libya. In the first week of July, more than 2,000 people successfully made the crossing – a significant increase in a country where migrant numbers have fallen dramatically since 2015, when more than 850,000 people arrived at the height of the refugee crisis.

Mitsotakis insisted the suspension was aimed at sending smuggling rings a resounding message that “the passage to Greece is closed”, though it was condemned by human rights groups as a grave violation of international law.

In power since 2019, the government describes its migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay.

Addressing parliament, Plevris said he was proud to have overseen the legislation, which will put Greece at the forefront of policies that few EU members have wanted to enforce.

But on Wednesday the backlash was as instant as it was broad, with judges taking the unprecedented step of weighing in to criticise the legislation’s emphasis on repression.

Highlighting the lack of consensus over the measures, Dimitris Kairidis, who stepped down as migration and asylum minister in 2024, told the Guardian that while deterrence remained paramount, it was vital Athens also eased legal pathways of migration at a time when labour shortages were acute.

“Greece needs both to counter illegal, but also encourage legal, migration as needed by its growing economy,” he said.

During his tenure, Kairidis legalised the status of 30,000 unregistered migrant labourers desperately required in the agriculture, construction and tourism sectors.

With Greece gripped by a demographic crisis that last week forced the education ministry to close more than 750 schools because of the lack of pupils, migrant solidarity workers called the law racist and nonsensical.

“It’s so contradictory that this should be passed when Greece’s population is in such freefall, and when migrants offer the solution to labour shortages,” said the director of the Greek Council for Refugees, Lefteris Papagiannakis. “Mitsotakis has managed to hold the centre ground. With this openly racist law, he is clearly trying to enlarge his voter pool by appealing to the far right.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/490abce60aef3f9a1dae85dcec8d2e091fe3b0b5/426_523_3515_2811/master/3515.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=30dcc6e4120ef67d22269e0af9a0b234",N,,2025-09-04 07:56:24.927360

But to find them, Congress must create a role for DHS in the sponsor-screening process from the outset,” Arthur wrote.

According to data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), President Donald Trump’s administration has overseen a sharp decline in the number of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) encountered by federal law enforcement officials, falling from 6,862 encounters in December to only 515 encounters in July: a 92.5% decrease. Since Trump returned to office at the end of January, CBP and other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) divisions have encountered a total of just over 4,733 UACs, compared to the annual average under the Biden administration of over 127,500, a 96% decrease.

Under the Biden administration, the number of unaccompanied minors subjected to sex-trafficking more than tripled, rising from an annual average of 625 sex-trafficked children to 1,143 in then-president Joe Biden’s first year in the White House. The numbers continued rising from there. According to border czar and former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) chief Tom Homan, over 300,000 UACs went missing under the Biden administration, with many suspected of having been sex trafficked. “We’re gonna find some of them living with pedophiles, living in sex slavery, some are gonna be dead, but we gotta find these children,” Homan said shortly before Trump returned to office.

One of the reasons cross-border child-trafficking has decreased so steeply is the presence of ICE agents at meetings between UACs and adult sponsors. Reportedly, ICE agents have begun attending the meetings during which migrant children are to be released from DHS custody to the care of their U.S.-based “parents” or sponsors, who are often illegal immigrants themselves. The new policy directive was issued by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responsible for the care of those minors. The new policy requires sponsors seeking custody of immigrant children to attend in-person meetings, rather than submit identification documents online, for more stringent vetting. Other measures taken by the Trump administration to protect immigrant children include mandatory fingerprinting of adult sponsors and all adult members of their households and allowing immigration officials to conduct home inspections and home visits.

Andrew Arthur, resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, explained in a recent article that a particular provision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 essentially created a loophole facilitating the trafficking of immigrant children. Section 235 of the TVPRA categorized unaccompanied minors as either coming from a “contiguous country” such as Canada or Mexico, allowing federal authorities to quickly deport the child if there was no credible fear of return, and those from “non-contiguous countries,” meaning everywhere else in the world. UACs from non-contiguous countries were required to be placed in the care of ORR and, if possible, eventually transferred to a sponsor in the U.S. “Not surprisingly, the number of non-contiguous UACs soared after Congress passed section 235 of the TVPRA, as parents (and more importantly smugglers) realized it essentially guaranteed that any child who could make it illegally across the line would be released into this country,” Arthur wrote. “ORR struggled to handle that UAC surge, to put it politely,” he added.

“You’d think that after all these hearings Congress would review … section 235 of the TVPRA, and either rescind [it] or at least fix the most glaring issues with the current UAC process,” Arthur quipped. He continued, “Congress premised that process on three naïve (and erroneous) propositions: (1) all UACs are better off with sponsors than in government custody; (2) most adult sponsors can be entrusted with a kid; and (3) it’s in the ‘best interests’ of alien children to come illegally with smugglers rather than to remain back home.” Arthur observed, “ORR has few defenders, but respectfully, in its haste to move UACs out of immigration custody, Congress failed to provide the office with any guidance on how to screen and when to deny would-be sponsors.” He continued, “As a result, it’s beyond cavil that children are raped, trafficked, exploited, and abused thanks to the [Homeland Security Act of 2002] and TVPRA, and whenever the volume of UACs at the border rises, those hells compound exponentially.”

Arthur pointed out that, under federal law, the smuggling of non-citizens into the U.S. qualifies as a class D felony, with a penalty of up to a decade in prison. “There’s no exception for adults who conspire to smuggle kids here, and if DHS throws a few would-be sponsors cum conspirators in jail for a decade, you’ll see the child-smuggling industry dry up quickly. But to find them, Congress must create a role for DHS in the sponsor-screening process from the outset,” Arthur wrote. He added, “Ideally, alien children encountered at the border would be handed over to USCIS officers to determine whether they have viable asylum or trafficking claims, and only if they do should they be placed with a sponsor here. If UACs don’t have an asylum or trafficking claim, however, they should be transferred to their own governments for placement abroad.”",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25I12_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:28.409987

The proposed rule seeks to limit the validity period for beneficiaries of those visas relative to the current rules.

Impact:

Under current regulations, persons who are beneficiaries of F visas for foreign students, J visas for exchange visitors, and I visas for representatives of foreign media outlets that have a home office in a foreign country, have their visas approved for a period that does not have a set duration, but instead is tied to specific program the visa holder is participating in or their employment. (This is known as being approved for a “duration of status.”)

DHS’s August 28 proposed rule seeks to change this to limit most admissions for foreign students at four years and possibly limit English language program students for two-years. The rule also proposes to shorten the grace period for leaving the country after completion of studies from 60 to 30 days. Visas for representatives of foreign media outlets would be limited to 240 days under DHS’s proposal.

There are nearly 1.6 million active records for persons who hold F-1 and M-1 visas; a miniscule share of those are M-1 holders, as there were 6,322 M-1 visas issued in 2024 (M-1 visas are not impacted by the proposed rule but are lumped together with F-1 by DHS in data reports). There were over 400,000 new F-1 visas issued by the State Department in 2024, 323,000 J-1 visas, and nearly 13,000 I visas.

DHS notes in their reasoning for the proposal that the current system undermines the agency’s ability to monitor and enforce compliance and results in fewer check-ins with DHS to verify compliance, and leads to insufficient monitoring of beneficiaries. DHS also cited national security concerns. It is difficult to know if these measures will significantly impact demand for visas in these three categories, but the President’s Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a lobby group for universities, argues that it will burden schools and students and deter foreign students and academics from coming to the United States.",https://files.epi.org/uploads/Federal-Policy-Watch-Project-2025-action-950x534.png,N,,2025-09-04 05:56:48.391673

Washington, D.C., September 3, 2025—On September 9, the U.S. Census Bureau will release national Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance data for 2024. We expect the numbers to show more poverty in 2024, particularly among children, and more people without health insurance. When we see the data, however, we must consider that the outlook for 2025 and beyond is ominous, given how precipitously the conditions for people facing economic insecurity have declined this year.

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the administration and Congress have unleashed a cascade of attacks on people with low incomes, including communities of color, immigrants and their families, and others who have been historically marginalized. These attacks have included slashing public benefit programs; issuing executive orders dismantling diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives; ripping families apart through a horrific mass deportation effort and gutting protections and services to immigrants, including U.S. citizen children; eliminating labor protections for millions of workers; and decimating the nation’s data collection efforts that are critical to accurate and equitable decision-making. Through these and other actions, the Trump Administration’s reckless disregard for people’s health, safety, and well-being will have dire consequences for the future of the country.

These attacks are particularly evident in the reconciliation bill passed by Congress, which is causing unprecedented harm to workers, people of color, immigrants, women, and children. In addition to excluding many families with low incomes from the Child Tax Credit, the bill cuts essential benefit programs, including Medicaid and SNAP. Although these changes will not be fully implemented until 2026 and beyond, they are already having a chilling effect among people who rely on these programs to meet their basic needs. Congress made these cuts to fund historic increases in immigration enforcement that undermine family unity and well-being and to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, which will only exacerbate poverty and wealth inequality.

The September 9 data will likely show another annual increase in people without health insurance coverage. The end of Covid-era protections for Medicaid coverage caused many people to lose coverage in 2024, although the availability of enhanced premium tax credits in the Marketplace likely offset some Medicaid losses. Congress’s action in 2025 to cut Medicaid and enhanced Marketplace tax credits by more than $1 trillion is estimated to cause nearly 15 million people to lose coverage in the coming years.

The full effect of millions of people losing health insurance, food assistance, and other supports—and how that loss will harm not just individuals but their families, communities, and the larger economy—will drive even more people deeper into poverty and instability for years to come.

We will have more to say after the Census Bureau releases the data next week. For now, CLASP reiterates our commitment to fighting for policies that center the dignity and autonomy of all people, especially those whom the Trump Administration and the current majority in Congress are most focused on harming with their punitive and dangerous actions.",https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-24.png,N,,2025-09-04 08:56:32.524631

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deal with Nauru was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”.
Favero said the broad wording in the deal could enable many thousands of people to be deported from Australia.
Nauru was one of two countries Australia initially sent asylum seekers to when it first began its controversial offshore detention programme in 2001.
In June 2023, the last refugees remaining on Nauru returned to Australia after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fulfilled an election promise to end offshore detention.","The Australian government has agreed to pay the small Pacific island nation of Nauru some $1.6bn over three decades to resettle former detainees who have “no legal right to remain in Australia”, in the latest iteration of Australia’s controversial offshore detention policies.

Both governments signed a secretive deal last week under which Nauru will resettle up to 354 people who have no legal right to stay in Australia in exchange for an initial 408 million Australian dollar payment ($267m) and about 70 million Australian dollars ($46m) each year thereafter.

Independent Senator David Pocock said a “snap Senate hearing” on Wednesday night revealed that the “agreement with Nauru to send asylum seekers there” could cost the Australian government up to 2.5 billion Australian dollars ($1.6bn) over 30 years.

The Senate hearing came after Australia’s Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke announced last week that he had signed a memorandum with Nauru’s president “for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru”.

“It’s in both nations’ interest to move through this as efficiently as we can,” said Clare Sharp, head of immigration from the Department of Home Affairs.

“It’s in Nauru’s interest, because money doesn’t flow until people arrive,” she said.

With an estimated population of some 12,500 and a mainland measuring just 21 square kilometres (8.1 square miles), Nauru is among the world’s smallest countries.

Nauru’s President David Adeang said in a statement on Sunday that the agreement with Australia will “support Nauru’s long-term economic resilience”.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Melbourne-based Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said the deal with Nauru was “discriminatory, disgraceful and dangerous”.

Favero said the broad wording in the deal could enable many thousands of people to be deported from Australia.

“That’s tens of thousands of lives at risk – not the tiny number the government would have Australians believe,” Favero said in a statement.

Australian immigration officials said there are no guarantees all 354 people – including some convicted of serious crimes – will be deported to Nauru, with the Pacific island making the final decision.

Australia’s government has struggled to find a way to deal with immigrants who have no other country to go to when their visas are cancelled. The country’s High Court ruled in 2023 that indefinite detention was unlawful if deportation was not an option, leading to the release of 220 people.

The number of people in that situation in Australia now numbers 354, government officials said.

In February, Australia paid an undisclosed sum for Nauru to accept three immigrants convicted of violent offences, though legal challenges have reportedly stalled their transfer.

Nauru was one of two countries Australia initially sent asylum seekers to when it first began its controversial offshore detention programme in 2001.

In June 2023, the last refugees remaining on Nauru returned to Australia after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese fulfilled an election promise to end offshore detention.

In January this year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found Australia’s offshore policy had violated two provisions of the legally-binding 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – one on arbitrary detention and one protecting the right to challenge detention in court.

Nauru has in recent years turned to other migration-related schemes in attempts to revive its economy, which historically has relied on thriving exports of phosphate, a key ingredient used in fertiliser. But those supplies have long dried up, and researchers today estimate 80 percent of Nauru has been rendered uninhabitable by mining.

Last month, Nauru’s government announced it had welcomed its first new citizens under an Economic and Climate Resilience Citizenship Programme, which provides citizenship and a passport for a minimum investment in the country of $105,000.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24015247834742-1756956177_7da4ac-1756956748.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:29.929818

These are not ordinary times. It’s not just that the Trump administration is taking actions that horrify and offend us. It’s that in just seven months, President Trump has all but dismantled a democratic system that took more than 200 years to build.

He and his team have failed to comply with nearly a third of major judicial rulings against them. They have created heavily-armed goon squads that seize people off the streets without warrants or due process.

They have eliminated, intimidated or coerced into submission all the institutions — the free press, academia, the courts, independent inspectors general, regulators, scientific panels and data — that used to guard against corruption and abuse.

Republicans in Congress have completely abdicated their power of the purse. Whatever checks and balances that once existed are ceasing to function.

We are now, for all intents and purposes, living in a dictatorship where the rules are made and changed at the whim of a single person, and the only beneficiaries are the ultra-rich.

Yet Democrats in Congress are largely conducting business as usual, as if this were merely a policy squabble. They continue to attend sham hearings, cooperate with Republicans in drafting legislation that will be ignored or circumvented by the administration and allow nominations to go through without a serious fight.

Lacking the votes to stop the worst excesses of Trump and his sycophants, Democratic legislators seem to think their options are limited to negotiating deals that are less horrendous or voting “no.”

But there is more that Democrats can and should do if they want to demonstrate a credible alternative to the current mayhem and win back the trust and support of the American people.

First, they should stop playing ball with Republicans and adopt a policy of strategic non-cooperation. They should refuse to help Republicans make a quorum, negotiate budget deals and pass legislation.

There is no point in making terrible bills marginally less bad when money they add goes unspent, restrictions they insert go unheeded and protections they demand are subverted. Instead, they should use the rules to obstruct and delay proceedings that are likely to end in further erosion of our rights.

As Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) put it, “every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

Second, they should show who and what they stand for and how they would govern differently.

Congressional Democrats should establish caucuses that function as shadow committees, holding their own hearings, issuing their own reports, and conducting their own investigations on issues of key importance to the American public.

Together with governors and party leadership, they should create a shadow cabinet, akin to the United Kingdom’s Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet. This would give Democrats an opportunity to show what they would do if they were in charge.

The shadow secretaries would lay out their vision and budget for their respective departments and issue detailed critiques of the current administration’s actions and omissions.

The party should adopt a clear and simple set of priorities, such as increasing affordability, improving family health and security and limiting the power of big money.

Third, Democrats in Washington should spend more time in their home states and districts, listening to local communities and supporting local leaders. With nothing useful happening in the nation’s capital, the momentum for change has shifted to municipal governments and civic campaigns.

National legislators can do more good by learning from and lending their voice to local movements than by giving floor speeches and proposing federal legislation that goes nowhere.

Finally, Democrats should build closer relationships with their counterparts in countries that have successfully emerged from authoritarian rule.

Organized resistance movements in Spain, Chile, Poland, South Africa and South Korea helped bring about peaceful democratic transitions, and they have much to teach us about preventing, countering and surviving tyranny.

If the last seven months have taught us anything, it should be that democracy is fragile and requires vigilance. Fascism can happen here, too.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times.
Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change.","Real World Impact: Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published an interim final rule (IFR) that provides a new online process for unregistered foreign nationals to comply with the decades-old but rarely enforced registration requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The IFR also requires foreign nationals over the age of 18 to carry proof of registration with them at all times. Failure to register or carry proof of registration is punishable by fines and possible imprisonment.

Background: Under the INA, with limited exceptions, foreign nationals age 14 or older who were not registered or fingerprinted (if required) when they applied for a visa and who are staying in the U.S. for 30 days or longer must apply for registration and fingerprinting. Parents and legal guardians of foreign nationals under age 14 must ensure they are registered. Within 30 days of turning 14, a foreign national, regardless of whether they previously registered, must apply for registering and fingerprinting.

Who is Already Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are considered preregistered, and no additional registration action is needed: lawful permanent residents, those with Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), those on sponsored work visas who have an I-94, their family members who have a valid I-94, and a few other categories. A full list of those who are considered preregistered is available on the USCIS website at: https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration.

Who is Not Considered Registered?

Certain foreign nationals are not considered registered and must do so, including those who entered the U.S. without inspection, children who are turning 14 (as noted above), and visa-exempt Canadian visitors who entered at a land port of entry, were not issued an I-94 upon entry, and are staying in the U.S. longer than 30 days.

New Registration Form

USCIS has developed a new registration form that those who are not registered can use: https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/g-325r. Note that the use of this form to register is not an immigration status and does not confer employment authorization or provide any other right or benefit under the INA or other U.S. law.

Evidence of Registration

The following documents are considered evidence of registration:

I-94, Arrival-Departure Record—Aliens admitted as nonimmigrants; aliens paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; aliens whose claimed entry prior to July 1, 1924, cannot be verified, having satisfactorily established residence in the United States since prior to July 1, 1924; and aliens granted permission to depart without the institution of deportation proceedings.

I-95, Crewmen's Landing Permit—Crewmen arriving by vessel or aircraft.

I-184, Alien Crewman Landing Permit and Identification Card—Crewmen arriving by vessel.

I-185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Canada or British subjects residing in Canada.

I-186, Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card—Citizens of Mexico residing in Mexico.

I-221, Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-221S, Order to Show Cause, Notice of Hearing, and Warrant for Arrest of Alien—Aliens against whom deportation proceedings are being instituted.

I-551, Permanent Resident Card—Lawful permanent resident of the United States.

I-766, Employment Authorization Document.

Form I-862, Notice to Appear—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

Form I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge—Aliens against whom removal proceedings are being instituted.

USCIS Proof of Alien G-325R Registration, or its successor form (this newly developed form is discussed above).

See https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-264/section-264.1. In addition to the documents listed above, a valid, unexpired DHS admission or parole stamp in a foreign passport constitutes evidence of registration.

Requirement to Carry Proof of Registration

All foreign nationals over the age of 18 who are required to register must carry their proof of registration with them at all times. For green card holders, this means carrying their Permanent Resident cards with them at all times. As with any important personal documents, we recommend people make copies of their proof of registration in case of loss or theft. Foreign nationals must also notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days of the change. A failure to comply with either of these requirements is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment of up to 30 days, or both.

The Bottom Line

While most noncitizen employees will be considered preregistered and do not need to reregister, it is important that they ensure they have proof of registration with them at all times. Few arrests have been reported for failure to possess proof of registration, but it is important to ensure that foreign nationals are prepared to demonstrate their compliance with the registration requirement in light of the USCIS’s increased focus on worksite enforcement. If someone is detained and asked to provide this documentation, they are not required to answer any questions and can ask to speak to their lawyer. Following arrests for failure to register, some courts have dismissed charges where prosecutors were unable to articulate probable cause for the defendant’s knowledge of the registration requirement and/or intentional refusal to register.

The Trump administration has claimed — without providing evidence — that the casualties of the strike were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that it has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

“Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, following the attack. “Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”

The White House posted an image on social media of Trump looking at a phone showing footage of the boat being hit. “TERRORISTS ELIMINATED. ADIÓS,” the post says, with an emoji of a person placing items in the trash.

In another post, the White House said: “ON VIDEO: U.S. Military Forces conducted a strike against Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists. The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the U.S. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action.”

The Trump administration has circulated a brief black and white video that it says shows the fatal strike. AP reports that the White House “did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members.” The outlet also noted that the video “is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people” and “did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.”

Experts say the administration’s deadly strike violated international law.

“Labeling someone a terrorist and deploying the military does not make them a military target,” Vincent Warren, executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement to Truthout. “These actions amount to an extra-judicial killing, a violation of international law, which should raise extraordinary concerns.”

“Without clear limitations on presidential and military authority, we may find this administration claiming that it can execute alleged drug dealers at home without any judicial process as happened under the Duterte regime in the Philippines,” Warren continued. Former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte is now at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of committing crimes against humanity, including rape, murder, and torture, in the context of the government’s so-called “war on drugs” campaign.

“Using military forces to kill alleged drug traffickers is an act of murder, not war,” Wells Dixon, a senior attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Truthout in a statement following the attack on Tuesday.

Civil rights attorney Alec Karakatsanis called the killings “extra-judicial assassinations — a preemptive death penalty with no process — for vague alleged nonviolent drug distribution offenses.”

Trump has a long history of calling for U.S. intervention to overthrow Venezuela’s government, and has escalated tensions in recent days by building up the U.S. military’s presence near the country. The Trump administration has also frequently accused people of belonging to Tren de Aragua to justify violations of their human rights.

Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization and subsequently invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to send more than 250 Venezuelans living in the United States to El Salvador’s notoriously brutal prison, CECOT. The administration repeatedly accused the men of being Tren de Aragua members, despite the fact that a majority did not have criminal convictions.

After four months, they were sent home to Venezuela in a prisoner swap deal between Venezuela and the United States. The men, including a soccer coach, a makeup artist, and a musician, have reported that they were physically and psychologically tortured at the prison.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-3-trump-at-white-house.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:38.351940

The issue the case presents is what deference, if any, the courts owe to official presidential lies.
Whatever crimes its members may be committing, it is not conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States—at least not such as might be considered a predatory incursion.
The dissent, by Judge Andrew Oldham, argues that the court is obliged to accept these lies.
A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.","The Situation last week contemplated the deployment of National Guard and federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C.

And I fully expected when I awoke this morning to continue in the same vein today and discuss Mayor Muriel Bowser’s executive order aligning city policy with Trump’s federal law enforcement posture vis-a-vis the city—a subject to which I will return.

But when I woke up and glanced at my computer, I found news that genuinely surprised me: The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had rejected President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being members of Tren de Aragua. The Fifth Circuit is perhaps the most conservative appeals court in the country. What’s more, I had listened to the oral argument in the case, and it frankly didn’t lead me to think the opinion would come out like this.

Yet there it was: a 2-to-1 opinion in which the majority holds that President Trump just can’t make the Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations when the president determines there has been an “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” cover immigrants from Venezuela by issuing a proclamation claiming that the Tren de Aragua gang is state-controlled and that the immigration is some kind of incursion.

I have a few observations about this case:

The first is that opinion, by Judge Leslie Southwick, is a slog to read. It is not especially well argued or reasoned, in my view. It will not go down in history as a wonderful piece of legal writing. There are no memorable lines.

But the quality of the opinion actually doesn’t matter very much. Not all opinions can have soaring rhetoric that makes one’s heart go pitter-patter. Not all the children can be above average. And some opinions are important less for their quality or reasoning or writing than as indicators.

This opinion is an indicator—an indicator that not all conservative judges feel the need to defer to the bullshit. It’s not the first such indicator. And it’s not the most eloquent. But it’s the strongest evidence we’ve seen so far in the Alien Enemy Act context. And that’s a hopeful sign.

The key point here is that the Trump administration had a chance to argue its extravagant claim of power to deport people based on complete fiction before one of the few courts of appeals in the country that is consistently more conservative than the Supreme Court. And it couldn’t persuade a panel of that court to uphold its invocation of an 18th Century legacy of the John Adams administration to deal with a 21st Century gang. That does not bode well for Trump’s chances before Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett—who together define the legal scope of modern American presidential autocracy.

The Fifth Circuit here is just a waystation. What matters here is only the signal that this is an issue that will divide conservative jurists.

But let’s pause a moment to be candid about the legal issue at stake in this case, and let’s bother to state it more precisely than the Fifth Circuit did. The issue the case presents is what deference, if any, the courts owe to official presidential lies. Do judges owe such deference to knowing and intentional untruths as to detain and deport people based on them? Or are they allowed to, in the common vernacular of our time, call bullshit on the president?

This is not an exaggeration meant for effect. I mean it very literally. The March 15 proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act is predicated on the following statements: “I find and declare that [Tren de Aragua] TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.”

That is not a true statement, and Trump’s finding and declaring it doesn’t make it true.

And on the basis of this untrue statement, the president finds that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

So now let me distill for you a lengthy and turgid judicial opinion into three short sentences of plain English:

Tren de Aragua is not, in fact, perpetrating or attempting an invasion or predatory incursion of the United States by any reasonable understanding of the terms in question.

Whatever crimes its members may be committing, it is not conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States—at least not such as might be considered a predatory incursion.

Consequently, Venezuelan citizens cannot lawfully be apprehended and removed as Alien Enemies.

The majority opinion does not call the statements in Trump’s proclamation lies, because in the mannered style of judicial opinions, one just doesn’t say that the president is gaslighting the public in an official presidential proclamation. Comity between the branches or something like that.

But I’m going to be blunt about it: I don’t believe for a second that Trump or his lawyers actually believe that Venezuelan immigration, even by Tren de Aragua members, constitutes an invasion or predatory incursion within the meaning of the Alien Enemies Act. They are relying instead on a claim about the unreviewable nature of the president’s power to decide these things, not about the truth or reasonableness of what he has decided.

And that question of reviewability is what divides the panel.

The dissent, by Judge Andrew Oldham, argues that the court is obliged to accept these lies. “What is the upshot of this series of cases?” he asks, having gone over the relevant case law. “All of them recognize one fundamental principle: The President’s judgment call as to the existence of a state of war, invasion, or insurrection is conclusive.”

Judge Oldham may well prove correct as a bellwether of where a majority of the Supreme Court comes down. A majority of justices will, of course, never say that they believe this nonsense about Tren de Aragua conducting an invasion or predatory incursion against the United States.

But they could end up signing off on the happy fiction that they have to pretend they believe that President Trump really believes this garbage (comity between the branches being what it is and all, and he having sworn an oath to take care that the laws be faithfully executed and all). And they thus could end up taking the position that it is not their job to determine, as Judge Oldham put it, that “the Executive’s finding [is] so implausible it should be overridden by a handful of generals-in-robes.” Even though it is so implausible that generals-in-robes who refuse to override it should be careful about calling themselves lawyers.

But while Judge Oldham may get the last laugh, Judge Southwick’s opinion offers proof that at least some conservative jurists look—and thus hope that maybe two Supreme Court justices will look—at the president’s proclamation and say that there has to be some limit to the deference owed to the president when he is just blowing smoke in the faces of the judges.

If the president had issued a proclamation that said, “I find and declare that an eggplant is perpetrating an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States” and that therefore “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA” are deportable, would any judge find such a statement “conclusive” as to an individual’s detainability or removability? The current order is hardly less nonsensical a basis on which to lock people up and put them on planes.

DECORAH — Calls to protect immigrant residents from federal enforcement dominated Tuesday night’s Decorah City Council meeting, as speakers urged adoption of a proposed ""separation ordinance"" that would limit local cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The issue appeared on the agenda as ""Discussion on Public Comment Received Regarding Jail Services and Arrestees,"" after weeks of organizing by residents and the advocacy group Decorah Community for Immigrant Rights. Supporters said the ordinance would prevent local police and jail services from going beyond what federal or state law requires in working with ICE.

During public comment, Ruth Palmer, a volunteer with the Immigration Action Network, told the council she opposed the federal agency’s practices but urged unity in the local debate.

""With the group that’s gathered here, I share a common concern for the rights of immigrants, but I oppose their proposed separation ordinance, because the focus of all in this room needs to be on protecting rights. On building unity, not separation,"" Palmer said.

""We need the passion, the energy, the ideas of every person here to commit to the protection of the most vulnerable in our community, recognizing that we are only as strong as our weakest link.""

Other speakers demanded clearer limits on cooperation with ICE. Christine Mohrhauser of DCIR cited deaths and abuses in immigration detention on a federal level.

""Do the people of Decorah really want to be known as complacently handing over our neighbors?"" she asked. ""We do not want our police department aiding this known abusive agency any more than that which is absolutely legally necessary.""

Matthew Alexander, a Decorah resident of more than 30 years, invoked his Norwegian immigrant ancestors in urging support.

""When I consider what it would have been like for my Norwegian great-grandparents to have experienced such cruel action, it stops me in my tracks,"" he said. ""We support this proposed separation ordinance to allow for respect and pause in the lightning attacks on people and to give inherent human rights and freedoms.""

Some residents framed the proposal as both moral and practical. Andrea Beck, who immigrated from Spain in 2013, told council members: ""As a former immigrant myself, I support this ordinance because it helps Decorah comply with federal immigration enforcement without giving away extra information that could compromise the safety of our immigrants.""

She warned that many local immigrants ""don't feel safe walking around in our community anymore.""

But opponents questioned whether the city had the authority to act. Retired Spanish teacher Margaret Betteridge, who volunteers as an interpreter for IAN, said: ""This proposed ordinance is not something that our city can realistically adopt. This type of reform needs to happen at the state or national level. Unfortunately, our city government can’t legislate ICE.""

Others rebutted that claim. Eric Rovelo of DCIR told the council the ordinance was designed only to ensure local agencies ""do exactly what’s required under the law and nothing that isn’t explicitly required."" He noted that more than 40 cities and 160 counties across the U.S. have passed similar measures.

City Manager Travis Goedken prefaced the council’s discussion by reading a prepared statement, cautioning that nothing discussed should be seen as restricting cooperation with federal agencies.

""Nothing that I give as a statement should be construed as discouraging, prohibiting or restricting law enforcement officers, employees or officials from cooperating with or assisting in federal immigration law enforcement activities,"" Goedken said, citing Iowa Code Chapter 27A.

Council Member Cody Whittle said he asked for the item to be placed on the agenda because the community deserved transparency.

""When I think about how I want government to work, I think if the public brings something forth and wants to discuss it, I think that we owe it to them to do that in an honest and open way,"" Whittle said. He praised both sides of the debate for ""so much in common … they care so much about human rights and share a deep concern for immigrants.""

Council Member Emily Neil said she deliberated at length before agreeing to place the item on the agenda. While she called it ""a moral moment,"" Neil asserted the ordinance as drafted would not protect immigrants and could instead draw harmful attention.

""The ordinance proposed is either outside of the jurisdiction of the city council, against the law, or in some cases already practiced and covered by other city ordinances,"" Neil said. ""Additionally, it opens up our city manager and our officers to unnecessary conflicts as they try to determine how to enforce a city ordinance that is in direct opposition to state law.""

Neil also stressed that the city has no control over the county jail, a focal point of the ordinance.

""The county owns the jail and is responsible for its oversight. To be clear, the Decorah City Council has no oversight of the county jail. It merely sits on land owned by the city,"" she said.

Council Member Brent Parker echoed that point, saying the ordinance confused the roles of city and county.

""We have no say in what our elected sheriff does in his jail,"" Parker said. ""If you have issues, maybe this is talking to him, not using the city of Decorah to circumvent that.""

Council Member Steve Zittergruen pointed to the city’s police department as already taking steps to support immigrants. He noted that officers use a language line to communicate with non-English speakers and provide a complaint process, and that no formal complaints had been received.

""I think they’re reaching out and doing the right things,"" Zittergruen said, citing Police Chief Trisha Thein’s prior experience in Marshalltown, a city ""with a more diverse population.""

Council Member Christopher Miculinich called the ordinance’s supporters sincere and urged broader collaboration.

""At the end of the day I don’t want to take a professional position on the set ordinance,"" Miculinich said. ""I think it’s great we’re having the conversation, but … we do have a bunch of other local organizations that are fighting for the same needs in our community. I would urge a collective effort.""

Despite rejecting the ordinance in its current form, members repeatedly thanked residents for their comments.

""I appreciate the conversation that has occurred here tonight. I know that’s not an easy thing,"" Miculinich added. ""The fact that you guys are getting up and having these conversations is a great thing to see.""

At a press conference held after the meeting, members of DCIR described the council discussion as a breakthrough, despite the council’s stance on the ordinance.

""Tonight, City Council made a critical move by putting the separation ordinance on the agenda, and that matters,"" Aime Rovelo, a member of DCIR, said. ""Its goal is simple: keep our community safe by drawing a clear line between local law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement.""

Speakers said codifying limits on cooperation is necessary to protect against future changes in leadership.

""Nothing in this ordinance is against the police,"" Joshua Ratel-Khan said. ""What we’re asking for is to codify what those discussions have looked like. You cannot guarantee that all police officers or the chief of police will continue to enact this law, especially in the political climate we’re in.""

They also rejected claims that state law blocks local action.

""They may say that Code 27A prevents us from enacting many of these things in this ordinance, but again, that’s not true,"" Ratel-Khan said. ""Our ordinance doesn’t say we don’t want our police to cooperate with ICE. It says we don’t want to go above and beyond what the law requires.""

Advocates framed the measure as part of a broader national movement.

""This ordinance comes from the people, from years of organizing by immigrant-led groups across the country … We know ICE is already in Iowa. Arrests are climbing. This is not a hypothetical scenario, it is very real,"" Rovelo said. ""We will keep organizing, keep showing up and keep fighting until every immigrant in Decorah can live with dignity, safety, and freedom from deportation.""",http://dircx6nshkvfy.cloudfront.net/360_Decorah_Live/0/0/0/0/19/948/19948_1,N,,2025-09-04 01:56:42.916339

Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/landor-v-louisiana-department-of-corrections-and-public-safety/,"When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials.
The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.
Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA.
State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.
The Supreme Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit, allowing Damon Landor to seek damages.","The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act protects the religious freedom of incarcerated people. Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian, wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion. After serving the first four months of his sentence at facilities where administrators respected his religious practice, that changed with his transfer to Raymond Laborde Correctional Center. There, when Landor showed the prison officials a printout of a Fifth Circuit decision holding that RLIUPA protected his right to keep his dreadlocks, they threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights under RLIUPA, the district court held that RLIUPA does not provide for damages against individual state officials. The Fifth Circuit affirmed, and Landor asked the Supreme Court to hear his case.

In September 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of Landor. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, Congress has broad discretion to make federal funding contingent on statutory conditions and craft remedies for violations of those conditions. The Spending Clause authorizes Congress to spend for the “general Welfare of the United States.” The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress has substantial discretion to define “the concept of the general welfare” and exercise its spending power accordingly. When Congress grants federal funds to a state subject to conditions it deems to be in furtherance of the general welfare, it also has significant discretion to ensure compliance with those conditions, including by using its legislative power to craft remedies for noncompliance, such as private rights of action. The Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause underscores Congress’s authority in this area.

Second, the court below erred when it claimed to import contract law “wholesale” to rewrite RLIUPA’s express private right of action. The Supreme Court has used contract law principles to interpret the application of the Spending Clause in two limited scenarios: to ensure that funding recipients had sufficient notice of the specific conduct prohibited by Congress, and to fill in statutory gaps about the type of relief available. The Court has refused to employ the contract-law analogy to displace or invalidate clear statutory text, emphasizing that the contract-law analogy does not sanction incorporating contract law “wholesale.”

The contract-law analogy has limited utility in this case: it simply raises the question of whether state funding recipients had sufficient notice when they accepted federal funds that their employees may be held individually liable for damages if they violate RLUIPA’s substantive provisions. The answer to that question is yes. The Supreme Court has held that identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act protected the ability to seek damages against state employees in their individual capacity. The Fifth Circuit supplied no reason to interpret the identical language in RLIUPA differently, because there is none.

Finally, there is no principled reason that state employees in particular may not be personally liable for damages under RLUIPA. RLUIPA does not impose liability on just anyone for violating its terms. It imposes liability on employees of the state. State employees are uniquely positioned as state actors to be held liable for actions in violation of funding terms that the state knowingly accepted.

Notably, just two years ago the Supreme Court reaffirmed that Spending Clause statutes, like all other federal laws, may give rise to privately enforceable rights pursuant to Section 1983 even where Congress does not include a cause of action in the statute itself. Here, Congress explicitly authorized private parties to enforce RLUIPA against state officials by importing Section 1983’s language into RLUIPA’s express cause of action. Rather than honor that statutory text, the Fifth Circuit effectively penalized Congress for its clarity.

Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article311962644.html,"The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.

“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation.
It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.
It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.","The Trump administration announced on Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States would lose their deportation protections and work permits under Temporary Protected Status by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the agency had reviewed conditions in Venezuela in collaboration with the State Department, and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had determined that the 2021 TPS designation for Venezuela was “contrary to the national interest.”

“Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,” said an agency spokesperson in a statement.

The decision leaves about 257,000 Venezuelans, including many in South Florida, vulnerable to being deported to a homeland deep in crisis and under the repressive governance of leader Nicolas Maduro.

The decision will also be heavily felt in South Florida, the heart of the Venezuelan community in the United States. On Wednesday, advocates and leaders were already reeling from the announcement.

“Venezuelans under TPS are not a burden—they are a resilient community that brings value, hope, and integrity to this nation. Ignoring their reality would be a failure to uphold the fundamental principles of compassion and justice that have long defined the United States,” said Helene Villalonga, a Venezuelan activist and president of the Multicultural Association of Activists for Voice and Expression.

In a separate announcement in February, the Trump administration ended TPS protections for another group of approximately 350,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries, arguing that conditions in the country have changed sufficiently to allow them to safely return. The vast majority currently do not enjoy TPS protections, and only about 5,000 currently have their TPS work permits as a result of ongoing litigation out of a federal district court in California. Their fate lies in the hands of Judge Edward Chen, who has been overseeing that lawsuit.

Substantial evidence suggests that many TPS holders would face severe consequences if repatriated. Many could be subjected to imprisonment, torture, or even death at the hands of the same government they once fled.

“The situation has definitely not improved in Venezuela,” Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told the Miami Herald in a recent interview. “On the contrary, following the July 28 elections of 2024, repression and political persecution have intensified. We currently have at least 890 political prisoners, including 72 foreigners, and at least 66 people who are missing, with their whereabouts still unknown.”

In addition to political persecution, returning Venezuelans would reenter a country teetering on collapse—maligned by hyperinflation, soaring unemployment, rampant crime, frequent power outages, water shortages and chronic scarcities of food and medicine.

Ironically, the assertion that Venezuela is safe is not consistently reflected across the Trump administration. The State Department has repeatedly urged U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Venezuela under any circumstances.

“Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure. All U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents in Venezuela are strongly advised to depart immediately,” a State Department advisory stated in May.

The Biden administration first granted Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans in 2021, a move that was largely celebrated in South Florida, home to one of the largest populations of people from the South American country. It then created a second TPS designation in 2023 that further expanded the protections so more people would benefit.

In February, the Trump administration ended the 2023 designation, a move which has led to fierce battles in the federal courts. The Trump administration ended the 2021 designation on Tuesday. It is set to expire on Sept. 10.

Wednesday’s announcement will face challenges in the federal courts. Last week, a federal appeals court in San Francisco unanimously affirmed Judge Chen’s decision decision to keep TPS while litigation is ongoing. It also ruled that TPS for Venezuelans should be kept until October 2026, like Chen had ruled in a preliminary injunction in March, because conditions in the country have not improved and Noem had ended it improperly. Venezuelans are now awaiting for Chen in San Francisco to issue a final determination on the matter.

However, earlier this year, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court asking the nation’s top judges to intervene in the lower court’s case in an emergency order.

In the federal register notice that ended the 2023 designation in February, the Trump administration said that there were notable improvements in areas such as the “economy, public health, and crime” which allowed Venezuelans to go back. It also similarly invoked the argument that the TPS designation was not in the national interests of the United States.

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has targeted Venezuelans through his mass deportation efforts. He has ended a parole program for several countries that allowed over 117,000 Venezuelans to legally live and work in the United States for two years and invoked a wartime act to send hundreds of Venezuelans the government accused of being gang members to a notorious terrorist prison in El Salvador.

The end of TPS also comes one day after the Trump administration blew up a boat, killing 11 people which federal officials say were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua transporting drugs to the United States. Typically, boats engaged in the illicit drug trade would be intercepted at sea by federal authorities and occupants are processed through the criminal justice system.

Adelys Ferro — the director of the Venezuelan American Caucus and who has been involved in the ongoing federal litigation — said that it’s a contradiction that the administration is launching an aggressive campaign against drug trafficking and gangs in Venezuela while saying that Venezuelans in the United States can return.

“We will continue fighting,” she said.

José Antonio Colina, the president of the Miami-based Organization of the Politically Persecuted Venezuelans in Exile, said that his hope now rested on the District Court.

“In the midst of all this political and military situation between the United States and Venezuela, sending Venezuelans back there, where their lives are at risk, is basically exposing them to a death sentence,” he said

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that?","Witnesses say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were spotted outside of the Domestic Violence Courthouse in Chicago's West Loop on Wednesday, taking at least one person into federal custody ahead of their scheduled court appearance.

The incident comes as the Trump administration has been preparing to launch a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago by the end of the week.

The courthouse at 555 W. Harrison St. opens at 8:30 a.m. each weekday. One woman, whose name CBS News Chicago is withholding because of the nature of her case, was set to appear in court at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, but didn't make it there.

According to court records, she wasn't in court because she was in ICE custody.

Witnesses said they saw a man, who they believe to be a federal officer, assist in her arrest outside the courthouse about 15 minutes before her scheduled time to appear.

A victim advocate asked why the woman was being arrested, and said an agent told her, ""We're going to speak to her about her immigration status"" before putting the woman in handcuffs.

CBS News Chicago has learned the woman in this case was an accused abuser, arrested by the Chicago Police Department and charged with two misdemeanor counts of domestic battery.

Court records indicated the charges were dropped on Wednesday.

""Sounds like as soon as we got word, my advocates and a bunch of other advocates and legal aid attorneys came down and started passing out 'know your rights' information,"" said Tessa Kuipers, program director and policy advisor at Family Rescue.

Victim advocates said the incident has people concerned they'll need to choose between reporting domestic violence and facing ICE when they show up to court.

There have been previous reports about ICE agents showing up to the Chicago Immigration Court, but no such reports of them showing up at Domestic Violence Court until now.

After the arrest, standing in the lobby of the Domestic Violence Courthouse, it was clear others decided not to attend their hearings because they were afraid to face ICE.

""My advocates were calling the survivors that had planned to come to court today, and telling them that ICE is there,"" Kuipers said.

Kuipers works as a victim advocate at the courthouse. She said she worries the arrest will deter victims of domestic violence from reporting their abusers.

""Just making people, survivors, unsafer. Obviously, survivors are going to know ICE was here. They're going to have hesitancy about seeking protections, about connecting with their advocate and orders of protection and criminal charges that might be a tool for safety for them,"" Kuipers said.

In a statement, Amanda Pyron, the CEO of The Network: Advocating Against Domestic Violence, encouraged virtual hearings for the courthouse moving forward.

""These actions will undermine survivors' trust in our legal system to be a resource to them and will discourage survivors from coming forward if they fear immigration will be at their next court hearing and take their loved ones,"" Pyron said.

Kuipers said she's already seen a downward trend in survivors showing up to court.

""We've been noticing that this past year that survivors from certain communities feel like it's much less likely for them to pursue legal assistance,"" she said.

Advocates said the fear caused by Wednesday's arrest won't be easily forgotten.

""It keeps people silenced, which domestic violence already inherently does; and then you add a layer of immigration status on top of that? It's silencing people, and it's keeping them in dangerous relationships, and it's making them kind of safety plan what is less dangerous – staying in an abusive relationship or potential deportation,"" Kuipers said.

Meyer explained that, ""for 30 years, the immigration courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute to provide people with the opportunity to seek release on bond.""
Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior.
The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.","AURORA, Colorado — The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a Denver immigration attorney have filed a federal class-action lawsuit challenging what they describe as an unlawful policy by immigration courts that denies bond hearings to immigrants detained in Aurora.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on behalf of Nestor Esai Mendoza Gutierrez and others similarly situated, alleges that immigration authorities have abandoned 30 years of established practice by denying bond eligibility to anyone who entered the country without permission.

""About two months ago, there was a 180-degree change in position by the immigration courts in Aurora, categorically denying anybody who ever entered the country without permission from being eligible for bond at all,"" said Hans Meyer, an immigration attorney with the Meyer Law Office who represents the plaintiff.

The policy change affects long-term U.S. residents who have been living in the country for years or decades. Mendoza Gutierrez, the named plaintiff, has resided in the Denver metro area for over 26 years, owns a construction business, has two U.S. citizen children and has applications for immigration status currently pending with the government.

According to court documents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Mendoza Gutierrez on May 25 following a false accusation that was later dismissed ""in the interest of justice"" by prosecutors. Despite his long-standing community ties, an immigration judge denied his bond request on June 23, ruling the court ""lacks jurisdiction.""

The lawsuit alleges this interpretation contradicts federal immigration law. Meyer explained that, ""for 30 years, the immigration courts have consistently interpreted the federal statute to provide people with the opportunity to seek release on bond.""

The policy shift comes from the Trump administration, and Meyer believes it's an effort to reach or inflate Trump's enforcement goal.

""The suit is to challenge what we believe is an illegitimate practice that's designed to metastasize the immigration detention system and to sort of balloon the number of people that the Trump administration can detain and coerce into taking deportations, as opposed to being able to legitimately fight their cases and maybe obtain status that they're entitled to under existing immigration law,"" Meyer said.

The practice first appeared in Tacoma, Washington. Meyer said Aurora became the second location to implement the new policy. Litigation in Tacoma successfully overturned the administration's interpretation of the statute and agreed that bond should be granted. Meyer and the ACLU hope for a similar outcome in the Colorado case.

Without access to bond hearings, detainees face prolonged detainment while their cases proceed through the immigration system.

""Categorically denying people bond can have them be stuck in detention for anywhere from a set of months to a set of years while they're waiting to get a case adjudicated,"" Meyer said.

The lawsuit argues this creates unnecessary costs for taxpayers.

""For U.S. taxpayers, we're paying corporations over $150 a day to hold a human being in detention for no ascertainable reason,"" Meyer said, speaking about the GEO Group and Core Civic, which are for-profit companies operating detention facilities.

Under the challenged policy, immigration courts apply mandatory detention provisions typically reserved for individuals apprehended at the border to long-term residents arrested in the interior. The lawsuit argues this violates the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides different detention authorities for different categories of individuals.

The case seeks declaratory relief establishing that class members are entitled to individualized bond determinations and requests that the court vacate the detention policies under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It is estimated that 156,000 undocumented immigrants currently reside in Colorado, with the vast majority having entered without inspection and potentially subject to the challenged policy if apprehended.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40/20250904T002257/1fdad244-8ebd-4276-aa5d-0014e5925b40_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:39.039514

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.
The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly.","Attorneys for Guatemalan migrant children in the U.S. have asked a federal court to extend a temporary ban blocking their deportation, saying that sending them to Guatemala puts them at risk of ""grave and irreparable harm."" They say that last weekend's attempt to hastily remove them in the middle of the night was a violation of their due process rights in the U.S. as well as federal law.

The 76 Guatemalan minors who came to the US unaccompanied and without legal documents were roused from their beds around 1:00 a.m. Sunday, Aug. 31, and brought by immigration authorities onto three planes. One took off, according to the children's lawyers, but turned around after a federal district court judge temporarily blocked their deportation. Attorneys with the National Immigration Law Center who sought that temporary restraining order over the holiday weekend, made a new request Wednesday for a longer-term injunction.

What do we know about these children?

New court papers offer details about the minors, their circumstances of abuse and neglect in their native Guatemala, and their ""harrowing experience during the weekend attempt to deport them from the U.S.

According to court filings a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy says he was awakened at 2 am, was very scared, lost his breath and started to pray. Another says simply she was ""totally traumatized."" One young girl was so scared that she vomited, according to an unidentified witness cited in the papers.

Many of the minors explain why they are ""terrified"" by the prospect of returning to Guatemala after having been threatened by gang members, for example, or having been a victim of human trafficking.

Several share details of ""abuse and neglect"" from family members and one describes how she ""suffered from physical and emotional abuse"" from both her parents.

""They hit me with a belt, with their hands and with sticks, and sometimes I would bleed,"" she stated. ""I fear that if I were to return to Guatemala my life would end.""

Another, who identifies as LGBTQ expressed fear of being raped and forced into a marriage, and stated ""If I had to return to Guatemala, I would kill myself.""

""In the dead of night on a holiday weekend, the Trump administration ripped vulnerable frightened children from their beds and attempted to return them to danger in Guatemala,"" said Efren Olivares, a lead attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

The judge said her order applied to all Guatemalan minors being held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which could be as many as 700 children.

Why are they being deported?

The U.S. government says the Guatemalan families of the unaccompanied young migrants sought their return. The Guatemalan government has said it proposed a repatriation plan to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in June. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said to reporters on Monday that he wanted to prevent vulnerable children from being sent to ICE detention centers. Arevalo said that his officials have ""toured detention centers for Guatemalans"" and were very concerned for the young migrants.

Trump administration officials have denounced the judge's order stopping the deportations.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, wrote on X that the move blocks ""flights to *reunify* Guatemalan children with their families. Now these children have to go to shelters. This is disgusting and immoral.""

Lawyers for the minors dismiss that as a ""false narrative.""

""If these are benign repatriations,"" says Olivares, waking kids up in the middle of the night with no notice, ""is not how that would have happened.""

What is the legal case against the deportations?

Immigration defense lawyers say the move was a blatant violation of the minors' due process rights, as well as immigration and federal laws which entitle the minors to a full opportunity to challenge their removals. They accuse the Trump administration of ""flouting their legal obligations"" to unaccompanied children that were passed by Congress, due to minors' ""unique and vulnerable situation.""

""This is not the government doing international family reunification. It's not repatriation,"" said Gladis Molina, executive director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights -- one of several advocates who briefed congressional staffers about the case on Tuesday.

""This is the government trying to put on a veil of legal authority to something that is completely violating international and domestic law,"" said Molina ""It's the turning back of people that are seeking protection under international and domestic asylum law.""

Similar legal challenges to efforts to deport Guatemalan children are also ongoing in Arizona and Illinois.

What does the judge's initial ruling mean?

U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's early morning emergency order imposed a 14-day freeze on the deportations

Sooknanan ordered the government to ""cease any ongoing efforts to transfer, remove or otherwise facilitate the transport"" of the minors, noting, ""I do not want there to be any ambiguity about what I am ordering.""

In a similar incident in March, a judge attempted to stop the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador. Despite the judge's order, government officials did not turn the planes around midflight.

What happens now?

The case now shifts from Judge Sooknanan, who was covering emergency hearings over the holiday weekend, to U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly. Kelly will hear more arguments from lawyers for both sides.

Lawyers for the Trump administration must file an opposition to the request for an injunction by Sept. 6, and the next court hearing is set for Sept. 10.

Olivares says he and other attorneys will use ""every legal tool … to force the administration to respect the law and not send a child into danger.""

""The Constitution and federal laws provide robust protection to unaccompanied minors specifically because of the unique risks they face,"" he said.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.","OMAHA — Again on Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s effort to deny bond to workers detained and facing deportation proceedings following their arrest in Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid.

This time, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon presided over a combined hearing in Omaha for three undocumented workers. His decision mirrored that of similar Glenn Valley cases he had ruled on the past several weeks.

Bataillon found that the government was violating due process rights of all three by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of a bond an immigration judge earlier had determined was appropriate.

He ordered the detainees to be immediately released upon reposting the respective bond amounts that weeks ago had been set by an immigration judge, but then were swiftly challenged by the federal government.

The three — Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, Diego Palma Perez and Ernesto Cortes Fernandez — were among about 75 Glenn Valley plant workers arrested during a June 10 workforce enforcement operation led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.” But the three in court Wednesday have faced no criminal charges, their lawyers said. They face administrative offenses and deportation for allegedly being in the country without authorization.

Federal attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE challenged the bonds based on new July 8 guidance from the Trump administration that looks to end bond hearings for almost all undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation.

That mandatory detention guidance hangs on a section of immigration law applied historically to newly arrived migrants, not those who, like the Glenn Valley workers, already had been in the U.S. for years, even if they entered without authorization.

Bataillon noted that ICE had arrested the Glenn Valley workers under one provision of the law, but then government attorneys wanted to hold them under the different section of law that applied to migrants who just arrived.

Attorney Christopher Ferretti, representing the feds, said during the hearing that his team still asserts that no-bond should apply. Given “short shrift” in the discussion he said, is the government’s interest in “controlling its borders.”

Jamie Arango, a Lincoln immigration attorney representing two of the Glenn Valley workers Wednesday, said the government’s strategy to prolong detention can drive some migrants to self-deport.

“It’s depriving them of due process,” she said.

Arango said family commitments led her clients to endure more than two months in a North Platte jail. Both have several children, she said, and have been in the country working for decades. “They didn’t want to leave their families behind.”

After release on bond, the migrants’ legal teams still must build cases as to why their clients should be able to remain in the U.S.

Arango said she represents another Glenn Valley worker in a similar situation, awaiting a federal hearing.

Arango said there are numerous people like her clients in Nebraska and across the country. “They’re not letting anyone out on bond,” she said, adding that it is clogging up the immigration justice system.

Grant Friedman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, who represented Carmona-Lorenzo, said the ACLU has at least one more client arrested in the Glenn Valley raid awaiting a similar hearing.

Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.

Carmona-Lorenzo had been in the U.S. for more than 20 years when she was detained in June, her lawyers said. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors, one is in college, and the other serves in the military.

The Glenn Valley workers’ lawyers challenged the prolonged detention in federal civil rights lawsuits that argue the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on a bond.

“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.

ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid should be on American “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by migrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden-era appointee, imposed the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles more than a month ago, but arrests in locations frequented by Latino workers, such as Home Depots and car washes, have become daily occurrences.

“It’s a complete disregard,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. “It’s almost like the rounding up of cattle in the road.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, denies racially profiling people in its efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

“Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people,"" DHS said Wednesday in an emailed statement. ""What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

The American Civil Liberties Union and Public Counsel, which filed the original lawsuit in July, filed a new motion Tuesday asking Frimpong to order additional evidence from the federal government “in light of apparent violations” of her order.

“This limited discovery is needed to determine whether further action may be necessary to enforce the Court’s TRO and to inform what additional measures, if any, may be needed to ensure compliance with any preliminary injunction the Court may issue,” the motion reads.

It details six arrests in August — three at Home Depots and three at car washes in Los Angeles County — that appear to undermine the temporary restraining order.

In one instance, on Aug. 22, federal agents detained seven people at a Pasadena car wash, including a legal resident, according to the motion. The man was handcuffed and detained despite having proper documentation nearby, the motion said. He was later released but described the incident as “devastating and humiliating.”

Frustrated by the lengthy court battle, immigrant rights' organizers say communities are being torn apart while lawyers file motion after motion. But local officials say the order has been difficult to enforce while litigation remains ongoing.

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.

Last month, Soto's office led a coalition of 20 California cities — including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach — in joining a federal lawsuit alleging that the federal government conducted unconstitutional and unlawful arrests and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

The organizations asked the court to stop federal agencies from using “disproportionate force,” which has sometimes led to U.S. citizens being detained.

The federal government twice challenged the temporary restraining order, first in the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals and then in the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.

The lawsuit is set for a hearing on Sept. 24 for a preliminary injunction that would extend the order as the case progresses through the courts.

Meanwhile, immigration advocates said they recorded more than a dozen arrests at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties Tuesday.

Volunteers who witnessed the arrests or went to the scene to help families get information about their missing loved ones said the workers all spoke Spanish.

Eight people were arrested last week outside a Home Depot near a day labor center, which has been the target of at least three previous enforcement actions, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Video shot by immigration advocates and circulated on social media shows federal agents arriving in unmarked cars as workers run, some tripping over themselves.

DHS said in a statement that three of the eight people had “extensive rap sheets,” but did not mention the other five.

“Every day, DHS is enforcing our nation’s laws across all of LA not just Home Depots,” the department said in Wednesday's emailed statement.

The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.

Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.

Data compiled by CHIRLA shows that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley.

As of Wednesday, Homeland Security has made more than 5,000 arrests in Los Angeles, ""including murderers, rapists, and child abusers,"" it said in the statement.

Believing they have little recourse, some residents have filed individual lawsuits instead of waiting for the temporary restraining order to be enforced.

Lawyers representing a Los Angeles mother took the first step last week toward suing the federal government after her teenage son was detained by agents at gunpoint in a case of mistaken identity. They filed a claim for $1 million in damages for personal injury, including ""assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment,"" according to court documents.

Andreina Mejia said she and her son, who is 15 and has special needs, were sitting inside her parked car outside Arleta High School when masked federal agents approached them with guns drawn. They were both pulled out and Mejia was handcuffed while agents questioned her son, she said.

“He didn’t know what was going on,"" she said. ""So, I just told him, ‘Don’t make any movement, don’t move, just follow instructions.’”

Agents asked for the whereabouts of a person whose name her son did not recognize and briefly detained him when he could not provide information, Mejia said. One of the agents appeared to realize they had the wrong person and let her son go, she said.

Mejia and her son are U.S. citizens. Agents said they were looking for a young man from El Salvador.

“The family is Mexican American,” said Mejia’s attorney, Christian Contreras. “It feels as if they were exploited, abused and taken advantage of because of the color of their skin.”

The interaction has left lasting scars on her son, who now suffers from nightmares and sometimes “breaks down” in tears when she’s driving, Mejia said.

“People with the slightest shade of brown in their skin in L.A. fear that they may be the target of immigration officials,” Contreras said. “It’s across the board now.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yjoX8IkcxnarRcRqWI.4iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/7fc3ea2851650148a91a01ab0228ccf3,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:27.889360

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 10 criminal illegal alien convicted sex offenders during an enforcement operation in sanctuary California’s Central Valley.

At capacity, the new facility, dubbed ""Louisiana Lockup,"" can hold more than 400 individuals, Landry said.

The individuals are being housed at what was formerly known as ""Camp J"" on Angola's 18,000-acre campus north of Baton Rouge. Camp J used to house ""disruptive"" inmates, but it fell into disrepair, Landry said.

Now, it's been fixed and is climate-controlled, and will house the 'worst of the worst' undocumented immigrants, the Governor's Office said.

As of now, the facility will only accommodate men, but Landry said he's open to discussing housing women as well.

Immigration attorney Glen Wasserstein said housing detainees at Angola would be another attempt to frighten immigrants into self-deporting.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisit Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan urged individuals to return home at the press conference.

Critics argue that housing immigrant detainees alongside those convicted of violent crimes raises safety and human rights concerns.

Landry said that Angola prisoners and those being held at ""Louisiana Lockup"" will not mix.

The governor stated that the contract to operate the facility is between ICE, Louisiana's Department of Corrections, and GOHSEP.

It's unclear how much Louisiana is spending and receiving from the feds to run the operation.

The press conference was held outside of the main building, which had ""Camp 57"" painted on it. The Governor's Office said that's in reference to Landry being the 57th governor of Louisiana.

Legal aid attorneys in New York say five deportees from the U.S. were sent to Eswatini, where they are being illegally imprisoned.

""My two clients have been imprisoned in Eswatini, at U.S. taxpayer expense, for over six weeks,"" said Alma David, a U.S.-based attorney for the two men who are from Yemen and Cuba, in a statement sent to Scripps News. ""No one has told them why they are being detained, and no lawyer has been permitted to visit them.""

One of the deportees has been identified as a Jamaican national who came to the U.S. legally and was convicted of murder. Despite completing his 25-year sentence, the 62-year-old was deported to Eswatini. He had been working in a men's shelter at the time and wasn't accused of any new crimes.

Eswatini is among several African nations that have entered agreements with the U.S. to accept non-citizen deportees. Other countries involved include Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, each seen as part of a program that has largely operated in secrecy. Several other African nations are reportedly considering similar agreements.

Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Senior Policy Analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told Scripps News Group that while third-country deportations are not new, the current administration is focusing on deporting individuals to more locations at an accelerated rate.

""The key concern is not just the number of people being sent to third countries where they are not from, but also that they are not necessarily given the review and due process to consider their protection or asylum claims,"" Soto said.

Defending this process in a statement to Scripps News, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said, ""The average illegal alien gets far more due process than most Americans. The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice—they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported.""

Human rights and legal advocates argue this expedited deportation process may result in individuals being sent to countries deemed unsafe, potentially violating international law.

As the Trump administration approaches additional nations for third-country deportation agreements, some have declined. Nigeria's Foreign Minister pointed to the country's population of 230 million people, saying the nation has problems of its own.

The justice department, which under Donald Trump has moved away from its historical focus on expanding voting rights, sued the North Carolina state board of elections earlier this year, demanding that the state deny a ballot to voters who had not provided a driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number when they registered, as required under the Help America Vote Act.

The North Carolina court of appeals ordered the board to seek the information from voters before allowing them to vote in future elections, and the Republican-majority board was going to comply before the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and voting rights groups in the state intervened.

Kuipers said just the threat of immigration enforcement has kept some people away from the courthouse over the last year.
“These raids aren’t creating safety — this is fearmongering and traumatic for survivors of domestic violence and their families.”","A woman was detained by federal immigration agents Wednesday while arriving at Cook County’s domestic violence courthouse, raising concerns that President Donald Trump’s plan to ramp up enforcement in Chicago has taken hold.

Lauren Hanna, an advocate at the courthouse, said she saw four plainclothes agents take the woman into custody around 8:45 a.m. One of the agents told Hanna that they wanted to talk to the woman “about her immigration status.”

The woman was a defendant in a case that was scheduled to be heard 15 minutes later. Her domestic violence charges were dismissed during the hearing, and the presiding judge wrote in a court document that the woman was in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“She had a case here, just trying to come to court,” Hanna said. “That’s the chilling part.”

The woman was the second person detained by immigration officials this week at the courthouse at 555 W. Harrison St., according to Tessa Kuipers, of Family Rescue, who said another person was taken into custody Tuesday. Kuipers said ICE agents hadn’t been spotted at the courthouse previously.

ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration is sending hundreds of federal agents from Los Angeles to a suburban naval base, according to sources with knowledge of the operation. Naval Station Great Lakes, the Navy’s largest training station and the largest military installation in the state, could also be used to accommodate national guard troops.

The plan to target Chicago with a flood of federal resources comes after Trump federalized the police department in Washington, D.C., and deployed the National Guard there to address crime.

Trump previously ordered an immigration blitz in Los Angeles this summer and called in the National Guard in response to protests that at times grew violent.

Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Tuesday that Trump’s administration may have already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment here. Pritzker also said ICE had informed his office that the agency planned to step up enforcement in Chicago this week.

At the courthouse, Kuipers and fellow advocates passed out “know your rights” flyers and warned those entering the building of the law enforcement presence. An advocate for immigrants said at least one person turned around and left.

Kuipers said just the threat of immigration enforcement has kept some people away from the courthouse over the last year. She said she worries survivors of domestic violence will now become even more fearful.

“They’re going to have hesitancy about seeking protections, about connecting with their advocate, and of course, criminal charges that might be a tool for safety for them,” Kuipers said. “It’s silencing people, and it’s keeping them in dangerous relationships, and it’s making them [consider] what is less dangerous: staying in an abusive relationship or potential deportation.”

The Network: Advocating Against Domestic Violence has encouraged survivors to file for orders of protection online and contact the Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline for legal help.

“This decision to conduct ICE raids at a courthouse — filled with vulnerable domestic violence survivors and their families seeking justice and safety from the legal system — is deplorable,” The Network wrote in a statement. “These raids aren’t creating safety — this is fearmongering and traumatic for survivors of domestic violence and their families.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b4efab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F45%2Fe25ca41e4539baf41fba652c5f08%2Ficecourt-090425-08.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:19.397389

In a 2–1 decision on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a lower-court order restoring Slaughter to her post, citing the Supreme Court's 1935 ruling in Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which recognized statutory protections against the removal of Federal Trade Commission members except for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.""

Why It Matters

At the heart of the dispute is whether presidents can unilaterally remove leaders of independent agencies.

The outcome will determine not only the future of Slaughter's tenure at the FTC, but also whether longstanding protections that insulate regulators like the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission from partisan control remain intact, or whether presidents will gain sweeping new authority to remake those agencies at will.

For nearly a century, the Supreme Court has declined to overturn Humphrey's Executor, reaffirming its limits on presidential removal power in a series of cases, even as it has narrowed them in other contexts.

What To Know

In March, Trump dismissed Slaughter, who had been appointed by former President Joe Biden, without providing a reason.

The Trump administration maintained that Congress's limits on removal powers were unconstitutional.

""The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the President's constitutional authority to fire and remove executive officers who exercise his authority,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said after the district court initially ruled against Trump in July.

""The Trump Administration will appeal this unlawful decision and looks forward to victory on this issue,"" he said.

The case illustrates a broader conflict between Trump and independent regulatory bodies. In recent months, courts have considered challenges to Trump's removal of Democratic appointees at agencies including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

In June, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that Trump acted unlawfully when he removed three CPSC commissioners without cause. ""The Court finds no constitutional defect in the statutory restriction on Plaintiffs' removal and that Plaintiffs' purported removal from office was unlawful,"" the opinion stated.

Trump has also faced legal challenges for attempting to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, alleging mortgage fraud—a claim she disputes—which underscores that the FTC case is part of a broader campaign to reshape independent agencies.

Supreme Court Signals

The Supreme Court has already shown interest in similar disputes. In April, Chief Justice John Roberts stayed two district court rulings in unrelated cases that had blocked Trump from removing officials at the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board.

That action suggested the justices could revisit Humphrey's Executor, a precedent that has withstood repeated calls for reconsideration but has been narrowed in later rulings.

In Seila Law v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2020), for example, the Court struck down tenure protections for the CFPB's single director while leaving Humphrey's Executor formally intact. More recently, in Collins v. Yellen (2021), the Court emphasized that the precedent had not been overruled but declined to extend it beyond multimember commissions.

The legal fight over the FTC echoes earlier courtroom showdowns during Trump's first term, when attorneys like Lee Gelernt of the ACLU led successful lawsuits against high-profile administration policies, including the family separation policy at the border.

The Trump administration argues that the FTC's powers have expanded since 1935, making its commissioners more akin to executive officers who should be subject to presidential control. The appeals court majority rejected that reasoning, finding that ""the present-day Commission exercises the same powers that the Court understood it to have in 1935.""

Newsweek reached out to Gelernt via email for comment outside of normal office hours on Wednesday.

What People Are Saying

Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, both appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote in the majority: ""To grant a stay would be to defy the Supreme Court's decisions that bind our judgments. That we will not do.""

Judge Neomi Rao, appointed by Trump, dissented, arguing that courts ""likely"" lacked power to reinstate an executive branch official during ongoing litigation. Rao also pointed to recent Supreme Court emergency orders allowing Trump to remove other officials while challenges were pending, underscoring her view that reinstatement intrudes on presidential authority.

She wrote that ""an injunction reinstating an officer the President has removed, harms the government by intruding on the President's power and responsibility over the Executive Branch.""

What Happens Next

The next step is almost certainly the Supreme Court, where the Trump administration plans to appeal the D.C. Circuit's ruling reinstating Slaughter. Trump may also seek emergency relief to suspend Slaughter's return to the FTC, as the Supreme Court has granted in other recent removal cases.

The justices are likely to view this alongside similar disputes over the Consumer Product Safety Commission and other boards, making it a coordinated test of whether the Humphrey's Executor precedent still shields independent agencies from at-will dismissal.

If the Court sides with Trump, it could greatly expand presidential control; if not, existing protections for regulators would remain in place.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2714844/rebecca-kelly-slaughter-reinstated.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:39.524532

Nadine YousifBBC News, Toronto

In a quiet, leafy suburb of Toronto, a 30-year-old Afghan woman spends most afternoons on the phone, hoping she can reach her two younger siblings and father.

They are not in Afghanistan, but instead just miles away, across the border in the US, held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

The three have been there in crowded cells for months, stuck in what their lawyers say is a bureaucratic limbo between Canada and the US.

They are eligible for asylum in Canada because they have immediate relatives who are legal refugees in the country, but can only file their claim at the land border - and US officials insist that they will only be released if they enter Canada by air, which they can't do without a visa, their US lawyer told the BBC.

That visa application is currently under review and they remain stuck, currently unable to make a claim in Canada and facing deportation from the US.

From her home near Toronto, ""Asal"" says she has tried everything to get them released. The BBC is using an alias because her family belongs to an ethnic and religious minority group facing persecution in Afghanistan.

She has hired attorneys in both countries to press their case and even offered to cover the costs of ICE agents escorting them to the Canada-US border, to no avail.

The family's case illustrates how some asylum seekers have been caught in rapidly changing policies under the Trump administration, their lawyers and experts say. It also raises questions about whether Canada has a responsibility to expedite entry for people in ICE detention who have ties to that country.

In the meantime, Asal's family members could be sent back to Afghanistan or a third country not of their choosing – ""the scariest move of all"", argues their American lawyer Jodi Goodwin. That option ""puts them at risk of being sent to God knows where, with no assurances of protection,"" she said.

The father had worked with US troops as a contractor, Asal said, making him a potential target for the Taliban if deported back to Afghanistan.

For the last eight months, Ms Goodwin has been working to stop US authorities from sending the family to their native country.

Meanwhile, their lawyers in Canada have been pressing authorities to grant the visas they need to get on a plane. Under an immigration pact between Canada and the US - the Safe Third Country Agreement - migrants without a visa must claim asylum at a land border crossing.

Asal speaks with her detained family when she can. ICE allows online ""visitations"", and she often gets through to her 18-year-old sister.

On a recent call, made using an iPad that she shares with around 80 other cellmates, her sister offered details of her daily life - her struggle to get a good night's rest, her habit of doing the laundry just to keep busy - before she bursts into tears.

In Canadian legal filings shared with the BBC, she states that she has been ""shocked"" by the conditions in ICE detention.

""Every aspect of our life is controlled, even though we are not criminals,"" she said.

She describes being strip searched, served ""nearly inedible"" food and how inmates who refuse to eat are threatened with ""solitary confinement"".

The BBC sought comment from ICE. Administration officials have previously defended reports of poor conditions in migrant detention facilities in the US as false.

Asal and other family say they struggle to get information about the well-being of those detained, including the youngest brother who was admitted to hospital for 10 days due to seizures and who is now back in ICE detention.

'They just didn't get to their paperwork in time'

The first part of the family, which included Asal and two siblings, arrived in Canada in February 2023, she told the BBC.

It was their preferred destination after reluctantly fleeing Afghanistan as violence rapidly escalated after the Taliban took over.

They trekked to Iran and from there to Brazil then up to the US, where they were held by ICE for four days before heading to the northern border and crossing into Canada via Roxham Road, at the time a well-travelled but unofficial crossing between New York state and Quebec. Once in Canada, they successfully filed for asylum.

""It is safe. There is security, and the community is good,"" Asal said.

In August 2024, more family members were able to leave Afghanistan and arrived in Canada following a similar path.

But by the time the final group - her mother and father, and her three siblings - made the trip, politics in North America had shifted.

Roxham Road - that unofficial route for thousands of asylum seekers entering Canada between 2017 and 2023 - had been closed, and the US was struggling to deal with a surge of migrants at its southern border.

After unsuccessfully trying legal options to enter the US from Mexico, in December Asal's family remaining members paid to be smuggled across the border, where they then surrendered to authorities.

In February, Asal's mother and one of her sisters were released shortly after Trump took office and signed an executive order expanding the detention and deportation of migrants, and made their way to Canada.

But the remaining three are still in ICE custody, with US authorities refusing to release them under the new rules, Ms Goodwin says.

The fact they weren't released along with the others in February came down to bad timing.

Ms Goodwin says an official told her ""they just didn't get to their paperwork in time"".

In response to questions from the BBC about the family's case, a senior official with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says, ""ICE would happily return them to their origin country"" should they request a voluntary departure.

They add that the US ""is NOT going to pass off illegal aliens seeking asylum from our country to Canada and vice versa. This is part of being good neighbors and partners"".

Adam Sadinsky, one of the family's Canadian lawyers, said Canada has an opportunity to allow this family to be reunited.

""We don't want Canada to be complicit in this treatment, and the potential result that they could be sent to any number of countries with their own abysmal human rights record,"" he tells the BBC.

Mr Sadinsky also argues that allowing them to enter Canada would be in line with the Safe Third Country Agreement, which contains exemptions aimed at reuniting families.

In a statement to the BBC, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it would not comment on the family's case, citing privacy legislation.

The case poses a conundrum for Canadian officials, says immigration lawyer Richard Kurland.

Mr Kurland, who is not involved with their case, told the BBC that allowing entry to the family could set a precedent for others in ICE detention with ties to Canada. ""How can you say 'yes' to just one family, and then, 'no' to everyone else?""

But he adds that he believes both Canada and the US have a responsibility to at least ensure the family is not sent back to Afghanistan.

""It's cruel for the US not to rule out the Kabul flight,"" he said. ""The Americans know what is in store, because they were right there in Kabul for over 20 years.""

For now, Asal and her family in Canada continue to agonise about the case, wishing for a reunion.

""Trust me when I say that I cannot sleep most of the night,"" she said.

But she is hopeful Canadian officials come through and ""that they will not leave us alone in this situation"".",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6652/live/5a034df0-88cb-11f0-85f1-5f1042c3058b.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:16.585452

Now it's Chicago and then back to Boston, with more cities planned.","President Trump plans to escalate immigration enforcement in Chicago and Boston, continuing the administration's pattern of targeting Democrat-run cities it views as hostile to Trump's agenda.

Driving the news: A surge of immigration agents is expected imminently in Chicago, and Trump vowed Tuesday to deploy National Guard troops there in a game plan that appears similar to the one that recently boosted arrests and drew protests and outrage in Los Angeles and D.C.

""I'm very proud of Washington, it serves as a template"" for Chicago, Trump told reporters on Tuesday in the Oval Office. ""We're going in.""

His remarks came on a day when a California judge ruled that National Guard troops deployed there in June illegally performed law enforcement duties. The decision applies only to California but could affect how the administration approaches using Guard troops elsewhere.

Zoom in: Trump's immigration and anti-crime crackdowns have been panned by nearly all local and state officials whose cities have been or could be affected — a chorus that includes Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who on Tuesday blasted the plans unfolding in that city.

But it's clear that more cities will see such immigration surges, and possibly troops. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official told Axios that the Chicago and Boston immigration crackdowns would happen ""soon.""

""President Trump has been clear: We are going to make our streets and cities safe again,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official said in a statement.

""What we are seeing now is a power grab that goes beyond the boundaries of the law,"" Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D-Mass.) said ahead of the increased ICE presence there.

Immigration advocates in Chicago have been building a broad coalition to oppose the surge of federal agents — and particularly the National Guard — in the city.

The coalition is planning on quick-response protests when members see spikes in immigration enforcement or troops deploying.

""This is a unifying moment for Chicago and Illinois because there are people stepping up and speaking out against the impending occupation, who might not otherwise have spoken up,"" said Brandon Lee of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

The ICE official said the agency is not coordinating with the National Guard in Chicago, as it did in L.A.

Zoom out: Trump's administration repeatedly has targeted sanctuary cities, in which local law enforcement officers don't partner with ICE agents. This prevents coordination for an immigration arrest when someone who is undocumented is released from local custody for any other offense — a primary way ICE makes arrests.

First it was Boston, where a surge of federal agents led immigration arrests to jump from about 300 in January to about 1,500 in May, according to data from the Deportation Data Project.

After the White House encouraged ICE to hit a 3,000 daily arrest quota, Los Angeles was flooded with agents backed up by National Guard troops to protect federal buildings and operations amid protests.

Then D.C. became a focal point, prompting more than 500 arrests.

Now it's Chicago and then back to Boston, with more cities planned.

""You're going to see a ramp of operations in New York, you're going to see a ramp up of operations continue in L.A.... Portland, Seattle, all these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with ICE,"" Trump border czar Homan recently told reporters at the White House.",https://images.axios.com/gkPfH4onMuf0kJi2SiUBSq67p-Y=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/09/02/1756835786400.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:00.459158

Today, Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) joined Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Dick Durbin (D-IL), along with Representatives Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA-6), Maggie Goodlander (D-NH-2), and Delia C. Ramirez (D-IL-3) and 54 other members of Congress in opening a new investigation into the Trump administration’s arrest, detention, and deportation of non-citizen service members, veterans, and military families. The lawmakers wrote to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DoD) demanding an explanation for these practices, which go against decades of precedent and long-standing DHS policy indicating that military service offers protection from immigration enforcement for military service members, veterans, and their immediate family members.

“The Trump administration’s [actions] threaten U.S. national security interests and erode the U.S. military’s credibility when it makes promises to its service members who have put their lives on the line for our country,” wrote the lawmakers.

In April, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rescinded its former policy of considering military service a “significant mitigating factor” when deciding whether to pursue immigration enforcement and issued a new policy less protective of service members and their families.

Following the policy change, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children was detained by ICE during a green card application appointment—despite having lived in the United States for over a decade. Then, in June, a father of three Marines was repeatedly punched in the head by masked ICE agents, and a U.S. citizen who served in the Army was rounded up in an indiscriminate raid and held without explanation. The Trump administration’s actions against veterans and non-citizen military families have even prompted at least one veteran to leave the United States.

Multiple constituents affected by the administration’s reckless changes to immigration protections for military families have shared their stories with representatives in Congress. For example, in Arizona, Maria Pelaez, a mother of an active-duty U.S. Marine, was detained by ICE, and ICE has refused to release her despite a judge’s decision to grant her bond. Additionally, Sae Joon Park, a disabled Purple Heart veteran residing in Hawaii, was forced to self-deport by the Trump administration despite having lived in the U.S. for nearly five decades.

The Trump administration may be targeting military families using information they voluntarily provided to the federal government in connection with their service. When applying for immigration benefits, like “parole in place,” military families provide extensive personal data, including their physical addresses, physically-identifying information like eye color and height, country of birth, and more. Now, USCIS may be using that information to refer service members or their families to ICE for removal proceedings, even if they were previously deprioritized for enforcement actions.

“We demand an explanation for why DHS is betraying its promises to service members who play a key role in protecting U.S. national security,” wrote the members.

The group of lawmakers asked the two agencies to provide, by September 16, 2025: information about the number of non-citizens serving in the military; a list of service members, veterans, and family members who have been arrested, detained, or deported since January 2025; the impact of these new immigration policies on recruitment, readiness, and morale; what information about non-citizen service members and military family members the Pentagon provides DHS and ICE; and more.",https://www.kelly.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Kelly_Favicon-150x150.png,N,,2025-09-03 21:57:20.392747

The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.","ANGOLA – A section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary undergoing emergency repairs is being used to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, Gov. Jeff Landry and officials with the Trump administration announced Wednesday.

Landry said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”

A complex at the state prison is already being used to house 51 detainees and has a total capacity of 416.

Joining Landry at the prison to make the announcement were U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheehan, who previously served as Landry’s Wildlife and Fisheries secretary.

“Louisiana, you’re going to be an example for the rest of this country,” Bondi said.

Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The four-building complex had been closed since 2018, with its only use as a quarantine site during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Neither the governor nor Noem shared whether the facility will be used as a post-conviction facility or as another ICE detention center where detainees await charges or trial.

The detainees will join more than 4,000 inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which stands on the site of a former slave plantation that is still a working farm now staffed with prisoners.

Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do.

Landry touted Angola’s natural features, including “forests full of bears” and “swamps full of alligators” as among the new facility’s safety features.

The Camp J section of the prison where ICE detainees are being held was once known as the “Dungeon.” It was designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Prison officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J.

Though it was rumored Camp J would be renamed Camp 47 to honor President Donald Trump, it has instead been renamed Camp 57 in honor of Landry, the 57th governor of Louisiana.

The governor also referred to the facility as “Louisiana Lockup,” a title that was featured prominently on an oversized licensed plate that adorned the lectern he, Bondi and Noem used at a news conference in front of the facility.

Landry’s emergency order in late July suspended state procurement code and public bid law to allow the officials to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency.

Despite being asked by reporters multiple times, Landry would not disclose how much money the state spent on renovations or operations or whether the federal government would reimburse the state for any of its costs.

Sheehan said the facility has been brought up to ICE standards, and detainees will have access to attorneys and a law library.

Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.

Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety.

Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases.

According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.

The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.

Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bondi-Noel-Landry-Angola.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 22:57:25.314822

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is with us now to tell us more about all this. Good morning, Domenico.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Michel.

MARTIN: So explain what these lawmakers are trying to do.

MONTANARO: Well, the two members of Congress who are at the center of this effort are Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California. Massie filed what's known as a discharge petition on Tuesday. That's a procedural maneuver to try and get around leadership and force a vote. They need 218 House members to sign it and force that vote. It would still need to pass the Senate, though, so this wouldn't force a release on its own. But proponents hope that this'll ramp up political pressure on the administration to do more. To an extent, it's already having an effect. I mean, after the petition was filed, the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee released some 30,000 more pages of documents related to the investigation, but a lot of that information is already public. It's not new. And those in favor of the release - of more release are saying, don't be fooled by that.

MARTIN: So what exactly do those calling for the full release of the files want or expect to find?

MONTANARO: Well, I want to highlight how Ro Khanna describes what this effort and discharge petition are about here on MORNING EDITION on Tuesday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)

RO KHANNA: The petition is about restoring trust in government. It protects victims' identity. It's simply calling for the release of all of the Epstein files to hold rich and powerful men who abused underage girls accountable.

MONTANARO: You know, more than this being about individual men who are Democrats or Republicans, this is seen as a question of who has power, money and influence and how it's used or abused. Very rarely have we ever seen Congress really involve itself in the Department of Justice and its investigations quite in this way.

MARTIN: You know what? We don't want to discount the fact that there are young women here who experienced something terrible, OK? But how much of this pressure is really about political opportunity?

MONTANARO: Politically, a day that's focused on Epstein is a day that is likely more helpful than not to Democrats. I mean, it's an irritant for Trump, especially since he's had a longtime friendship with Epstein. The White House says Trump and Epstein had a falling out in the early 2000s because Epstein was, quote, ""being a creep."" Other reporting has said it was over a property dispute. Nonetheless, there's a lot we don't know about their relationship. The association is certainly something Democrats, though, don't mind reminding people about. And polling has shown big majorities of people don't think the government is being transparent enough and disapprove of how Trump is handling this.

MARTIN: Can you say more about that polling very briefly? Is this something that's resonating with voters?

MONTANARO: You know, it's hard to say that this is going to be something that factors into people's minds more so than, say, prices, crime or immigration. But that's not to say it doesn't matter to people. It's one of the rare areas where we've seen some splits with people who are key in Trump's base.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thank you.

At least 60 days before a TPS designation expires, the secretary of homeland security, after consultation with appropriate U.S. government agencies, must review the conditions in a country designated for TPS to determine whether the conditions supporting the designation continue to be met and, if so, how long to extend the designation.

DENVER — The ACLU of Colorado, American Civil Liberties Union, and the Meyer Law Office filed a class-action lawsuit yesterday challenging a recent Trump administration policy that ends bond eligibility for millions of immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The filing amends a habeas petition brought by Alyssa Reed, of Reed Immigration, LLC, on behalf of Nestor Esai Mendoza Gutierrez, a longtime Colorado resident and small business owner. It also seeks class certification for others in Colorado subject to the new policy.

On July 8, ICE issued a new policy declaring that all people alleged to have entered the country without documentation be denied eligibility for bond during the entirety of their removal proceedings; this would impact millions of immigrants in the country, regardless of how long they have been living in the United States. The lawsuit argues that the new policy is unlawful and a profound and far-reaching departure from longstanding immigration law.

“This illegal policy threatens to imprison millions of hardworking immigrants with no criminal records and deep ties to their communities, with no recourse,” said Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado legal director. “Having secured billions of dollars to build more ICE detention in Colorado and across the country, this administration now wants to fill up its immigration detention centers. This unlawful new policy is a cruel twist on the adage ‘if you build it, they will come.’ Nestor, however, has decided to bravely fight back against this sweeping expansion of ICE’s detention and deportation machine.”

“The brutality of this Trump administration policy is eclipsed only by its intellectual dishonesty and departure from decades of agency practice,” said Hans Meyer, owner of the Meyer Law Office. “This is a fatuous attempt to weaponize immigration detention to illegitimately bolster deportation numbers and intimidate immigrant communities. But ICE is wrong on the law, and we will hold the agency to account for its lawlessness.”

Current federal law mandates detention without bond eligibility only under limited circumstances. The lawsuit asserts that Mendoza Gutierrez and others similarly situated do not meet these statutory criteria that limit bond eligibility.

The lawsuit also argues that Mendoza Gutierrez’s detention without eligibility for bond raises serious constitutional concerns and violates fundamental safeguards for due process. These constitutional protections apply to all people in the country, regardless of immigration status.

“The Constitution guarantees all persons living in the United States rights to due process under the law, full stop,” said Michael Tan, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “The Trump administration seeks to rewrite our constitutional bedrock, denying millions of immigrants in detention facilities the ability to seek bond. But the Constitution doesn't allow the government to lock people up without basic due process.""

“The ACLU and other immigrants’ rights advocates already filed a class-action lawsuit in California challenging ICE’s new bond policy in July 2025. The California lawsuit seeks to represent a class of individuals subject to the ICE policy, as well as a class of individuals denied bond hearings by the Adelanto Immigration Court.

The complaint is here.

Massachusetts is home to one of the nation’s largest Haitian populations, including more than 15,000 Haitian TPS holders.
Massachusetts’s Department of Developmental Services alone employs dozens of Haitian TPS holders, who provide care to some of Massachusetts’s most vulnerable populations.","Boston — Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell today co-led a coalition of 18 attorneys general in filing an amicus brief in Miot, et. al. v. Trump, et al. in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. The brief supports a challenge to the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to terminate Haiti’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation and strip legal immigration status from hundreds of thousands of Haitians living and working in the United States.

“Haitian TPS recipients in Massachusetts are hardworking members of our state economy, often filling critical roles in the health care and elder care industries. The Trump Administration’s unlawful attacks on Haiti’s TPS designation have no logical basis and are yet another example of his mistreatment of the immigrant communities that make our Commonwealth, and our country, stronger,” said AG Campbell. “I will continue to fight back against illegal policies that harm our state economy and threaten the wellbeing of the roughly 15,000 Haitian TPS holders in Massachusetts and the families, patients, and employers who rely on them.”

TPS is a humanitarian immigration status created by Congress to protect foreign nationals who cannot safely return to their home country because of war, natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS allows recipients to live and work in the United States as long as their home country has a TPS designation. Haitian immigrants have been eligible for TPS since 2010, when a devastating earthquake hit the country. The protections have continuously been extended due to unsafe conditions in Haiti, including widespread violence, homelessness, and starvation.

On July 1, 2025, the Trump Administration sought to formally terminate Haiti’s TPS status without any evidence that the dangerous conditions in Haiti had improved and despite the fact that the U.S. State Department continues to classify Haiti as a “Level 4: Do Not Travel” country—its highest risk designation.

In their brief, AG Campbell and the coalition argue that unlawfully terminating Haiti’s TPS status would separate families, damage economies, deplete workforces, increase health care costs, and harm public health and safety. Across states, thousands of TPS recipients providing important public services as health care providers, teachers, entrepreneurs, construction workers, and more would be stripped of their legal status and forced to either face life in uncertainty and vulnerability without legal protections or return to a country that continues to have exceedingly dangerous conditions that pose ongoing risk of violence and human rights abuses.

TPS-eligible Haitians contribute $4.4 billion annually to the U.S. economy. Sixty-nine percent of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older were members of the civilian labor force in 2022, with high rates of participation in health care support and service industries. Furthermore, a recent estimate found that 75,000 TPS-eligible Haitians work in labor-short industries.

Massachusetts is home to one of the nation’s largest Haitian populations, including more than 15,000 Haitian TPS holders. Massachusetts’s Department of Developmental Services alone employs dozens of Haitian TPS holders, who provide care to some of Massachusetts’s most vulnerable populations. Stripping TPS recipients of their legal status and work authorization will cause irreparable harm to families, workforces, and state economies.

In submitting their brief, AG Campbell and the coalition are asking the Court to grant the Plaintiffs’ motion to postpone the effective date of termination of Haiti’s TPS status, which would protect the hundreds of thousands of Haitians legally in the United States under the program while the litigation proceeds.

Joining AG Campbell in submitting this brief, which she co-led with the attorneys general of California and New York, are the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

In a post on social media accompanied with a video of the strike, President Donald Trump stated that the attack was “against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists.” Trump also noted that Tren de Aragua had previously been designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The social media post also asserted that the strike had occurred in international waters and killed “11 terrorists.”

Although the facts are still emerging, the Trump administration’s extraordinary lethal attack on this purported smuggling vessel – and its vow that the strike was a start of a campaign – raise a number of significant potential legal issues. And even apart from these legal concerns, the strike constitutes a deeply troubling gratuitous use of the military that resulted in the unnecessary killing of 11 individuals.

Background

President Trump had reportedly flirted with the idea of using military force against drug trafficking organizations during his first term. Early in his second term, his administration began to cast drug trafficking organizations as terrorists and hinted at possibly using targeted killing tools developed over the last few decades in the counter-terrorism context. In February, the State Department for the first time designated eight drug trafficking organizations, including Tren de Aragua, as FTO). To be clear, this step does not by itself provide authority for the use of force. In the past, however, it has paved the way to military action, including the strike on Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

Certainly, the rhetoric from key figures close to Trump suggests that the administration views FTO designation as a stepping stone to using force. Soon after the designations were publicly revealed, Elon Musk commented on social media that listing “means they’re eligible for drone strikes.” The Trump administration’s “border czar” Tom Homan said in November that the president was “committed to calling [the cartels] terrorist organizations and using the full might of the United States special operations to take them out.” Secretary of Defense Hegseth stressed on Fox News that “all options will be on the table if we’re dealing with what are designated to be foreign terrorist organizations who are specifically targeting Americans on our border.”

The Trump administration would cite the FTO designation of Tren de Aragua and lean further into the use of military tools against the group when in March it invoked the wartime authority of the Alien Enemies Act—and then relied on that authority to rendition hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador.

The September military strike occurs in the context of a broader military deployment to the Caribbean—a deployment reportedly pushed by Secretary of State Rubio to put pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The deployment includes three destroyers and an amphibious assault group with 4,500 sailors, including 2,500 marines, on board. U.S. forces in the region were further bolstered by a guided missile cruiser and at least one submarine, the nuclear-powered USS Newport News.

Domestic Legal Authority for the Use of Force

A U.S. president may direct the use of military force pursuant to either (1) a congressional authorization for the use of force/declaration of war or (2) inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution, typically as commander in chief of the U.S. military. The scope of the president’s authority to direct the use of force under Article II in the absence of congressional authorization is contested. Although there is broad agreement that the president may use force to repel “sudden attack,” the U.S. executive branch has taken a much more expansive view of the president’s unilateral war powers.

Here the Trump administration will almost certainly rely solely on Article II of the Constitution as the source of authority for the attack on this vessel. Despite labelling the targets “narcoterrorists,” there is no plausible argument under which the principle legal authority for the U.S. so-called “war on terror”—the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force—authorizes military action against the Venezuelan criminal entity Tren de Aragua.

Under the executive branch’s two-prong test for when a president may use force without congressional authorization, the contemplated operation must advance an important “national interest” and must not amount to “war in the constitutional sense,” which the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has recognized as an outer limit on the president’s unilateral warmaking authority. That said, OLC precedent marks out remarkably wide latitude, with the first prong in particular having been critiqued as being unconstraining, and it is not clear whether it would have limited the president in this instance even assuming OLC advice was sought before the strike took place.

Further, though Trump and others in his administration have emphasized the prior designation of Tren de Aragua as an FTO, such designation does not by itself convey authority to use force. Nonetheless, such FTO designations are widely and mistakenly perceived as authorizing such action within the executive branch. Thus, designation of Tren de Aragua and a number of other Latin American criminal entities as FTOs in February foreshadowed this week’s attack in the Caribbean, despite providing no actual legal authority for it.

War Powers Resolution

When the U.S. president directs certain military actions in the absence of prior congressional authorization, those actions must be reported to Congress under the 1973 War Powers Resolution. Further, when U.S. armed forces are introduced “into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances,” the president must not only report the action to Congress within 48-hours but terminate such military action within 60-days unless Congress votes to authorize it.

The War Powers Resolution does not define what it means for U.S. armed forces to be introduced into hostilities. Nonetheless, the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s report on the Resolution explains:

The word hostilities was substituted for the phrase armed conflict during the subcommittee drafting process because it was considered to be somewhat broader in scope. In addition to a situation in which fighting actually has begun, hostilities also encompasses a state of confrontation in which no shots have been fired but where there is a clear and present danger of armed conflict. “Imminent hostilities” denotes a situation in which there is a clear potential either for such a state of confrontation or for actual armed conflict.

Unsurprisingly, the executive branch has espoused different, narrower interpretations of these terms that are less likely to constrain the president’s ability to use military force without congressional authorization. In the most oft-repeated formulation, the State Department’s Legal Adviser informed Congress in a 1975 letter that its working definition of “hostilities” meant “a situation in which units of the U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile forces.” “Imminent hostilities” means “a situation in which there is a serious risk from hostile fire to the safety of United States forces.”

The executive branch has at times taken the position that supposedly defensive action by U.S. armed forces is exempt from the reporting and withdrawal requirements of the War Powers Resolution because U.S. armed forces were not “introduced” into hostilities, but instead hostilities were introduced to U.S. armed forces. The Biden administration adopted this legal theory to wage a yearslong military campaign against the Houthis without congressional authorization despite the restrictions of the War Powers Resolution.

The White House has in the past sometimes treated U.S. attacks on foreign vessels as introductions into hostilities triggering the War Powers Resolution. This was the case for the 1986 Gulf of Sidra incident involving air and naval fighting with Libya and a 1988 episode during the Tanker War when U.S. helicopters in the Persian Gulf responded to the distress call of a tanker under attack by (presumably Iranian) small boats, were fired on by the boats and returned fire in self-defense.

In my view, the U.S. attack on this supposed smuggling vessel constituted the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities, triggering both the reporting requirements of the War Powers Resolution as well as its 60-day clock for withdrawing U.S. forces. The attack not only resembles previously reported incidents during the Reagan administration, but U.S. armed forces were deliberately introduced into the situation with the U.S. president himself reportedly giving the order to “blow up” the supposed smuggling vessel.

UN Charter

Any use of force by the United States must also comply with the UN Charter—both as a matter of international and domestic law. Article 2(4) of the UN Charter provides that: “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”

The UN Charter safeguards states from the use of force. It is not currently clear what states (if any) were impacted by the U.S. attack on this vessel and thus whether Article 2(4) of the Charter is implicated by this strike. According to the Trump administration, the strike occurred in international waters. There is no indication that the vessel was flagged under any country (which would make an attack on the vessel an attack on the flag state in the view of the United States) Although some countries (such as the United States) have in the past treated attacks on their nationals abroad as attacks on the state itself, as of publication no country has claimed the 11 people reportedly killed in this attack and the Venezuelan government claimed the video of the incident was generated by artificial intelligence.

Use of Lethal Force

Working in collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy has for many years conducted maritime interdictions of suspected drug smugglers under a law enforcement paradigm—including during the current Trump administration. In such operations, U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement personnel board the suspect vessel and take the crew into custody.

The attack on the smuggling vessel in the Caribbean was so extraordinary because there was no reported attempt to stop the boat or detain its crew. Instead, the use of lethal force was used in the first resort. According to Secretary of State Rubio, President Trump was given the option of conducting a maritime interdiction but instead elected to blow up the vessel to send a message. Such use of lethal force raises a number of distinct legal issues.

Assassination Ban

Executive Order 12333 prohibits assassinations, providing that “No person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.” Under executive branch legal doctrine, “assassination” is understood to include the targeted killing of individuals. (The Uniform Code of Military Justice also of course criminalizes murder.)

Public reporting on the past interpretation of the assassination ban indicates that the U.S. executive branch has recognized two potentially relevant exceptions to the prohibition in recent decades: (1) actions taken in self-defense; and (2) use of lethal force consistent with the law of war.

With respect to self-defense, the Trump administration has indicated that it is countering the flow of drugs to the United States. But drug trafficking by itself does not constitute an “armed attack,” nor a threat of an imminent armed attack, for the purposes in international law. Nor does drug trafficking represent the predicate for self-defense commonly recognized as required for the invocation of self-defense under criminal law in the United States.

The Law of War

Although not explicit, the administration’s framing of its attack on the alleged Tren de Aragua smuggling vessel suggests that it is targeting the group as if it were a terrorist organization with which the United States is engaged in an armed conflict. Such a law of war framework in turn raises a number of subsidiary questions.

Even assuming that Tren de Aragua constitutes an organized armed group (which there is reason to doubt) with which the United States is involved in a non-international armed conflict, it is far from clear that the attack on the vessel and the killing of those aboard was lawful under the law of war. The administration has not sought to explain how either the boat or its passengers were lawful military objectives.

In armed conflict, combatants/fighters (not hors de combat) may be targeted on a status basis. Further, civilians directly participating in hostilities may also be made the object of attack. Smuggling drugs by itself does not render a civilian a combatant/fighter subject to status-based targeting. Nor does it constitute direct participation in hostilities.

Nor has the administration argued that the cargo of the vessels was somehow a lawful military objective and the passengers somehow lawful collateral damage consistent with the principle of proportionality.

Assuming arguendo that the United States is operating under the law of war in targeting this supposed Tren de Aragua vessel, attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects violate the law of war.

Moreover, certain violations of the law of war constitute war crimes under both international and U.S. domestic law. Specifically, the U.S. War Crimes Act criminalizes murder, defined as the

“act of a person who intentionally kills, or conspires or attempts to kill, or kills whether intentionally or unintentionally in the course of committing any other offense under this subsection, one or more persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including those placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.”

Many other states not only criminalize this offense but have universal jurisdiction over the crime, regardless of who perpetrates it.

We still lack details about the individuals aboard the targeted vessel as well as the legal rationale for the attack. But if U.S. forces are targeting individuals who are civilians—not qualifying as combatants/fighters or directly participating in hostilities—this raises the specter of accountability under the War Crimes Act.

The Right to Life in Human Rights Law

Such attacks may also violate the right to life under international human rights law. And while the U.S. government has not consistently acknowledged the extraterritorial application of the relevant legal obligation as a matter of treaty law (see this 2014 Just Security symposium for long-running debate on that issue), DoD’s 2024 Operational Law Handbook (pages 98-99) adopts the view that murder is prohibited by a peremptory rule of customary international law applicable even extraterritorially.

An Extraordinary and Unsettling Action

The Trump administration’s military attack on this alleged smuggling vessel is not only extraordinary and unsettling in its own right, but also because of the context in which it occurs and for what it may portend for future action.

The use of lethal force in this attack appears gratuitous and the administration has not explained why law enforcement tools were inadequate to address the situation. Of a piece with the deployment of troops to U.S. cities, the strike is an unnecessary and performative use of the U.S. military—a use that is legally fraught at best. (Indeed, Trump threatened Chicago with a troop deployment in the same Oval Office appearance in which he announced the strike.) And the use of lethal force against these supposed terrorists is ominous both because the Trump administration has vowed further such strikes in Latin America and because this administration has deployed the “terrorist” label more broadly domestically, including against migrants and political opponents.

“This is a fluid situation.” Elizabeth Marrero, one of the organizers of the Waukegan parade, said she plans to make an informed decision about whether to hold or cancel the parade.
Though President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending troops to Chicago, Cunningham worries Waukegan may not be spared.

With Naval Station Great Lakes serving as the nerve center for the effort, federal officials met with Lake County law enforcement Wednesday morning to brief them on the agents’ arrival and the potential for the National Guard’s deployment, according to Gregory Jackson, the chief of staff for North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. The city’s police chief, Laz Perez, was among those in attendance, Jackson said.

As a result, Rockingham and Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham said they are taking steps to ensure the safety of people in their communities, where there is fear of family separation in mixed families where some members are documented and others are not.

“I don’t believe that a time has come in our country where the National Guard and ICE are coming into our community to basically scare the Latino population,” Rockingham said. “I didn’t think our country would ever get to that point.”

Waukegan officials also expressed concern about the federal plans ahead of a Sept. 14 event celebrating Latin American independence. A similar Fiestas Patrias parade and festival scheduled for that day in North Chicago was cancelled on Wednesday afternoon, Jackson said.

Jackson said as many as 300 ICE agents will be part of the operation. The officers will stay in hotels in Waukegan, Gurnee and possibly other area communities. National Guard troops will be used as they were in Los Angeles to protect federal buildings, he said.

Federal buildings in the area include the Navy base, the James A. Lovell Federal Healthcare Center and an FBI firing range in North Chicago, as well as a U.S. Social Security Office in Waukegan.

Along with representatives of law enforcement from neighboring communities, Jackson said U.S. Navy personnel and naval police were at the briefing, as well as representatives of ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Perez declined to comment on the meeting.

With the parade celebrating Mexican Independence Day and the freedom of other Latin American countries still on in Waukegan for Sept. 14, local officials and parade organizers are concerned about the safety of local residents.

Cunningham said due to the influx of federal officials into the area, he and members of his staff spent about an hour with Mexican Consul General Reyna Torres Mendivil discussing ways to keep people safe.

“She will be in touch with the various organizing groups and will advise them on the best way to ensure the safety and security of their families,” Cunningham said. “This is a fluid situation.”

Elizabeth Marrero, one of the organizers of the Waukegan parade, said she plans to make an informed decision about whether to hold or cancel the parade. Her primary concern is the safety of the community.

“We’re watching very closely, and I’m trying to get the feel of the community,” she said. “It is a great concern. It’s 11 days away. We’re going to see what happens.”

Cunningham said his concerns go beyond the parade. Though President Donald Trump keeps talking about sending troops to Chicago, Cunningham worries Waukegan may not be spared.

“They’re (staying) much closer to Waukegan and North Chicago than Chicago,” the mayor said. “I’m worried about ICE in our neighborhoods. Thoughts of that in the Latino community really scares people.

During the Waukegan City Council meeting on Tuesday at City Hall, Cunningham tried to calm people during his opening comments. He said immigrants formed the fabric of Waukegan since its earliest days in the 1800s. It is as true today as it was then, he said.

“We want our community to know challenges may arise, and we will face them together with courage and resolve,” Cunningham said. “The people of Waukegan do not hide from fear. We stand up and support one another.

“That is our stand until this situation has passed us,” he continued. “If we stick together and stay focused on leading our residents through this, this too shall pass.”

With ICE increasing its presence in the area, Mano a Mano Executive Director and Waukegan Township Trustee Dulce Ortiz said Wednesday people must know their rights if they encounter an agent. They are masked and do not resemble other law enforcement officers, she said.

“The Trump administration is terrorizing the Brown community by trying to bring his agenda to us,” Ortiz said.

Should people encounter an ICE agent, she said they have the right to remain silent or ask to speak to a lawyer. If an agent comes to a person’s home, they do not have to open the door unless the person there has a warrant signed by a judge, Ortiz said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ctc-l-federal-deployment001_233915059.jpg?w=1024&h=691,N,,2025-09-03 20:57:23.024495

“You’re not going to be able to remove any of these children until … I can rule,” she told the government.
One red flag: In Pittsburgh and elsewhere, court hearings for children in the system began disappearing from the master calendar.","A holiday-weekend attempt by the Trump administration to remove hundreds of Guatemalan children — including several in Pittsburgh — from the United States was temporarily halted Sunday by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. But advocates say they doubt the fight is over — and that it already has added to the trauma of children who fled danger to come to the U.S. on their own.

The children, said to number between 600 and 700 nationally, are in the custody of the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, which contracts with service providers to house “unaccompanied minors” until more permanent arrangements can be found. Many of the children, say advocates, fled dangers such as trafficking or violence — from family members, criminals, or military groups.

The children in Pittsburgh are “upset and worried and scared,” said Dana Gold, chief operating officer of Jewish Family and Community Services, which provides the minors with legal representation. “They're in a situation that's totally outside of their control in a country they had hoped to trust.”

The effort to remove the children came with little public warning.

On Friday, CNN reported that the children had been identified across the country for removal in a “pilot program” crafted with Guatemalan officials. Locals worried that children could be removed from local facilities as early as 8 a.m. Saturday morning. That didn’t happen in Pittsburgh, but roundups elsewhere led the National Immigration Law Center to file a suit late Saturday night on behalf of 10 children from around the country, asking U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan to issue a restraining order that would prevent any children from being removed.

The Trump administration has claimed the children in question were being sent to Guatemala because their families wanted them back. Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government, told Sooknanan in a hearing Sunday afternoon that it was “outrageous” that lawyers for the children were “trying to interfere with these reunifications. “

Sooknanan appeared unconvinced: She cited statements from children expressing fear about their return, and she noted they had been rounded up “in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend” and been placed on airplanes by the time she issued her order.

But an early version of Sooknanan’s order did not make clear whether it protected all 600 children or just those named in the suit. Local attorneys prepared to file a suit on behalf of the Pittsburgh refugees until Sooknanan revised the order to explicitly cover every child the government had deemed subject to removal.

“You’re not going to be able to remove any of these children until … I can rule,” she told the government.

While shelters in other parts of the country reportedly received letters warning them not to interfere with immigration officials, Gold said she was unaware of such a letter being received locally.

Still, she said, children in the Pittsburgh area had been hearing “that children in shelters in another part of the United States were ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night, taken away by people they don't know. … They do not know what's going on.”

Gold was wary of identifying the number of children beyond saying they were housed in ""multiple facilities.” She noted that unaccompanied minors stay in shelters just long enough to find a sponsor — typically a family member in the country — who can care for them while their case makes its way through the system. But sources say the number of Guatemalan minors being cared for locally is currently less than a dozen.

‘A really troubling practice’

As rapidly as the situation unfolded this weekend, there had been recent omens of what was to come. In mid-August, immigration agents sought interviews with refugee children at Pittsburgh’s Holy Family Institute, which has long cared for refugee children, and in similar facilities nationwide.

Holy Family declined to comment to WESA at the time, and Gold said she wasn’t sure what the agents sought to discuss.

But CNN, which first reported on the interviews, called them an ”escalation in the [Trump] administration’s focus on immigrant children.” And observers suspected they were efforts either to lay the groundwork for deportation or to help immigration authorities remove the people who were identified as likely sponsors of the children.

“It’s a really troubling practice,” Keith Armstrong, a fellowship attorney on immigrant-rights issues for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told WESA at the time.

“The fact that [immigration enforcement] is speaking with them comes across as intimidation and harassment,” he added — especially for kids who “often have experienced trauma in the past.”

ORR is not an immigration-enforcement agency: It is housed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rather than Homeland Security, whose purview includes immigration control. Its function has been to provide support for minors who lack a parent or other caretaker.

But even before this weekend’s events, Jennifer Podkul of the child-advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense told WESA that the Trump administration appeared to be shifting its focus.

She noted that the acting head of ORR, Angie Salazar, is a former ICE official. And Project 2025, a conservative blueprint proposed for Trump’s administration during the 2024 campaign, proposed that the office function more like a law-enforcement agency.

The interviews and shift in priorities are “a core attack on children — some of the most vulnerable kids who are in this country, and who may already have escaped horrific situations,” Podkul told WESA last month.

Word that children in Pittsburgh could be removed began circulating among activists Friday night, though Gold said lawyers were tracking the concern earlier in the week. One red flag: In Pittsburgh and elsewhere, court hearings for children in the system began disappearing from the master calendar.

“It was really alarming when we checked the master calendar hearings and saw our clients — these vulnerable children's names — no longer on the docket where they had been a few hours earlier,” Gold said.

For now, Sooknanan’s order prevents those children from being removed. But advocates doubt it will be the last word.

“Folks sprung into action so that these things could be prevented,” said Monica Ruiz of the local immigrant-advocacy group Casa San Jose. “But I think it’s just temporary. I think [administration officials] are going to figure out a way to do it.”

“I thought the idea was to go after criminals or people who were taking jobs. But this just proves that was never really the goal,” Ruiz added. “A lot of people don’t think this is happening, but it’s happening literally in their backyard. It’s here. It’s really here.”

Gold said that by Wednesday, lawyers hope to have declarations from Guatemalan children about their fears of being returned — statements they will present to the National Immigration Law Center for potential inclusion in the District of Columbia case. More broadly, she said, they are gathering such declarations from every unaccompanied minor housed locally, no matter what their country of origin.

“We're going to begin the process for kids from every nationality,” Gold said. “Because we anticipate that this is something that's just going to continue.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c427b53/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1538x807+0+66/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Fb8%2F88c2d57543e593e089728994def9%2Ftexas-migrant-children-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 17:57:36.062442

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.
The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.
The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.
Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.","LOS ANGELES — Federal agents are violating a court order that prohibits them from racially profiling Latinos and other Southern California residents as the directive winds it way through an appeals process, immigrant advocates and local officials say.

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden-era appointee, imposed the temporary restraining order in Los Angeles more than a month ago, but arrests in locations frequented by Latino workers, such as Home Depots and car washes, have become daily occurrences.

“It’s a complete disregard,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA. “It’s almost like the rounding up of cattle in the road.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, denies racially profiling people in its efforts to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda.

“Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people,"" DHS said Wednesday in an emailed statement. ""What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.”

Immigrant rights' organizers and local officials say the order is difficult to enforce while the litigation winds its way through the courts.

“We’re using every tool at our disposal to put a stop to this behavior,” said Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto.

Last month, Soto's office led a coalition of 20 California cities — including Los Angeles, Santa Monica and Long Beach — in joining a federal lawsuit alleging that the federal government conducted unconstitutional and unlawful arrests and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

In the complaint, filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigration and civil rights groups, they said the federal government's enforcement actions have had a ""chilling effect"" on local communities.

The organizations asked the court to stop federal agencies from using “disproportionate force,” which has sometimes led to U.S. citizens being detained.

The federal government twice challenged the temporary restraining order, first in the 9th Circuit of Appeals and then in the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling was upheld in the appeals court, and the Supreme Court has not weighed in on the issue.

The lawsuit is set for a hearing on Sept. 24 for a preliminary injunction that would extend the order as the case progresses through the courts.

Meanwhile, immigration advocates said they recorded more than a dozen arrests at Home Depots and car washes in Los Angeles and Orange counties on Tuesday.

Volunteers who witnessed the arrests or went to the scene to help families get information about their missing loved ones said the workers all spoke Spanish.

Eight people were arrested last week outside a Home Depot near a day labor center, which has been the target of at least three previous enforcement actions, NBC Los Angeles reported.

Video shot by immigration advocates and circulated on social media shows federal agents arriving in unmarked cars as workers run, some tripping over themselves.

DHS said in a statement that three of the eight people had “extensive rap sheets,” but did not mention the other five.

“Every day, DHS is enforcing our nation’s laws across all of LA not just Home Depots,” the department said in Wednesday's emailed statement.

The operation unfolded at the same Home Depot where federal agents jumped out of a Penske rental van and took a dozen people into custody.

Joshua Erazo, a day laborer organizer who connects workers with employers at the center, told NBC Los Angeles that the people who were detained included street vendors.

Data compiled by CHIRLA shows that 471 of the 2,800 arrests made by the Department of Homeland Security from June 6 to July 20 occurred in predominantly Latino neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley.

As of Wednesday, Homeland Security has made more than 5,000 arrests in Los Angeles, ""including murderers, rapists, and child abusers,"" it said in the statement.

Believing they have little recourse, some residents have filed individual lawsuits instead of waiting for the temporary restraining order to be enforced.

Lawyers representing a Los Angeles mother took the first step last week toward suing the federal government after her teenage son was detained by agents at gunpoint in a case of mistaken identity. They filed a claim for $1 million in damages for personal injury, including ""assault, battery, false arrest, false imprisonment,"" according to court documents.

Andreina Mejia said she and her son, who is 15 and has special needs, were sitting inside her parked car outside Arleta High School when masked federal agents approached them with guns drawn. They were both pulled out and Mejia was handcuffed while agents questioned her son, she said.

“He didn’t know what was going on,"" she said. ""So, I just told him, ‘Don’t make any movement, don’t move, just follow instructions.’”

Agents asked for the whereabouts of a person whose name her son did not recognize, and briefly detained him when he could not provide information, Mejia said. One of the agents appeared to realize they had the wrong person and let her son go, she said.

Both Mejia and her son are U.S. citizens. Agents said they were looking for a young man from El Salvador.

“The family is Mexican American,” said Mejia’s attorney, Christian Contreras. “It feels as if they were exploited, abused and taken advantage of because of the color of their skin.”

The interaction has left lasting scars on her son, who now suffers from nightmares and sometimes “breaks down” in tears when she’s driving, Mejia said.

“People with the slightest shade of brown in their skin in L.A. fear that they may be the target of immigration officials,” Contreras said. “It’s across the board now.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250903-ice-agents-ch-1316-0388cc.jpg",N,,2025-09-03 17:58:08.700423

On August 11, President Trump invoked a provision of the D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973 and temporarily placed the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control for 30 days, saying he would allow the police to “do whatever the hell they want.” At the same time, he deployed nearly 1000 D.C. National Guard troops and almost as many federal law enforcement agents to patrol the streets. Since he declared this false emergency, Republican governors from six states have sent their National Guard troops to D.C. as well.

For the more than 700,000 people who call D.C. home — and the many more who visit the capital every day — the federal government’s militarized presence is impossible to ignore. Armed National Guard troops are stationed in metro stations, at parks, and on popular streets filled with bars and restaurants, costing taxpayers an estimated $1 million a day. Police checkpoints manned by unidentified federal agencies are popping up across the city, waiting to catch someone who doesn’t have a seatbelt on. Armored military vehicles run red lights and cause accidents in quiet neighborhoods, while heavily-armed, often masked federal agents violently arrest people who are immigrants, and people of color while refusing to identify themselves or provide any information to the bystanders trying to help.

Recently, The Washington Post reported that President Trump plans to deploy military troops and federal agents to Chicago this September, and he has threatened to do the same in Baltimore, New York City, Oakland, and San Francisco, disregarding state and local officials who have loudly proclaimed that this would be unwanted and unjustified.

At the ACLU, we are making clear to Congress that troops do not belong on our streets and urging Congress to pass the VISIBLE Act, which would ban federal agents from hiding their identities. We also know that no matter what agency someone is with—whether federal or local, law enforcement or the military—the Constitution constrains how government employees can treat us.

If you’re in a city where law enforcement or military troops are present, it’s important to know your rights. If you are stopped on the street, you may ask, “Am I free to go?” If the answer is “yes,” you are free to walk away. If arrested or detained, you have the right to remain silent. In certain circumstances, you can also refuse searches of your belongings or car. If you witness or document police or military activity, you generally have the right to record in public spaces as long as you do not interfere with law enforcement activity.

If asked about your immigration status, you can remain silent, though if you are not a U.S. citizen, the law may require you to carry with you and provide specific immigration documents for your specific immigration status when an immigration agent requests your immigration papers. If you do not have these papers or if you choose to remain silent regarding immigration or citizenship status, an immigration officer might detain you for longer to verify this information. There may also be immigration and other legal consequences if you make this choice. Never lie or present false documents.

The threats to our rights and safety are real, but so is our power and resilience. Knowing our rights is critical to how we hold power accountable.

Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern over incidents in which her agency and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement have prevented members of Congress from inspecting ICE immigrant detention facilities.

The letter contends that new DHS protocols — which require seven days’ notice for a visit, among other provisions — violate federal law and urges Noem to “immediately rescind the facility visit guidance that impedes congressional access to detention facilities and ensure full compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.”

The ICE facilities, the letter said, “are funded by billions of taxpayer dollars and exhibit persistent issues related to health and safety, human rights, and waste, fraud, and abuse. It is imperative that Members conduct timely oversight to determine whether public funds are being spent as mandated by Congress and ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals who are detained by the government.”

Vasquez visited the Otero County Processing Center in July where, as Source previously reported, he was unable to speak with detainees; ICE officials were “unwilling and unable” to provide clear answers about their treatment of detainees; and inmate phones were broken and toilets would not flush.

Staff members for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) visited the Torrance County Detention Facility in May, and heard at least 10 people file complaints with an ICE official for verbal and physical abuse; lack of access to laundry; being forced to wear old, dirty clothing; and lack of medical care, according to a letter Heinrich sent to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

“Congress needs and must be able to inspect and enforce the inspection of detention facilities,” Vasquez told Source on Wednesday. “Part of our job is oversight of federal facilities like ICE facilities, and we’re being denied that right all across the country. And so this is essentially a letter that spells out what the clear letter of the law is.”

A dozen Democratic members of the U.S. House have also gone to court over being denied access.

She described receiving death threats from people she claims were jealous of her father’s success in business and who sought to extort the business. … In her application for withholding of removal, Lopez Cano claimed that the threats were on account of a statutorily protected ground because they were based on her relationship with her father, and she maintained that ‘the Lopez family’ constituted ‘a particular social group’ within the meaning of the relevant statute. 8 U.S.C. §1231(b)(3)(A). …

“… One of her children, Tommy, suffers from anxiety, which causes him to bite his nails. Tommy had been attending psychotherapy sessions on a weekly basis at the time of the hearing. Lopez Cano testified that she would not be able to afford the mental health treatment Tommy needs in Guatemala. …

“Lopez Cano challenges the denial of her application for cancellation of removal on two grounds. First, as far as we can glean, Lopez Cano challenges the agency’s weighing of the facts in concluding that she did not satisfy the hardship standard. She contends that the agency failed to give adequate weight to Tommy’s ‘hardship of not having his mother’s care and presence in the USA.’ Second, she argues that the agency committed legal error by not properly analyzing required hardship factors articulated in In re Matter of Monreal-Aguinaga, 23 I. & N. Dec. 56 (BIA 2001) (henceforth, ‘Monreal’) and In re Matter of Gonzalez Recinas, 23 I. & N. Dec. 467 (BIA 2002) (hereafter, ‘Recinas’). …

“Accepting the agency’s factual findings as they are, and affording deference to the agency, we discern no error in the BIA’s conclusion that Lopez Cano failed to satisfy the hardship standard. The BIA accepted the IJ’s finding that Tommy suffers from anxiety but, like the IJ, found no basis for concluding that the hardship to Tommy, or the cumulative hardship to Lopez Cano’s three children, would be exceptional and extremely unusual. In making that determination, the BIA emphasized the scanty evidence in the record concerning Tommy’s anxiety, which manifested in nail-biting. The BIA pointed out that Lopez Cano did not make clear whether her children would accompany her to Guatemala and, if so, whether Tommy’s anxiety could be treated there. The BIA stated that, without evidence on those matters, ‘the record does not establish that [Tommy’s] health issues are so serious that they rise to the level of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.’ … In addition, the BIA noted that Lopez Cano’s ‘two younger children are healthy and have no problems in school.’ Based on this state of the record, the BIA observed that Lopez Cano failed to show that the difficulty for her children, including Tommy, would be ‘substantially beyond the ordinary hardship that would be expected when a close family member leaves the country.’ Monreal, 23 I. & N. Dec. at 62. We discern no error in that assessment. To the extent Lopez Cano challenges the IJ and BIA’s factual findings, we lack jurisdiction to review that argument. …

“For these reasons, we reject Lopez Cano’s challenge to the BIA’s decision to deny cancellation of removal. …

“Next, we consider Lopez Cano’s challenge to the BIA’s denial of her application for withholding of removal. …

“The BIA held that Lopez Cano did not meet the nexus requirement because she did not show her membership in her family was the reason she and her father were (or would be) targeted. Before us, Lopez Cano only challenges the BIA’s determination that she failed to ‘establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her’ membership in the Lopez family. In particular, as far as we can tell, Lopez Cano contends that the evidence in the record compels the opposite conclusion. Not so.

“Nothing in the record compels the conclusion that Lopez Cano’s family will be a central reason Guatemalan criminal gangs would target her. Rather, Lopez Cano’s own testimony supports the agency’s no-nexus finding. … Accordingly, the BIA’s denial of withholding of removal to Lopez Cano is supported by substantial evidence in the record.”

He is a former partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher and a former partner at Sidley Austin. He clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia from 1987-88 and Judge Amalya Kearse from 1986-87.

Yesterday, federal District Judge Charles Breyer ruled that the Trump Administration’s federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles to assist in immigration law enforcement violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which is 18 U.S.C. section 1385. The Posse Comitatus Act bars use of the military for law enforcement, “except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.” The Trump Administration argued that the National Guard authorization statute on which it relied—10 U.S.C. section 12406(3)—is an express exception. Judge Breyer’s ruling to the contrary, at pages 26-32 of his decision, was his core holding. Although the Los Angeles deployment was not about elections, if an appellate court adopts certain arguments made by the Trump Administration in that case, such a decision could set our country on a path to military interference in the 2026 elections.

It would be criminal for any Administration to use the military to interfere with voting or vote counting in any election. In particular, 18 U.S.C. sections 592 and 593 (“Sections 592 and 593”) criminalize both having troops at the polls and military interference with voting, conducting elections, or election officers. These statutes apply to use of both the regular military and members of National Guard units “called into Federal service.” 10 U.S.C section 12405; see also 10 U.S.C. section 10106. Although Sections 592 and 593 apply only to officers and members of the military, 18 U.S.C. section 2 also makes it criminal for others—for example, a member of the Cabinet or a White House official—to aid, abet, counsel, command, induce, procure, or willfully cause violations of Sections 592 and 593. And 18 U.S.C. Section 371 makes it criminal for both military and non-military officials to conspire to violate Sections 592 and 593.

But, in the Los Angeles case, in addition to the Trump Administration’s expansive interpretation of 10 U.S.C. section 12046(3), the Administration has raised three arguments that, if adopted by the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court, would disable federal court enforcement of Sections 592 and 593 and thus encourage using the military to interfere in the 2026 elections. The first such Trump Administration argument is that the President has an inherent power to use the military to protect federal property, federal personnel, and federal functions and that this inherent protective power is not subject to federal statutory limitations. One can almost hear the Trump Administration arguing in 2026 that it is using the military to protect the federal function of federal elections. But Judge Breyer’s decision at 33-42 exhaustively surveyed the precedents and correctly decided that any inherent protective power to use the military domestically is subject to federal statutory restrictions. Under this ruling, no inherent protective power would override the statutory prohibitions in Sections 592 and 593 against employing the military to interfere with elections.

The second Trump Administration argument is that it does not matter if deploying the military violates a criminal statute, because federal courts lack the equitable power to enjoin violations of criminal statutes. Judge Breyer’s decision at 46-48 rejected this argument on a number of grounds. Most important for election law, Judge Breyer relied on the history of the Posse Comitatus Act, where its triggering cause was the deploying of the military at elections. “It is ahistorical and illogical to think that Congress reacted to this by passing a statute that had as its sole enforcement mechanism federal prosecution of individual troops by the same federal government that would have ordered the troops to engage in domestic law enforcement.” (P. 48, emphasis in original) This deficiency in the government’s argument would be as obvious for violations of Sections 592 and 593.

The third Trump Administration argument suffers from a similar deficiency. The Plaintiffs in the Los Angeles case sought ultra vires relief as the vehicle to stop violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. Ultra vires relief is a remedy for official actions that lack constitutional or statutory authority. The Trump Administration argued that ultra vires relief should be unavailable for violation of a federal criminal statute. That would mean that the only remedy would be the possibility that the same executive branch that violated the criminal statute would bring a prosecution. Judge Breyer’s decision at 48-50 rejected this argument, commenting that its implications meant the Posse Comitatus Act “would have been ineffective when passed and would remain so today.” (P. 50.) The same absurd implications would apply if ultra vires relief was unavailable to stop military interference with elections that violates Sections 592 and 593.

If an appellate court adopts any of these three arguments of the Trump Administration, such a decision would neuter the federal criminal prohibitions on the use of the military, including National Guard units in federal service, to interfere with elections. These arguments are thus a dagger pointed at elections–the heart of our Republic.

This danger to federal elections is not far-fetched. In December 2020, private counsel working in support of President Trump drafted executive orders that would have deployed National Guard units in federal service to seize voting machines and records. See Brief Amici Curiae of Danforth, et al., at 29-31, filed April 4, 2024, in Trump v. United States, No. 23-939 (U.S. Sup. Ct.). Thankfully, President Trump did not issue those executive orders. If any court adopts any of the three Trump Administration arguments described above, however, next time our Republic might not be so lucky.

We live in an age where what was once unimaginable has become commonplace. The courts on appeal in the Los Angeles case should protect our country by rejecting any Trump Administration argument that would provide a precedent for criminal military interference in the 2026 or subsequent elections. Even for a judge or Justice whose judicial philosophy often supports expansive executive powers, please remember Justice Scalia’s warning against limitless legal arguments: “Fun’s fun, but you can’t die laughing.”

BY EVAN COOPER

The Trump administration has taken a seemingly drastic approach to State Department reform. First, the remnants of USAID were merged into State’s regional bureaus. This was followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s sweeping reorganization, which eliminates most staffing in the Bureaus of Conflict and Stabilization Operations and Population, Refugees, and Migration; the Office of Global Partnerships; and dozens of other offices. The plan also seeks to cut at least 15 percent of State’s U.S.-based workforce through the reduction-in-force procedure and early retirements.

While the attempt to shrink the size of the department is unprecedented, many of the second Trump administration’s State Department reforms are drawn from past efforts by his first administration and others, which ultimately did not stick. They risk failing again for the same reason: a consistent inability to work effectively with Congress. Both sides are at fault; administrations have not engaged Congress to codify reforms for the long term, while the modifications to State that Congress has pushed are done without buy-in from the bureaucracy.

The administration’s “move fast and break things” approach to the State Department is unlikely to work if there is not congressional authorization of these changes, followed by oversight and evaluation of enacted reforms.

Reforms Again and Again

Every administration in the 21st century has attempted to reform the State Department, and some of these efforts are reflected in the Trump administration’s recent moves. For example, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sought to overhaul foreign assistance, trying to align it with the strategic diplomatic goals of the George W. Bush administration while making assistance more transparent and ensuring greater oversight.

This push for reform was “due in large part to the Secretary’s inability to answer congressional inquiries regarding U.S. spending on democracy promotion,” wrote Gerald Hyman in a 2008 report published by the Carnegie Endowment. Similar concerns about democracy promotion spending have been cited by the Trump administration as reason for cutting foreign assistance; moving assistance programs under the purview of the regional bureaus; and drastically shrinking the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

The Obama administration undertook an even broader approach to State Department reform than the Bush administration, implementing the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR). Ultimately, the QDDR did not live up to its name, with reviews published only in 2010 and 2015. In 2012 a group of senators (including then-Senator Marco Rubio) introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act, which sought to codify the QDDR process and authorized the Secretary of State to establish an Office of Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.

Every administration in the 21st century has attempted to reform the State Department, and some of these efforts are reflected in the Trump administration’s recent moves.

While the QDDR effort obtained support from Congress, there was no institutional buy-in on the State side to facilitate the continuing review process. “Stakeholders largely viewed the resulting document as anchored by wish lists instead of real strategy,” Daniel Runde and Helen Moser wrote in an assessment of the 2010 QDDR process for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. One of the principal recommendations in the 2010 QDDR was that State reduce the use of contractors—a recommendation that was never pursued and has since returned as a goal of the second Trump administration’s State reform agenda.

The first Trump administration did go to Congress with a State Department reform proposal in 2017 that aimed to “improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the executive branch.” According to the 2021 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, “Congressional Oversight of the State Department: Review of Selected Organizational Reform Efforts,” Congress viewed the “Redesign” plan with hostility and “was able to leverage its oversight authorities to prevent the Trump administration from implementing a major reorganization” of the department. The proposed reforms in 2017 included merging USAID into State; Trump’s team did not seek approval from Congress for such a merger the second time around. The Trump administration appears to have taken the lesson from its first reform effort that it should act without the support of Congress and only later ask Congress to codify the changes it has made.

The Biden administration’s Modernization Agenda took a more focused approach than the first Trump administration and sought to work with Congress to enact its proposed changes. Notably, this led to the creation of the new Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy, which has had bipartisan support from Congress and which the second Trump administration has not sought to eliminate. Other aspects of Biden’s Modernization Agenda, however, that do not enjoy broad congressional support, particularly those related to workforce modernization, have quickly been overturned by the current administration. Republican members of Congress, including Rubio, criticized the Biden administration’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at State. The incoming Trump administration celebrated its early elimination of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, seeing it as a political win that was unlikely to receive pushback from Congress.

The Way Forward: The Role of Congress

Several lessons from past reform attempts should inform future efforts. The most important is that while reform proposals should come from the executive branch, they must be designed with workforce buy-in and congressional support in mind.

The executive branch decides how to deploy the State Department. To do this, it must understand what the institution’s capabilities and weaknesses are. The executive branch should source ideas from within the department’s ranks and choose which ideas it wants to advance. But those ideas need to be communicated to Congress early on, with a focus on explaining why the changes are needed and identifying how Congress can help sustain any changes past the current administration. Successful reform efforts will not be implemented in four- or even eight-year cycles; they require funding and oversight from Congress and cultural adoption from within the bureaucracy.

To be successful, reforms need to be implemented through a consistent and iterative process, which has thus far been lacking.

Congress’ best tool for implementing reforms is a State Department authorization, but lawmakers have failed to pass a stand-alone authorization bill since 2002. While State Department authorizations have been tacked on to the National Defense Authorization Act for the last three years of the Biden administration, these bills only authorized appropriations on a narrow set of issues rather than broadly authorizing State Department accounts. Furthermore, as the 2025 CRS report “Foreign Relations Reauthorization: Background and Issues” highlights, attaching State authorization to NDAA legislation includes committees in the decision-making that would not otherwise have oversight authority over State. This contributes to the narrowing of the authorizations and prevents funding for new initiatives.

For a future State authorization to be successful, the administration will need to work with Congress, specifically the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to understand what is politically viable. State should strive to make Foreign Service (FS) and Civil Service (CS) officers available to speak with Congress about how structural changes would affect their jobs, which could provide useful information to Congress while helping obtain buy-in from the workforce.

Use the Congressional Commission

The Congressional Commission on Reform and Modernization of the Department of State, which was authorized in 2023 and fully funded in 2024, offers a useful forum for information sharing between the executive branch and Congress. The commission was designed to bring together lawmakers, State’s leadership, and outside experts to elevate not just useful concepts for reform but insights into how they can be implemented. The commission should be utilized by both sides to put forward concepts for reform and test their viability before going through the legislative process. There is a risk that the commission will fall by the wayside under the Trump administration, but members of Congress and the administration should staff and employ the body for their own benefit.

The commission should prioritize engaging the longest-serving members of the FS to develop an understanding of what the opportunities and impediments are to receiving institutional buy-in for reforms. The QDDR was an earnest attempt to implement a procedure that could be adopted by future administrations, but it was so far detached from the experience of State Department personnel that it came to be seen as an aspirational review divorced from practical plans for implementation. High-level reviews that do not receive support from the workforce risk bureaucratic slow-rolling and quiet resistance.

The reform process should engage with employees early and in depth but should not off-load responsibility onto them. There is a risk of tasking the workforce with a burdensome review, only for their own reform proposals to be dismissed; when that happens, the process will ultimately be seen as superficial by those whose buy-in matters most. Mandated integrated country strategies, for example, create a large amount of work for missions but rarely lead to significant policy changes and are thus seen by many in the FS as perfunctory. Asking the workforce to develop ideas for reform without providing the resources needed to implement the ideas is a recipe for a disillusioned bureaucracy.

State Department reform does not have a finish line to be crossed. To be successful, reforms need to be implemented through a consistent and iterative process, which has thus far been lacking. There is a rich body of ideas for changes to State Department operations, but implementation of those concepts has failed because of a disjointed relationship between the State Department workforce, executive branch leadership, and Congress. As the Trump administration attempts to reshape State, it should view both Congress and State’s workforce as integral partners in this process rather than impediments to its vision. It will only be through the work of department staff, funded and overseen by Congress, that any positive reforms will last beyond the current administration.

MARTIN: And the Supreme Court has already issued a few emergency decisions related to the Alien Enemies Act.
Then, in May, the Supreme Court issued an order overnight to stop the deportation out of a facility in North Texas.
Generally, challenges to the use of the Alien Enemies Act has been playing out at individual courts across the country.","MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

And we have one more story that involves alleged gang members from Venezuela. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a late-night ruling blocking the Trump administration's use of an 18th-century wartime power to deport Venezuelans it says are gang members. The administration has been using the Alien Enemies Act to quickly remove people it suspects of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Now the ultimate question of whether the president's invocation of the act is legal could be headed to the Supreme Court. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been following the case, and she's with us now. Good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So you've been telling us that the use of the Alien Enemies Act has attracted many lawsuits. So what is this latest decision?

BUSTILLO: An appeals panel in the 5th Circuit has issued a preliminary injunction which stops the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act as the reason for deporting people. The decision comes out of what is generally considered the most conservative circuit. And in their decision, two judges, appointed by Presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden, took issue with the use of the wartime power and lack of relief if someone is removed by mistake. One judge, a Trump appointee, issued a dissent opinion.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, told NPR that the use of the wartime power to regulate immigration was, quote, rightfully ""shut down."" The administration will have the option of appealing to a wider appeals court. This is expected - that this issue will then make its way all the way up to the Supreme Court.

MARTIN: And the Supreme Court has already issued a few emergency decisions related to the Alien Enemies Act. How is it different?

BUSTILLO: The court has yet to directly address the larger question of whether President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act at all was legal. So far, they've weighed in on ancillary issues, mostly to do with how much notice people are given before their removal. For example, in March, the court ruled that those being deported through the act needed reasonable time to argue against their removals. Then, in May, the Supreme Court issued an order overnight to stop the deportation out of a facility in North Texas. That's a detention facility. Lawyers on behalf of Venezuelans held at that detention facility moved to quickly stop their clients' deportations when they learned that they had only received hours' notice that they were about to be removed using the Alien Enemies Act.

Generally, challenges to the use of the Alien Enemies Act has been playing out at individual courts across the country. District judges in Texas, Colorado and New York have ruled against the administration's use of the act, questioning Tren de Aragua's alleged ties to Venezuelan government and noting that the U.S. is not at war.

MARTIN: OK. So what you're telling us is that there have been a number of setbacks to Trump's use of the law. This is just the latest. Have you observed a throughline to what judges are objecting to?

BUSTILLO: A few things stick out across the various decisions. Judges and justices have often pointed to two main issues. First, the lack of time and notice given to those removed under the act, and second, the absence of remedies in the face of mistakes. In this latest decision, for example, the panel was united in saying that the government is actually providing sufficient notice - about seven days - to those that it wants to remove with the act. There have been challenges over individuals only receiving hours' notice, leading to immigration lawyers arguing that there simply is not enough time for someone to contest their removal.

But one element that the government seems to continuously struggle to refute is the lack of remedies if there are errors. The panel in this case, like others, have raised concerns with the government's responses on how they would navigate mistakes. They also note that the government cites nothing to indicate commitment to not remove a person who is challenging their detention. It remains to be seen what the government argues in court so it can continue to use the law to deport Venezuelans from the country.

MARTIN: That's NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

MARTIN: A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told NPR that, quote, ""this ruling will not be the final say on this matter,"" unquote. The statement went on to say, quote, ""we are confident on our position, and we have the law, the facts and common sense on our side.""

We won this battle against one state mask ban – but we must keep fighting against any other local or state ban in New York.","The Trump administration is waging an all-out war on free speech, the rule of law, immigrant rights, public health, and even taking over American cities. There is no shortage of work to be done by our state and local leaders to defend against these attacks. Yet instead of fighting for our rights, Governor Hochul and several lawmakers spent weeks of their precious time during this year’s legislative session advocating for a mask ban, a policy that plays directly into Trump’s hands.

Everyday New Yorkers, public health experts, and advocacy groups – including Jews for Mask Rights, Jews for Racial & Economic Justice, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and the NYCLU – successfully defeated Hochul’s push for an all-out mask ban. But the Governor and other anti-mask politicians forced through a provision that creates a new charge for instances when a person “conceals their identity” while committing certain crimes. This means that wearing a face covering alone is not a crime, which is an important victory.

While it’s true that we beat back the originally proposed mask ban, the fight is far from finished.

Mask Bans Proliferate

Local mask bans have already been enacted in Nassau County on Long Island and in Ballston Spa near Albany. And while a complete mask ban did not pass this legislative session, anti-mask advocates have made it clear they’re not content with the narrow restriction that was enacted. They want a full mask ban. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has even floated the idea of a ban that punishes offenders with significant jail time.

Contrary to proponents’ promises, a mask ban will not curb crime or combat antisemitism. It is a performative move that ignores the root causes of crime. Politicians can promote true public safety by addressing people’s most basic needs like housing, health care, and education. And using Jewish safety as a pretext for banning masks actually perpetuates harmful antisemitic tropes about Jews having outsized power over government. It also disregards the root causes of antisemitic hate, and tramples on free speech rights of Jewish people.

A Mask Ban for Thee but Not for ICE

While everyday people face ongoing threats to their right to wear a face covering, local and federal officials are pushing for special rules for law enforcement. Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s director, is fighting to allow ICE agents to conceal their identities for privacy reasons. Here in New York, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman – who fought relentlessly to ban everyday people from wearing masks – is pushing to allow police officers to wear a mask whenever they please. In this scenario, a masked police officer would have legal ground to arrest someone else for wearing a mask.

For those keeping score at home: Mask ban proponents think average New Yorkers must be easily identifiable at all times. But law enforcement agents – who have a long history of abuse and are supposed to work for and be accountable to the public – must be allowed to operate in secret and hide their identities.

Another Tool for Discrimination

Any mask ban, even the limited provision that was passed, is dangerous and puts New Yorkers at greater risk of police abuse, criminalization, and surveillance. We know Black New Yorkers are disproportionately surveilled, arrested, charged, and convicted of crimes, and they are the ones most likely to be negatively impacted by mask restrictions.

More broadly, any mask ban – even one with carveouts for health and religious use – creates a stigma around mask-wearing. A ban will inevitably be selectively enforced and weaponized against New Yorkers of color, Muslim New Yorkers, trans New Yorkers, and those who are disabled – all of whom are already disproportionately targeted, surveilled, and abused by police.

A Public Health Disaster

The push for a mask ban is even more alarming as we face a federal administration fervently committed to defunding our health care infrastructure and spreading misinformation about public health risks, from COVID to the largest measles outbreak in decades.

More than five years on, COVID remains a serious public health threat. Masks also offer protections against other health risks, like a new bird flu outbreak amongst humans and dangerous air quality levels due to wildfire smoke. Banning face masks undermines public health and pushes people with disabilities and those who are immunocompromised further into the margins. This isn’t a hypothetical problem. After a mask ban passed in North Carolina, a cancer patient reported being harassed for masking.

Muzzling Protests

New York’s attempts to restrict mask-wearing are not new – they’re part of our long history of suppressing residents’ First Amendment rights. The State first criminalized masks in 1845 to crack down on rent protests in the Hudson Valley. Law enforcement later used mask bans to criminalize anti-war protestors in the 1960s, people wearing Guy Fawkes masks during Occupy Wall Street in 2011, and more. In 2020, New York rightly repealed its existing mask ban in response to the COVID pandemic.

Anyone questioning why people might want to anonymously protest by wearing a mask should look at the case of Mahmoud Khalil. Mr. Khalil is a lawful permanent resident and recent graduate student at Columbia University who was arrested by the Trump administration solely in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinian human rights. He is one of hundreds of other students whom Trump wants to deport for the same reason. And, he was easy to target precisely because he did not mask at protests.

Other Columbia students who publicly advocated for Palestinian rights had their names and faces broadcast on a doxxing truck parked outside the university’s gates. As a result, a prestigious law firm rescinded job offers it had made to two of these students. Across the country, staff and students – including Mr. Khalil – discovered that their names, locations and activities had been publicized on an anonymously run website. The Department of Homeland Security has admitted to consulting this website when targeting international students for deportation.

The administration could decide to expand the parameters of who they catch in this dragnet. Close presidential advisers are openly musing about charging anyone who doesn’t agree with certain Trump policies with providing material support for terrorism. Given this climate, it’s easy to see why a broad range of New Yorkers would want to shield their identity while they exercise their right to protest.

Any mask restriction is likely to be used to selectively criminalize, doxx, surveil, and silence pro-Palestine protestors, immigrant rights advocates, those protesting police brutality, and others speaking out on issues deemed unpopular by police and some politicians. New Yorkers have grown familiar with seeing droves of officers with cameras, police drones, and helicopters monitoring and capturing images of protestors.

Those who choose to wear a mask at protests and in daily life have good reason to do so – to protect themselves from surveillance in an increasingly digital world.

We won this battle against one state mask ban – but we must keep fighting against any other local or state ban in New York. Our leaders should focus on delivering real benefits to New Yorkers and fighting back against the Trump administration. Instead, they worked to make it easier for Trump and other fascist forces to increase discriminatory policing and surveillance, crack down on dissent, and undermine public health.",https://www.nyclu.org/uploads/2025/09/web25-womancovidmasksubway-1200x630-1.png,N,,2025-09-03 17:57:59.340408

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In a Tuesday decision a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and National Guard units to Southern California, where they assisted with immigration and other arrests, was illegal.

In May, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give more financial incentives to state and local police to cooperate with ICE, including reimbursement for salary and benefits for officers trained in the 287(g) program to assist ICE in making arrests, and “performance awards” for “successful location of illegal aliens.”

“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan said in a statement.

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., decried ""out of control"" violence in the nation’s capital city and revealed that she was assaulted by a gang of youths in the streets of Washington, D.C., before the Trump administration’s takeover.

Speaking with reporters outside the Capitol building during a Republican Study Committee (RSC) press conference on Tuesday, Fedorchak, who is the sole member of the House of Representatives from North Dakota, agreed with her fellow Republicans that congressional action is needed to help keep D.C. safe.

She said she herself was attacked in broad daylight in D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood, which is located just a few minutes’ drive from the Capitol and is a popular neighborhood for members of Congress and staffers. The neighborhood is also home to the Nationals' baseball stadium.

""D.C. is a beautiful city. It's an amazing city, and it's the best capital in the world. But it isn't safe. We all know this,"" said Fedorchak. ""Crime in our nation's capital is out of control. If D.C. were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country.""

""In fact, I felt this myself recently in a small way,"" she continued. ""I was walking down the street in July and near my apartment in Navy Yard, not very far from home, and I felt something hard hit me in the in the back of my head. It was broad daylight. I was very startled. I was on the phone at the time, and just as that happened, a pack of juveniles came rushing by on their bikes and I turned to look around and see what had happened. And a large, hard plastic object had been thrown directly at my head.""

""Now that was a small, minor incident. I wasn't harmed, but the young people who did it, did it with reckless abandon and with zero fear of consequences,"" she said. ""They gathered in a circle not far from me after that and sat there and laughed.""

Fedorchak said this assault is just another example of ""how crime is out of control in this city, and there aren't any consequences.""

In August, President Donald Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control in response to rampant violent crime in the city. One of the reasons cited by the president was the epidemic of violent youth gangs terrorizing residents in the streets of D.C. In early August, a former DOGE staffer named Edward Coristine was violently assaulted by a group of D.C. youths and left bloodied in the street. Trump called the perpetrators ""thugs"" and vowed to exert his powers to federalize D.C.

Trump Praises Democratic Dc Mayor For Working With His Administration On Crime Crackdown

Fedorchak praised Trump’s crackdown in D.C. and agreed with other Republicans present that more action is needed from Congress to help the president restore order to the city.

""America is the greatest country in the world. There's no reason why our capital should have a violent crime rate higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world,"" she said.

""Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have falsely claimed that D.C. crime stats are at a 30-year low. But let's remember that crime is not just about statistics. It's about people.""

She pointed to the recent killing of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in northwest D.C. in June.

""It's about the mother who sent her child here to intern in one of our offices this summer, never to see him again. It's about all the families who suffer from crime in this very city. It's about the Metropolitan Police Union, who agrees that they are stretched too thin and don't have the resources to take care of crime in this city, and to provide a safe environment. It's about staffers, interns, families and visitors who live with the daily reality of coming to a city that isn't safe.""

Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., whose office Tarpinian-Jachym was interning with when he was killed, also weighed in during the press conference, calling the murder ""a senseless crime.""

""To this day, it's not been solved by the Washington, D.C., police … That's why I applaud President Trump and the work that he's doing in terms of making sure that we do have a safe capital,"" he said.

Trump Declares Dc A 'Crime Free Zone' Amid His Federal Crackdown

""Yesterday, I was able to walk around the Navy Yard with my daughter, and it was great to see the National Guard out there patrolling around,"" he said. ""It was a safe environment for people to hang out. It was nice. There was a family there having a birthday party for one of their children.""

During the press conference, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., announced that Congress would be asserting greater control over D.C. to ensure the city remains safe for residents and visitors.

""In 1973, Congress granted D.C. limited home rule authority through the District of Columbia Self-Government Reorganization Act, also called the Home Rule Act. In the Home Rule Act, Congress reserves the right at any time to exercise its constitutional authority as the legislature for the district, which includes the right to review and block local legislation before it takes effect. It has now become necessary for Congress to exercise such authority,"" she said.

""Why? Because the D.C. city council is seeking to exercise its authority not for the best interests of its citizens or the broader community, but for political purposes,"" she continued. ""For years now, the D.C. city council has not only prioritized left-wing policies and programs but intentionally sought to hide their activities from Congress. It is a new day in D.C., however, and Congress intends to once again assert its authority to ensure that Washington, D.C., rightfully reflects and represents this great nation on the national and international stage.""

RSC Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, stated, ""Now, Congress must take the next step and use our Article One powers.""

Sen. Marsha Blackburn Criticizes Democrats Who Make ‘Villains Out Of Law Enforcement’

""We cannot and will not allow D.C. to fall into a hellscape again when the local government fails,"" he added. ""It's our constitutional duty to act. Congress has a clear constitutional authority over D.C., and we will use it without hesitation to continue making D.C. safe and great again.""

In a separate press conference taking place elsewhere at the Capitol at the same time, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also commented on Trump’s D.C. crackdown. He downplayed the crackdown’s success, claiming that ""every single area of criminal activity"" was ""on the way down prior to the arrival of the National Guard.""

Jeffries suggested the crackdown was ""probably the result of Donald Trump trying to figure out a way to change the topic, given his deep unpopularity.""

As the Trump administration continues to pledge to target the worst of the worst criminals in its immigration crackdown, many others are getting caught up in that crackdown.

Last month, 28-year-old community organizer Catalina ""Xochitl"" Santiago was detained by Customs and Border Protection. Despite living legally in the U.S. for years under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, she remains in ICE detention in Texas today.

I spoke with her wife, Desiree Miller, a few days ago.

Desiree Miller, welcome to the ""News Hour."" Thank you for joining us.

Desiree Miller, Wife of Catalina ""Xochitl"" Santiago: Hi. Thank you for having me.

Desiree Miller:

Yes, thank you for that question.

I'm able to speak to her every day. So, we usually talk every morning. And, obviously, there's some really concerning things that she's told me about the conditions inside of the detention.

I think some of the main ones are that people don't receive the medical attention that they need. In particular, there are some pregnant women who don't get medical attention. And a lot of the times, when people ask for medical attention, they're just given water. The water smells weird in there. They have been given food multiple times that it's either expired or makes people sick.

There's a lot of talk about whether or not the conditions are humane or not, but I think that there's no way to make that situation humane when you have ripped someone away from their family.

All of these things that they do to make it seem as if it's humane, letting people talk to their families, having video calls and having these — quote, unquote — ""mental health checkups,"" I think that no mental health checkup is going to make up for the amount of trauma that has been inflicted by being ripped away from their families and trying and having my wife and other people — trying to deport them without cause.

Desiree Miller:

It's a really difficult experience.

I think that knowing also that a lot of times the conditions that she's in, that she's not able to sleep well because they have the lights on all night and the guards are very loud and walk very loudly throughout the whole night, so that they're not able to sleep, it's really hard for me to be out here trying to go about my day, because I still have to take care of her stuff and I still have to work while I'm also trying to just live with this fact that she's in their suffering.

Desiree Miller:

On that day, August 3, she sent me a video of that officer questioning her, the one that is now all over social media, and told me that they had taken her DACA card and were refusing to give it back.

So, after that, I was obviously very concerned. I was texting her and calling her, and I didn't get any response after that. So, for several hours, I didn't know where she was, if something had happened to her, if everything was fine and she was just on the plane, until around 8:30.

One of our friends here received a call from her, and she let our friend know where she was being detained. And that's how we found out where she was at.

Amna Nawaz:

We should underscore here, she's 28 years old. She has valid DACA status, right? She's renewed that several times over the years, which does require verification and background checks and the like.

We did ask DHS about her case. They gave us a statement in which they called her a criminal illegal alien and they also said this in part — quote — ""Her criminal history includes charges for trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia. She will remain in ICE custody pending her removal proceedings.""

So, Desiree, I just want to get your response to that. And, also, is it your understanding that these charges that they reference in the statement, that is the basis for her arrest and potential deportation?

Desiree Miller:

So, DHS in that statement and since then has blatantly lied to try and justify the fact that they are detaining her unlawfully. Her legal team has confirmed multiple times that she has not been convicted of any crime that would cause her to lose her DACA status, nor are there any pending criminal charges against her.

She to this day holds a valid work permit that allows her to work and travel within the United States legally. So, DHS and I don't have any legal basis for why they detained her, why they are holding her or why they are trying to initiate deportation proceedings.

And I think it should be very concerning to everyone that ICE is knowingly holding someone who has protection from deportation under DACA and is claiming that their DACA status doesn't matter.

Amna Nawaz:

You know, the administration, as you have probably seen regularly, puts out information about who they're taking into immigration custody, who they're working to deport. Violent criminals are usually who they highlight in those messages.

And there are absolutely violent convicted criminals among those they're working to deport. That they continuously say that they are working and targeting the worst of the worst, what does that mean to you? What's your reaction to that?

Desiree Miller:

There's a lot. There's a lot of — a lot going on inside me to hear that.

Xochitl is really an example of how they are using this language of calling people criminals, illegal aliens as a way to distract from what the reality is of what they're doing, which is that these are people who they are taking and detaining and trying to deport their people's wives, brothers, sisters, mothers, grandparents.

I think Xochitl is really an example of that, in that she has dedicated her entire life to improving her community in so many different ways, to — to protect people who have immigrated to this country. And now she works in our community.

Desiree Miller:

I'm definitely not an illegal expert. I'm just Xochitl's spouse, who's obviously trying to understand all of this that is national policy unfolding within our daily lives.

I think that we are fully anticipating her to come home to her family, to her community, where she belongs. I think it's horrible that my wife has been used as an example, but I hope that it helps bring light to the reality of what is happening and the dangers that we are facing in this administration.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/Detained-1024x680.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:58:23.972638

The workshop was hosted on Zoom by two women living in a state with an abortion ban, tailored for attendees who also live in ​“red” states that restrict abortion to varying degrees, and covering the medical basics about how to self-manage a medication abortion. The majority of the training, however, focused on how participants could pass the lessons along — educating other people about those medical basics, the practical realities of what to expect during a first-trimester medication abortion, how to recognize the signs of problems and, importantly, how to do all this while remaining within the law.

The last part required some role-playing for participants to practice staying within the boundaries of ​“sharing information” without crossing over into anything that could potentially be prosecuted as giving medical advice. At the end, at least a dozen people in states with abortion bans were ready to share information about how to self-manage a medication abortion and to offer emotional as well as informational support to someone through the process.

In addition to everything else this workshop represented, it was also an example of solidarity-based action. We learned a practice, based in the assumption of shared fate, that our own bodily autonomy cannot be separated from the autonomy of others and therefore we need to work together to protect basic self-determination. The ideas of shared fate and shared responsibility lie at the core of solidarity, and present a fundamental challenge to fascism’s emphasis on enemies, on scapegoating the vulnerable for society’s ills and convincing followers that they will be safe from the violence inflicted on others.

In the United States, the word ​“solidarity” has long been associated with labor organizing, but more generally it refers to unity and a sense of common destiny, as expressed in the slogan of a union founded by socialists, the IWW, ​“an injury to one is an injury to all.” In its early use within labor organizing, solidarity was about shared struggle among industrial workers, but more recently it has been used to recognize interconnection across difference.

The ideas of shared fate and shared responsibility lie at the core of solidarity, and present a fundamental challenge to fascism’s emphasis on enemies, scapegoating the vulnerable and convincing followers they will be safe from the violence inflicted on others.

For example, in 2011, Occupy Wall Street invoked cross-class solidarity among the 99% in opposition to policies that favor the wealthiest 1% of society. Both the first and second waves of Black Lives Matter organizing — in 2013 after the murder of Trayvon Martin and again in 2020 in response to the murder of George Floyd — called for interracial solidarity to challenge racist brutality. The Palestine Solidarity movement, as its name suggests, expands the call to the international level, uniting activists across borders and continents to support the human rights of a globally marginalized population.

Loosely speaking, actions based in solidarity involve standing with others in the face of oppression, understanding it as a threat to everyone regardless of who is the immediate target, and sharing resources or practical assistance with those most affected. Examples include union strike funds that pool resources to get through an extended work stoppage, the mutual aid groups that emerged during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, or, less personally, boycotts and divestment. The public health strategy of calling for everyone to stay home before vaccines were available for COVID-19 also reflected a solidarity-based understanding of society, which helps explain why it became a focal point for right-wing outrage.

Solidarity-based abortion activism takes multiple forms, all of which involve active support for someone who is seeking an abortion in ways that fully respect their autonomy. In the 21st century, abortion funds are probably the most visible and longstanding form of solidarity-based abortion work in the United States, offering diverse forms of support that can include driving someone significant distances or providing childcare or a couch to sleep on, as well as financial assistance with hotels, other travel expenses and the abortion itself. The model used by abortion funds draws more on the principles of mutual aid than charity, centering horizontal relationships and mutual respect, locating the work in the realm of solidarity more than service.

Feminist networks that support and enable self-managed medication abortions are another form of solidarity-based abortion activism that has long existed across the Global South, and one which has been increasingly important in the United States since the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. While it’s difficult to measure something that takes place outside of institutional systems, self-managed medication abortion appears to have increased significantly since Dobbs, especially among those facing significant barriers to care and even more so if telehealth is included. People who self-managed an abortion in the six months following Dobbs were more likely to report getting pills through community networks — including grassroots collectives, abortion providers working outside formal medical systems and people trained through Zoom workshops like the one I joined — than through telehealth or online vendors. That in itself provides statistical evidence of the importance of solidarity-based abortion activism.

These actions directly undermine the dynamics of fascism, including the manifestation we know as the Trump administration, in multiple ways. The scapegoating and dehumanization exemplified by the Trump administration’s relentless legal and social assaults on immigrants, are essential elements of fascist authoritarianism, as is enforcement of traditional binary gender structures. Attacking the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people has been central to the MAGA agenda, as can be seen in abortion bans, restrictions on access to care and legal recognition for transgender people and the policy plans in Project 2025 that guide the Trump administration’s destruction of public health, social services, and civil rights. When routine abortions or care for transgender youth become criminal events — as they now have in almost half the country — and masked agents raid workplaces and seize people at immigration courts, then the act of standing together becomes a profound affirmation of shared humanity.

Solidarity-based actions undermine each of those essential elements of fascism, not least by enabling self-determination for those who have been classified as unworthy or dangerous. The criminalization and scapegoating of marginalized populations and people in marginalized situations require isolation, dehumanization and fear in order to function; when autonomy and self-determination are regained through collective action, this intrinsically challenges the power and authority of fascist systems.

The criminalization of human beings and ordinary life situations — abortions, medical care, court hearings — transforms neighbors and coworkers into strangers and potential threats to society. These forms of repression locate ordinary people as guilty — ​“the worst of the worst” in Trump’s words — and as enemies who deserve to be abused rather than ordinary people who deserve respect.

Solidarity-based actions destabilize those processes through affirming connection and shared fate across difference in the face of assault from the state. Holding that ​“a threat to one is a threat to all” directly contradicts the divisions, fear and scapegoating at the heart of Trump and other fascist regimes.

When routine abortions or care for transgender youth become criminal events—as they now have in almost half the country—and masked agents raid workplaces and seize people at immigration courts, then the act of standing together becomes a profound affirmation of shared humanity.

The power of solidarity-based activism can be seen in the measures taken to repress and prevent it. States have criminalized practical support for people who need abortions or for trans youth, even trying to prosecute parents who support their trans children as child abusers. When a wave of ICE raids in Los Angeles was met this June with sustained community resistance, the Trump administration responded by mobilizing the National Guard and Marines to ​“protect” ICE agents. The relentless repression of Students for Justice in Palestine — including by the Trump administration, which used crackdowns on student protesters as a tool for attacking universities — highlights the powerful challenge that international solidarity with Palestine poses to a politics built on casting entire populations as threats.

The underlying power of solidarity comes precisely from centering interconnection over division, cooperation over competition and a commitment to our common humanity over fear. Movements built on solidarity envision social systems anchored in the core understanding that we have a shared fate, that our ability to thrive is interdependent.

This is why it has the power to fundamentally disrupt systems based in fear, isolation and scapegoating, and rooted in models of competition and scarcity. The far Right and the 1% understand that solidarity is a fundamental threat to their regime and way of life; it’s time for the rest of us to recognize the same — and mobilize our shared power.",https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/in-these-times/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2226525613.jpg?mtime=1756831317,N,,2025-09-03 15:57:48.232615

In short, the administration envisions dramatically less development spending in the near future.","Official word came Friday that the administration would pursue a pocket rescission of $4.9 billion in international assistance funding. The move sets the stage for a larger fight over Congress’s constitutional power of the purse. Here’s a quick rundown on why and what the rescissions mean for US development policy.

What’s a pocket rescission?

Under the process outlined in the Budget and Impoundment Control Act, to legally cancel previously appropriated funds, the White House submits a proposal to Capitol Hill, starting a 45-day clock. During the 45-day window, Congress must act affirmatively, passing legislation to codify the rescissions—though such measures receive expedited consideration and require only simple majority votes in both chambers. If Congress fails to act within 45 days, the administration is required to spend the appropriated funds as originally intended. The administration’s current approach is considered a “pocket rescission” because the funding it’s asking Congress to cancel is set to expire at the end of September—within the 45-day window. By freezing that funding now, the administration all but ensures the money won’t be spent regardless of whether Congress acts, since the funds will expire before the review period ends. The Government Accountability Office has declared pocket rescissions illegal, but the director of the Office of Management and Budget has made no secret of his desire to challenge impoundment restrictions. And recent revisions to OMB guidance appear to assert expansive executive authority to reclaim previously appropriated funding.

The administration’s action appears highly likely to trigger litigation—and is sure to complicate the FY26 appropriations process in the meantime.

What does this mean for foreign aid?

It’s worth putting these additional cuts into context. Since January, the administration has taken a host of actions to constrain the US role in advancing global development, from dismantling USAID and other small agencies to terminating thousands of awards supporting development and humanitarian programming. But because of Congress’s constitutionally strong hand in the budget and appropriations process, permanently cancelling funding is a taller order. Still, the administration has sought to curb spending in several ways.

The administration’s FY26 budget request revealed plans to scale back foreign assistance dramatically. But even predating the release of the president’s budget, the administration opted to designate emergency funding in the FY2025 appropriations measure only selectively—drawing bipartisan criticism from top Senate appropriators—effectively signaling it would not spend $2.5 billion appropriated by Congress for international assistance. Next, of course, came the high-profile rescissions package submitted in late May, which included more than $8 billion in foreign aid cuts. Congress narrowly approved the bulk of the proposed rescissions, and it was signed into law in late July. The dynamics over multiple fiscal years are important because a lot of foreign aid funding takes a while to get out the door, owing to a raft of requirements from congressional sign-off and agency procurement rules. So very often, federal departments and agencies are in the position of spending down funding from the prior fiscal year.

The proposed rescissions unveiled late last week target largely older funding from a limited set of accounts, with Development Assistance—the bilateral economic assistance funding previously managed by USAID—comprising the largest share.

While we focus here on Development Assistance, other accounts would also see significant haircuts, including another $1.5 billion appropriated in FY25 funding for Contributions to International Organizations, which supports US commitments to several UN agencies, and much of the recent funding appropriated for democracy promotion activities, and hundreds of millions of dollars across accounts to fund assessed and voluntary contributions to international peacekeeping activities.

What is Development Assistance, and what happens next?

Historically, Development Assistance (DA) represented one of USAID’s most flexible accounts, thanks to its broad mandate—though it has regularly been subject to a host of congressional spending directives. Among the development priorities consistently funded through DA have been investments in education, agricultural development, and energy access. And while administration officials have called attention to specific projects they considered wasteful or fundamentally unaligned with administration goals, those awards have already been cancelled—along with life-saving programming.

Congressional spending bills dictate the terms of the availability of provided funding. DA funding is most often provided for a two-year window, but for various reasons, funds can remain in play for longer.

As our colleague Charles Kenny pointed out in a post published last Thursday, there had been many lingering questions about whether the Department of State has the interest or capacity to continue foreign aid delivery at the scale suggested by available funding. To better understand the implications for DA funding as a whole, we’ve done our best to piece things together based on data published by OMB (which was last updated in July) and both rescission proposals.

In short, the administration envisions dramatically less development spending in the near future. A looming question is whether the White House will see a challenge to that vision from Capitol Hill. House appropriators recently advanced a development and diplomacy spending bill that sought cuts that, while quite deep, were not nearly as aggressive as the administration proposed. Likewise, lawmakers don’t seem ready to throw in the towel when it comes to development programming as a whole—specifying a desire to see continued investment in agriculture, education, and even women’s economic empowerment abroad. Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations Committee has signaled plans to move ahead with its own bill markup in the coming weeks.

While the fate of ongoing spending debates remains uncertain, the administration’s continued willingness to circumvent the standard appropriations processes signals the potential for a broader shift in how development policy is executed, regardless of Congress’s intent.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/pocket-rescission-blog-collinson-estes.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:57:50.359660

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., decried ""out of control"" violence in the nation’s capital city and revealed that she was assaulted by a gang of youths in the streets of Washington, D.C., before the Trump administration’s takeover.

Speaking with reporters outside the Capitol building during a Republican Study Committee (RSC) press conference on Tuesday, Fedorchak, who is the sole member of the House of Representatives from North Dakota, agreed with her fellow Republicans that congressional action is needed to help keep D.C. safe.

She said she herself was attacked in broad daylight in D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood, which is located just a few minutes’ drive from the Capitol and is a popular neighborhood for members of Congress and staffers. The neighborhood is also home to the Nationals' baseball stadium.

""D.C. is a beautiful city. It's an amazing city, and it's the best capital in the world. But it isn't safe. We all know this,"" said Fedorchak. ""Crime in our nation's capital is out of control. If D.C. were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country.""

SENATE AIDE WHO SURVIVED BRUTAL DC STABBING SAYS CRIME FIGHT 'WORTHWHILE'

""In fact, I felt this myself recently in a small way,"" she continued. ""I was walking down the street in July and near my apartment in Navy Yard, not very far from home, and I felt something hard hit me in the in the back of my head. It was broad daylight. I was very startled. I was on the phone at the time, and just as that happened, a pack of juveniles came rushing by on their bikes and I turned to look around and see what had happened. And a large, hard plastic object had been thrown directly at my head.""

""Now that was a small, minor incident. I wasn't harmed, but the young people who did it, did it with reckless abandon and with zero fear of consequences,"" she said. ""They gathered in a circle not far from me after that and sat there and laughed.""

Fedorchak said this assault is just another example of ""how crime is out of control in this city, and there aren't any consequences.""

In August, President Donald Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control in response to rampant violent crime in the city. One of the reasons cited by the president was the epidemic of violent youth gangs terrorizing residents in the streets of D.C. In early August, a former DOGE staffer named Edward Coristine was violently assaulted by a group of D.C. youths and left bloodied in the street. Trump called the perpetrators ""thugs"" and vowed to exert his powers to federalize D.C.

TRUMP PRAISES DEMOCRATIC DC MAYOR FOR WORKING WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION ON CRIME CRACKDOWN

Fedorchak praised Trump’s crackdown in D.C. and agreed with other Republicans present that more action is needed from Congress to help the president restore order to the city.

""America is the greatest country in the world. There's no reason why our capital should have a violent crime rate higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world,"" she said.

""Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have falsely claimed that D.C. crime stats are at a 30-year low. But let's remember that crime is not just about statistics. It's about people.""

She pointed to the recent killing of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in northwest D.C. in June.

""It's about the mother who sent her child here to intern in one of our offices this summer, never to see him again. It's about all the families who suffer from crime in this very city. It's about the Metropolitan Police Union, who agrees that they are stretched too thin and don't have the resources to take care of crime in this city, and to provide a safe environment. It's about staffers, interns, families and visitors who live with the daily reality of coming to a city that isn't safe.""

Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., whose office Tarpinian-Jachym was interning with when he was killed, also weighed in during the press conference, calling the murder ""a senseless crime.""

""To this day, it's not been solved by the Washington, D.C., police … That's why I applaud President Trump and the work that he's doing in terms of making sure that we do have a safe capital,"" he said.

TRUMP DECLARES DC A 'CRIME FREE ZONE' AMID HIS FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

""Yesterday, I was able to walk around the Navy Yard with my daughter, and it was great to see the National Guard out there patrolling around,"" he said. ""It was a safe environment for people to hang out. It was nice. There was a family there having a birthday party for one of their children.""

During the press conference, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., announced that Congress would be asserting greater control over D.C. to ensure the city remains safe for residents and visitors.

""In 1973, Congress granted D.C. limited home rule authority through the District of Columbia Self-Government Reorganization Act, also called the Home Rule Act. In the Home Rule Act, Congress reserves the right at any time to exercise its constitutional authority as the legislature for the district, which includes the right to review and block local legislation before it takes effect. It has now become necessary for Congress to exercise such authority,"" she said.

""Why? Because the D.C. city council is seeking to exercise its authority not for the best interests of its citizens or the broader community, but for political purposes,"" she continued. ""For years now, the D.C. city council has not only prioritized left-wing policies and programs but intentionally sought to hide their activities from Congress. It is a new day in D.C., however, and Congress intends to once again assert its authority to ensure that Washington, D.C., rightfully reflects and represents this great nation on the national and international stage.""

RSC Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, stated, ""Now, Congress must take the next step and use our Article One powers.""

SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN CRITICIZES DEMOCRATS WHO MAKE ‘VILLAINS OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT’

""We cannot and will not allow D.C. to fall into a hellscape again when the local government fails,"" he added. ""It's our constitutional duty to act. Congress has a clear constitutional authority over D.C., and we will use it without hesitation to continue making D.C. safe and great again.""

In a separate press conference taking place elsewhere at the Capitol at the same time, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also commented on Trump’s D.C. crackdown. He downplayed the crackdown’s success, claiming that ""every single area of criminal activity"" was ""on the way down prior to the arrival of the National Guard.""

Jeffries suggested the crackdown was ""probably the result of Donald Trump trying to figure out a way to change the topic, given his deep unpopularity.""

Noem: “Actions like this one, targeting DACA holders who are lawfully in the United States, and who have committed no crime, help explain why a majority of the American public disapproves of the Trump Administration’s track record on immigration”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) led 38 Senate Democrats in pressing U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem on the Trump Administration’s wrongful targeting of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients in its cruel mass deportation scheme.

The Senators cited a troubling statement from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in which she said, “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.” The Senators made clear that McLaughlin’s statement is contradicted by public DHS guidance.

“DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements,” wrote the Senators. “In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are ‘not considered to be unlawfully present’ in the United States and that ‘[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.’”

“We urge you to correct Assistant Secretary McLaughlin’s statement to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward,” continued the Senators. “Recent enforcement actions against DACA recipients not only appear to violate the Fifth Circuit stay, but also disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs.”

The Senators contrasted McLaughlin’s statement and the Administration’s actions regarding DACA with the overwhelming public support for Dreamers. They noted President Trump’s previously stated support for protections for Dreamers, and emphasized that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept in place protections for current DACA holders and limited to Texas a nationwide injunction on new DACA approvals.

In June, 41 Senators, including Senator Padilla, sent a letter to the Acting Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), urging the agency to resume processing new DACA applications, in line with the Fifth Circuit ruling. Instead, DHS has pushed DACA holders to “self-deport.” The Administration also recently detained a deaf and non-verbal DACA holder with no criminal history, wasting taxpayer dollars and undermining the Trump Administration’s pledge to target the “worst of the worst” violent criminals.

In addition to Padilla, Durbin, and Kelly, the letter was also signed by Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

Senator Padilla previously took to the Senate floor to defend DACA recipients from DHS’ baseless statement and slam the Trump Administration’s push for DACA recipients to “self-deport.” He emphasized that these long-term residents — who were brought to the country as children — have been working, studying, and living legally in the United States since 2012 and are vital members of American communities.

Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers, with a pathway to permanent legal residence. In July, Padilla hosted a press conference in Los Angeles alongside immigration advocates, impacted families, and community leaders to announce legislation to expand a pathway to lawful permanent residency for millions of long-term U.S. residents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and mass deportation assaults intensified in Los Angeles, Padilla marked the 13th anniversary of the DACA policy by urging Congress to take immediate action to deliver permanent protections for millions of families, parents, and individuals who are increasingly at risk amid President Trump’s mass deportation agenda. He also delivered remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the anniversary, pushing for permanent protections for Dreamers rather than the indiscriminate ICE raids stoking fear in Los Angeles communities.

Full text of the letter to Secretary Noem is available here and below:

Dear Secretary Noem:

In a recent statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: “Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation.” In fact, DACA was created to provide protections from immigration enforcement for certain noncitizens brought to the United States as children, also known as Dreamers, who undergo strict background checks and meet specific educational or work requirements. In contrast to Ms. McLaughlin’s puzzling statement, public DHS guidance makes clear that DACA holders are “not considered to be unlawfully present” in the United States and that “[a]n individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.”

Americans overwhelmingly support providing Dreamers a path to citizenship, and in December 2024, then-President-elect Trump stated that he supported protections for Dreamers to remain in the United States. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals kept in place a stay that protects current DACA holders and limited a nationwide injunction on new DACA approvals to the state of Texas. In June, 41 Senators sent United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) a letter requesting that USCIS begin processing new DACA applications, consistent with these decisions.

Instead of doing so, DHS has issued a statement urging DACA holders—who know no home but the United States—to “self-deport.” It was also disturbing to see DHS recently waste taxpayer dollars on the prolonged detention of a deaf and non-verbal DACA holder with no criminal history, contrary to your claims that the Trump Administration is arresting the “worst of the worst.”

Actions like this one, targeting DACA holders who are lawfully in the United States, and who have committed no crime, help explain why a majority of the American public disapproves of the Trump Administration’s track record on immigration.

Please respond to the following questions no later than September 17, 2025:

1. How many active DACA recipients have been detained or deported by DHS since January 2025? Provide a complete record for each DACA recipient, including locations, dates, and case outcomes.

2. On what legal authority does DHS rely to detain or remove individuals with current DACA protections?

3. How is DHS verifying the DACA or legal status of individuals at the time of detention, prior to initiating removal proceedings or deportation?

4. In the instances where DHS ascertains it has erroneously detained or deported an individual, especially if they have a form of legal protection such as DACA, what actions is the Department taking to remedy these situations?

5. What actions are DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) taking to address any errors regarding current DACA recipients and ensure they do not continue to take place as part of the current Trump administration’s immigration enforcement activities?

6. Has DHS shifted its policy regarding these young people despite President Trump declaring his support for protecting Dreamers and DACA recipients?

We urge you to correct Assistant Secretary McLaughlin’s statement to accurately reflect DACA and ensure that DHS recognizes and abides by the protections of DACA moving forward. Recent enforcement actions against DACA recipients not only appear to violate the Fifth Circuit stay, but also disrupt families, harm communities, and inflict unnecessary social, emotional, and economic costs.

“The operation is expected to kick off in Chicago by this Friday and could involve agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially be backed by guard forces in a peacekeeping role, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning,” CNN reported on Tuesday.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) said on Sunday that no one from the Trump administration had contacted him or anyone in his office about the alleged plans.

“So, it’s clear that in secret they’re planning this — well, it’s an invasion with U.S. troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker said, per CNN.

Last week, CBS News reported that federal officers will use tactics in Chicago that are similar to those used in Los Angeles, which “included armored vehicles, tactical gear and weaponry.”

In June, the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant raids in Los Angeles prompted mass demonstrations across the city. Despite California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s opposition, Trump sent in thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines to crush the protests. Today, a federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of troops in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the president from using the military to carry out domestic law enforcement activities.

Separately, the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to send federal officers into Chicago and other cities under the pretense of fighting crime, just as it did last month in Washington, D.C. In order to justify his authoritarian tactics, Trump has misrepresented the prevalence of violent crime in D.C. and Chicago, both of which have reported record-low crime rates.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) cooperated with the Trump administration as it deployed federal officers and troops in her city, earning praise from the president and ire from her constituents. Unlike Bowser, Illinois’s elected officials have fought back. In a September 1 post on Truth Social, Trump condemned the opposition from Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D), and others, claiming that D.C. is now a “CRIME FREE ZONE.”

“Wouldn’t it be nice to say that about Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and even the Crime Drenched City of Baltimore???” he continued. “It can happen, and it can happen FAST! Work with us!!!”

On August 30, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order “to protect the Constitutional rights of Chicagoans amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government into Chicago,” the mayor’s office said in a press release, noting that violent crime had decreased in the city.

“With this executive order, we send a resounding message to the federal government: we do not need nor want an unconstitutional and illegal military occupation of our city,” Johnson said in a statement. “We do not want military checkpoints or armored vehicles on our streets and we do not want to see families ripped apart.”

City residents have also been preparing for a possible military occupation. Kelly Hayes, co-host of Truthout’s podcast “Movement Memos,” recently reported on a gathering of dozens of activists in Chicago who met to discuss how best to protect their communities.

“Trump’s Pentagon is drafting plans for a military invasion of Chicago,” Hayes wrote in Organizing My Thoughts. “The people most at risk — unhoused people, trans folks, Black and brown people, disabled people, and immigrants — need more than our fear and indignation. They need robust networks of care and defense in every corner of our beloved city.”

Riverton leaders announced Friday that the Riverton Police Department had entered into a formal accord with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to jointly pursue immigrants in the country illegally. The department joins several other sheriff's offices across Utah and the Utah Department of Corrections in entering into what federal authorities refer to as 287(g) agreements.

Like representatives from other agencies entering into 287(g) accords, Riverton authorities touted the agreement as a way to assure public safety and better fight crime.

""It allows federal immigration authorities and our local law enforcement team to work side-by-side to locate and remove criminal offenders who threaten public safety. By putting federal resources to work here in Riverton, we can better protect our residents, uphold the rule of law and keep our neighborhoods safe from criminal activity,"" reads a joint statement issued Friday by Mayor Trent Staggs and Police Chief Shane Taylor.

No one from Riverton was available on Tuesday to respond to follow-up questions from KSL.com regarding the arrangement.

An ACLU of Utah rep, however, said Tuesday that the rising number of such accords is worrisome to the organization, in part because they could deter some people, particularly immigrants, from seeking help from law enforcement authorities. The link between local law enforcement and immigration officials could spur worries among some immigrants that interacting with police officers or sheriff's deputies could put them on the radar screen of federal immigration agents.

""The 287(g) agreements let the federal government turn local law enforcement into immigration agents, leading to potential discrimination and civil rights violations,"" said Aaron Welcher, spokesman for the Utah civil rights organization. ""This isn't public safety. It makes people afraid to call for help, report crimes or cooperate with law enforcement.""

The growing number of local law enforcement agencies entering into formal agreements with immigration officials has been a point of increasing concern for Utah ACLU officials. Late last month, the organization launched a petition drive to drum up opposition to them. ""These agreements turn local officers into Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, fueling deportations, racial profiling and fear in immigrant communities,"" reads the petition.

Welcher said he's heard particular concern from immigrant advocacy groups in Utah about the impact of the increased cooperation on those experiencing domestic violence. Some facing domestic abuse, he said, ""are afraid to call for help because it could lead to them being detained or deported.""

Utah County leaders' decision last July to formalize a 287(g) agreement between the Utah County Sheriff's Office and ICE sparked intense backlash from some. However, with fighting immigration a priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, other accords involving the sheriff's offices in Cache, Washington and Weber counties, among others, have sparked little to no public clamoring.

As described by proponents, 287(g) agreements facilitate communication with immigration authorities, enabling local law enforcement to determine whether suspects they are dealing with are in the country illegally or face deportation. Local law enforcement officials receive training in accessing federal immigration records and working with federal authorities, aiding with efforts at jails and in the field to identify immigrants in the country illegally.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau's five-year American Community Survey estimates for 2023, 2,314 of Riverton's 44,944 residents were foreign-born. Of those 2,314, 1,049 were naturalized citizens and 1,265 were of some other unspecified migratory status. The 1,265 — 2.8% of Riverton's population — can include immigrants in the country illegally, legal permanent residents, people here on student visas, asylum-seekers and others.",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3108/310841/31084104.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-09-03 15:57:52.039582

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday confirmed its deportation operations would ramp up in Chicago and other major U.S. cities in the coming weeks. When the new fiscal year kicks in October 1, Immigration Customs and Enforcement can begin tapping billions in new funds from President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. With the agency seeking to hire 10,000 new agents, Americans can expect more violent raids snatching their neighbors off the streets.

The epicenter of America’s anti-immigrant campaign has been Los Angeles and its surrounding cities, where thousands have been arrested since June. Almost every day this summer, federal agents from ICE and U.S. Border Patrol have stalked Home Depot parking lots, car washes, and immigrant communities across Southern California, detaining people based on ethnicity or language.

But as the Trump administration’s war on immigrants expands, so does the resistance against it.

“It’s important that they break LA,” said Ron Gochez, a high school history teacher and leading member of the LA-based grassroots group Unión Del Barrio. “If they break LA, they can break any community in this country.”

Gochez and Unión Del Barrio are a part of the Community Self-Defense Coalition, a network of dozens of grassroots groups. The network conducts daily street patrols to warn their neighbors of possible ICE activity.

Filmmaker Brandon Tauszik embedded with Gochez and other members of Unión Del Barrio throughout the summer for The Intercept. In the documentary film “A City Fights Back: How LA Defends Itself Against ICE,” activists show a multifaceted strategy of opposition. They drive the streets in search of federal agents, monitor highway off-ramps to flag suspicious cars entering their communities, organize protests, and recruit and train new members willing to combat ICE.

For Gochez, a high school teacher and a father, the stakes are increasingly personal.

On August 8, federal agents snatched up high school student Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, 18, while he was walking his dog in Van Nuys, days before he was set to begin his senior year at Reseda Charter High School. He remains in ICE detention at a privately owned facility 80 miles away in Adelanto, California. Days later, agents detained at gunpoint Nathan Mejia, 15, outside of Arleta High School before releasing him later that day.

Both Mejia and Guerrero-Cruz are students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where Gochez teaches. In the film, he reflects on how his fight is intertwined with that of the next generation.

“It’s a constant reminder why we struggle and why we do what we do,” he says, while playing with his son. “One day when we’re no longer here and he’ll be here, and maybe his children, they’ll have a better life than what we had and what our parents had — so we’re fighting for the next seven generations, and he’s next up.”

Asked by reporters in the Oval Office about sending National Guard troops to the nation’s third-largest city, Trump said, “We’re going in.""

“I have an obligation,” the president said. ”This isn’t a political thing.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, along with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other local leaders gave an update after Trump spoke, scoffing at the notion of sending military troops and federal agents into Chicago and reiterating that federal intervention was not required or wanted.

Trump has already sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles and Washington, where he’s also federalized the police force. He has said he plans similar moves in other Democrat-run cities even as a federal judge on Tuesday deemed the California deployment illegal.

But when exactly could federal troops, including the National Guard and Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) deploy in Chicago? Here's what we know right now.

ICE in Chicago, Illinois

The state received its first contact about federal intervention on Saturday when the head of the Illinois State Police got a call from Gregory Bovino, chief of the Border Patrol’s El Centro, California, sector, Pritzker said during Tuesday's update.

The comments come just hours after Pritzker confirmed to NBC Chicago’s Mary Ann Ahern that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.

""In the coming days, we expect to see what has played out in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., to happen here in Chicago,"" Pritzker said ""First, Donald Trump is positioning armed federal agents and staging military vehicles on federal property such as the Great Lakes Naval Base. It is likely those agents will be with ICE, Customs and Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security and other similarly situated federal agencies. Many of these individuals are being relocated from Los Angeles for deployment in Chicago. We believe that staging that has already begun started yesterday and continues into today.""

The governor warned that ""unidentifiable agents in unmarked vehicles with masks are planning to raid Latino communities and say they're targeting violent criminals,"" while noting that timing of such a deployment could be intentional.

""We have reason to believe that Stephen Miller chose the month of September to come to Chicago because of celebrations around Mexican Independence Day that happen here every year,"" Pritzker said. ""It breaks my heart to report that we have been told ICE will try and disrupt community picnics and peaceful parades. Let's be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here.""

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker said in an exclusive interview with NBC Chicago earlier Tuesday. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

A report from The New York Times said Homeland Security officials requested to use Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago for their operations, which would include space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

National Guard in Chicago, Illinois

While the deployment of the National Guard still has not been made official, Pritzker said he received reports that the Trump administration ""has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois,"" though sources in the Texas governor's office told NBC Chicago that is not accurate.

While no official announcement has been made, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send National Guard members to Chicago in similar fashion to the way they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.

Speaking in the Oval Office Tuesday, Trump said the decision to send in federal assets was not “a political thing,” but promised that intervention would soon occur in Chicago.

“We’re going in,” he said. “I didn’t say when, but we’re going in.”

A spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard also confirmed Tuesday ""we don't have an order for a mission in Chicago.""

Trump cited statistics on shootings in Chicago over the Labor Day weekend during his remarks, with eight people killed and 50 wounded in 37 different shooting incidents, according to Chicago police data.

The president claimed Chicago is less safe than Afghanistan, and described Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker as a “terrible governor,"" saying his refusal to ask the administration for help is making the city’s residents less safe.

""If the governor of Illinois would call me up, I would love to do it,” he said. “Now, we're going to do it anyway. We have a right to do it.”

Pritzker responded by saying, ""I refuse to play a reality game show with Donald Trump again.""

""When did we become a country where it's OK for the US president to insist on national television that a state should call him to beg for anything, especially something we don't want? Have we truly lost all sense of sanity in this nation that we treat this as normal?"" Pritzker said.

Is it legal?

Pritzker and other Illinois officials have argued the Trump administration does not have the right to send National Guard members to Chicago for law enforcement operations, with pledges to fight any such actions in court.

In California this week, a judge ruled that the Trump administration had violated the Posse Comitatus Act when it sent the National Guard into Los Angeles during June protests and unrest in the city. District Judge Charles Breyer cited the 19th century law, which nearly fully prohibits the use of military assets in a law enforcement capacity, and said the administration’s actions ran afoul of the law.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Trump's latest comments on Chicago were not enough confirmation to begin legal proceedings before operations begin, however.

""'We're going in' is not enough,"" Raoul said.

Pritzker urged residents to keep protests against potential deployments ""peaceful.""

""We know, before anything has happened here, that the Trump plan is to use any excuse to deploy armed military personnel to Chicago. If someone flings a sandwich at an ICE agent, Trump will try and go on TV and declare an emergency in Chicago,"" Pritzker said. ""I'm imploring everyone, if and when that happens, do not take the bait.""

Crime in Chicago

Johnson said violence in the city stems from guns on the streets that are trafficked to Illinois from neighboring states, including Republican-led Indiana.

“Chicago will continue to have a violence problem as long as red states continue to have a gun problem,” Johnson said.

Echoing a trend in other major U.S. cities, Chicago’s violent crime has dropped significantly overall, though it remains a persistent issue in parts of the city.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/pritzker-9-2-25.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:06.497797

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.
“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","President Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by the Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone. Over the Labor Day weekend it attempted to remove Guatemalan children who were living in shelters or with foster care families.

The July 9 memo regarding sponsors said they must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child younger than 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said that parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under the Biden administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden administration’s struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said that it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say that they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among the steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home to which children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/afab062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4463x2343+0+316/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F09%2F244d5063499b80bc2ab8bed59025%2F1e26f07da1cf4f909f336cf2b1b55be0.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:02.259889

Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.","This story was originally published by Stateline and is republished here by permission.

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.

Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.

Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.

Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.

The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.

“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”

Team was assigned to respond to Bear Gulch Fire near Olympic National Park

Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch Fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.

One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.

“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”

“I felt beyond betrayed. What they did was messed up.”

Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.

Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.

After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.

After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.

“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”

Time card discrepancies for firefighting crews may have lead to immigration status checks

In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.

Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.

“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”

After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.

The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.

Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.

A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.

Federal officials did not warn state agency about its investigation

The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.

“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.

Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.

The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.

Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.

One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.

The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.

“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”

Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.

“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.

On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.

“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”

“To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire.”

Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.

“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”

Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch Fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.

“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”

In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Omar Salazar was visiting his longtime girlfriend in Lubbock when he was stopped by a police officer for a traffic violation, his attorney Jacob Monty told KERA News. After Salazar provided the officer with his ID, an immigration official arrived and arrested Salazar on site.

As of Tuesday afternoon, he was being detained at the Blue Bonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, located approximately 200 miles west of Dallas.

""Imagine this, Omar ate breakfast in Lubbock, never expecting that he'd be facing the fight of his life Friday afternoon,"" Monty said. “Friday morning, he was just a normal resident of Texas enjoying the beginning of the long holiday weekend, and now he's fighting to stay in the country that he loves.”

Salazar came to the U.S. from Mexico with his family in 2008, but never gained legal status. Described as a leader by colleagues and friends, Salazar was valedictorian of his graduating class at Trini Garza Early College and is a graduate of Southern Methodist University, where he was a Hunt Scholar. He works in the AI industry.

Salazar has no criminal history and is not a flight risk, Monty said.

“This is a case that shows that in the administration's effort to go after the bad guys that no one's shedding a tear for,” he said. “The sweep is so broad that it's included people like Omar Salazar, who's an SMU grad who recently completed a certificate at UT on AI,” Monty said.

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to increase deportations, prioritizing people with violent criminal histories, but many of those who have been detained under his push have not been convicted of high-level crimes, an Associated Press analysis found.

Salazar’s first hearing is scheduled for October. Under a new immigration policy issued by the Department of Homeland Security in July, Salazar would potentially not be eligible for bond and would have to fight his deportation while in custody.

“That's kind of what led to this new wave of mandatory detention for a lot of people who previously would have been released on bond because they're not a danger to the community, because they are not a flight risk, because they haven't committed a crime,"" said Veronica Franco, one of the attorneys representing Salazar.

KERA reached out to ICE and has not received a response.

Monty said Salazar remains optimistic and is ""hopeful that common sense prevails.”

His attorney is representing him pro bono, but friends have organized a Free Omar Salazar Go Fund Me account to help cover other legal costs. So far, they have raised more than $40,000.

“The bonds he has created with leaders and neighbors alike are a testament to his character, and we are hopeful that those same leaders will raise their voices for him now, more than ever, and that you will join us,” wrote Luis Rodriguez, co-organizer of the Go Fund Me account.

Karma was critical of the impact of the changes, which she said would have a devastating impact on those affected, who had been led to believe they had a safe future in this country. “This idea of not being able to renew a visa is on a par with deportation because you are effectively saying someone cannot stay in the UK and this destroys lives,” she said.

She called for a change in the government’s approach to this visa route, suggesting one compromise could be a return to the “resident labour market test”, whereby sponsoring organisations had to show they could not recruit someone already in the UK. She was also very critical of changes meaning certain workers are now excluded from bringing family members:

Employers and organisations should have to show they have tried to recruit in the UK and then only bring people in if this has not been possible. It shouldn’t matter what the job is – if it’s needed we should be sponsoring it. We also need to end the two-tier system whereby some Skilled Workers can bring in their family members and others can’t. It’s creating a system in which some migrants will have no long-term commitment to the UK, or investment in their job.

The White House has responded to an appeals court ruling temporarily blocking it from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, and predicted it would ultimately prevail in the case.

“The authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President. President Trump exercised this lawful authority and employed the Alien Enemies Act to remove enemies of the United States, including vicious TdA gang members, from the country,"" said a statement from White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.

The 2-1 ruling last night by the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals granted a preliminary injunction blocking deportations under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798, finding the administration’s claim that members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang are part of a warlike invasion is not accurate.

It also sent the case back to a lower court for further proceedings.

The dissenting judge was Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee who said the president should not be second-guessed. ""Time and time and time again, the Supreme Court has instructed that the President’s declaration of an invasion, insurrection, or incursion is conclusive. Final,"" he wrote.

Jackson praised Oldham's ""careful review of this authority.""

Democrats confront limited options to block GOP’s spreading redistricting efforts

and

Missouri lawmakers are kicking off a special session on redistricting today, the latest effort by Republicans to create friendlier congressional districts for their party ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Democrats, like others in GOP-led states pursuing new maps mid-decade, are loudly opposing the move. But there’s little they can do to stop it.

Unlike in Texas, where Democrats were able to band together to grind the state House to a halt and delay redistricting attempts, Missouri Democrats lack the numbers needed to mount a similar quorum break. While two-thirds of the Texas Legislature must be in session to conduct business, Missouri’s quorum requirement is a simple majority of members. And Missouri Republicans have about a two-thirds majority in both legislative chambers.

Pfizer says Trump’s call for transparency is ‘welcomed’

After Trump demanded Monday that pharmaceutical companies release data pertaining to the success rates of their Covid “drugs,” Pfizer said today that it welcomed the president's call for transparency.

Pfizer was the only company Trump called out by name. Trump claimed that he had seen “extraordinary” information “from Pfizer, and others” that has never been released to the public.

During Trump’s first term, Pfizer had the first authorized Covid vaccine in the U.S. and developed Paxlovid, an antiviral medication used to treat mild to moderate Covid.

In its statement, Pfizer shared a link to its website, which shows press releases on published studies and safety and efficacy data on the Covid vaccine. It also noted that, to date, information on its Covid shot has appeared in more than 600 peer-reviewed journals. The company said it will post additional information and studies by the end of the month.

Vaccines must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which requires companies to submit data for review. During the pandemic, Pfizer’s data on the Covid vaccine was reviewed by both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which included public advisory committee meetings, before the shots were released to the public.

In the statement, the drugmaker said that “in the coming days,” it will share new data regarding its latest updated Covid vaccine, which it says the FDA approved after a “meticulous review by experienced medical and clinical experts.”

“President Trump’s call for transparency is welcomed, and we remain deeply committed to that principle,” the company said. “Transparency has always been a cornerstone of trust, and we are dedicated to continuing to provide clear, factual data to the public.”

Trump says his case on tariffs will be 'one of the most important' to go before the Supreme Court

Trump said in his Oval Office remarks this afternoon that the case challenging his tariffs will be ""one of the most important cases I’ve ever seen go before the Supreme Court of the U.S.""

""Tariffs are vital to our country, and just so you know, other countries use them on us, but I just used them a lot better,"" Trump said. ""We’re in a much better position. We have trillions of dollars coming into our country. If we didn’t have tariffs, we would be a very poor nation, and we would be taken advantage of by every other nation in the world, friend and foe.""

He continued, ""We have a very, very big case in the Supreme Court,"" and predicted he will have ""a big victory.""

Trump said yesterday that he will ask the Supreme Court to rule quickly in the case challenging his tariffs. A federal appeals court said late last week that Trump misused his authority by imposing the tariffs unilaterally, but the judge left them in effect as the case makes its way through the courts.

More than 90 arrested in D.C. overnight as part of Trump crackdown

and

Ninety-two people were arrested in Washington, D.C., overnight as a result of Trump's crime crackdown in the city, including two people who were wanted for homicide, a White House official said.

Further details on the operation were not provided, but the official said one person was arrested on a warrant in Ward 7 for homicide, and that the suspect had previously been convicted of two murders and sentenced to 36 years in prison. Another person was arrested on a warrant for first-degree murder, first-degree assault, the use of a firearm in a violent crime and second-degree assault, while a third was arrested on a warrant for attempted first-degree murder.

Among the 92 were also 40 undocumented immigrants, including some with prior criminal histories for attempted first-degree murder, burglary, assault and attempted second-degree murder. The official did not disclose how many of those arrested had criminal records or the status of their cases.

In all, there have 1,761 arrests since the operation was started Aug. 7, the official said.

Second big-name Republican jumps into the race to replace Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner filed to run for governor of Florida today, making him the second big-name Republican to jump into the race to replace term-limited Ron DeSantis.

“Many called it the two most conservative years in Florida history,” Renner said of his time as speaker from 2022 to 2024 in an interview yesterday. “I led a chamber of great men and women ... that made Florida what it is today.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is seen as the front-runner. Not only has he been endorsed by Trump and has been on the campaign trail for months, but he has also already socked away $25 million in campaign funds. Donalds announced his bid for governor in March.

Putin ready to meet Zelenskyy, if he comes to Moscow

Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that he was ready to hold talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy if the Ukrainian president came to Moscow, while casting doubt on whether such talks would be useful.

Zelenskyy has pressed to meet Putin, a summit backed by Trump, to discuss the terms of a possible deal that could bring an end to the war. But a summit in the capital of a country that has invaded his and sought to kill him would be a nonstarter for Zelenskyy.

At the end of his trip to Beijing, Putin said he had “never ruled out” the possibility of a meeting. “But is there any point? Let’s see,” he added.

The Russian leader said that such a meeting had to be well-prepared in advance. He made the remarks after Trump said he was “very disappointed” in him for Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine.

""They were hit, obviously, and they won’t be doing it again,"" the president added, also saying, ""We have to protect our country, and we’re going to.""

The president continued, highlighting his agenda to improve border security, telling reporters, ""Venezuela’s been very bad both in terms of drugs and sending the worst criminals from anywhere in the world into our country.""

Trump says 'you'll see things happen' if U.S. is unhappy with Putin

Trump suggested in his remarks in the Oval Office that his administration could take action against Russia if Vladimir Putin doesn't continue to cooperate in negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he didn't have a message for Putin.

""Putin knows where I stand, and he'll make a decision one way or the other,"" he said. ""Whatever his decision is, we'll either be happy about it, or unhappy, and if we're unhappy about it, you'll see things happen.""

Previously unidentified victim wants Epstein files released to help her remember what happened

One of Epstein's victims, Marina Lacerda, 37, told reporters that today is her first time speaking publicly about what happened to her when she was a teenager in New York City.

Lacerda said she dropped out of high school while she was forced to massage grown men at Epstein's Manhattan mansion.

""There are many pieces of my story that I can't remember no matter how hard I try,"" Lacerda told reporters. ""The constant state of wonder causes me so much fear and so much confusion. My therapist says that my brain is just trying to protect itself, but it's so hard to begin to heal knowing that there are people out there who know more about my abuse than I do.""

""The worst part is that the government is still in possession right now of the documents and information ... that could help me remember and get over all of this,"" she said, adding later, ""But I don’t have any of it, and I know the same is true for many of these women.""

Epstein accusers rally on Capitol Hill

Women accusing Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking rallied at Capitol Hill ahead of the news conference, calling for the release of all files related to the Epstein investigation, a commitment “to the truth” without political bias, and a promise by Trump not to pardon Maxwell.

Supporters held up signs that read “Trust the victims, not the felon,” referring to Maxwell and “Stand Up for Survivors.”

“The justice system was not designed to serve the powerful, it was meant to protect the people — and it’s time it started doing just that,” said Sky Roberts, the brother of prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.

Theresa Helm, who alleges she was 22 in 2002 when Maxwell groomed her and she was sexually abused by Epstein, said Maxwell belongs in prison.

“Ghislaine Maxwell, you are the system and now you are part of another system, one that you’ve earned through your very own choices and actions — a prison system where you deserve to live in your 20-year sentence,” Helm told the crowd.

The accusers at the rally said that if Congress wasn’t willing to release all of the investigative documents pertaining to Epstein, they would compile their own list through survivors to hold those in Epstein’s orbit accountable.

“We are the keys,” said Haley Robson, who alleges she was trafficked by Epstein starting when she was 16. “We know the games. We know the players.”

Rep. Ro Khanna: 'We’re here not as partisans, we’re here as patriots'

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized in his opening remarks that the push for transparency over the Epstein case is bipartisan.

""We're here not as partisans, we're here as patriots,"" Khanna said. ""We begin the work of bringing this country together. Progressives, independents, moderates, and yes, MAGA supporters, to demand truth and justice.""

Khanna said the lawmakers only need two more signatures from colleagues in order to move to the next steps for forcing a vote on the release of more files related to Epstein.

White House slams support from lawmakers for Massie's Epstein files petition as 'a very hostile act'

and

The White House is blasting any support from members of Congress for an effort by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a floor vote to require the Trump administration to release more Jeffrey Epstein files.

A White House official said helping Massie and Democrats ""with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.""

The petition, which needs 218 signatures to force the floor vote in the House, has already earned the backing of three other House Republicans: Reps. Nancy Mace, of South Carolina; Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia; and Lauren Boebert, of Colorado.

House to vote on censuring and removing Democratic lawmaker from committee

and

The House is scheduled to vote today on a resolution that would censure Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., and remove her from the House Homeland Security Committee over her confrontation with law enforcement at an immigration detention center in New Jersey in May.

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., introduced the measure as a privileged matter last night, a fast-track process that forces a vote within two legislative days. The resolution is currently on the agenda for the House today, but it is unclear whether a vote will take in early afternoon or later tonight.

The last member censured by the House was Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, in March after he interrupted Trump’s address to Congress.

The House has voted to strip several members of committee assignments in recent years. When Democrats were in the majority in 2021 they voted to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., from committees. In 2023, Republicans voted to oust Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Federal court blocks Trump’s removal of alleged Venezuelan gang members under wartime enemies law

and

A federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration yesterday from using an 18th century wartime law to remove people alleged to be Venezuelan gang members from the United States.

A panel of the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to block Trump’s deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, ruling the administration’s claim that members of Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang are part of a warlike invasion is not true.

Trump accuses Xi of conspiring against the U.S. with Putin and Kim at China military parade

Trump sent his warmest regards to the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea today.

The pleasantries, though, came with a twist — in the very same breath, he accused Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un of conspiring against the United States as the trio gathered at a massive military parade in Beijing.

Though the grand display of missiles and marching troops may have been capped by the release of 80,000 doves into the skies of the Chinese capital, the American president suggested he saw something altogether more sinister behind the spectacle.

“May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”

Trump says U.S. strike on vessel in Caribbean targeted Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang, killed 11

Trump said yesterday the U.S. has carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean on a drug-carrying vessel that departed from Venezuela and was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang.

The president said in a social media posting that 11 people were killed in the rare U.S. military operation in the Americas, a dramatic escalation in the Republican administration’s effort to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America. Trump also posted a short video clip of a small vessel appearing to explode in flames.

Democrat Scott Colom launches long shot Mississippi Senate run

Democrat Scott Colom, a district attorney, launched a campaign for Senate in Mississippi today, arguing that he could put the deep-red state in play next year and suggesting that GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith” puts D.C. politics above what’s best for us.”

Colom told NBC News in an interview yesterday ahead of his launch that Hyde-Smith’s vote for Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending law, known as the “big beautiful bill,” was the “final betrayal.” Colom said that tax cuts for ultra-wealthy Americans would not benefit most Mississippians, and cuts to Medicaid could threaten health care for tens of thousands of residents.

The race is an uphill climb and not one of the main campaigns in the spotlight for Democrats, who need to net four seats in 2026 to take control of the Senate. Trump won Mississippi by 23 points last year, and Hyde-Smith won her first full term in 2020 by 10 points. Attorney Ty Pinkins, who ran for Senate unsuccessfully last year as a Democrat, is challenging Hyde-Smith as an independent.

But The New York Times reported in May that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had discussed Colom’s potential Senate bid as a potential opportunity for his party. Colom acknowledged that he has spoken with Schumer and other Democrats like Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., but said he speaks most frequently with Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss.

”I’m focused on Mississippi,” Colom said. “I’m not focused on D.C. politics. I don’t care what Mitch McConnell thinks. I’m not going to D.C. based on what Chuck Schumer thinks. I’m more concerned about what the people in my community think.”

Colom ousted a longtime incumbent district attorney back in 2015 with backing from a super PAC funded by Democratic donor George Soros, who has become involved in local prosecutor races around the country in recent years. Colom has some history with Hyde-Smith: She blocked Colom’s nomination for a federal judgeship during the Biden administration. Colom said at the time that he ""never requested these funds from Mr. Soros.""

Asked if the episode factored into his decision to challenge the senator, Colom said he has personally forgiven Hyde-Smith, but said he remains “frustrated with how she votes.”

Hyde-Smith said at the time that she opposed Colom’s nomination in part because of his past support from Soros and out of concern that he would oppose legislation “to protect female athletes.” Colom said that issue did not come up in their meeting about the judgeship. Noting he coaches his young daughters’ soccer team, Colom said, “I don’t support biological boys playing in girls’ sports. I never have.”

“I talk to a bunch of people in Mississippi all the time. I talk to grand juries, I talk to people at the grocery store. Nobody has ever brought that issue up to me,” Colom said.

“All they talk about is grocery prices still out of control. What about getting that lower? Why don’t we have a senator fighting for consistent tariff policy? When are we ever going to get a raise in the minimum wage? ... What are we going to do for our teachers and cops? What’s this I’m hearing about a hospital might be closing?” Colom added. “Those are the issues I hear about. So those are the reasons I want to go to United States Senate, because I want to fight for the issue that people are telling me concern them.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250903-Donald-Trump-Karol-Nawrocki-se-1222p-e44959.jpg",N,,2025-09-03 13:57:55.063976

Federal officials allege the practice violates federal law and discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states, according to a complaint filed against the Illinois governor, attorney general and public university boards of trustees in the Southern District of Illinois.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April targeting state laws that allegedly favor undocumented residents over American citizens. It cited in-state tuition as a benefit that advantages students lacking legal status over out-of-state American citizens.

Illinois is the fourth state to be targeted by the Trump administration over long-standing state laws providing reduced tuition to students who reside in their states but lack legal immigration status. The Illinois General Assembly passed legislation in 2003 granting eligibility to undocumented students who have attended high school in the state for three years. The state also allows students who lack legal status to apply for state-funded scholarships.

More than 20 states provide in-state tuition to undocumented students, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal. Advocacy groups like the Presidents’ Alliance for Immigration and Higher Education argue that doing so is consistent with federal law and helps states maintain an educated and trained workforce.

Illinois is home to more than 500,000 immigrants without legal status, nearly 27,000 of whom are pursuing higher education. If they were to lose in-state financial aid benefits, those attending the state’s public colleges and universities could be forced to pay twice as much to pursue their degrees.

Dugan is accused of trying to help an undocumented immigrant escape federal agents outside her courtroom.

A federal judge denied a motion to dismiss the case, which argued Dugan had judicial immunity.

Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan will be tried Dec. 15 on federal criminal charges accusing her of obstructing immigration agents trying to arrest an undocumented Mexican migrant outside her courtroom earlier this year.

U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman set the trial date in the high-profile, high-stakes case at a hearing in the federal courthouse on Sept. 3. The trial is expected to last a week.

Jury selection was scheduled for Dec. 11-12.

Adelman set the trial date after Dugan's attorneys announced in court that they would not appeal his decision to reject their motion to dismiss the case at this time, but preserved their right to appeal later. Last week's decision by Adelman, one of the most liberal federal judges, was a blow to the defense, but it is difficult to win such a motion even before the facts have been established in a case. Adelman was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Bill Clinton.

Dugan's high-profile arrest and indictment put her case at the center of the growing dispute between President Donald Trump and the judiciary. Critics have accused Trump of trying to intimidate judges around the country, citing his administration's decision to defy or ""slow walk"" compliance with multiple court orders and Trump's calls to impeach one federal judge.

In the three months before trial, Adelman is expected to decide pretrial motions filed by either prosecutors and defense attorneys.

The two sides have already begun arguing about the questions that potential jurors will be asked. Given the intense publicity over the case, jury selection could be challenging.

The trial had been originally scheduled for late July, but Adelman pushed back the date indefinitely because he decided it was impractical, especially with the defense's motion to dismiss.

Dugan was not at the Sept. 3 hearing. She has been excused from attending court hearings after she entered a not guilty plea earlier this year.

On May 13, Dugan was indicted on charges she obstructed a federal agency and tried to help undocumented immigrant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz escape federal agents at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18.

Flores-Ruiz, 31, was arrested following a short chase outside the courthouse. Federal officials say Flores-Ruiz illegally re-entered the United States from Mexico after being deported.

A week later, FBI agents arrested Dugan at the courthouse, thrusting her to the forefront of a clash between the judiciary and the Trump administration amid its crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Dugan pleaded not guilty to the charges, a felony and a misdemeanor. If convicted, the veteran judge faces up to six years in prison. However, first-time nonviolent offenders typically get shorter sentences or probation.

Dugan, 66, has been suspended with pay by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. She makes nearly $175,000 a year.

Dugan's attorneys argued that she was being prosecuted for actions that are ""official acts,"" for which she has immunity as a judge. They also argued the case was an example of federal overreach.

Federal prosecutors said Dugan's arguments on these two issues were flawed and unsupported by legal precedent. To dismiss the case, prosecutors said, would suggest that ""judges are 'above the law,' and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement.""

On Saturday, a public procurement database showed that a stop work order on the September 2024 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been lifted, technology journalist Jack Poulson reported on his All-Source Intelligence Substack.

The deal does not specify what ICE will be getting as part of the deal, beyond describing an agreement for a “fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.”

An individual who answered a phone number listed for Paragon on the contract declined to comment.

The Independent has contacted ICE for comment.

The initial deal was paused in October to review whether it complied with a March 2023 Biden administration executive order limiting the use of commercial spyware that could pose counterintelligence risks to the U.S. or that might be improperly used by a foreign government, WIRED reported.

Critics warned of potential risks from the U.S. engaging with Paragon, whose Graphite program can quietly invade the mobile phone of its target and extract its contents, primarily through accessing cloud backup data.

“Invasive, secret hacking power is corrupting,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which has probed the foreign use of Paragon products, told The Guardian. “That’s why there’s a growing pile of spyware scandals in democracies, including with Paragon’s Graphite.”

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has previously used Graphite against drug traffickers outside the U.S., The New York Times reported in 2022.

Paragon was founded by Ehud Schneorson, a former commander of Israel’s cyber-spying Unit 8200. In late 2024, AE Industrial Partners, a Florida-based investment group, acquired the company for $500 million, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.

Paragon bills itself as an ethical cyber firm that only sells to the U.S. and other allied countries.

WhatsApp said in early 2025 it had disrupted a hacking campaign targeting about 90 people linked to Paragon, and an Italian journalist and several pro-immigration activists said they were among the victims. Analysis by the Citizen Lab think tank suggests two other journalists were targeted.

Paragon said in June it terminated contracts in Italy after claiming the Italian government refused its help in investigating whether its products were improperly used in the attack.

“The company offered both the Italian government and parliament a way to determine whether its system had been used against the journalist in violation of Italian law and the contractual terms,” Paragon said in a statement at the time. “As the Italian authorities chose not to proceed with this solution, Paragon terminated its contracts in Italy.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/16/22/10/Federal-Agents-Detain-Immigrants-Outside-Connecticut-Courthouse-qachhcus.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-03 14:57:13.762395

But I want to emphasize that, you know, beyond the National Guard, this is in many ways also about immigration.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We look now at a slew of legal developments with the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and his broader immigration crackdown. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, the brother of the retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled Trump broke the law when he deployed the National Guard to L.A. to quell protests against immigration raids. Breyer expressed concern [that] the deployments are, quote, “creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” unquote.

Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges.

And in more immigration news, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a two-to-one ruling that blocks President Trump from using the 18th-century wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members, because, quote, “We find no invasion or predatory incursion had occurred.” The 5th Circuit is considered to be one of the most conservative appeals courts in the United States. The case is expected to head to the Supreme Court.

For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we’re joined by Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.

Aaron, welcome back to Democracy Now! Let’s start with that last overnight court decision. If you can talk about this very conservative court ruling against Trump using the Alien Enemies Act, the AEA, and then just go through these latest decisions in the last two days?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, well, first, starting with the Alien Enemies Act, we saw the 5th Circuit, in a two-one decision, rule that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority, which is what everyone has been saying so far. The judges’ panel’s rule, it was a two-one decision. They joined over a dozen other federal judges to rule that this law, adopted in 1798 during the quasi-war with France, and that has only ever previously been invoked during declared wars, is in fact a wartime authority and not something that can be used to deport Venezuelan alleged gang members without any due process whatsoever. So this is yet another blow for the Trump administration in their efforts to use the Alien Enemies Act. And though we know that this case will eventually make it to the Supreme Court, at the Supreme Court, as well, the Trump administration is zero for two in their efforts to use the law without any due process.

Beyond that, of course, we had Judge Breyer’s decision in California finding that the President violated the Posse Comitatus Act when the military was used for domestic law enforcement, things like riot control or crowd control in Los Angeles.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And for those who are not aware, what is the Posse Comitatus Act?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: The Posse Comitatus Act is a 150-year-old law, adopted after the Civil War, that says extremely clearly that the U.S. military may not be used for domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized to do so by Congress. And here, Congress has never authorized the military to be used for basic law enforcement tasks like crowd control.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Also, if you could comment on the federal judge’s decision over the weekend stopping the Trump administration from illegally deporting as many as 700 Guatemalan children in the middle of the night back to Guatemala?

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, that’s another case that looks very suspiciously similar to the kinds of things the Trump administration did in the Alien Enemies Act case. They adopted a very out-there, bizarre legal interpretation that had never been for — been put forward, and then tried to execute mass removals in the middle of the night, or very early in the morning, before a judge could stop them. In this case, a judge acted at 2 a.m. to put forward an order to block the Trump administration, and continued forward that order and her actions throughout the day, so they did, in fact, prevent the planes from taking off.

But at its heart, this resulted from — this was a result of the Trump administration’s bizarre claim that the Office of Refugee Resettlement has an authority to effectively run its own shadow repatriation system and has the ability to send children home outside of the normal constraints of immigration law, which include things like the right to seek asylum. So, those flights have been blocked. This case will now continue forward in the courts. But unlike what happened with the Alien Enemies Act and the deportations to El Salvador, the planes did not manage to take off and deplane their passengers.

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges. The head of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Ben Johnson, warned the decision will gut due process and undermine the immigration court. He said to the Associated Press, “It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.” Talk about the meaning of Army lawyers becoming immigration judges.

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, Ben Johnson is right here. The reality is that immigration law is extraordinarily complex, and it’s often been described as second in complexity only to the tax system. And immigration court has often been described as death penalty cases in traffic court procedures. So, what we have here are 600 lawyers, who may very well be good lawyers and conscientious, but have absolutely no experience in immigration law whatsoever, and they’re being assigned to take cases that could lead to someone’s death if they’re decided wrong. While undoubtedly they could eventually become experts in immigration law with months and months of training, these deployments are supposed to last only 179 days. So, you have people who have been or are going to be ordered to take on these incredibly weighty, difficult, complex cases, without any of the relevant experience they need, which is only going to strain the immigration court system. And indeed, the purpose of this is clear. Corey Lewandowski, who is a senior adviser to Secretary Noem, and, of course, a longtime member of Trump world, said on X yesterday that the goal of this is to increase deportations. And I think that really gives away the game.

AMY GOODMAN: So much for being with us —

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I wanted to —

AMY GOODMAN: Oh, go ahead, Juan.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: No, no, I just wanted to ask him about the pending invasion of Chicago by both federal agents and the military, especially this idea that Trump has of bringing National Guard troops from, essentially, Republican states to occupy largely minority cities in Democratic states.

AARON REICHLIN-MELNICK: Yeah, I think, as Governor Pritzker has stated, this is particularly disturbing. You know, when you look at the statistics, Chicago is not even in the top 20 most violent cities, which is not to say, of course, that there are not issues with gun violence, but not ones that would justify deploying the National Guard.

But I want to emphasize that, you know, beyond the National Guard, this is in many ways also about immigration. Here in Washington, D.C., the National Guard has mostly been standing around the Mall or doing tasks like spreading mulch and picking up trash. But what’s actually been happening, most significantly, is the invasion of the city by federal law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement. You have ICE and the Metropolitan Police Department setting up checkpoints in major thoroughfares in the city. You have a major increase in ICE raids across the city and people being afraid to take their children to school. So, while a lot of the attention in Chicago is going to be on the National Guard deployment, keep an eye out for what ICE is doing, because this could be yet another Los Angeles, where we see huge increase in immigration enforcement throughout the city and immigrant communities forced to shrink back in fear.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/93/78793/full_hd/SEG2_Trump.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 13:58:00.694420

Now, in a disturbing expansion of immigration enforcement, Trump has proposed detaining up to 30,000 migrants at Guantánamo.","On Aug. 11, 2025, US President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers to deploy 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital, signaling another alarming escalation of the use of military force during his second term. The military is now being used in ways once unimaginable for immigration enforcement — stationing troops in US cities, detaining migrants in military prisons, and invoking wartime powers to expel them.

From day one, Trump has framed migration as a national security threat, vowing to launch “the largest deportation program of criminals” in US history. What has followed is a calculated effort to expand military power into domestic immigration policy and blur the lines between enforcement and war.

Just days into his presidency, Trump moved to bypass Congress by signing 10 executive orders expanding military involvement in immigration enforcement.

Among the most consequential was the order “Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border of the United States.” This reclassified the movement of migrants at the border as a “national emergency” and authorized the Department of Defense to deploy troops to the border. Another order, “Clarifying the Military’s Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States,” assigned servicemembers with the mission of “repelling the invasion and sealing the United States’ southern border from unlawful entry.”

As a result, nearly 10,000 active-duty troops are stationed along the southern border, supporting detention, removal, and enforcement operations. These executive orders marked the administration’s first step in recasting immigration not as a humanitarian or legal issue, but as a national security crisis demanding a war-like response. With the signing of the reconciliation package in July, Congress has given the administration $170 billion to carry out a dangerous campaign that fails to respond to modern migration challenges.

In March, Trump unlawfully invoked the outdated Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to exile approximately 250 Venezuelans to El Salvador without a semblance of due process. Federal courts have since ruled that removal, even under the AEA, must comply with constitutional protections. The AEA had never been used outside of wartime. The last instance was during World War II, when the US government shamefully justified the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German nationals.

Trump overstepped congressional war powers by labeling the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) a foreign, wartime enemy. The US is not at war with this group, yet the president used the AEA in an outrageous powergrab to apprehend and remove any Venezuelan noncitizens 14 years of age or older deemed members of TdA. This represents an unprecedented abuse of executive authority.

“The threat of war powers continues to escalate.”

For four months, 252 men exiled to El Salvador were imprisoned in CECOT, a facility notorious for its grim and widespread human rights offenses. Now released and repatriated in Venezuela, the men have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, torture, and sexual abuse inside CECOT. They were held with limited access to legal counsel and deprived of sunlight and time outdoors. Many of the men detained had no criminal record in the US or in Venezuela, and in most cases, the US government failed to provide sufficient evidence of any TdA affiliation.

Trump’s misuse of the AEA signals a sharp turn, marked by an alarming misuse of war powers and a disregard for due process — a constitutional right afforded to anyone on US soil, regardless of immigration status.

The threat of war powers continues to escalate. On June 7, 2025, Trump became the first president since 1970 to federalize the National Guard, deploying nearly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to respond to protests following immigration raids. The event renewed concerns over the possible invocation of the Insurrection Act to deploy the military for interior policing.

For more than 23 years, Guantánamo Bay has symbolized torture and indefinite detention. It has drawn condemnation from human rights experts and members of Congress, many of whom have called for its closure. Opened in January 2002 to hold alleged terrorists, the facility continues to serve as a moral stain on the US and a global symbol of unchecked executive power.

Now, in a disturbing expansion of immigration enforcement, Trump has proposed detaining up to 30,000 migrants at Guantánamo. More than 500 have already been held at the site, costing taxpayers over $40 million, in addition to transportation costs of $21 million or more than $26,000 per flight hour. Even more alarming, reports indicate that some migrants have been detained not just at the Migrant Operations Center, but by military personnel at Camp 6 — a facility built for high-level terrorism suspects. This is unlawful, as only members of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, or their “associated forces” are permitted to be held in military detention at Guantánamo.

Using a wartime prison to hold migrants marks a dangerous convergence of military power and civilian immigration policy. It erodes civil liberties and continues to set a chilling precedent for future enforcement. All the while, the Trump administration continues to conflate immigration management with warfare, endangering both citizens and noncitizens. Violent immigration policies — family separation, abusive detention, and military-involved removals — sow fear and insecurity. As the Quaker Statement on Migration affirms, “Migration injustice values the perceived security of some over shared security: a militarised approach to security threatens security for all of us.” America will not thrive waging war on itself. Congress must modernize the outdated system with humane asylum processes, a citizenship pathway, and just, orderly border policies.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/alejandro-cartagena-fnEQLMhXkWI-unsplash-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:58:01.462024

“[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.” The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.
Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act.
L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos.
The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.","State officials said they have not inspected the private immigrant detention center in Tacoma since last year amid legal pushback, but a recent federal court opinion could reinforce state-level oversight of health and safety conditions for detainees.

The Department of Labor & Industries reported it last inspected working conditions at the Northwest Immigration Processing Center in summer 2024 and found no violations. GEO Group, the private company operating the detention center, has challenged the state’s authority to conduct inspections and since barred entry to L&I as well as Department of Health inspectors.

“Despite hundreds of complaints and our ongoing efforts, NWIPC continues to deny entry to DOH staff,” DOH spokesperson Kara Kostanich wrote in a statement. “Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all people in Washington, including those in detention, who are among the most vulnerable in our state.”

GEO Group has contested a 2023 Washington state law that authorized new oversight of the private detention center, arguing the law unfairly discriminated against the company as the only such center in the state. Legislators amended that law earlier this year to include other facilities and impose specific penalties on health and safety violations.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Aug. 19, overturning a lower court ruling that barred state officials from conducting inspections, and clarifying that the state has authority to regulate many types of civil detention facilities such as mental health institutions.

“The key issue in this case is whether the entities to which we should compare the NWIPC are state prisons or civil detention facilities,” the opinion states. “[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.”

The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.

The Department of Health had filed a separate lawsuit last year, seeking a court order to allow inspectors into the detention center to observe detainee quarters. L&I spokesman Matt Ross told Cascade PBS that the agency has maintained it has ongoing authority to conduct its workplace safety checks, but confirmed it had not inspected the center since last year.

“We already had authority under state law and the state constitution to inspect conditions for workers,” he wrote in an email, “and were already conducting routine inspections into workplace safety and health at the site.”

GEO Group recently dropped a lawsuit to block L&I from releasing records from its 2024 inspection after a Cascade PBS reporter requested those materials under the Public Records Act. The company sought an injunction against L&I in January, arguing that disclosing the inspection photos and reports to the media could undermine security at the facility. Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act. GEO did not seek legal or equitable relief against Cascade PBS.

In attachments to its filed complaint, GEO Group included a live hyperlink to more than 200 L&I inspection photos. Most of the photos depicted items related to workplace safety regulations such as fire extinguishers, stairways, cleaning chemical labels or personal protective equipment. Some photos included shackles, gas masks or tactical gear.

L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos. Cascade PBS then asked L&I to conduct an administrative review of those redactions and officials provided a second set of similarly redacted photos, citing a security exemption raised by GEO Group.

Many redactions blacked out doorways, windows or the locations of security cameras. L&I contended the redacted photos contained “specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique emergency and escape response plans at a city, county, or state adult or juvenile correctional facility, or secure facility for persons civilly confined.”

“In this case we removed the location of security cameras, video surveillance images, and types of weapons and restraints,” an L&I records officer wrote to Cascade PBS.

GEO Group ended its case against L&I and Cascade PBS in June, filing a voluntary request for dismissal before any substantive proceedings or rulings occurred in the case.

An attorney affiliated with the Washington Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit organization advocating for government transparency, told Cascade PBS that exemptions that allow public agencies to redact information should be applied narrowly. The attorney pointed to Does v. King County, a 2015 case in which officials tried to block the release of surveillance footage of a shooting on Seattle Pacific University’s campus.

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.

GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on the latest federal court decision. The company is expected to file a response to the opinion by Sept. 16.

State representative Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who sponsored both inspection bills, lauded the recent court decision, calling it an act of “justice” and a step toward holding the NWIPC accountable for its numerous alleged human rights abuses.

“We certainly should not be letting a private facility come in and profit off the backs of our most vulnerable people,” she said. “And that’s what’s been happening — with no accountability — very little from the federal government, if any, and none from the state. They’ve been able to do whatever it is that they want, but they’re doing it in our state, and I think that’s the difference.”

The panel of appellate judges held that multiple sections of the state’s inspection law did not conflict with the “intergovernmental immunity doctrine,” which protects federal agencies from state regulation or discrimination. The judges ruled that requiring DOH to adopt rules that ensure safe and sanitary conditions to people in immigration detention and enforcing civil penalties for violations of such conditions did not rise to that level.

“[T]he panel held that it would not decide at this point whether Washington regulates the conditions of confinement at the NWIPC differently from the way it regulates the conditions of confinement in other civil detention facilities,” the panel wrote. “Because the district court incorrectly concluded that the appropriate comparator was Washington’s prisons, the panel remanded to allow the district court to make the comparison with other civil detention facilities.”

The judges concluded that allowing GEO to compare its operations to prison would “ignore the critical fact that inmates in Washington’s prisons have been convicted of crimes, and that the conditions of their confinement are part of a penal regime.”

“By contrast,” the opinion states, “none of the detainees held in the NWIPC has been convicted of — or even charged with — a crime.”

Before the DOH could implement its own rules, the panel found that the already-existing contractual requirements that were implemented on the NWIPC by the state were “almost identical” to the requirements imposed under Washington law on the types of civil detention facilities.

Ortiz-Self said the decision would help Washington achieve parity with California — which, since 2017, has empowered state investigators to inspect the state’s network of immigration detention centers.

“We want it for all facilities — public or private — because we feel a sense of accountability as the state that is housing these facilities,” she said. “And in the California determination, they said, ‘Yes, as a state, states do have a right to inspect and have standards for private facilities.’”

Kostanich with DOH said the agency is still determining its next steps in the case.

“We are optimistic the federal courts will clarify DOH’s authority,” she wrote, “allowing us to conduct investigations that promote transparency and protect the health and well-being of everyone inside the facility.”",https://www.cascadepbs.org/content/images/2025/09/msb-1243873modcolor.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 13:58:20.031930

The new phenomenon, referred to as ""reverse flow"" migration, has mainly impacted migrants fleeing the economic and political turmoil in Venezuela and who had been moving north through Central America toward the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the political crisis in Venezuela.

The report, published by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had plummeted by 97% this year.

""It’s time to go back — the American dream wasn’t like this,"" one migrant said, per the report.

The report links the reversal to President Donald Trump's border policies, with 46% of migrants citing policy changes and 49% saying they could not enter the U.S. Another 34% ran out of resources and 17% feared detention or deportation.

Migration through the treacherous Darién Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed.

The report also blames U.S. financial reductions for drying up humanitarian aid. As a result, NGOs and U.N. agencies that were filling protection gaps in places like the Darién Gap and along return routes had to shut down or scale back operations.

Additionally, tougher transit restrictions in Panama mean the traditional pipeline toward the U.S. is nearly shut.

That flow slowed somewhat in 2024 but dried up almost completely early this year as President Trump fulfilled his campaign promise of shutting the border.

Southwest border apprehensions hit a monthly record low in July, with only 4,399 apprehensions, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. For the third month in a row, there were zero releases. This is the new all-time record low, beating the prior record low of 6,070 in June.

Biden repeatedly had single days when apprehensions ranged from 8,000 to 10,000 migrants, with his highest single month being December 2023, when 249,785 Border Patrol apprehensions were recorded.

The migrants who had hoped to reach the U.S. now find themselves in a difficult situation and some face violence, abuse and exploitation, the report states.

Roughly 50% of those interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia said they intended to go back to Venezuela, with around a quarter of those interviewed planning to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Some migrants will continue moving south within Latin America, but the report warns they face unsafe boat journeys, dependence on smugglers and criminal groups that prey on returnees. Others remain stranded in places like Palenque, Miramar, Necoclí, Bahía Solano and Medellín, sleeping in parks or abandoned buildings without access to food, shelter or medical care.

Humanitarian monitors said many are turning to survival strategies such as informal work, begging or even transactional sex.

""We don’t know whether to stay in Colombia or go to Chile. I worry a lot about my children; they’re tired of moving so much,"" one migrant said.

""Imagine, I’m back in the same place I left many years ago chasing a dream,"" another said. ""Now I don’t know what to do.""

Scott Campbell, the U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said the returnees are among the most vulnerable people on the continent and urged governments not to abandon the migrants.

""Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Campbell said. ""We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.""

Federal officials allege the practice violates federal law and discriminates against U.S. citizens living in other states, according to a complaint filed against the Illinois governor, attorney general and public university boards of trustees in the Southern District of Illinois.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April targeting state laws that allegedly favor undocumented residents over American citizens. It cited in-state tuition as a benefit that advantages students lacking legal status over out-of-state American citizens.

Illinois is the fourth state to be targeted by the Trump administration over long-standing state laws providing reduced tuition to students who reside in their states but lack legal immigration status. The Illinois General Assembly passed legislation in 2003 granting eligibility to undocumented students who have attended high school in the state for three years. The state also allows students who lack legal status to apply for state-funded scholarships.

More than 20 states provide in-state tuition to undocumented students, according to the Higher Ed Immigration Portal. Advocacy groups like the Presidents’ Alliance for Immigration and Higher Education argue that doing so is consistent with federal law and helps states maintain an educated and trained workforce.

Illinois is home to more than 500,000 immigrants without legal status, nearly 27,000 of whom are pursuing higher education. If they were to lose in-state financial aid benefits, those attending the state’s public colleges and universities could be forced to pay twice as much to pursue their degrees.

Tabletop exercises are discussions in which participants work through scenarios to test emergency response plans, per KOIN 6 News. The Portland Police Bureau said it was not involved in what happened outside the ICE facility on Labor Day night, per the outlet.

In July, Portland’s progressive-leaning city council said it was exploring ways to expel ICE from the detention facility that has become a flashpoint for violent clashes between agents and radical agitators.

Chaotic scenes have been unfolding outside the facility since June, including in one incident where a large group of anti-ICE protesters tried to block law enforcement vehicles from entering and exiting the facility, forcing agents to deploy rubber bullets, tear gas and flash bangs to disperse the crowd.

Footage that emerged from overnight Monday purportedly showed demonstrators burning a flag before law enforcement fired munitions to disperse the crowd.

Video then showed police clearing out the area, with the protesters yelling through loudspeakers, ""You are sad excuses for human beings!"" and ""You guys are violent, cowardly pigs!""

At least two protesters were seen wielding riot shields to protect against the munitions being fired at them. It is unclear if any arrests were made during the incident.

Meanwhile, fraught funding negotiations amid President Trump’s move to claw back funding through a pocket recession are top of mind as a Sept. 30 shutdown deadline quickly approaches.

Congress will need to hammer out a stopgap measure. But this is easier said than done amid divisions over what this funding measure would look like and Democrats’ anger with the president and Republicans’ agenda.

At the White House, President Trump is meeting with Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki.

The Hajnówka Five have been prosecuted after giving humanitarian aid to refugees in a forest in Poland who had crossed from the Belarus border in 2022. They face up to five years in prison if convicted.

I’ve been following their trial and others like it for some years, as the Polish authorities target activists who give food, water, and legal advice to people coming from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Ethiopia, and other places and who seek refuge in Poland.

In May, I was in this same court when two women activists were acquitted after helping a man seeking asylum in the forest. Today, two doors away from the Hajnówka Five, another activist known as Bartek had his first trial hearing. He is charged with“influencing the official duties of the Border Guard” after trying to ensure the Border Guards fulfilled their legal obligation in October 2024 by accepting an application for international protection from a young Somali man, whom Bartek was authorized to represent. If convicted, he faces up to three years in prison.

Poland is an increasingly dangerous place for refugees and those who help them. The Polish government has suspended the right to asylum for those coming via Belarus, with a few exceptions.

But there was a lot of support for Bartek and the Hajnówka Five outside and inside the court today. A hundred or so people gathered near the steps at the entrance, providing free coffee, blueberries, and music.

Inside the cavernous Room IV, the benches were filled with more supporters and about a dozen TV crews. This trial is big news in Poland and is seen as a test of the country’s values.

The accused sit along one side of the room, the prosecution and defense lawyers (nine in all) sit opposite them, and at one end, Judge Adam Konrad Rodakowski sits up on the dais alone, with Poland’s national symbol ­— a huge golden eagle — embedded in the wall above his head.

Virtually everything else in the court is green — the marble slabs lining the walls, the smooth pillars, the tinted glass, the floor tiles, and the benches.

Mariusz is one of the Hajnówka Five. I first met him when we drove into Ukraine together in the weeks following Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. He had just passed his driving test a few days before, and frankly, he probably shouldn’t have. Speeding from Poland into Ukraine with Mariusz in a car full of flak jackets for medics and baby food was a hair-raising trip, even for a bald man.

“Guess what,” he laughed when we met this morning. “My job now is as a driver. I’m better than I was.”

A week after that trip, he and the others were arrested after they gave water, food, and clothing to a desperate Iraqi couple, their seven children, and an elderly Egyptian man who was with them. Mariusz and three others gave the group a ride to the nearest town when they were stopped by border guards.

They are accused of providing “illegal assistance” to refugees, “making it easier for them to stay in the Republic of Poland” by “providing food and clothing to them while they were hiding in the woods, giving them shelter and rest, and transporting them into Poland on March 22, 2022.”

In January this year, I submitted evidence to the court in support of Mariusz, confirming his acts as humanitarian.

Mariusz and the others spoke in court today, outlining their reasons for providing aid.

This trial is about these five cases, but it is really about what Poland stands for and whether it wants to be a country that targets and outlaws such acts of kindness.

There is a widespread belief that there will be further cases brought, with human rights activists citing the large numbers of people questioned by police in recent months. “Maybe all activists are in danger, because who knows who has said what to the police,” one woman active in helping refugees told me.

The Hajnówka Five should find out their fate on Monday, and Bartek will receive his verdict later this month.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2280-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:58:09.317687

Speaking to The Times, Mr Papier likened asylum rulings from national courts and the ECHR in Strasbourg as appearing to “settle like mildew over the states’ political power to take action”.

France’s far-Right National Rally was leading in France and Nigel Farage’s Reform Party is in front in Britain.","Germany’s former top judge said the “existence of western democracies” was in danger unless overbearing courts were reined in and Europe implemented asylum reforms.

Hans-Jurgen Papier said “uncontrolled and unconditional immigration” was damaging public faith in conventional politics and that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) had gone too far in its definition of the right to asylum.

Mr Papier, who was once the most senior judge in Germany, is a constitutional expert. His comments mark a radical shift in public mood towards immigration, from the days of Angela Merkel’s open-door policy to the rise of the far-Right.

Speaking to The Times, Mr Papier likened asylum rulings from national courts and the ECHR in Strasbourg as appearing to “settle like mildew over the states’ political power to take action”.

“The prospect that those in positions of political responsibility in Europe could change this system and adapt it to the fundamental changes in our social, political and cultural conditions seems ever more difficult and ever more hopeless to many people,” he said.

He added the situation was “generally destroying the European citizen’s trust in the capacity of their democratic institutions to act, and so at the end of the day endangering the existence of western democracies”.

Germany has hardened its stance on migration amid widespread discontent over its growth.

When she famously told the German public that the country could cope with migration, Ms Merkel was bucking the trend in Europe which was resisting pressure to allow in migrants from places such as Syria.

However, when more than 600 women were sexually assaulted by migrants in the Cologne New Year sex attacks at the start of 2016, Mrs Merkel found herself politically isolated.

Islamist terror attacks

A year of Islamist terror attacks followed, culminating when a rejected Tunisian asylum-seeker drove a lorry into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12. Even Mrs Merkel’s most diehard supporters began to fear she had got it catastrophically wrong.

Years on and her liberal politics have been dispensed with by Germany’s current leader.

Friedrich Merz, the chancellor, said last month he will abolish a rule that automatically assigns a lawyer to asylum seekers awaiting deportation, even if they have lost their final appeal.

Allies of Mr Merz told The Telegraph that the rule, introduced by a previous government, had mired German courts in red tape and was being used to prolong deportation cases.

According to recent German government statistics, the number of asylum applications filed in Germany between January and July 2025 stood at around 70,000, a decrease of 50 per cent compared to the same time period of last year.

The reduction in numbers has been linked to tougher German government rhetoric on migration, passport checks at all land borders and, more broadly, the passage of time – with far fewer people fleeing Ukraine, Afghanistan and Syria.

Nevertheless, governments across the EU are under intense pressure from the populist Right to toughen up migration policy, with some hoping to set up offshore processing centres which would be similar to the UK’s failed Rwanda deportation scheme.

The scale of the surge of the far-Right was evident in August when for the first time in modern history, far-Right and populist parties were topping the polls in Germany, France and Britain.

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is now the most popular among voters, leading the polls on 26 per cent and putting the Christian Democrats in second place at 24 per cent.

The military will begin sending groups of 150 attorneys — both military and civilians — to the Justice Department “as soon as practicable,” and the military services should have the first round of people identified by next week, according to the Aug. 27 memo.

The effort comes as the Trump administration more regularly turns to the military as it cracks down on illegal immigration through ramped-up arrests and deportations. Its growing role in the push includes troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.

The administration's focus on illegal immigration has added strain to the immigration courts, which were already dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years. An organization for immigration lawyers called the new directive a “destructive” move meant to undermine the courts.

Numerous immigration judges have been fired

At the same time, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration, their union says. In the most recent round of terminations, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired “without cause” in courts across the country.

That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move would double their ranks.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, requested the assistance from the Defense Department, according to the memo sent by the Pentagon’s executive secretary to his DOJ counterpart. The military lawyers' duties as immigration judges will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewed, it said.

A DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department, where officials directed questions to the White House.

A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”

The head of the American Immigration Lawyers Association decried bringing in temporary judges who lack expertise in immigration law, saying “it makes as much as sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement.”

“Expecting fair decisions from judges unfamiliar with the law is absurd. This reckless move guts due process and further undermines the integrity of our immigration court system,” said Ben Johnson, the organization’s executive director.

Pentagon says the step may require mobilizing reserve officers

The memo stressed that the additional attorneys are contingent on availability and that mobilizing reserve officers may be necessary. Plus, the document said DOJ would be responsible for ensuring that anyone sent from the Pentagon does not violate the federal prohibition on using the military as domestic law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act.

The administration faced a setback on its efforts to use troops in unique ways to combat illegal immigration and crime, with a court ruling Tuesday that it “willfully” violated federal law by sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles in early June.

It is not immediately clear what impact shifting that number of military attorneys would have on the armed forces' justice system. The attorneys, called judge advocates, have a range of duties much like civilian lawyers, from carrying out prosecutions, acting as a defense attorney or offering legal advice.

Pentagon officials did immediately offer details on where any of the 600 attorneys will be drawn from and whether they will come from active duty or the reserves.

The training that goes into being an immigration judge

Until she was abruptly fired in July, former supervising judge Jennifer Peyton administered the intensive training that all judges in Chicago undergo before working in some of the busiest immigration courts in the country. After the weekslong training, new judges are paired with an experienced mentor and have a two-year probationary period.

Peyton doubted that military attorneys would be able to master the complexities of immigration law without that rigorous process. She also said it wasn’t clear how they would handle the hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of cases on just a Chicago immigration judge’s docket each year.

“Six months is barely enough time to start to figure out the firehose of information and training,” she said.

Peyton also was concerned that Trump’s move didn’t supply more administrative workers, including translators, whom judges rely on to make decisions. The stakes, she said, were life or death for people who would come before the new judges.

“None of it makes sense unless you were intentionally trying to weaken the immigration courts,” Peyton said.

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. military forces yesterday conducted a “kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists” on Trump’s orders, killing 11 “terrorists” who were “transporting illegal narcotics,” Trump announced in a social media post. The move is a significant escalation of the Trump administration’s effort to stem the trafficking of narcotics from Latin America. The White House did not explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro did not directly comment on the strike to date. Aamer Madhani, Konstantin Toropin, and Regina Garcia Cano report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir directly challenged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a recent meeting over Netanyahu’s plans to expand the Gaza war, according to Israeli officials. The officials say that Zamir highlighted the potential risks to the 48 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza and the Israeli troops on the ground, and raised objections to the humanitarian and strategic ramifications of the displacement of up to one million Palestinians that would result from the offensive. He also urged ministers to consider the latest ceasefire proposal put forward by Egyptian and Qatari mediators that has been accepted by Hamas. Tal Shalev and Dana Karni report for CNN.

The United Kingdom is working to get critically sick and injured children out of Gaza so they can receive specialist treatment in U.K. hospitals, and is “outraged” by Israel not allowing enough aid to enter the territory, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Monday. AP News reports.

Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh has written to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, urging him to reconsider his decision to bar Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas from attending the U.N. General Assembly and pushing back on Rubio’s rationale in banning Palestinian Authority officials from the United States.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Two senior Defense Department homeland and cybersecurity officials have “moved on” from their positions, a U.S. defense official told the Hill yesterday. The official did not specify when Ashley Manning, the principal deputy assistant secretary for cyber policy, and Jonathan Owen, the acting deputy assistant secretary for homeland defense integration and defense support to civil authorities, have left their posts. The Pentagon’s tech innovation chief, Doug Beck, resigned last week. Filip Timotija reports.

Trump yesterday announced he plans to relocate the U.S. Space Command to Alabama from Colorado, in part due to his grudge against Colorado, a state he has never won. The Space Command coordinates space-related operations for all branches of the armed forces.

A group of more than 85 scientists last week submitted a joint rebuttal to the Energy Department’s July report about climate change. The rebuttal finds that “DOE report’s key assertions … are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect” and that its approach to “undermining scientific evidence mirrors tactics previously employed by the tobacco industry to create artificial doubt.” The DOE report is extensively relied on in EPA’s reconsideration of its 2009 Endangerment Finding. Julia Simon reports for NPR.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) yesterday said that a scheduled National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency oversight meeting has been cancelled after far-right activist Laura Loomer launched public attacks on him and the agency’s director, Vice Adm. Trey Whitworth. The planned Friday meeting was scheduled weeks ago and was unpublicized and classified, Warner added. In a social media post, Loomer took credit for the cancellation and demanded that Whitworth be fired for “insubordination.” Dan De Luce reports for NBC News.

The House Oversight Committee yesterday released more than 33,000 pages of records connected to the Justice Department’s investigation of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Many of the documents published by the Committee were already public, and it was not immediately clear whether the release included any material that had not already been made public. Michael Gold reports for the New York Times.

The planned extension does not necessarily signal that the D.C. deployment will last until then. Haley Britzky reports for CNN.

A D.C. grand jury has refused to indict a woman accused of threatening Trump on social media, according to a motion filed by the woman’s attorneys on Monday. The grand jury’s refusal is at least the sixth instance in which prosecutors failed to secure an indictment during Trump’s federal policing effort in Washington. Ryan J. Reilly reports for NBC News.

TECH NEWS

In a closely-watched antitrust trial, a federal judge yesterday rejected the Justice Department’s request to break up Google by forcing it to spin off its Chrome browser and Android products, instead ordering the tech giant to share some of its search data with competitors and prohibiting it from making deals that make its products the default tool on mobile devices. Google said it is reviewing the decision. Nate Robson reports for POLITICO.

The United States has recently told Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s authorization that it is revoking the chipmaker’s authorization to ship essential gear to its main Chinese chipmaking site effective Dec. 31, 2025, the TSMC said.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has agreed to temporarily send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as immigration judges, according to a memo seen by AP News. Konstantin Toropin reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday reinstated Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to the Federal Trade Commission, with the majority of the court finding that Trump fired her without cause rather than on the statutory grounds of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Slaughter said she plans to resume work at her FTC office starting today. Cecilia Kang reports for the New York Times.

Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles violated federal law, a federal judge ruled yesterday, finding that the deployment overseen by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement without explicit permission from Congress. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

In a 2-1 decision, a federal appeals court in Texas yesterday ruled that Trump has failed to show that alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang his administration sought to summarily deport using the Alien Enemies Act mounted an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” against the United States. For this reason, Trump did not have the authority to invoke the Act to carry out the deportations, the majority of the court ruled. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

The potential harm caused by the Environmental Protection Agency’s rescission of unspent funding from the $20 billion “Green Bank” program to organizations that were meant to receive the funding is not irreparable, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday in a 2-1 decision. The majority of the court also found that the “grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims.” The majority lifted a lower court order that prevented the EPA from taking back the money while the litigation plays out. Rachel Frazin reports for the Hill; Alex Guillén reports for POLITICO.

Unions representing the employees of the National Weather Service and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office yesterday filed a lawsuit challenging Trump’s executive order that sought to end the staffers’ collective bargaining agreements with the government. Rachel Frazin reports for the Hill.

Trump yesterday said that he would appeal to the Supreme Court as soon as today a Friday ruling that found many of his tariffs to be illegal, and he would ask the justices to render their decision on an “expedited” timeline. Tony Romm and Ana Swanson report for the New York Times.

What is ICE’s downtown Milwaukee building used for?
What are the plans for ICE’s downtown office space?","It's been more than seven months since U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plans to move its Milwaukee offices sparked criticism from local elected officials and immigrants' rights advocates.

Now, renovations are moving forward at ICE’s new building on Milwaukee's northwest side, and the federal government has signed a year-long lease extension at its current downtown Milwaukee office.

Here’s what to know about the move:

Where are ICE’s current Milwaukee offices?

ICE has been based at 310 E. Knapp Street in downtown Milwaukee since 2001. The Milwaukee School of Engineering has owned the building since 2023 and leases it to ICE.

ICE’s lease was set to expire in April, but the school recently granted a one-year lease extension, according to MSOE spokeswoman JoEllen Burdue. The lease extension was first reported by Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service.

Burdue said the government has the option to extend the lease further to 2028.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, was also housed in the building until October 2024, when it moved to another downtown location at 310 W. Wisconsin Ave.

Both agencies are under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. USCIS handles visas and naturalization, while ICE deals with immigration enforcement.

What is ICE’s downtown Milwaukee building used for?

At the Knapp Street office, immigrants facing deportation meet with ICE staff for check-in appointments, and immigrant detainees are processed to be transported to other facilities. It is not organized to hold people overnight.

Detention data from the Vera Institute of Justice, which collected daily immigration detainee totals from federal open records requests, shows that the Knapp Street office is holding more detainees during the day on average than it did during the Biden administration.

During the first two months of the fiscal year — October and November 2024 — the Knapp Street office held an average of 0.3 people a day. That is to say, it held zero people most days.

In the last two months of available data — early April to early June — it held an average of about 2 people.

Four times in early summer, its detainee count hit double-digits. One day in early June, it held 22 people. Three days later, it held 17. None stayed overnight.

What are the plans for ICE’s downtown office space?

Since MSOE purchased the property in 2023, ICE has been planning to move into a business park on Milwaukee’s northwest side and MSOE had been intending to remodel the building into classrooms to house its Civil and Architectural Engineering and Construction Management department.

Those classrooms will now be located in the new Robert D. Kern Engineering Innovation Center, which is under construction.

The addition of the innovation center means that ""we don’t have immediate plans for the building at 310 E. Knapp St.,"" Burdue said in an email.

Where does ICE intend to move?

ICE is moving into a business park at 11925 West Lake Park Drive, on Milwaukee’s far northwest side.

The timeline for opening was not clear. City records over the last few months show standard building permits have been filed as renovations continue at that site.

Will ICE operate out of both buildings?

It’s unclear.

Burdue, the MSOE spokesperson, said ICE requested a one-year extension for the current downtown office space, as opposed to a long-term lease contract.

Milwaukee Ald. Robert Bauman, whose district includes the Knapp Street building, said he was told that ICE extended its lease, but he did not know why, and he has received no updates on the move since a February zoning committee meeting.

Representatives for both ICE and the General Services Administration, which handles federal real estate properties, referred a reporter to the other agency for comment. ICE did not answer follow-up questions about whether the agency planned to operate out of both buildings.

Representatives for the developer of the new offices, Illinois-based WD Schorsch, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.

What will the new ICE building be used for?

According to ICE’s 2023 development proposal, the site will be used to process detainees before they are transported to holding facilities elsewhere. It will also process people who are not detained but need to go to check-in appointments for their deportation cases.

The facility will have an 8-foot-tall privacy fence and a sally port, which is a secure entryway like those used in jails.

Despite early characterizations of the site as a “detention facility,” records from the city's zoning committee indicate it will be a processing center where immigrants are not held overnight and are soon taken elsewhere.

Employees would not commonly work on-site after 5 p.m. The offices would occupy about 17,000 square feet of the 32,000-square foot building, according to the proposal.

Where does ICE hold detainees overnight in Wisconsin?

Dodge County Jail is ICE’s only detention facility in Wisconsin. Unlike ICE’s downtown office, it holds detainees overnight.

The jail's daily headcount has remained steady since the fall, with about 105 to 106 immigration detainees a day.

The Waukesha County Jail holds certain inmates overnight for ICE as part of an agreement with the agency. Its ICE detainee population has increased in recent months, from a daily average of 0.2 inmates in the fall to 3.2 inmates in early summer.

Other local jails in Wisconsin also occasionally hold people for ICE.

To support the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement efforts, Congress approved $170 billion in additional funding to turbocharge immigration and border enforcement through 2029.

ICE is looking to rapidly expand its detention capacity as part of that effort.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/02/PMJS/abf80a7d-cdf6-4695-a9ff-0edc87002361-Knapp.jpg?crop=1279,720,x0,y64&width=1279&height=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-03 11:56:53.191006

Plus, despite the recruitment campaign, beefing up the already overstretched federal law enforcement force “is not going to happen quickly.","Across New York City, Los Angeles has been on the mind in a far darker way than the usual friendly rivalry between the nation’s two largest cities. Since June, Trump and his anti-immigration architect Stephen Miller have used LA as both testing ground and showcase for their shock-and-awe immigration and speech crackdown, sending teams of heavily armed and masked agents to raid workplaces and homes and then deploying federal agents and the National Guard to tamp down resulting protests.

This strategy has not been a success. Troops themselves have reportedly questioned their deployment and the administration has faced multiple lawsuits and some court losses amid cratering public support for its immigration actions – but it has produced some of the higher arrest numbers that Miller demanded, and the administration seems committed to continuing course. As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement begins receiving appropriations in excess of most of the world’s military budgets and goes on a hiring blitz, other jurisdictions have reason to worry about a franchising of the LA model. New York City is an obvious and prime candidate, with some inside Homeland Security already pointing to pressure to ramp up arrests.

A source familiar with internal discussions inside ICE’s New York City field office said agents are under pressure to increase arrests, with teams of federal agents otherwise assigned to tasks like financial and drug crimes being pulled into immigration enforcement. This has not yet translated to hyper-aggressive operations in New York City like the raids in LA, but within the agency the groundwork is being laid to be able to launch that type of campaign as soon as an order comes down.

That mounting concern has run up against relative silence from Mayor Eric Adams and his administration, who have largely reaffirmed they will “follow the law,” but stayed away from many specifics about whether and how they’re planning for the eventuality of an LA-style federal response here, alarming some advocates. New York City has faced enforcement, but it’s so far been largely confined to arrests at the immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza. “We do still continue to reach out and ask questions, often to hear kind of vague responses,” said New York City Council Member Alexa Avilés, chair of the Committee on Immigration.

West Coast nightmare

In LA, teams of heavily armed and often masked agents have for months set up checkpoints and raided worksites and areas where undocumented immigrants are thought to congregate, including Home Depots, which White House Deputy Chief of Staff Miller infamously implored field agents to to focus on instead of just targeting criminals. The constant presence and apparently random nature of the operations has caused people to pull back from aspects of public life. Parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

Multiple federal judges have found that the sweeps are indiscriminate and unconstitutionally profiled people based on factors like race and location, an argument bolstered by the fact that multiple U.S. citizens have been detained in the raids. An analysis of ICE data showed that an average of 88 people were being detained per day in a three-week period before a temporary restraining order came down. In addition to suspected immigration violators, federal agents arrested over 160 protesters, some who’d engaged in violence, but most of whom were not charged with any violent offense. The crackdown has had and probably will have huge deleterious impacts on the city’s economy.

In Los Angeles, parents aren’t dropping off kids at school and once-bustling public areas sit empty.

This approach has now spread to Washington, D.C., where Trump recently took over the local police force and began deploying federal officers and soldiers, who’ve reportedly engaged in hundreds of indiscriminate stops, checkpoints and arrests. Unlike the LA deployments, the rationale there has expanded beyond immigration to general criminal enforcement, adding another layer to the possible pretexts for potentially bringing roving federal patrols and troops to New York City. Immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in the capital are reportedly deserted as residents fear the indiscriminate enforcement, which has often involved a mix of federal agents at the exits to metro stations asking people for identification.

That approach could be easily ported over to New York City, with hundreds of subway stations that act as congregation points for people of all walks of life. Trump has now explicitly pledged to deploy troops in other cities, starting apparently with Chicago. A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that Trump’s use of the military in this manner was an illegal attempt to create “a national police force with the President as its chief,” blocking for now additional deployments in California, though the administration seems poised to move ahead with plans elsewhere. Federal law enforcement entities like ICE and the Border Patrol with their own military-style units, though, are free to keep operating.

Trump immigration coordinator and attack dog Tom Homan came to New York City in July to promise that the agency would “flood the zone.” (ICE acknowledged but did not respond to detailed questions about its planning for New York City.)

Mayor Adams was asked about these remarks and whether he’d had any conversations with Trump about it in an unrelated press conference the next day and answered mostly in terms of why such an operation would be unnecessary. “New York is moving in the right direction in public safety. (If) the federal government wants to assist us in really navigating some of the laws around easy accessibility to automatic weapons… I'm not part of the group that says we don't want to work in coordination with the federal government, but we don't need anyone to come in and take over our law enforcement apparatus,” the mayor said. That framing struck many as incomplete, if only because D.C. – experiencing record-low levels of crime – did not need this intervention either.

This leaves Adams in an awkward position. The former cop with the law-and-order calling card seems inclined to help fellow law enforcement, yet has watched ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol trigger disorder where they’ve focused their efforts. Public stats show that most arrestees have no criminal record. At the same time Adams, as an incumbent, is the underdog in a mayoral race in which front-runner Zohran Mamdani has gone the complete opposite direction, pledging (perhaps unrealistically) to halt ICE operations in New York City altogether.

So far, the relationship between the city and federal administrations has been something like an uneasy truce with occasional skirmishes. Adams has met multiple times with Homan, once declaring that he and the Trump official had the “same goal.” The Justice Department in February moved to drop pending federal charges against him in exchange for cooperation on immigration enforcement, though he denies the existence of any deal. In April, his administration moved to allow a new ICE office on Rikers Island, a policy since blocked as a result of a City Council lawsuit.

These overtures don’t mean all smooth sailing. Adams was named personally in a long-shot federal lawsuit filed by Trump’s Justice Department late last month seeking to overturn New York City’s sanctuary provisions. City Hall has sued the federal government over the sudden withdrawal of $80 million from the city’s coffers, and filed several legal briefs opposing ICE arrests of New York City students.

The NYPD’s options

Many sanctuary rules are not up to Adams but embedded in city law. In March, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch was reportedly forced to step in and block an operation that Deputy Mayor Kaz Daughtry had planned with Homan, which would have entailed NYPD directly assisting hundreds of ICE personnel in raids on two of the city’s makeshift migrant shelters. Tisch reportedly stopped the raids on the grounds that such cooperation was illegal.

“My impression is that Jessica Tisch has a more normal, traditional attitude toward constitutional law,” mused Daniel Feldman, a professor at John Jay and former Assembly member who’s an expert in administrative law and enforcement. “If, for any reason, she's under pressure to mobilize the NYPD, perhaps in lieu of federal troops, I would assume what they would do is pretty much what the National Guard folks did in LA, which is, yeah, they were there, but didn't really do anything. They just stood there.” Still, even in LA which has its own sanctuary laws, some advocates contended that local law enforcement were de facto assisting ICE under the mission of preserving public order – not slapping the cuffs on immigrants but enabling federal raids by keeping onlookers at bay.

“If and when they decide they're going to send more people here to do an LA-style enforcement action, I think what we're going to see is communities standing up and fighting for their neighbors,” said Murad Awawdeh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. Awawdeh expressed frustrations over what he described as a relatively muted administration response to their urging for public reassurances.

“In New York City, we have very comprehensive non-collusion laws on the books. We want to make sure that the City of New York knows that it is not the job of the NYPD to collude with immigration enforcement,” said Awawdeh. “What we would be urging this administration to be doing is ensuring that as New Yorkers are being attacked, that they do what's in their power to defend them.”

How to protect

What would it look like for the city to not just decline to help ICE but actively constrain it and provide help to its targets? Avilés said requiring agents to show their faces is a start. “We see (ICE agents) don't like to follow the law. It doesn't have anything to do with safety. So then the question becomes, can we get these agents to unmask themselves?” said Avilés. In addition to identification, there are pushes to have the city ensure that agents actually have warrants and stay out of sensitive locations, such as schools.

How city law enforcement could or could not intervene would be up to debate and possibly litigation. “The (federal) government can't command the police to help, they can demand that the police not obstruct, or demand that any state not obstruct. Obviously, the line between failure to cooperate and obstruction is one that gets fought over,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and current law professor at Columbia who’s written about interactions between federal and local law enforcement. “To the extent that warrants are legally required, I can imagine a jurisdiction enforcing that constitutional framework. But beyond that, no, federal officers get to do what is legally appropriate to carry out federal law, and can't be barred from doing so by a state or local government.”

Feldman, the John Jay professor, said it might be feasible for the city to not interfere with immigration operations but engage in other constitutional functions. “Where I think the NYPD can legitimately, practically speaking, operate is protecting protesters. As we know, there have been physical conflicts between ICE and some protesters,” he said. “Planning how to prevent that from happening, and assuring safety and exercise of civil liberties at the same time, that should be the focus of their attention at this point.”

Even if those plans are being developed, Feldman doesn’t necessarily agree with the advocates that the city should be talking about them. “Frankly, if I was the (NYPD) commissioner, I wouldn't reveal my plans either. Why? I mean, there's potentially such a fraught, if not adversarial, position with the federal government, why do you want to tell them in advance what your strategy is, to empower them to figure out a counter-strategy?”

If I were in the police department, one, I would not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties. And two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone.

Daniel Richman law professor at Columbia and former federal prosecutor

Richman agrees. “If I were in the Police Department, one, I would keep my principles in mind but not think that I can devise a detailed playbook given the number of uncertainties; and two, to the extent that there’s any playbook, I sure as hell wouldn't tell anyone,” he said. He pointed out that despite the signals that Trump and Homan might ramp up operations in New York City, there are still a lot of uncertainties about how they might do that – whether workplace raids or checkpoints or more of the courthouse arrests. Plus, despite the recruitment campaign, beefing up the already overstretched federal law enforcement force “is not going to happen quickly. The city obviously has to prepare for that surge, but they have quite a lot of time to do that.”

Whatever the reason, City Hall is treading carefully with what they say. Often-chatty Adams officials did not respond to questions I sent.

In a statement, City Hall spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak wrote that “New York City continues to be a place where sensitive locations – like our schools and churches – are safe and free of non-local law enforcement. The Adams administration has also ensured that, at this time of heightened anxiety, New York City provides the largest immigrant legal services and support network in the nation,” pointing to the city’s new Office to Facilitate Pro Bono Legal Services and funding for know your rights efforts and legal representation. She did not address on the record questions about the NYPD’s directives around contending with the possibility of, for example, ICE workplace raids and roving patrols.

While waiting for the city to roll out something more concrete, advocates are focusing more on the ground level. “Communities, institutions, rapid response network, mutual aid groups, and organizations across the city and the state are actually creating their own plans of how they're going to respond to what's happening,” said Awawdeh, though he declined to get into specifics on the record. They’re holding their cards close to the vest, while hoping that behind the city’s silence is a plan, too.",https://cdn.cityandstateny.com/media/img/cd/2025/09/02/GettyImages_2228666321/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 06:57:02.461061

The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba have criminal convictions, but had all served their sentences and been released in the US, their lawyers said. The US deported them to the small southern African country without warning in July, claiming they were “depraved monsters”.

The US has sent migrants to several third countries, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up deportations. Eight men were sent to South Sudan in July, Rwanda accepted seven migrants last week and Uganda has agreed to take in asylum seekers. The US also deported 252 Venezuelans, first sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador for four months.

The lawyers said they have been unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are allowed one short video call a week in the presence of prison staff. A local lawyer representing the five men has been prevented from visiting them in the maximum security Matsapha correctional centre.

The Emaswati lawyer filed a case demanding access to the men, but a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed when the judge did not show up, said Alma David, who is representing the Yemeni and Cuban men.

When the men, who had all been in the US since they were children, were first deported, US assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed they were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.”

In response, Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Smith, said: “The government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” and would work to return any deportees to the country. She later said that diplomats visited Orville Etoria in prison in Eswatini on 21 August and found him “in good spirits”.

Etoria, 62, came to the US legally in 1976, aged 12, said his lawyer Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1997. He obtained an undergraduate degree in prison, was released on parole in 2021 and was working in a men’s shelter and studying for a master’s degree in divinity when he was deported.

He had been reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as required and obtained a Jamaican passport earlier this year at their request. His relatives told Unger he had first been put on a plane to Jamaica and then removed, she said, adding that his being sent to Eswatini “makes no sense”.

Relatives of the four other men did not want their identities disclosed, their lawyers said. The Yemeni man, who served 22 years in prison for murder and was released in 2020, had been living in Michigan and is 70, his lawyer Alma David said.

The Cuban man, who served nine years for murder, is in his mid-50s and had been working for a plumbing company in Florida. He was released from prison after serving a separate sentence for grand theft auto in 2012, David said.

She spoke to both men while all five deportees were with guards and the prison chief, who said that only the US embassy in Eswatini could grant access to the men. “Since when does the US embassy have jurisdiction over Eswatini’s national prisons?” she said.

Tin Thanh Nguyen, representing the Vietnamese and Laotian deportees, said the men were aged 34 and 45 and released in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The Laotian man’s relatives reported he was starting to show signs of depression.

“The United States is outsourcing their detention … to purge the United States of immigrants and refugees and to make a spectacle of deportations,” Nguyen said.

Last month, a group of Eswatini NGOs challenged the country’s acceptance of the deportees on constitutional grounds, arguing that parliament had not been consulted and that the men’s human rights were being violated.

An Eswatini government spokesperson said they would not be responding while court cases were under way.

“Weeks ago, I arranged an on-site meeting this coming Friday at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s headquarters in Springfield, Va., to connect with the nonpartisan career intelligence professionals who serve our country every day. These are Virginians – my constituents – and I have held more than a dozen similar private listening sessions with NGA and other intelligence agencies in Virginia under both Democratic and Republican presidents, including during President Trump’s first term. Engagements such as these are a core part of my responsibility to provide oversight and support to our intelligence community and hear from Americans who live in Virginia, and they have never been questioned or politicized, until now.

“Over the weekend, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer discovered the unpublicized, classified visit and launched a campaign of baseless attacks against both me and NGA Director Vice Admiral Trey Whitworth for hosting what has always been considered a routine oversight meeting. In response to Loomer’s criticism, political appointees canceled the visit, just the latest example of an administration seemingly desperate to please Loomer, a figure with a long history of extreme and outlandish fringe views, including 9/11 denialism, anti-Muslim harassment campaigns, and associations with white supremacists.

“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security. Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe. This should concern Republicans as well as Democrats: if routine oversight can be obstructed for political reasons, no member of Congress is immune.

“Let me be clear: I will never be deterred from carrying out my constitutional responsibilities. The business of government and the security of our nation will not be dictated by extremist attention-seekers. I will continue to hold the government accountable and meet with the career intelligence professionals who keep our country safe.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday that it would pay state and local law-enforcement officers' salaries and benefits in places where governments join a program to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The offer, which begins October 1, would also provide up to 25% of an officer's salary in overtime costs and bonuses to agencies based on performance, DHS said.

President Donald Trump's administration aims to deport record numbers of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and has intensified enforcement across the country.

The Republican-led Congress in July passed a spending package that gave U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement $75 billion over a little more than four years, a funding surge that ICE plans to use to ramp up operations.

The Trump administration has worked to expand so-called 287(g) immigration-enforcement partnerships with state and local law enforcement, and their number has risen from 135 to 958 since Trump took office in January, DHS said.

Immigrant advocates say the agreements sow mistrust of law enforcement in immigrant communities and could lead to racial profiling.

The partnerships fall under a program called the Task Force Model that was terminated under former President Barack Obama but restarted in Trump's second term. It allows state and local law enforcement to make immigration arrests while performing their policing duties.

In a June fact sheet, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights called it ""the most dangerous and invasive"" form of the Task Force Model. A Justice Department investigation in 2012 found that North Carolina sheriffs illegally stopped and detained Latino drivers under the program.

Nayna Gupta, policy director of the pro-immigration American Immigration Council, said tasking local police with immigration work means they spend less time on ""actual public safety threats in our own communities and immigrants become scared to report actual crimes.""

Yadira Córdoba’s arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Aug. 20 in San Antonio has rattled Nicaragua’s exile community.

Córdoba, a Nicaraguan mother demanding justice for the murder of her 15-year-old son during a May 30, 2018 march in Nicaragua, was arrested during a routine immigration court appointment on August 20. She has been in the United States seeking asylum since 2023.

The U.S Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for comment.

Córdoba is scheduled to have an expedited removal hearing on September 22. The American Immigration Council describes this process to be one by which noncitizens can be removed from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.

Undocumented immigrants placed in expedited removal proceedings are entitled to access the asylum system if they express fear of persecution, torture, or of returning to their home country.

The process can be flawed for a number of reasons, including a lack of judicial review and a backlog of asylum applications.

Córdoba faces the real risk of being deported to Nicaragua, where she has been targeted for persecution by the Ortega-Murillo regime.

Human rights organizations warn that her life is in danger if she is returned to Nicaragua.

Following the death of Córdoba’s 15-year-old son, Orlando, she became one of the most prominent voices demanding justice for victims of state repression.

She has since then been a high-profile figure in Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and is a member of the Mothers of April, a group that has become a symbol of resistance, demanding accountability and an end to the authoritarian regime in Nicaragua.

“The Mothers of April is made up of women whose children were killed. These are not politicians. They are schoolteachers, nurses, housewives—ordinary people who became activists because of unbearable loss. Their demand is simple: truth, justice, and guarantees of non-repetition,” said Félix Maradiaga, an opposition activist, former presidential candidate, and now professor at the University of Virginia and Johns Hopkins University.

Maradiaga added that “Yadira Córdoba is a name very well known in Nicaragua. She always spoke from a nonpartisan and nonpolitical perspective around the issues of justice, human rights, and democracy.” After her son’s assassination, she became a relentless spokesperson for the Mothers of April.

Córdoba’s activism came at a cost. She faced threats and persecution, forcing her into exile in Costa Rica in 2019. But even there she was not safe. “Let’s remember there have been assassination attempts against Nicaraguan activists there, and even killings. She did what any of us would do—flee to save her life,” said Maradiaga.

There have been documented assassination attempts and killings of Nicaraguan exiles in Costa Rica as part of a pattern of transnational repression orchestrated by the Nicaraguan government. Recent prominent cases include the killing of activist Roberto Samcam in 2025, the killing of Jaime Luis Ortega in 2024, and attacks against Joao Maldonado in 2023, though Costa Rica's president has denied Nicaraguan operatives are active in the country.

In 2023, Córdoba resettled in the United States, where she sought protection under U.S. asylum law. Her detention this month stunned Maradiaga and other exiles. “This was a shock to many of us,” he said. Yadira is an internationally recognized case. Her testimony has been recorded by the European Union, by the Organization of American States, by the United Nations, even raised before the U.N. Security Council. The U.S. government itself, during the first Trump administration, issued statements condemning the assassination of her son.

“That one of the most well-documented cases of extrajudicial killing could now result in deportation—it is absolutely outrageous.”

According to Pablo Cuevas, who’s part of Córdoba’s legal team, the issue is rooted in a technicality. “She entered undocumented and did not have a credible fear interview upon entry. That was later corrected, but ICE is treating it as a violation rather than a technicality”, explained Cordova.

The risk Córdoba faces if deported is severe. “Her life would be at risk,” Maradiaga said. “The regime does not need intelligence reports to know who Yadira is. She has spoken at international forums. If she is returned, she would not only be persecuted but could be disappeared.”

The Sandinista regime has built an extensive surveillance apparatus known as SORM, a Russian-designed system that compiles data into a centralized database. Anyone interrogated by authorities is entered into this system, which can pull information from social media, police records, and even neighborhood informants aligned with the Sandinista Party. Something as minor as a traffic ticket or a Facebook post from years ago can trigger inclusion. Local party members feed names into community lists, which are then passed up to regional representatives, ultimately creating a nationwide registry of citizens under scrutiny. For Nicaraguans who return after migrating—whether deported or coming back voluntarily—the consequences vary.

Maradiaga pointed out that “economic migrants are often forced to sign documents pledging not to criticize the regime. But political cases are different. Those deported activists simply disappear. Their families are too afraid to speak. That’s the kind of police state we are facing.”

He drew a sharp contrast between the U.S. government’s public support for Nicaragua’s pro-democracy movement and the flaws of its asylum system. “Asylum should be hard, and it should be rigorous. But the problem is inconsistency. Some cases without strong documentation are approved, while cases like Yadira’s—with extraordinary proof—are denied. That is what confuses and frightens people.”

Maradiaga himself continues to live in limbo in the U.S. after being released and banished from Nicaragua along with 221 other political prisoners in February 2023. “Neither my wife’s asylum case nor mine has been approved after seven years, despite recognition from U.S. authorities. We have chosen to stay in the asylum system as an act of solidarity with fellow Nicaraguans, to experience its flaws from within, and to speak with legitimacy.”

For Maradiaga, Córdoba’s story is more than an individual case. “When you see humble women—mothers who never imagined becoming political actors—stand up to the dictatorship, you see the real Nicaragua,” said Maradiaga. Yadira’s story is not only about her son Orlando. It is about a movement of mothers who refuse to be silenced.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31e29df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+144/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2Fa4%2F93621b374a64ab4c82938d1c8891%2F64954120-0a2b-49f5-b3c3-2c38fe92a0ec.JPG,N,,2025-09-03 01:57:16.350706

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday filed a joint motion to dismiss an appeal filed by the federal government in 2023 after a district judge sided with the state.

The joint motion cited changes in immigration policies after President Donald Trump replaced former President Joe Biden in January.

“President Trump has since taken office and directed the Department of Homeland Security to reexamine certain immigration policies from the previous administration,” the motion filed at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.

The motion came after lawyers from the state and federal governments asked the Atlanta-based appeals court in June to put the appeal on hold while they tried to resolve it.

Moody filed a lawsuit in September 2021 as she and Gov. Ron DeSantis made a high-profile issue of criticizing the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues. The lawsuit involved “parole” policies, which related to undocumented immigrants being released from detention after crossing the country’s southwest border.

U.S. District Judge T. Kent Wetherell issued two rulings in 2023 that said policies, known as “Parole Plus Alternatives to Detention” and “Parole with Conditions,” violated federal law. But the Biden administration appealed the rulings.

Before attorneys asked in June to put the case on hold, the appeals court had directed the two sides to file additional briefs and pointed to an executive order that Trump issued after taking office Jan. 20. The executive order said the Department of Homeland Security should “terminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States.”

“Given the change in presidential administration and immigration policies, we must determine whether this case has become moot. … A case becomes moot when events after its commencement ‘create a situation in which the court can no longer give the plaintiff meaningful relief,”” the appeals court said in calling for the additional briefs, partially quoting a legal precedent.

The state argued in the case that the Biden administration violated laws through “catch-and-release” policies. The state contended that undocumented immigrants moved to Florida and created costs for such things as the education, health-care and prison systems.

The appeals court, however, questioned whether Florida had legal standing to challenge the immigration policies. That came after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas and Louisiana did not have standing to challenge certain immigration policies.

DeSantis in January appointed Moody to the U.S. Senate to replace Marco Rubio, who became U.S. secretary of state. DeSantis subsequently appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, to serve as attorney general.

The DeSantis administration has taken a series of steps designed to help Trump’s efforts to deport people in the country illegally.

“The termination of any of the current countries that receive Temporary Protected Status directly affects our immigrant communities in San Francisco,” said District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder, who introduced a non-binding resolution urging the California federal delegation to urge Congress to establish a permanent pathway for Temporary Protected Status holders.

The Trump Administration’s order has been upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and on Sept. 8, the immigrants will lose their protected status – this includes their ability to remain in the United States or to work here legally.

By Fielder’s side at the steps of City Hall were Supervisors Myrna Melgar, Chyanne Chen, Shamann Walton, and Bilal Mahmood. The resolution itself which passed with a unanimous vote on Tuesday afternoon at the Board of Supervisor meeting.

“As your city attorney, I can share with you that our office is doing everything we can to stand with our immigrants because we know how far our country has fallen from the promise of the Statue of Liberty,” said City Attorney David Chiu, whose office filed amicus briefs on July 29 highlighting the “deep integration into American society” of the city’s immigrant population, and warning that ending their status would “cause irreparable harm” to communities.

“We have to stand together,” Chiu said to the 30 or so people who attended the rally.

Created by the U.S. Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, “Temporary Protected Status” protects nationals from countries undergoing civil wars or environmental disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, drought and epidemics from deportation.

A Temporary Protected Status designation has to be renewed every six, 12 or 18 months, depending on the arrangement.

Kimberly, a city worker attending the rally, said that this had been true for her mother, Janeth. She arrived in Los Angeles at age 23, after being displaced from Honduras by Hurricane Mitch.

Violence, disease, and infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane made returning to Honduras dangerous enough that the U.S. kept renewing TPS status for Hondurans.

Like many other TPS holders, the only way for her mother to stay in the United States was to renew her TPS status every two years, Kimberly said. Progressing from TPS status to a green card or citizenship is difficult, and her mother wasn’t able to obtain either.

“The only thing that they give you with TPS is work authorization and deportation protection and to be legally present here,” Kimberly said. “So it literally is just for labor.” Her mother spent the last two decades working as a nurse at Kaiser.

But Sept. 8, 2025 will be her last day. Her mother is not willingly retiring, Kimberly said. Her employment is terminated because of the Aug. 20 court ruling that allowed the Trump administration to proceed with terminating TPS status for several countries, including Honduras.

NPR reported that the decision will impact some 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans, whose TPS designations are set to expire on Sept. 8, as well as some 7,000 people from Nepal whose designations will expire on Aug. 5. Once their designations expire, these immigrants will face deportation.

Kimberly said that her mother has been working seven days straight ahead of her layoff on Sept. 8. “She needs all the money that she can get because she has a mortgage,” Kimberly said.

Her mother has no idea if she can get her money from her retirement account or her pension in any way if she’s in Honduras. She doesn’t know if she will have a chance to be called into work on Monday, Sept. 8. She doesn’t have any family in Honduras anymore.

“Mentally, she’s not okay,” Kimberly said. “Physically, she’s still showing up.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2215-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 02:56:28.339808

The news conference came just moments after President Donald Trump told reporters ""we're going in"" when asked about a slew of circulating rumors that the White House has plans to send troops to Chicago to address crime.

""Rumors have been swirling about what the White House has planned, and sifting fact from fiction has been increasingly difficult because Donald Trump's administration is not working in coordination with the city of Chicago, Cook County or the state of Illinois,"" Pritzker said.

While no official announcement has been made, the Trump administration has reportedly been planning to send National Guard members to Chicago in a similar manner to how they were deployed to Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, according to the National Guard and other outlets.

Pritzker confirmed to NBC Chicago’s Mary Ann Ahern just hours before the press conference that ICE agents will be conducting enhanced immigration enforcement operations in the city in coming days.

""[They said] they will begin operations here sometime in the coming week,"" Pritzker said in the exclusive interview. ""That - literally after two weeks of all this talk about troops on the ground - that's the first time we've heard from the federal government on this.""

Pritzker also said during the press conference that he believes staging for federal enforcement in Chicago has ""already begun.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke alongside Pritzker during the news conference Tuesday.

Trump is ""worried about the wrong border,"" Johnson said. ""We don't have an immigration crisis in Chicago, we have a gun crisis.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a contract with the spyware maker last year, which had been under a stop work order pending review.

The following can be attributed to Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University:

“Reports that ICE has renewed its contract with spyware vendor Paragon compounds the civil liberties concerns surrounding the rapid and dramatic expansion of ICE’s budget and authority. Spyware like Paragon’s Graphite poses a profound threat to free speech and privacy. It has already been used against journalists, human rights advocates, and political dissidents around the world. The quiet lifting of the stop work order also raises the troubling prospect that parts of the executive branch are acting without adherence to the government’s own vetting requirements. Congress should step in to limit the circumstances in which spyware technology can be deployed.”

In 2022, the Knight Institute filed a lawsuit on behalf of journalists and other members of El Faro—one of Central America’s foremost independent news organizations, based in El Salvador—who were the victims of spyware attacks using NSO Group’s Pegasus technology. In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had abused its discretion in dismissing the lawsuit and remanded the case for further consideration.

“Procedural fairness is a cornerstone of our legal system and a safeguard against error,” Finlay said in a media release from the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC). “Expressly removing it from decisions about third country transfers risks serious harm and sets a troubling precedent.”

In the media release, Finlay warned that the changes contemplated via the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill 2025 could:

Undermine human rights

Breach Australia’s international legal obligations

Deprive those removed of a meaningful opportunity to respond to decisions with major impacts on their lives, health, safety, and families

“These amendments strip away one of the most basic legal protections of a fair society: the right to be heard,” Finlay said in the media release.

Finlay added that the bill would validate relevant visa decisions retrospectively. According to Finlay, this change could entail retrospective criminal liability, significant concerns regarding the rule of law, and the need for careful scrutiny.

Finlay encouraged Parliament to examine the bill to ensure it would not undermine Australia’s human rights obligations.

“Fairness should never be optional,” Finlay said.

Finlay also urged Parliament to consider the contemplated changes in their broader context,

“Rather than a patchwork of reactive responses, we need to ensure principled migration and asylum policies that maintain the integrity of Australia’s migration system while also upholding our human rights obligations,” Finlay said.

Context of changes

In its media release, the AHRC noted that the planned amendments were part of the government’s response to recent High Court rulings, including NZYQ v Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs (2023), 280 CLR 137; [2023] HCA 37.

NZYQ determined that indefinite immigration detention – where there was no real prospect of a detainee’s removal from Australia becoming practicable within the reasonably foreseeable future – was unconstitutional.

NZYQ resulted in the release from immigration detention of hundreds of detainees whom the relevant authorities could not deport to their country of origin, as well as legislative changes permitting the government to pay third countries to accept non-citizens under third country reception arrangements.

According to the bill’s explanatory memoranda on Parliament’s website, the proposed changes would provide that the rules of natural justice would be inapplicable to third country reception arrangements.

In a 2-1 decision, the District of Columbia circuit court of appeals allowed a lower court decision in favor of Slaughter to take effect, rejecting the Trump administration’s request to delay the ruling during its appeal.

The court said that FTC commissioners may not be fired by a president without cause, saying that the law on this point has been clear for nearly a century.

“The government is not likely to succeed on appeal because any ruling in its favor from this court would have to defy binding, on-point, and repeatedly preserved supreme court precedent,” two judges wrote in the majority opinion.

A third judge, Trump appointee Neomi Rao, dissented, saying that federal courts likely have no authority “to order the reinstatement of an officer removed by the president”.

Slaughter said on Tuesday that she was heartened by the ruling and that Trump is “not above the law”.

“I’m very eager to get back first thing tomorrow to the work I was entrusted to do on behalf of the American people,” Slaughter said in an emailed statement.

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The FTC enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws.

Trump had appointed Slaughter to her first term on the FTC in 2018. Joe Biden designated her as the FTC’s acting chair in January 2021, and Biden appointed her to a second term in 2023, which is to end in September 2029.

A federal judge ruled in July that the Trump administration’s attempt to remove Slaughter did not comply with removal protections in federal law.

Under the FTC’s bipartisan structure, no more than three of the five commissioners can come from the same party. Congress placed restrictions on the hiring and firing of commissioners in an effort to insulate the agency from partisan politics.

Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners on the FTC in March, in a major test for the independence of regulatory agencies.

The dispute over Trump’s firing of Slaughter and fellow commissioner Alvaro Bedoya will likely end up before the supreme court, which ruled 90 years ago that FTC commissioners may be dismissed only for good cause, such as neglecting their duties. Bedoya formally resigned in June to take another job and is not part of the case.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9595704e6540623da8f5f0c2d852cb65fd9546fe/120_0_3634_2907/master/3634.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbb4b51f4dcbd8f78ff122f7e03bd78f",N,,2025-09-03 01:57:36.961900

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama.","MEXICO CITY (AP) — More than 14,000 mainly Venezuelan migrants who hoped to reach the United States have reversed course and turned south since U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown began, according to a report published Friday by the governments of Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica.

The phenomenon, known as “reverse flow” migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border between Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023, when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday's report, published with the support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97% this year.

Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia by those countries' ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%), and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally enter the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and others.

That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

Now, those migrants who were still trying to reach the U.S. have reversed course, traveling back to South America. Around a quarter of those interviewed planned to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Colombia and other South American nations spent years pleading for aid from the international community to cope with the brunt of Venezuela's migratory crisis, before many of those same migrants began moving toward the United States.

“Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,"" Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said in a statement. “We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.”

The shift marks a radical reversal in one of the biggest mass migrations in the world.

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama. From there, migrants pay between $260 and $280 to ride on precarious boats packed with people back to Colombia.

They take two different routes. Most island hop north of Panama through the Caribbean Sea, landing in the small town of Necocli, Colombia, where many started their journeys through the Darien.

Others travel south by sea along a jungled swath of Panama and Colombia through the Pacific Ocean, where they are dropped off in remote towns or the Colombian city of Buenaventura. The region is one of the most violent in Colombia, and the lack of state presence is filled by warring armed groups.",https://epsilon.creativecirclecdn.com/christianindex/original/20250902-080352-c60-AP25240816520264.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 23:56:33.518705

WASHINGTON – U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem today terminated multiple Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees for consuming pornographic content during work hours while on government issued devices. During the investigation into FEMA employees’ conduct, DHS discovered that almost half of FEMA’s employees regularly log into social media platforms while performing their taxpayer funded duties.

“Today, I am announcing that multiple disgraced FEMA employees were fired for using their government devices to consume sexually explicit content while on the job. These individuals had access to critical information and intelligence and were entrusted to safeguard Americans from emergencies—and instead they were consuming pornography. In at least one case the pornography consumed was racially charged and involved bestiality,”said Secretary Noem. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we are cleaning house at FEMA to make this dysfunctional agency work for the American people the way that it was intended. For decades some of these bureaucrats engaged in every act imaginable instead of safeguarding the American people from natural disasters. That ends now.”

On July 12, 2025, The DHS’s Insider Threat Operations Center (ITOC) identified that one employee typed explicit and sexually charged phrases into a chatbot website from his government devices for the purpose of having the comments read back to him in an accent.

On August 1, 2025, another individual, a government contracted employee also stationed at the command center was identified by the ITOC as accessing Reddit.com 578 times over a 30-day period. It was revealed that he was engaged in extensive interactions with individuals online, viewing explicit sexual content while on his work devices. He accessed content that included graphic photographs and videos. On several occasions, he used his government computer to chat online with members presenting explicit content.

DHS actively investigates the misuse of devices throughout the agency to ensure that employees are not abusing federal devices or sharing classified or sensitive information.

A recent report from Hatewatch, the extremism watchdog run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, shows how the agency and top Trump administration officials have ramped up their promotion of white nationalist or anti-immigrant social media posts since June, when the agency reposted anti-immigrant propaganda that originated from an avowedly racist social media account.

MSNBC has noted the agency’s propaganda in the past, including their use of cruel memes that vilify nonwhite immigrants and of American artworks to promote themes of ethnic cleansing.

The Hatewatch report takes a comprehensive look at these incidents since June, citing an apparent increase in racist propaganda as part of what the watchdog calls “an escalating trend in American immigration enforcement toward overt use of white nationalist and anti-immigrant myths to recruit personnel and justify departmental operations.”

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to MSNBC’s request for comment on Hatewatch’s claims. When asked last month by NBC’s Los Angeles affiliate about the campaign, the DHS called its digital strategy “bold and effective.”

Here’s one example Hatewatch flagged:

In one recruitment poster, published on Aug. 11, a white Uncle Sam caricature in the style of a Norman Rockwell painting stands at a crossroads of directional signs that include such phrases as “INVASION,” “CULTURAL DECLINE,” “HOMELAND” and “LAW & ORDER.” The poster includes the caption “Which way, American man?” — which appears to be a nod to the influential white nationalist text Which Way Western Man? by William Gayley Simpson. Published by an imprint associated with the neo-Nazi National Alliance, the book is a reflection and critique of society from Simpson’s travels. While critical of some aspects of society, it largely frames Western civilization as superior and veers into sexist and antisemitic commentary.

To some online observers, like author and conspiracy theory expert Mike Rothschild, this apparent nod to an unabashed bigot was hardly subtle:

The report notes that multiple Trump administration figures in senior leadership roles have ties to racist organizations or have been known to espouse white nationalist themes. That includes border czar Tom Homan, who collaborated with anti-Muslim hate group The United West on his “Defend the Border” project, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, whose white nationalist views first came under scrutiny during Trump’s first term.

The report also refers to multiple posts from DHS that promote the idea of forging friendships or strengthening familial bonds over the targeting of immigrants.

WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a public comment opposing the Department of Labor’s (DOL) proposed rule, “Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Domestic Service,” which would eliminate hard-won wage and hour protections for millions of the nation’s paid caregivers, who are disproportionately Black and Brown women and are among the poorest workers in the labor force.

The proposal would change the definition of in-home “companionship” services under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the federal law whose protections include a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay for work performed beyond 8 hours in a single day, or 40 hours in a single week. Under the proposed new definition, millions of home care workers would no longer be entitled to those protections. Additionally, while agencies and other third-party employers of home care workers currently are required to comply with the FLSA, DOL proposes to excuse those employers from the statute’s requirements. These actions would undo DOL’s 2013 regulations, which extended FLSA protections to home care workers after decades of exclusion.

“Even though they currently are entitled to receive the minimum wage and overtime, home care workers are among the most vulnerable in our nation’s labor force, facing wage theft and unsafe working conditions, and living in poverty,” said Gillian Thomas, senior counsel in the ACLU Women's Rights Project. “The Department of Labor ’s proposed rule change would strip away the meager economic security that FLSA coverage provides to these essential workers, who take care of our elders and our loved ones with disabilities. By enabling greater exploitation by corporate home care providers, DOL will drive more workers out of a field already facing a profound labor shortage and deprive millions of families of the care they rely on.”

ACLU’s comment highlights that the exclusion of home care workers from the FLSA’s protections stems directly from the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. When Congress passed labor laws like FLSA and the Social Security Act in the 1930s, lawmakers carved out from those statutes’ coverage domestic workers as well as agricultural workers—the two fields in which formerly enslaved people and their descendants were most likely to work—in order to win southern lawmakers’ support. Although Congress eventually amended the FLSA to bring such workers within the law’s protection, DOL did not fully effectuate that intent until it issued regulations in 2013.

“Today, home care workers still are disproportionately women of color, and most of whom are women and people of color, provide essential care yet remain among the poorest and least protected in our economy. Rescinding DOL’s 2013 rules not only will make them much poorer—it will shamefully revive a legal exclusion firmly rooted in racism and misogyny,” added Thomas.

DOL’s 2013 rule recognized the realities of the modern home care industry, in which workers are well-trained professionals who are supporting families of their own, and in which third-party agencies—rather than care recipients themselves—employ care workers, reaping billions in profits. Entitlement to minimum wage and overtime pay has provided economic security for a workforce made up overwhelmingly of women, and particularly Black women and immigrant women. Such protections not only have helped lift wages for one of the nation’s lowest-paid professions, but also has ensured stable, quality care for seniors and people with disabilities.

ACLU’s comment further explains that the proposed rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act. DOL has effectively suspended the 2013 rule without proper notice and comment, and its justifications for abandoning longstanding protections are arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful.

The ACLU urges the department to preserve the 2013 rule, which corrected a historic injustice, advanced gender and racial equity, and strengthened the home care workforce.

The Trump administration has decided to get more immigration judges from an unprecedented source: the military.

On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported that the Pentagon plans to send up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to temporarily run immigration courts around the country. Some of them could receive their new assignments as early as next week.

The arrangement would help the Trump administration tackle a backlog of immigration cases. But military lawyers have little or no experience with immigration law. And some former military lawyers worry the plan isn’t even legal. It “should raise all sorts of alarms,” Daniel Maurer, a former Army attorney who also taught law at West Point, told me recently.

I spoke with Maurer in July, after President Trump first hinted that he’d be open to the idea of deploying military attorneys—known as Judge Advocate Generals, or JAGs—as immigration judges in Florida. That idea, floated by Gov. Ron DeSantis, hadn’t yet come to fruition. “There is no clear precedent for what DeSantis and the president are doing,” Mark Nevitt, a law professor at Emory University who served as a Navy JAG, told me at the time.

“This would be unlawful,” added Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles who was an Air Force JAG.

In particular, VanLandingham said, turning military lawyers into immigration judges would likely violate the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that bars US troops from participating in civilian law enforcement or “executing the laws,” unless otherwise authorized to do so by the Constitution or Congress. It’s “frightening,” VanLandingham said of the plan, because “the use of military courts to hear civilian cases is the essential component of martial law.”

“What you end up with,” Maurer added, “is military officers under federal control who are running civilian courts.”

The former JAGs gamed out several scenarios (see my previous story for more details), but they couldn’t imagine any in which it would be legal for the Pentagon to turn military attorneys into immigration judges, that is, unless Congress were to pass a law that allowed it, or Trump invoked the Insurrection Act, which gives the commander in chief power to deploy military forces within the United States to suppress rebellion or domestic violence.

And if Trump went that route, there would be no turning back, according to Raquel Aldana, a law professor at the University of California, Davis: “The reality is that, once he does, the powers can be unlimited and we are in a military state.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2Sept2025_JAGs.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-02 19:56:31.124090

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people.
Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy.
If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.
At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves.","It’s been 10 years since Angela Merkel, as German chancellor, memorably declared “Wir schaffen das” — “We can do this” — in the face of the mass migration crisis sweeping Europe. Last week The Wall Street Journal reported, “For the first time, populist or far-right parties are leading the polls in the U.K., France and Germany.” Similar parties are already in power or in government in Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, to say nothing of the United States.

To say the West’s turn to the anti-immigrant right was the predictable result of Merkel’s calamitous decision to open Germany’s borders does not mean there aren’t still lessons to be learned from it — not least by the world’s most clueless of all major political parties today, the Democratic Party.

Starting around 20 years ago, perhaps earlier, liberal democracy gained two half-siblings: postliberal democracy and preliberal democracy.

Preliberal democracy accepts the practice of regular elections but rejects most of the core values of liberalism: free speech and moral tolerance, civil liberties and the rights of the accused, the rule of law and independence of courts, the equality of women and so on. Turkey under the long reign of Recep Tayyip Erdogan typifies this type of democracy, as did Egypt under the short reign of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi.

Postliberal democracy, by contrast, embraces the values of liberalism but tries to insulate itself from the will of the people. The European Union, with its vast architecture of transnational legislation, is one example of postliberalism; international courts, issuing rulings where they have no jurisdiction, are another; global environmental accords, like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (signed by the Obama administration but never ratified by Congress), are a third.

Standing between these two models is old-fashioned liberal democracy. Its task is to manage the tension, or temper the opposition, between competing imperatives: to accept majority will and protect individual right, to defend a nation’s sovereignty while maintaining a spirit of openness, to preserve its foundational principles while adapting to change. If the frustration of liberal democracy is that it tends to proceed in half-steps, its virtue is that it advances on more secure footing.

That’s the ideal that much of the West essentially abandoned in recent years. On the political left but also the center-right, postliberal policymaking largely determined the outcome of the two most basic political questions: First, who is “us”? And second, who decides for us?

Merkel never sought the approval of German voters to relax the country’s immigration laws and take in nearly a million people over the space of a year. Americans didn’t elect President Joe Biden on any promise to let in millions of migrants over the southern border. Post-Brexit Britons never thought they’d bring in an astounding 4.5 million immigrants to a country of just 69 million between 2021 and 2024 — under Tory leaders, no less.

No wonder the reaction to years of postliberal governance has been a broad turn to its preliberal opposite. Not all right-wing populist parties are the same, and there are meaningful differences between, say, the ill-disguised fascism of the Alternative for Germany and the pragmatic conservatism of Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s prime minister. But all of them have risen on the same core complaint: that postliberal governments used obscure legal mechanisms or simply ignored the law to attempt a social transformation without society’s explicit consent. In America, it’s called replacement theory.

Liberals and progressives typically dismiss replacement theory as antisemitic, racist demagoguery, and no doubt there are plenty of bigots who believe it. But maybe some measure of understanding ought to be extended to ordinary voters who merely wonder why they should be made to feel like unwelcome outsiders in parts of their own country or asked to pay a share of their taxes for the benefit of newcomers they never agreed to welcome in the first place or extend tolerance to those who don’t always show tolerance in return or be told to shut their mouths over some of the more shocking instances of migrant criminality.

What most of these voters are feeling isn’t racism. It’s indignation at having their normal and appropriate political concerns dismissed as racism. And as long as politicians and pundits of the traditional political establishment treat them as racists, the far right is going to continue to rise and flourish.

There’s something partisans of the center-right and center-left could do: Instead of discreetly murmuring that, say, Merkel or Biden got immigration policy wrong or that it was morally and economically right but politically foolish, they can grasp the point that control over borders is a sine qua non of national sovereignty, that mass migration without express legislative consent is politically intolerable, that migrants ought to be expected to accept, not reject, the values of the host country and that hosts should not be expected to adapt themselves to values at odds with a liberal society.

At that point, hopefully, the values of liberal democracy — including an appreciation of the virtues of immigrants — might begin to reassert themselves. Until then, the preliberal tide will continue to surge.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/03/multimedia/02stephens-vjtf/02stephens-vjtf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:59.273521

Hegseth approved more than 600 military lawyers from the Department of Defense to serve as temporary immigration judges, nearly doubling the ranks of jurists overseeing the president’s massive deportation efforts, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. It’s a move that indicates the Trump administration was simply clearing house to install their own ranks of loyalist judges, intent on seeing the president’s deportations through.

A memo dated August 27 said that the military would begin dispatching batches of 150 attorneys to the Justice Department “as soon as practicable,” and have an initial group identified by next week. Appointments would last no longer than 179 days, expiring in February, but can be renewed.

Private prison operator CoreCivic, which owns and manages the 2,560-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, confirmed to The Bee that the facility is now operational.

“We have begun receiving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees at our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF) in response to an immediate need from the federal government for safe, humane and appropriate housing and care for these individuals,” Ryan Gustin, senior director for public affairs for CoreCivic, said in a statement.

The California City Immigration Processing Center, as it is now known, is the third privately-operated ICE facility in Kern County and the seventh in California. The Geo Group private prison operator runs Mesa Verde in Bakersfield and Golden State Annex in McFarland. The reopening was first reported by Bakersfield’s Eyewitness News KBAK-CBS.

It’s unclear how the facility was able to open without a 180-day public notice as required by state law.

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins and City Manager Christopher Lopez did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

In an interview with The Bee on Thursday, Lopez said the facility would likely be subject to SB29. The state law prohibits a city or county from approving an immigration detention center, including the reuse of existing building owned by private prison operators, unless the public agency has provided 180-day notice to the public and solicited and heard public comments on the action.

On Thursday, Lopez said he had “no information” on the negotiations between ICE and California City on a longer-term operation contract to re-open.

The privately-operated prison opened in the late 1990s by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became known as CoreCivic. In the early 2010s, ​CoreCivic​ had a contract with the federal government to house federal detainees who awaited trial or had pending immigration cases. It later became a privately operated state prison known as the California City Correctional Facility, which closed in 2024 after the state ended its for-profit prison contracts.

Gustin, of CoreCivic, said the reopening will create about 500 new jobs and generate more than $2 million in property taxes to the city.

ICE did not respond to specific questions about when the facility opened. In a statement, a spokesperson said “ICE has worked with private detention operators, local governments, and other federal partners to identify and bring online over 60 new detention facilities to include California City.”

Immigration advocates warned during public comment at a June 24 California City council meeting that the facility’s opening would lead to increased community arrests in the greater Kern County region.

According to a study by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, immigrants are more likely to be arrested and detained by ICE in counties with more detention beds. In communities with more than 850 ICE detention beds, there was a 6.4 times higher likelihood of arrest, researchers found.

California City had concerns with reopening

Immigration rights advocates have shown up to California City council meetings throughout the summer to voice opposition to the facility’s reopening. City officials have not discussed the facility’s reopening at a public meeting since June 24, according to a review of council meeting agendas.

“We’re troubled by California City turning a deaf ear to the objections voiced by community members and advocates voiced at previous meetings,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, manager of the Valley Watch Network with the nonprofit group Faith in the Valley.

Faith in the Valley estimated as of Tuesday afternoon that there are already 300 detainees at the California City facility that are being quietly transferred from Golden State Annex and Mesa Verde. The group alleged in a social media post Tuesday afternoon the facility opened “without a valid permit.”

Lopez said Thursday CoreCivic had submitted a site plan review — a necessary step to receive a business license. The facility already had a conditional use permit in place, he said. A Sept 2 planning commission agenda confirms the site plan review was pending.

In a July 29 letter to CoreCivic, Lopez told the private prison operator that the facility “posed a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of the community of California City.” The city listed four concerns related to insufficient emergency communications, increased demand for police and fire services, as well as paramedics and ambulances for medical emergencies.

The letter also listed concerns with a fire inspection and basic radio test that found the building wasn’t up to code.

Gustin of CoreCivic said the company’s leadership team had an “open line of communication” with California City officials. He said CoreCivic had addressed the concerns raised in the July 29 letter.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser on Thursday dropped the lawsuit he filed against Investigator Alexander Zwinck over the incident because of the deputy’s resignation, according to court records. Weiser agreed to dismiss the case because the law no longer applies to Zwinck after his resignation, according to a motion filed last week.

A larger investigation into whether other state law enforcement officers in the region collaborated with federal officials in a Signal group chat for the purposes of federal immigration enforcement will continue, said Lawrence Pacheco, spokesman for the attorney general’s office.

“Because the laws he is accused of violating apply only to state and local employees, the attorney general’s office is dismissing the lawsuit against Mr. Zwinck but retaining the right to re-file the case if Mr. Zwinck becomes a state or local employee in the future,” Weiser said in a statement.

Weiser alleged in the lawsuit that Zwinck knowingly assisted in federal immigration enforcement by sharing information about 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves in the Signal group chat during a June 5 traffic stop on Interstate 70 near Loma.

Colorado law prohibits local law enforcement officers from carrying out civil immigration enforcement and largely blocks local police agencies from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The deputy purposely stalled Dias Goncalves so federal immigration officers could get into position to arrest her, and passed on details about the make and model of her car, her license plate, and her direction and timing of travel to the federal officers, knowing it would be used for immigration enforcement, Weiser said.

Zwinck pulled Dias Goncalves over because she was following a semitrailer too closely. At about 1:40 p.m., he shared a picture of her driver’s license in the Signal group chat so that federal agents could run her information through a number of databases that are only accessible to them, Weiser alleged in the lawsuit.

Zwinck questioned Dias Goncalves about her accent and where she was from — she said she was born in Brazil. He shared his location with the federal agents, who responded that they were en route. He kept Dias Goncalves for about 15 minutes, then let her go with a warning at about 1:55 p.m.

The federal agents then arrested her on immigration grounds. Dias Goncalves, who attends the University of Utah, came to the U.S. from Brazil with her family when she was 7 and overstayed a tourist visa. She has a pending asylum application, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

State officials said they have not inspected the private immigrant detention center in Tacoma since last year amid legal pushback, but a recent federal court opinion could reinforce state-level oversight of health and safety conditions for detainees.

The Department of Labor & Industries reported it last inspected working conditions at the Northwest Immigration Processing Center in summer 2024 and found no violations. GEO Group, the private company operating the detention center, has challenged the state’s authority to conduct inspections and since barred entry to L&I as well as Department of Health inspectors.

“Despite hundreds of complaints and our ongoing efforts, NWIPC continues to deny entry to DOH staff,” DOH spokesperson Kara Kostanich wrote in a statement. “Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all people in Washington, including those in detention, who are among the most vulnerable in our state.”

GEO Group has contested a 2023 Washington state law that authorized new oversight of the private detention center, arguing the law unfairly discriminated against the company as the only such center in the state. Legislators amended that law earlier this year to include other facilities and impose specific penalties on health and safety violations.

The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on Aug. 19, overturning a lower court ruling that barred state officials from conducting inspections, and clarifying that the state has authority to regulate many types of civil detention facilities such as mental health institutions.

“The key issue in this case is whether the entities to which we should compare the NWIPC are state prisons or civil detention facilities,” the opinion states. “[We] conclude that the appropriate comparators are civil detention facilities.”

The case will now go back to U.S. District Court in Seattle for further proceedings.

The Department of Health had filed a separate lawsuit last year, seeking a court order to allow inspectors into the detention center to observe detainee quarters. L&I spokesman Matt Ross told Cascade PBS that the agency has maintained it has ongoing authority to conduct its workplace safety checks, but confirmed it had not inspected the center since last year.

“We already had authority under state law and the state constitution to inspect conditions for workers,” he wrote in an email, “and were already conducting routine inspections into workplace safety and health at the site.”

GEO Group recently dropped a lawsuit to block L&I from releasing records from its 2024 inspection after a Cascade PBS reporter requested those materials under the Public Records Act. The company sought an injunction against L&I in January, arguing that disclosing the inspection photos and reports to the media could undermine security at the facility. Cascade PBS was named as a defendant in the action solely in its capacity as a requestor under the Public Records Act. GEO did not seek legal or equitable relief against Cascade PBS.

In attachments to its filed complaint, GEO Group included a live hyperlink to more than 200 L&I inspection photos. Most of the photos depicted items related to workplace safety regulations such as fire extinguishers, stairways, cleaning chemical labels or personal protective equipment. Some photos included shackles, gas masks or tactical gear.

L&I later provided Cascade PBS with heavily redacted copies of those photos. Cascade PBS then asked L&I to conduct an administrative review of those redactions and officials provided a second set of similarly redacted photos, citing a security exemption raised by GEO Group.

Many redactions blacked out doorways, windows or the locations of security cameras. L&I contended the redacted photos contained “specific and unique vulnerability assessments or specific and unique emergency and escape response plans at a city, county, or state adult or juvenile correctional facility, or secure facility for persons civilly confined.”

“In this case we removed the location of security cameras, video surveillance images, and types of weapons and restraints,” an L&I records officer wrote to Cascade PBS.

GEO Group ended its case against L&I and Cascade PBS in June, filing a voluntary request for dismissal before any substantive proceedings or rulings occurred in the case.

An attorney affiliated with the Washington Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit organization advocating for government transparency, told Cascade PBS that exemptions that allow public agencies to redact information should be applied narrowly. The attorney pointed to Does v. King County, a 2015 case in which officials tried to block the release of surveillance footage of a shooting on Seattle Pacific University’s campus.

The state Court of Appeals held that providing surveillance footage did not in itself compromise security and that footage could be released with limited redactions of student identities.

GEO Group did not respond to requests for comment on the latest federal court decision. The company is expected to file a response to the opinion by Sept. 16.

State representative Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo, who sponsored both inspection bills, lauded the recent court decision, calling it an act of “justice” and a step toward holding the NWIPC accountable for its numerous alleged human rights abuses.

“We certainly should not be letting a private facility come in and profit off the backs of our most vulnerable people,” she said. “And that’s what’s been happening — with no accountability — very little from the federal government, if any, and none from the state. They’ve been able to do whatever it is that they want, but they’re doing it in our state, and I think that’s the difference.”

The panel of appellate judges held that multiple sections of the state’s inspection law did not conflict with the “intergovernmental immunity doctrine,” which protects federal agencies from state regulation or discrimination. The judges ruled that requiring DOH to adopt rules that ensure safe and sanitary conditions to people in immigration detention and enforcing civil penalties for violations of such conditions did not rise to that level.

“[T]he panel held that it would not decide at this point whether Washington regulates the conditions of confinement at the NWIPC differently from the way it regulates the conditions of confinement in other civil detention facilities,” the panel wrote. “Because the district court incorrectly concluded that the appropriate comparator was Washington’s prisons, the panel remanded to allow the district court to make the comparison with other civil detention facilities.”

The judges concluded that allowing GEO to compare its operations to prison would “ignore the critical fact that inmates in Washington’s prisons have been convicted of crimes, and that the conditions of their confinement are part of a penal regime.”

“By contrast,” the opinion states, “none of the detainees held in the NWIPC has been convicted of — or even charged with — a crime.”

Before the DOH could implement its own rules, the panel found that the already-existing contractual requirements that were implemented on the NWIPC by the state were “almost identical” to the requirements imposed under Washington law on the types of civil detention facilities.

Ortiz-Self said the decision would help Washington achieve parity with California — which, since 2017, has empowered state investigators to inspect the state’s network of immigration detention centers.

“We want it for all facilities — public or private — because we feel a sense of accountability as the state that is housing these facilities,” she said. “And in the California determination, they said, ‘Yes, as a state, states do have a right to inspect and have standards for private facilities.’”

Kostanich with DOH said the agency is still determining its next steps in the case.

“We are optimistic the federal courts will clarify DOH’s authority,” she wrote, “allowing us to conduct investigations that promote transparency and protect the health and well-being of everyone inside the facility.”

The plan calls for sending groups of 150 attorneys, both military and civilian, with the first round expected to be identified by next week and deployed ""as soon as practicable,"" according to the memo.

Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed the move to Newsweek.

""At the request of the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense is identifying qualified Judge Advocates and civilian attorneys for details to serve as Temporary Immigration Judges,"" Parnell said in a statement. ""These DOD attorneys will augment existing resources to help further combat a backlog of cases by presiding over immigration hearings.""

Why It Matters

The DOJ oversees the immigration court system, where judges determine whether immigrants are eligible to remain in the United States or not. The system has been facing a backlog for some time, reaching an all-time high in July as some judges left and recruitment slowed under the Trump administration.

What To Know

There are about 600 immigration judges across the country, within the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), down from a high of over 700 in the last few months of the Biden administration.

The current White House fired multiple immigration judges, some allegedly without obvious cause, despite the president's focus on immigration law and enforcement.

According to the memo seen by the AP, the deployment of Defense Department judges to the EOIR will initially last no more than 179 days.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge could have on the DOJ's backlog of cases, which stood at 3.7 million when figures were last published in June.

Last week, the EOIR issued a memo granting itself the authority to appoint any government attorney as a temporary immigration judge, stating that this would allow it to select judges from a ""larger pool of well-qualified candidates.""

The change in policy marks a shift from the current expectation that immigration judges have a decade of experience behind them before taking to the bench.

What People Are Saying

Charles Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter immigration law firm in Atlanta, told Newsweek: ""Just what the Immigration Court needs—more lawyers with no experience in a wildly complicated field with defendants' lives on the line on each decision. This is not a joke. It's a travesty.

""Without a doubt, the immigration court system is broken. But this is not the way to fix it. Politicizing judges is the worst possible outcome for the immigrants in deportation proceedings.""

Lisa Koop, national director of legal services at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told Newsweek: ""While immigration court backlogs and dysfunction are not unique to this administration, the immigration judge 'shortage' is a problem of the Trump administration's own making, a result of the firing of dozens of qualified judges since January.

""Asking military attorneys with limited or no immigration experience to decipher the U.S. immigration code and administer justice is misguided; it is clearly intended to lead to speedy deportations in lieu of due process and just outcomes. In reality, this move will lead to years of tangled litigation and mishandled immigration cases. The victims will be immigrants seeking their fair day in court who are being set up to always lose, regardless of their clear eligibility for protections created by Congress and recognized by every single administration except this one.""

Sean Parnell, in his statement to Newsweek: ""The Department remains committed to continuing our support for our interagency partners, bringing the skill and dedication of America's service members and civil servants to deliver justice, restore order, and protect the American people. Beyond this, we don't have any additional details to provide at this time.""

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, on X: ""The Trump admin plans to double the number of immigration judges, ordering hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges, despite flimsy legal authority to do so. Notably, immigration law is infamously complex, and judges normally require months of training.""

What Happens Next

A White House official told the AP that the administration is working on a variety of options to tackle the backlog of immigration cases.

The rulings are part of an ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the federal judiciary over the administration’s immigration crackdown. Judges have raised concerns that immigrants’ due process rights are being violated.

On Sunday, Sooknanan voiced concern for unaccompanied children’s due process rights, and temporarily halted planes carrying the minors from taking off.

The administration had planned to deport 10 children to their home country of Guatemala.

The case resembled one earlier this year in which a judge ordered planes carrying Venezuelan men removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grounded. Despite the order, multiple planes landed in El Salvador where more than 200 Venezuelans were sent to a notorious mega-prison.

The 10 children, nationals of Guatemala, on the planes ranged in age from 10 to 17 and crossed the southern border alone. Attorneys in court filings stressed that the children had immigration cases pending before a judge and that the children expressed fear of returning to Guatemala.

‘Everyone would be at risk’

The order followed Cobb’s order Friday granting a request from immigration rights groups to halt the implementation of a new policy that expanded expedited removal.

The administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, which allows for the quick removal of migrants, as a pillar of its aim to carry out mass deportations of people without permanent legal status.

For decades, administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, they are subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration in January expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.

In Cobb’s Friday opinion, she wrote that the administration likely violated the rights of immigrants and approached a universal violation of the constitutional right to due process. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021.

“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” she wrote. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.”

Flights of Guatemalan minors grounded

In a flurry of action Sunday, Sooknanan temporarily halted the deportation of the children for 14 days while the case continues after an emergency request from the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

Attorneys from NILC argued that if the children were returned, they could face violence and the administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors.

“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement … custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the attorneys wrote in their emergency filing.

The 10 children on the planes were taken off and put back into the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to a status update filed Monday by NILC lawyers.

The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children to be removed under a pilot program created through an agreement with Guatemala, according to the court filings.

Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Biden also appointed Sooknanan.

Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, told the New York Times in an interview that the initiative began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala in July. He added there is an agreement for Guatemala to accept more than 600 children.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The State Department’s 2024 report on Guatemala details human rights concerns such as violence, and advises against traveling to the country.

The case involving the unaccompanied children was reassigned to judge Timothy James Kelly, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-02 17:57:27.950892
